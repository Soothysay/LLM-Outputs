   Assessment and Plan
   31yo gentleman with h/o HIV not on HAART, ESRD on HD, and h/o coag neg
   Staph endocarditis s/p MVR/AVR [**1-25**] admitted with fevers and diarrhea.
   # Fever:
   Patient is immunocompromised and has a history of endocarditis.  Of
   note, he has had prior recent admission in [**7-/2188**] with similar
   symptoms.  DDx for his fevers is broad and includes persistent low
   grade endocarditis (supported by new PR prolongation on EKG), CMV
   colitis, viral gastroenteritis, C diff colitis, or [**Doctor First Name **].  He responded
   appropriately to volume challenge and his blood pressures have been
   stable in 90s/50s since presentation to the MICU.  Although initially
   febrile, he was 94.8 and then 95.1 upon presentation to the MICU.
   Would also have concern for CNS process given headaches and unequal
   pupils on exam, although clinical presentation does not suggest
   bacterial meningitis.  Of note, LP done [**7-/2188**] was negative.  CXR does
   not show infiltrate.
   - f/u BCx and fungal cultures
   - check CMV and stool C diff, O&P, stool Cx
   - obtain TTE to eval for endocarditis
   - follow EKG and monitor on tele in case he does have conduction
   disease from endocarditis
   - obtain MRI of head without gad given ESRD
   - consider ID consult in AM
   - patient received levo and flagyl in ED; will change to vanc/gent and
   flagyl for now to cover staph as well as bowel pathogens
   # ESRD on HD:
   Note that patient did not receive scheduled dialysis today.  There is
   no pressing indication for dialysis, and renal will reevaluate him in
   AM.
   - continue nephrocaps, phoslo, cinacalcet, and sevelamer
   - monitor lytes closely
   - appreciate renal input
   # Oral thrush:
   - nystatin swich and swallow
   # HIV with CD 4 count of 34:
   Not on HAART as he does not tolerate it.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue dapsone and bactrim (currently on weekly bactrim, may need
   to adjust dose per ID)
   # Hyponatremia:
   Suspect this is hypovolemic hyponatremia and will improve after IV
   fluids.  Note that he is not hyponatremic at baseline but has had some
   hyponatremia in the past when ill.
   - monitor
   # Anemia: Current Hct 28, baseline Hct 29-34
   Most likely due to ESRD.
   - receiving Epo with dialysis
   - monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia: Current platelets 107, baseline 80-200
   [**Month (only) 60**] be low in setting of acute infection.  Also may be secondary to
   hepatosplenomegaly (chronic on his imaging).
   - monitor
   # Elevated Troponin:
   Most likely due to CKD.  CK has been normal, no ischemia on EKG.
   - serial enzymes
   - follow EKGs
   # Asthma:
   - continue albuterol
   # Elevated INR:
   Unclear if nutritional or if he has coagulopathy.  His INR is at his
   baseline.
   - monitor
   # HTN:
   Of note, he has had problems with hypertension in the past but his
   nephrologist reports that his BP has been increasingly easy to control
   of late
   - hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Elevated Alk Phos:
   Chronic.  Most likely from bone as bone alk phos was elevated when
   checked in past.  Nephrologist planning on bone scan.
   # HCV/HBV:
   - LFTs at baseline.
   .
   # Chronic pain and h/o opioid dependance:
   - contine methadone 40mg tid
   # FEN: PO diet, careful with IV fluids as he does not make urine
   (received 3L in ED)
   # PPx:  subQ heparin, famotidine while in ICU
   # Code:  confirmed FULL
   # Dispo:  ICU for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and a previous coag-negative Staphylococcus endocarditis after mitral valve replacement/repair. He was admitted with fevers and diarrhea. The patient is immunocompromised and has a broad differential diagnosis for his fevers, including persistent low-grade endocarditis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, viral gastroenteritis, Clostridium difficile colitis, or other causes. He responded appropriately to volume challenge and has stable blood pressures since presentation to the MICU. Although initially febrile, his temperature has been stable since then. He also presented with headaches and unequal pupils on examination, raising concerns for a central nervous system (CNS) process, although the clinical presentation does not suggest bacterial meningitis. A lumbar puncture performed previously was negative. His chest X-ray does not show any infiltrate.

Plan:

1. Follow-up blood cultures and fungal cultures.
2. Check CMV and stool Clostridium difficile tests.
3. Obtain a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to evaluate for endocarditis.
4. Monitor the patient's EKG and consider telemonitoring in case he has conduction disease from endocarditis.
5. Obtain an MRI of the head without gadolinium given his ESRD.

   Assessment and Plan
   31yo gentleman with h/o HIV not on HAART, ESRD on HD, and h/o coag neg
   Staph endocarditis s/p MVR/AVR [**1-25**] admitted with fevers and diarrhea,
   now w/ GPC POS BCx. Pt presents good clinical picture for bacterial
   endocarditis.
   # Fever:
   Patient is immunocompromised and has a history of endocarditis.  Of
   note, he has had prior recent admission in [**7-/2188**] with similar
   symptoms.  DDx for his fevers is broad and includes persistent low
   grade endocarditis (supported by new PR prolongation on EKG), CMV
   colitis, viral gastroenteritis, C diff colitis, or [**Doctor First Name **].  He responded
   appropriately to volume challenge and his blood pressures have been
   stable in 90s/50s since presentation to the MICU.  Although initially
   febrile, he was 94.8 and then 95.1 upon presentation to the MICU.
   Would also have concern for CNS process given headaches and unequal
   pupils on exam, although clinical presentation does not suggest
   bacterial meningitis.  Of note, LP done [**7-/2188**] was negative.  CXR does
   not show infiltrate.
   - f/u BCx and fungal cultures and speciation
   - check CMV and stool C diff, O&P, stool Cx
   - obtain TTE to eval for endocarditis, if TTE is negative, will perform
   [**Year (4 digits) 1613**] as is high risk for endocarditis
   - plan for FISTULA study as well if [**Year (4 digits) 1613**] is negative.
   - follow EKG [**Hospital1 **] and monitor on tele in case he does have conduction
   disease from endocarditis
   - Planed to obtain MRI of head as has bacteremia and HIV and focal
   neurological finding. MRI without gad given ESRD, pt unable to tolerate
   MRI, will wait until after TTE is done. If pt needs [**Last Name (LF) 1613**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] consider
   intubation for both [**First Name3 (LF) 1613**] and MRI.
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - patient received levo and flagyl in ED; will change to vanc/gent and
   flagyl for now to cover staph as well as bowel pathogens
   # ESRD on HD:
   Note that patient did not receive scheduled dialysis today.  There is
   no pressing indication for dialysis, and renal will reevaluate him in
   AM.
   - continue nephrocaps, phoslo, cinacalcet, and sevelamer
   - monitor lytes closely
   - appreciate renal input
   # Oral thrush:
   - nystatin swich and swallow
   # HIV with CD 4 count of 34:
   Not on HAART as he does not tolerate it.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue dapsone and bactrim (currently on weekly bactrim, may need
   to adjust dose per ID)
   # Hyponatremia:
   Suspect this is hypovolemic hyponatremia and will improve after IV
   fluids.  Note that he is not hyponatremic at baseline but has had some
   hyponatremia in the past when ill.
   - monitor
   # Anemia: Current Hct 28, baseline Hct 29-34
   Most likely due to ESRD.
   - receiving Epo with dialysis
   - monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia: Current platelets 107, baseline 80-200
   [**Month (only) 60**] be low in setting of acute infection.  Also may be secondary to
   hepatosplenomegaly (chronic on his imaging).
   - monitor
   # Elevated Troponin:
   Most likely due to CKD.  CK has been normal, no ischemia on EKG.
   - serial enzymes
   - follow EKGs
   # Asthma:
   - continue albuterol
   # Elevated INR:
   Unclear if nutritional or if he has coagulopathy.  His INR is at his
   baseline.
   - monitor
   # HTN:
   Of note, he has had problems with hypertension in the past but his
   nephrologist reports that his BP has been increasingly easy to control
   of late
   - hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Elevated Alk Phos:
   Chronic.  Most likely from bone as bone alk phos was elevated when
   checked in past.  Nephrologist planning on bone scan.
   # HCV/HBV:
   - LFTs at baseline.
   .
   # Chronic pain and h/o opioid dependance:
   - contine methadone 40mg tid
   # FEN: PO diet, careful with IV fluids as he does not make urine
   (received 3L in ED). NPO until procedures are finished.
   # PPx:  subQ heparin, famotidine while in ICU
   # Code:  confirmed FULL
   # Dispo:  ICU for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and previous coag negative Staphylococcal endocarditis following mitral valve replacement and aortic valve repair. He was admitted with fevers and diarrhea and now presents with a positive BC for GPC p/c/c. The patient is immunocompromised and has a good clinical picture for bacterial endocarditis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial Endocarditis: Given the patient's history of endocarditis and positive BC for GPC p/c/c, there is a high suspicion for bacterial endocarditis. This condition can lead to complications such as heart failure, embolic events, and septic shock.
2. HIV/AIDS: The patient has a low CD4 count of 34, indicating severe immunosuppression. This puts him at increased risk for opportunistic infections and other HIV-associated complications.
3. ESRD on HD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis. He did not receive scheduled dialysis today. Non-adherence to dialysis can result in fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic symptoms.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 107, which is below the normal range. This may be due to acute infection or chronic conditions like hepatosplenomeg"

   Staph endocarditis s/p MVR/AVR [**1-25**] admitted with fevers and diarrhea,
   now w/ GPC POS BCx. Pt presents good clinical picture for bacterial
   endocarditis.
   # Bacterial Endocarditis:
   Patient is immunocompromised and has a history of endocarditis.  Of
   note, he has had prior recent admission in [**7-/2188**] with similar
   symptoms.  TTE and TEE findings as well as S. viridans bacteremia new
   PR prolongation on EKG are consistent with this diagnosis.  Other, ddx
   for his fevers would include CMV colitis, viral gastroenteritis, C diff
   colitis, or [**Doctor First Name **].  He responded appropriately to volume challenge and
   his blood pressures have been stable in 90s/50s since presentation to
   the MICU.  Although initially febrile, he was 94.8 and then 95.1 upon
   presentation to the MICU.  Would also have concern for CNS process
   given headaches and unequal pupils on exam, although clinical
   presentation does not suggest bacterial meningitis.  Of note, LP done
   [**7-/2188**] was negative.  CXR does not show infiltrate.
   - Will consult EP today to discuss PR prolongation and risk/benefit of
   pacer wire placement as well as for pre-operative cardiac clearance.

   - Imaging is low priority, but will consider once cardiac issues have
   been addressed.
   # ESRD on HD:
   - HD today as well as yesterday, further per renal.
   - continue nephrocaps, phoslo, cinacalcet, and sevelamer
   - monitor lytes closely
   - appreciate renal input
   # Oral thrush:
   - nystatin swich and swallow
   # HIV with CD 4 count of 34:
   Not on HAART as he does not tolerate it.
   - appreciate ID recs

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Bacterial Endocarditis: The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS, endocarditis, and is currently presenting with fevers, diarrhea, and bacteremia. The findings from the TTE and TEE, along with the presence of S. viridans bacteremia, are consistent with bacterial endocarditis. This condition can lead to further complications such as heart valve damage, heart failure, or embolism.

2. Aortic Root Abscess: The initial TEE results showed a posterior aortic root abscess. If left untreated, this can lead to severe complications including aortic rupture or dissemination of infection.

3. Paravalvular Mitral Regurgitation: The TEE also revealed moderate-to-severe paravalvular mitral regurgitation. This condition can result in heart failure and other cardiac complications.

4. First-Degree AV Block: The patient's EKG shows a first-degree AV block with progressive PR prolongation. This can lead to a complete heart block, resulting in bradycardia and potential cardiac arrest if not managed appropriately.

5. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications during invasive procedures or surgeries.

6. Oral Thrush: The patient has oral thrush, which is a fungal infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   31yo gentleman with h/o HIV not on HAART, ESRD on HD, and h/o coag neg
   Staph endocarditis s/p MVR/AVR [**1-25**] admitted with fevers and diarrhea,
   now w/ GPC POS BCx. Pt presents good clinical picture for bacterial
   endocarditis.
   # Bacterial Endocarditis:
   Patient is immunocompromised and has a history of endocarditis.  Of
   note, he has had prior recent admission in [**7-/2188**] with similar
   symptoms.  TTE and TEE findings as well as S. viridans bacteremia new
   PR prolongation on EKG are consistent with this diagnosis.  Other, ddx
   for his fevers would include CMV colitis, viral gastroenteritis, C diff
   colitis, or [**Doctor First Name **].  He responded appropriately to volume challenge and
   his blood pressures have been stable in 90s/50s since presentation to
   the MICU.  Although initially febrile, he was 94.8 and then 95.1 upon
   presentation to the MICU.  Would also have concern for CNS process
   given headaches and unequal pupils on exam, although clinical
   presentation does not suggest bacterial meningitis.  Of note, LP done
   [**7-/2188**] was negative.  CXR does not show infiltrate.
   - Will consult EP today to discuss PR prolongation and risk/benefit of
   pacer wire placement as well as for pre-operative cardiac clearance.
   - Discuss surgical plans with CT [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   - Continue Vanc/gent with renal dosing
   - TID EKG
   - f/u final TEE read
   - f/u BCx and fungal cultures and speciation
   - check CMV and stool C diff, O&P, stool Cx
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - patient received levo and flagyl in ED; will change to vanc/gent and
   flagyl for now to cover staph as well as bowel pathogens
   # Intubated
 Multiple potential invasive procedures pending
   - Extubation plan based on CT and EP plans
   - VAP bundle
   # Anisocoria - Planed to obtain MRI of head as has bacteremia and HIV
   and focal neurological finding. MRI without gad given ESRD.  Pt was
   unable to tolerate MRI.  Currently patient seems at high risk to leave
   floor.
   - Imaging is low priority, but will consider once cardiac issues have
   been addressed.
   # ESRD on HD:
   - HD today as well as yesterday, further per renal.
   - continue nephrocaps, phoslo, cinacalcet, and sevelamer
   - monitor lytes closely
   - appreciate renal input
   # Oral thrush:
   - nystatin swich and swallow
   # HIV with CD 4 count of 34:
   Not on HAART as he does not tolerate it.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue dapsone and bactrim (currently on weekly bactrim, may need
   to adjust dose per ID)
   # Hyponatremia:  Resolved.  Likely was hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   # Anemia: At baseline
   - receiving Epo with dialysis
   - monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia: Current platelets 107, baseline 80-200
   [**Month (only) 60**] be low in setting of acute infection.  Also may be secondary to
   hepatosplenomegaly (chronic on his imaging).
   - monitor
   # Asthma:
   - continue albuterol
   # Elevated INR:
   Unclear if nutritional or if he has coagulopathy.  His INR is at his
   baseline.
   - monitor
   # HTN:
   Of note, he has had problems with hypertension in the past but his
   nephrologist reports that his BP has been increasingly easy to control
   of late
   - hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Elevated Alk Phos:
   Chronic.  Most likely from bone as bone alk phos was elevated when
   checked in past.  Nephrologist planning on bone scan.
   # HCV/HBV:
   - LFTs at baseline.
   .
   # Chronic pain and h/o opioid dependance:
   - contine methadone 40mg tid
   # FEN: PO diet, careful with IV fluids as he does not make urine
   (received 3L in ED). NPO until procedures are finished.
   # PPx:  subQ heparin, famotidine while in ICU
   # Code:  confirmed FULL
   # Dispo:  ICU for now.

","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS, endocarditis, and chronic renal failure on hemodialysis. He presents with fever, diarrhea, and anemia, and has been found to have high-grade bacteremia with Gram-positive cocci. He was intubated for a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which showed a posterior aortic root abscess and moderate-to-severe paravalvular mitral regurgitation. He also has a history of coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.9°C (100.2°F)
- Heart rate: 62 bpm
- Blood pressure: 93/56 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics (gentamicin and vancomycin), analgesics (fentanyl), sedatives (propofol and midazolam), and antacids (famotidine). 

The patient's physical examination reveals an irregular heartbeat and unequal pupils. He has diffuse wheezing and rales at the lung bases, as well as mild hepatomegaly. His extremities show no edema or cyanosis, but there is a thrill present over an arteriovenous fistula in his left upper extremity.

   MRI Brain:
   Markedly limited exam due to patient's claustrophobia.
   1. Severely limited study shows no acute intracranial process.
   2. Diffusely low marrow signal, consistent with marrow hyperplasia,
   which
   could be secondary to anemia or HIV.
   Fistulogram: No evidence of septic thrombus in the fistula.
   TTE: moderate-to-severe paravalvular mitral regurgitation; no definite
   vegetations seen, but the new finding of paravalvular mitral
   regurgitation is consistent with acute infectious endocarditis
   TEE (PRELIM): The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta
   are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 40 cm from
   the incisors. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
   posterior aortic root is thickened but no definite abscess is
   idenfitied. Trivial intraaortic valvular regurgitation is seen. No
   masses or vegetations are seen on the bioprosthetic aortic valve. A
   bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. A paravalvular mitral
   prosthesis leak is present. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
   valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation or
   mass is seen on the tricuspid or pulmonic valve. There is no
   pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   31yo gentleman with h/o HIV not on HAART, ESRD on HD, and h/o coag neg
   Staph endocarditis s/p MVR/AVR [**1-25**] admitted with fevers and diarrhea,
   now w/ GPC POS BCx. Pt presents good clinical picture for bacterial
   endocarditis.
   # Bacterial Endocarditis:
   Patient is immunocompromised and has a history of endocarditis.  Of
   note, he has had prior recent admission in [**7-/2188**] with similar
   symptoms.  TTE and TEE findings as well as S. viridans bacteremia new
   PR prolongation on EKG are consistent with this diagnosis.  Other, ddx
   for his fevers would include CMV colitis, viral gastroenteritis, C diff
   colitis, or [**Doctor First Name **].  He responded appropriately to volume challenge and
   his blood pressures have been stable in 90s/50s since presentation to
   the MICU.  Although initially febrile, he was 94.8 and then 95.1 upon
   presentation to the MICU.  Would also have concern for CNS process
   given headaches and unequal pupils on exam, although clinical
   presentation does not suggest bacterial meningitis.  Of note, LP done
   [**7-/2188**] was negative.  CXR does not show infiltrate.
   - Will consult EP today to discuss PR prolongation and risk/benefit of
   pacer wire placement as well as for pre-operative cardiac clearance.
   - Discuss surgical plans with CT [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   - Continue Vanc/gent with renal dosing
   - TID EKG
   - f/u final TEE read
   - f/u BCx and fungal cultures and speciation
   - check CMV and stool C diff, O&P, stool Cx
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - patient received levo and flagyl in ED; will change to vanc/gent and
   flagyl for now to cover staph as well as bowel pathogens
   # Intubated
 Multiple potential invasive procedures pending
   - Extubation plan based on CT and EP plans
   - VAP bundle
   # Anisocoria - Planed to obtain MRI of head as has bacteremia and HIV
   and focal neurological finding. MRI without gad given ESRD.  Pt was
   unable to tolerate MRI.  Currently patient seems at high risk to leave
   floor.
   - Imaging is low priority, but will consider once cardiac issues have
   been addressed.
   # ESRD on HD:
   - HD today as well as yesterday, further per renal.
   - continue nephrocaps, phoslo, cinacalcet, and sevelamer
   - monitor lytes closely
   - appreciate renal input
   # Oral thrush:
   - nystatin swich and swallow
   # HIV with CD 4 count of 34:
   Not on HAART as he does not tolerate it.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue dapsone and bactrim (currently on weekly bactrim, may need
   to adjust dose per ID)
   # Hyponatremia:  Resolved.  Likely was hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   # Anemia: At baseline
   - receiving Epo with dialysis
   - monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia: Current platelets 107, baseline 80-200
   [**Month (only) 60**] be low in setting of acute infection.  Also may be secondary to
   hepatosplenomegaly (chronic on his imaging).
   - monitor
   # Asthma:
   - continue albuterol
   # Elevated INR:
   Unclear if nutritional or if he has coagulopathy.  His INR is at his
   baseline.
   - monitor
   # HTN:
   Of note, he has had problems with hypertension in the past but his
   nephrologist reports that his BP has been increasingly easy to control
   of late
   - hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Elevated Alk Phos:
   Chronic.  Most likely from bone as bone alk phos was elevated when
   checked in past.  Nephrologist planning on bone scan.
   # HCV/HBV:
   - LFTs at baseline.
   .
   # Chronic pain and h/o opioid dependance:
   - contine methadone 40mg tid
   # FEN: PO diet, careful with IV fluids as he does not make urine
   (received 3L in ED). NPO until procedures are finished.
   # PPx:  subQ heparin, famotidine while in ICU

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old gentleman with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a previous admission for coagulation-negative Staphylococcal bacteremia. He presents with fevers, diarrhea, and now gram-positive cocci (GPC) positive blood culture. 

The patient's clinical picture is consistent with bacterial endocarditis, which is further supported by TTE and TEE findings of moderate-to-severe paravalvular mitral regurgitation, thickening of the posterior aortic root, and no definite abscess or vegetation seen on the bioprosthetic aortic or mitral valves. The patient's history of HIV and recent admission with similar symptoms also contribute to this diagnosis. 

Other differentials for his fevers include CMV colitis, viral gastroenteritis, C. difficile colitis, or tuberculosis. The patient's response to volume challenge and stable blood pressures suggest that he is not septic. Although initially febrile, his temperature has been stable since presentation to the MICU.

The patient's neurological symptoms, including headaches and unequal pupils, raise concern for a central nervous system process, although the clinical presentation does not suggest bacterial meningitis. A lumbar puncture performed previously was negative.

The patient is currently intubated and multiple invasive procedures are pending. Extubation plans will depend on cardiac and electrophysiology assessments. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   31yo gentleman with h/o HIV not on HAART, ESRD on HD, and h/o coag neg
   Staph endocarditis s/p MVR/AVR [**1-25**] admitted with fevers and diarrhea,
   now w/ GPC POS BCx. Pt presents good clinical picture for bacterial
   endocarditis.
   # Bacterial Endocarditis:
   Patient is immunocompromised and has a history of endocarditis.  Of
   note, he has had prior recent admission in [**7-/2188**] with similar
   symptoms.  TTE and TEE findings as well as S. viridans bacteremia new
   PR prolongation on EKG are consistent with this diagnosis.  Other, ddx
   for his fevers would include CMV colitis, viral gastroenteritis, C diff
   colitis, or [**Doctor First Name **].  He responded appropriately to volume challenge and
   his blood pressures have been stable in 90s/50s since presentation to
   the MICU.  Although initially febrile, he was 94.8 and then 95.1 upon
   presentation to the MICU.  Would also have concern for CNS process
   given headaches and unequal pupils on exam, although clinical
   presentation does not suggest bacterial meningitis.  Of note, LP done
   [**7-/2188**] was negative.  CXR does not show infiltrate.
   - Will consult EP today to discuss PR prolongation and risk/benefit of
   pacer wire placement as well as for pre-operative cardiac clearance.
   - Discuss surgical plans with CT [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   - Continue Vanc/gent with renal dosing
   - TID EKG
   - f/u final TEE read
   - f/u BCx and fungal cultures and speciation
   - check CMV and stool C diff, O&P, stool Cx
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - patient received levo and flagyl in ED; will change to vanc/gent and
   flagyl for now to cover staph as well as bowel pathogens
   # Intubated
 Multiple potential invasive procedures pending
   - Extubation plan based on CT and EP plans
   - VAP bundle
   # Anisocoria - Planed to obtain MRI of head as has bacteremia and HIV
   and focal neurological finding. MRI without gad given ESRD.  Pt was
   unable to tolerate MRI.  Currently patient seems at high risk to leave
   floor.
   - Imaging is low priority, but will consider once cardiac issues have
   been addressed.
   # ESRD on HD:
   - HD today as well as yesterday, further per renal.
   - continue nephrocaps, phoslo, cinacalcet, and sevelamer
   - monitor lytes closely
   - appreciate renal input
   # Oral thrush:
   - nystatin swich and swallow
   # HIV with CD 4 count of 34:
   Not on HAART as he does not tolerate it.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue dapsone and bactrim (currently on weekly bactrim, may need
   to adjust dose per ID)
   # Hyponatremia:  Resolved.  Likely was hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   # Anemia: At baseline
   - receiving Epo with dialysis
   - monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia: Current platelets 107, baseline 80-200
   [**Month (only) 60**] be low in setting of acute infection.  Also may be secondary to
   hepatosplenomegaly (chronic on his imaging).
   - monitor
   # Asthma:
   - continue albuterol
   # Elevated INR:
   Unclear if nutritional or if he has coagulopathy.  His INR is at his
   baseline.
   - monitor
   # HTN:
   Of note, he has had problems with hypertension in the past but his
   nephrologist reports that his BP has been increasingly easy to control
   of late
   - hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Elevated Alk Phos:
   Chronic.  Most likely from bone as bone alk phos was elevated when
   checked in past.  Nephrologist planning on bone scan.
   # HCV/HBV:
   - LFTs at baseline.
   .
   # Chronic pain and h/o opioid dependance:
   - contine methadone 40mg tid
   # FEN: PO diet, careful with IV fluids as he does not make urine
   (received 3L in ED). NPO until procedures are finished.
   # Glycemic control
   # Access
 2 PIVs
   # PPx:  subQ heparin, famotidine while in ICU
   # Code:  confirmed FULL
   # Dispo:  ICU for now.
","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a previous diagnosis of coagulation-negative Staphylococcal endocarditis following mitral valve replacement/repair. He presented with fevers, diarrhea, and positive blood cultures for Gram-positive cocci, indicating a possible recurrence of bacterial endocarditis. Other differential diagnoses include CMV colitis, viral gastroenteritis, Clostridium difficile colitis, or other infections. The patient also has an extended PR interval on EKG and unequal pupils on examination. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/54 to 114/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and has multiple invasive procedures planned, including possible extubation based on CT and electrophysiology (EP) plans. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and liver enzyme abnormalities. His HIV status is noted, with a CD4 count of 34. 

Plan:
- Consult EP today to discuss PR prolongation and risk/benefit of pacer wire placement as well as pre-operative cardiac clearance.
- Discuss surgical plans with CT surgeon.
- Continue Vancomycin and gentamicin with renal dosing.
- Obtain daily EKG.
- Follow up final transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) read.
- Follow up blood cultures and fungal cultures and speciation.
- Check CMV and stool C. difficile, O&P, stool cultures.
- Infectious disease follow-up appreciated.
- Patient received levofloxacin and Flagyl in the emergency department; will change to Vancomycin/gentamicin and Flagyl for now to cover Staphylococcus as well as bowel pathogens.
- Extubation plan based on CT and EP plans.
- VAP bundle.
- Anisocoria - Planed to obtain MRI of the head as has bacteremia and HIV and focal neurological finding. MRI without gadolinium given ESRD. The patient was unable to tolerate MRI. Currently, the patient seems at high risk to leave the floor.
- Imaging is low priority, but will consider once cardiac issues have been addressed.
- ESRD on HD - HD today as well as yesterday, further per renal.
- Continue nephrocaps, phoslo, cinacalcet, and sevelamer.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a previous coag-negative Staphylococcus endocarditis following mitral valve replacement (MVR) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was admitted with fevers and diarrhea and is now diagnosed with GPC positive bacteremia. The patient has shown a good clinical picture for bacterial endocarditis, which is consistent with his previous admission in [**7-/2188**] with similar symptoms. 

Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial Endocarditis: The patient has a history of endocarditis, and his current symptoms along with TTE and TEE findings as well as S. viridans bacteremia indicate a recurrence of bacterial endocarditis.
2. CNS Process: The patient presents with headaches and unequal pupils on examination, suggesting a potential CNS process. However, the clinical presentation does not strongly suggest bacterial meningitis, and a previous lumbar puncture (LP) done [**7-/2188**] was negative.

   31yo gentleman with h/o HIV not on HAART, ESRD on HD, and h/o coag neg
   Staph endocarditis s/p MVR/AVR [**1-25**] admitted with fevers and diarrhea,
   now w/ GPC POS BCx. Pt presents good clinical picture for bacterial
   endocarditis.
   # Bacterial Endocarditis:
   Patient is immunocompromised and has a history of endocarditis.  Of
   note, he has had prior recent admission in [**7-/2188**] with similar
   symptoms.  TTE and TEE findings as well as S. viridans bacteremia new
   PR prolongation on EKG are consistent with this diagnosis.  Other, ddx
   for his fevers would include CMV colitis, viral gastroenteritis, C diff
   colitis, or [**Doctor First Name **].  He responded appropriately to volume challenge and
   his blood pressures have been stable in 90s/50s since presentation to
   the MICU.  Although initially febrile, he was 94.8 and then 95.1 upon
   presentation to the MICU.  Would also have concern for CNS process
   given headaches and unequal pupils on exam, although clinical
   presentation does not suggest bacterial meningitis.  Of note, LP done
   [**7-/2188**] was negative.  CXR does not show infiltrate. EP consulted, and
   believe he has a poor prognosis and requires surgical intervention.  CT
   surgery consulted, and is waiting for final [**Doctor Last Name 1259**] from TEE before
   deciding on course.
   - F/u final read of TEE and discuss surgical plans with CT [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   - Continue Vanc/gent and flagyl with renal dosing
   - TID EKG
   - f/u BCx and fungal cultures and speciation
   - check CMV and stool C diff, O&P, stool Cx
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - Pacer pads kept at bedside.
   # Intubated for airway protection for multiple procedures.
   - Extubation plan based on CT surgery assessment which will require the
   final read on the TEE.
   - VAP bundle
   # Anisocoria - Planed to obtain MRI of head as has bacteremia and HIV
   and focal neurological finding. MRI without gad given ESRD.  Pt was
   unable to tolerate MRI.  Currently patient seems at high risk to leave
   floor.
   - Imaging is low priority, but will consider once cardiac issues have
   been addressed.
   # ESRD on HD:
   - HD yesterday, further per renal.
   - continue nephrocaps, phoslo, cinacalcet, and sevelamer
   - monitor lytes closely
   - appreciate renal input
   # Oral thrush:
   - nystatin swich and swallow, applying as swab while intubated
   # HIV with CD 4 count of 34:
   Not on HAART as he does not tolerate it.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue bactrim (currently on weekly bactrim, may need to adjust
   dose per ID)
   # Hyponatremia:  Resolved.  Likely was hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   # Anemia: At baseline
   - receiving Epo with dialysis
   - monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia: Current platelets 107, baseline 80-200
   [**Month (only) 60**] be low in setting of acute infection.  Also may be secondary to
   hepatosplenomegaly (chronic on his imaging).
   - monitor
   # Asthma:
   - continue albuterol
   # Elevated INR:
   Unclear if nutritional or if he has coagulopathy.  His INR is at his
   baseline.
   - Vitamin K given today
   -monitor
   # HTN:
   Of note, he has had problems with hypertension in the past but his
   nephrologist reports that his BP has been increasingly easy to control
   of late
   - hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Elevated Alk Phos:
   Chronic.  Most likely from bone as bone alk phos was elevated when
   checked in past.  Nephrologist planning on bone scan.
   # HCV/HBV:
   - LFTs at baseline.
   .
   # Chronic pain and h/o opioid dependance:
   - contine methadone 40mg tid
   # FEN: NPO while intubated, careful with IV fluids for pressure support
   only as needed as he does not make urine. If needs to stay intubated,
   will consider TF.
   # Glycemic control
   # Access
 2 PIVs, 18g , 20g will attempt to place another 18g line.
   # PPx:  subQ heparin, famotidine while in ICU
   # Code:  confirmed FULL
   # Dispo:  ICU for now.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 31M HIV/AIDS, endocarditis c/b AVR/MVR,
   diarrhea, fever, poor PO intake p/w fever and hypotension at HD.
   Colitis on CT, high grade GPC bacteremia.   Intubated for TEE which
   showed suspected aortic root abscess but no vegetations.  1^st degree

","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS, endocarditis, and chronic kidney disease requiring hemodialysis. He presented with fevers, diarrhea, and poor oral intake, which led to his current critical condition. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is being treated in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/54 to 114/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His physical examination reveals anisocoria that has resolved, a loud aortic sound, diffuse rales at the lung bases, and a benign bowel sounds assessment.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 4.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, sodium level of 72 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.8 mg/dL, and a lactate level of 0.7 mmol/L. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prothrombin time (PT) of 16.5, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 27.5, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5.

   Patient is immunocompromised and has a history of endocarditis.  Of
   note, he has had prior recent admission in [**7-/2188**] with similar
   symptoms.  TTE and TEE findings as well as S. viridans bacteremia new
   PR prolongation on EKG are consistent with this diagnosis.  Other, ddx
   for his fevers would include CMV colitis, viral gastroenteritis, C diff
   colitis, or [**Doctor First Name **].  He responded appropriately to volume challenge and
   his blood pressures have been stable in 90s/50s since presentation to
   the MICU.  Although initially febrile, he was 94.8 and then 95.1 upon
   presentation to the MICU.  Would also have concern for CNS process
   given headaches and unequal pupils on exam, although clinical
   presentation does not suggest bacterial meningitis.  Of note, LP done
   [**7-/2188**] was negative.  CXR does not show infiltrate. EP consulted, and
   believe he has a poor prognosis and requires surgical intervention.  CT
   surgery consulted, and is waiting for final [**Doctor Last Name 1259**] from TEE before
   deciding on course.
   - F/u final read of TEE and discuss surgical plans with CT [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   - Continue Vanc/gent and flagyl with renal dosing
   - TID EKG
   - f/u BCx and fungal cultures and speciation
   - check CMV and stool C diff, O&P, stool Cx
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - Pacer pads kept at bedside.
   # Intubated for airway protection for multiple procedures.
   - Extubation plan based on CT surgery assessment which will require the
   final read on the TEE.
   - VAP bundle
   # Anisocoria - Planed to obtain MRI of head as has bacteremia and HIV
   and focal neurological finding. MRI without gad given ESRD.  Pt was
   unable to tolerate MRI.  Currently patient seems at high risk to leave
   floor.
   - Imaging is low priority, but will consider once cardiac issues have
   been addressed.
   # ESRD on HD:
   - HD yesterday, further per renal.
   - continue nephrocaps, phoslo, cinacalcet, and sevelamer
   - monitor lytes closely
   - appreciate renal input
   # Oral thrush:
   - nystatin swich and swallow, applying as swab while intubated
   # HIV with CD 4 count of 34:
   Not on HAART as he does not tolerate it.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue bactrim (currently on weekly bactrim, may need to adjust
   dose per ID)
   # Hyponatremia:  Resolved.  Likely was hypovolemic hyponatremia.

   # Asthma:
   - continue albuterol
   # Elevated INR:
   Unclear if nutritional or if he has coagulopathy.  His INR is at his
   baseline.
   - Vitamin K given today

   # HTN:
   Of note, he has had problems with hypertension in the past but his
   nephrologist reports that his BP has been increasingly easy to control

   - hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Elevated Alk Phos:
   Chronic.  Most likely from bone as bone alk phos was elevated when
   checked in past.  Nephrologist planning on bone scan.

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and previous staphylococcal endocarditis after mitral valve replacement/repair. He was admitted with fevers, diarrhea, and positive blood cultures for Gram-positive cocci, suggesting bacterial endocarditis. The patient also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, elevated liver enzymes, and hepatitis C infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial Endocarditis: The patient's clinical presentation, positive blood cultures, and echocardiogram findings are consistent with bacterial endocarditis. This condition can lead to heart failure, septic emboli, and systemic infection.
2. Central Nervous System (CNS) Process: The patient presents with headaches and unequal pupils, which raises concern for a CNS process such as meningitis or abscess. However, the absence of fever and negative lumbar puncture make bacterial meningitis less likely.
3. Surgical Intervention: The patient's cardiac team believes he requires surgical intervention due to his poor prognosis. This carries risks associated with surgery, including bleeding, infection, and adverse cardiac events.
4. Intubation Complications: The patient is currently intubated for airway protection. Complications related to mechanical ventilation include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, and ventilator-induced lung injury.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and previous coag-negative Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. He was admitted with fevers, diarrhea, and is now diagnosed with probable bacterial endocarditis. The patient is immunocompromised and has a high risk for complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bacterial Endocarditis: The patient's symptoms, history of endocarditis, and positive S. viridans bacteremia suggest bacterial endocarditis. This condition can lead to heart valve damage, heart failure, abscess formation, and embolic events.

2. Central Nervous System (CNS) Process: The patient presents with headaches and unequal pupils, raising concern for a CNS process such as meningitis or brain abscess. However, the clinical presentation does not strongly suggest bacterial meningitis, and a previous lumbar puncture was negative.

3. Sepsis: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, ESRD, and positive bacteremia, there is a risk of developing sepsis. Sepsis can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and may require urgent intervention.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, which can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic symptoms.

   Assessment and Plan
   31yo gentleman with h/o HIV not on HAART, ESRD on HD, and h/o coag neg
   Staph endocarditis s/p MVR/AVR [**1-25**] admitted with fevers and diarrhea,
   now w/ GPC POS BCx. Pt presents good clinical picture for bacterial
   endocarditis.
   # Bacterial Endocarditis:
   Patient is immunocompromised and has a history of endocarditis.  Of
   note, he has had prior recent admission in [**7-/2188**] with similar
   symptoms.  TTE and TEE findings as well as S. viridans bacteremia new
   PR prolongation on EKG are consistent with this diagnosis.  Other, ddx
   for his fevers would include CMV colitis, viral gastroenteritis, C diff
   colitis, or [**Doctor First Name **].  He responded appropriately to volume challenge and
   his blood pressures have been stable in 90s/50s since presentation to
   the MICU.  Although initially febrile, he was 94.8 and then 95.1 upon
   presentation to the MICU.  Would also have concern for CNS process
   given headaches and unequal pupils on exam, although clinical
   presentation does not suggest bacterial meningitis.  Of note, LP done
   [**7-/2188**] was negative.  CXR does not show infiltrate. EP consulted, and
   believe he has a poor prognosis and requires surgical intervention.  CT
   surgery consulted, and think pt would be a poor surgical candidate.
   Patient to have repeat TEE
   - F/U repeat TEE and discuss surgical plans with CT [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   - Continue Vanc/gent and flagyl with renal dosing
   - TID EKG
   - f/u BCx and fungal cultures and speciation
   - check CMV and stool C diff, O&P, stool Cx
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - Pacer pads kept at bedside. EP following
   - Possible pacer wire placed in am so NPO
   #Blepharitis: New L eyelid edema on exam. ? blepharitis.
   -          warm compresses
   -          - erythromycin eye ointment. Will d/w ID. On
   Vanc/gent/Flagyl
   # Intubated for airway protection for multiple procedures.
   - Extubation plan based on CT surgery assessment which will require
   repeat TEE.
   - VAP bundle
   # Anisocoria - Planed to obtain MRI of head as has bacteremia and HIV
   and focal neurological finding. MRI without gad given ESRD.  Pt was
   unable to tolerate MRI.  Currently patient seems at high risk to leave
   floor.
   - Imaging is low priority, but will consider once cardiac issues have
   been addressed.
   # ESRD on HD:
   - Next HD Tuesday.
   - Per Renal, DC nephrocaps, phoslo, continue cinacalcet, and sevelamer
   - monitor lytes closely
   - appreciate renal input
   # Oral thrush:
   - nystatin swich and swallow, applying as swab while intubated
   # HIV with CD 4 count of 34:
   Not on HAART as he does not tolerate it.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue bactrim (currently on weekly bactrim, may need to adjust
   dose per ID)
   # Hyponatremia:  Resolved.  Likely was hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   # Anemia: At baseline
   - receiving Epo with dialysis
   - monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia: Current platelets 144, baseline 80-200
   [**Month (only) 60**] be low in setting of acute infection.  Also may be secondary to
   hepatosplenomegaly (chronic on his imaging).
   - monitor
   # Asthma:
   - continue albuterol
   # Elevated INR:
   Unclear if nutritional or if he has coagulopathy.  His INR is at his
   baseline.
   - Vitamin K given yesterday
   -monitor
   # HTN:
   Of note, he has had problems with hypertension in the past but his
   nephrologist reports that his BP has been increasingly easy to control
   of late
   - hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Elevated Alk Phos:
   Chronic.  Most likely from bone as bone alk phos was elevated when
   checked in past.  Nephrologist planning on bone scan.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and previous coag-negative Staphylococcus endocarditis post mitral valve replacement/repair (MVR/AVR). He was admitted with fevers and diarrhea and now presents with possible bacterial endocarditis. The patient has chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia, as well as hypotension not in shock. He is critically ill and requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Valve abscess: The patient's presentation suggests concern for a valve abscess due to bacterial endocarditis. This condition requires prompt evaluation with repeat transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and may necessitate surgical intervention if an abscess is found.
2. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on maintenance hemodialysis. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of treatment accordingly is essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension needs to be managed carefully to ensure adequate tissue perfusion. If the hypotension does not improve with medical management, further investigation into the underlying cause may be required.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has chronic thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications. Monitoring platelet counts and taking appropriate measures to prevent bleeding events is important.
5. Anemia:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and a negative blood type. He presents with symptoms of bacterial endocarditis, including fevers and diarrhea. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has several potential medical complications.

1. Hypothermia: The patient's current temperature is 36.7°C, which is below the normal range. Hypothermia can occur due to various factors such as exposure to a cold environment or the use of certain medications.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently low, indicating hypotension. This may be attributed to his underlying conditions, such as ESRD, or the administration of certain medications.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 8.5 g/dL, indicating anemia. Anemia can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and fatigue.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low at 100,000/mm³, indicating thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding complications.

5. Renal failure: The patient has a history of ESRD and requires hemodialysis. Renal failure can cause electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

6. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low at 27"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He has had a previous myocardial valve replacement (MVR) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). The patient presented with fevers and diarrhea and was found to have gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia. He is suspected to have bacterial endocarditis and there are concerns about a valve abscess, which would require repeat transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and possible surgical intervention if an abscess is present.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/70 to 131/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The results of the arterial blood gas analysis indicate a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 443 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukoc"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and a negative blood type. He has been admitted with fevers and diarrhea and now presents with good clinical features suggestive of bacterial endocarditis. The patient's medical complications that can arise include:

1. Valve abscess: The concern for valve abscess needs to be evaluated further with a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) today. If an abscess is present, the patient may require surgical intervention.

2. Hypotension: The patient has chronic hypotension, which could be related to his underlying conditions such as ESRD and endocarditis. Close monitoring and management of blood pressure is necessary.

3. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on maintenance hemodialysis. Regular monitoring of kidney function and adherence to dialysis schedule are essential.

4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia. These conditions need to be managed appropriately to prevent complications related to bleeding or low oxygen-carrying capacity.

5. HYPONATREMIA: The patient has low sodium levels, which can lead to various symptoms and complications. It is important to monitor and manage his sodium levels carefully.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a previous surgery for mitral valve replacement (MVR) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). He presents with fevers and diarrhea and is now diagnosed with gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia. The patient's clinical picture suggests bacterial endocarditis. There is concern for a valve abscess, which requires a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) today. If a valve abscess is present, the patient needs to go to the operating room (OR) for surgical intervention. He will continue receiving antibiotics, and vancomycin levels will be checked today. Serial blood cultures will also be obtained. The patient's ESRD is being managed with hemodialysis (HD) on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. An eyelid abscess has been identified, possibly related to blepharitis, and is being treated with warm compresses and erythromycin ointment. An ophthalmology consult has been requested if the condition worsens. The patient's other issues will be addressed according to the housestaff notes. ICU care includes holding nutrition for the TEE procedure, restarting after completion, glycemic control, and line management. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with subcutaneous unfractionated heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis. Ventil"

   Assessment and Plan
   31yo gentleman with h/o HIV not on HAART, ESRD on HD, and h/o coag neg
   Staph endocarditis s/p MVR/AVR [**1-25**] admitted with fevers and diarrhea,
   now w/ GPC POS BCx. Pt presents good clinical picture for bacterial
   endocarditis.
   # Bacterial Endocarditis:
   Patient is immunocompromised and has a history of endocarditis.  Of
   note, he has had prior recent admission in [**7-/2188**] with similar
   symptoms.  TTE and TEE findings as well as S. viridans bacteremia new
   PR prolongation on EKG are consistent with this diagnosis.  Other, ddx
   for his fevers would include CMV colitis, viral gastroenteritis, C diff
   colitis, or [**Doctor First Name **].  He responded appropriately to volume challenge and
   his blood pressures have been stable in 90-100s/50-60s since
   presentation to the MICU.  Although initially febrile, he was 94.8 and
   then 95.1 upon presentation to the MICU.  Would also have concern for
   CNS process given headaches and unequal pupils on exam, although
   clinical presentation does not suggest bacterial meningitis.  Of note,
   LP done [**7-/2188**] was negative.  CXR does not show infiltrate. EP
   consulted, and believes he has a poor prognosis and requires surgical
   intervention.  CT surgery consulted, and think pt would be a poor
   surgical candidate. Initial TEE did not show a descrete abcess. A
   repeat TEE was scheduled yesterday, but was not tolerated by the pt;
   plan to repeat TEE today.
   - Continue Vanc/gent and flagyl with renal dosing
   - TID EKG to monitor PR interval
   - f/u BCx, fungal cultures and speciation, f/u stool studies
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - EP following, appreciate recs
   - F/U repeat  of 2nd TEE and discuss results w/ CT surgery.
   - EP will place pacer wire today
   #Blepharitis: New L eyelid edema on exam. ? blepharitis.
   -          warm compresses
   -          - erythromycin eye ointment. Will d/w ID. On
   Vanc/gent/Flagyl
   -          Will arrange for ophthalmology consult tomorrow.
   # Intubated for airway protection for multiple procedures.
   - Extubation after TEE and pacer wire placement
   - VAP bundle
   # Anisocoria - Planed to obtain MRI of head as has bacteremia and HIV
   and focal neurological finding. MRI without gad given ESRD.  Pt was
   unable to tolerate MRI.  Currently patient seems at high risk to leave
   floor.
   - Imaging is low priority, but will consider once cardiac issues have
   been addressed.
   # ESRD on HD:
   - Had HD this morning, received GENT/VANC/FLAGYL w/ HD
   - Per Renal, DC phoslo, cinacalcet, and continue Nephrocaps
   - monitor lytes closely
   - appreciate renal input
   # Chronic pain and h/o opioid dependance:
   - contine methadone 40mg tid
   - consider MRI of spine as pt has bactermia and is high risk for
   epidural abcess. Pt w/ chronic pain, which could mask new neurological
   symptoms.
   # Oral thrush:
   - nystatin swich and swallow, applying as swab while intubated
   # HIV with CD 4 count of 34:
   Not on HAART as he does not tolerate it.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue bactrim (currently on weekly bactrim, may need to adjust
   dose per ID)
   # Hyponatremia:  Resolved.  Likely was hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   # Anemia: At baseline
   - receiving Epo with dialysis
   - monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia: Current platelets 144, baseline 80-200
   [**Month (only) 60**] be low in setting of acute infection.  Also may be secondary to
   hepatosplenomegaly (chronic on his imaging).
   - monitor
   # Asthma:
   - continue albuterol
   # Elevated INR:
   Unclear if nutritional or if he has coagulopathy.  His INR is at his
   baseline.
   - Vitamin K given yesterday
   -monitor
   # HTN:
   Of note, he has had problems with hypertension in the past but his
   nephrologist reports that his BP has been increasingly easy to control
   of late
   - hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Elevated Alk Phos:
   Chronic.  Most likely from bone as bone alk phos was elevated when
   checked in past.  Nephrologist planning on bone scan.
   # HCV/HBV:
   - LFTs at baseline.
   .
   # FEN: NPO for procedures, careful with IV fluids for pressure support
   only as needed as he does not make urine.
   - Pt should be Extubated today after procedures and should able to
   restart PO
   - if stays intubated for CT-surgery, then will start TFs when returns
   to the floor

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and a previous admission for coagulation-negative Staphylococcus endocarditis after mitral valve replacement/repair. He presents with fevers, diarrhea, and positive blood cultures for Gram-positive cocci, indicating a possible new episode of bacterial endocarditis. The patient is immunocompromised due to HIV and has multiple comorbidities. He is currently intubated for airway protection during procedures and has been diagnosed with anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, asthma, hypertension, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is also positive for hepatitis C and B viruses. His condition is complex, and potential medical complications include worsening endocarditis, septic emboli, heart failure, renal failure, and possible CNS involvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening endocarditis: The patient has a history of endocarditis and current symptoms suggestive of a new episode. Without proper treatment, the condition can progress and lead to further complications.
2. Septic emboli: Bacterial endocarditis can cause the formation and release of septic emboli, which can lead to systemic infections or organ damage.
3. Heart failure: The presence of heart valve abnormalities and potential infection can impair the heart's ability to pump effectively, leading to heart failure.
4. Renal failure"

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS, chronic renal failure, chronic anemia, and chronic thrombocytopenia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for suspected endocarditis. The patient has had a fever since admission and has been receiving antibiotics. He has undergone several tests including an EKG and transesophageal echo, but was unable to obtain adequate sedation for a bedside transesophageal echo to assess for vegetation/abscess of the aortic valve. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/68 mmHg to 155/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with SIMV/PSV/AutoFlow mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,468 mL and output of 329 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,138 mL. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

   Staph endocarditis s/p MVR/AVR [**1-25**] admitted with fevers and diarrhea,
   now w/ GPC POS BCx. Pt presents good clinical picture for bacterial
   endocarditis.
   # Bacterial Endocarditis:
   Patient is immunocompromised and has a history of endocarditis.  Of
   note, he has had prior recent admission in [**7-/2188**] with similar
   symptoms.  TTE and TEE findings as well as S. viridans bacteremia new
   PR prolongation on EKG are consistent with this diagnosis.  Other, ddx
   for his fevers would include CMV colitis, viral gastroenteritis, C diff
   colitis, or [**Doctor First Name **].  He responded appropriately to volume challenge and
   his blood pressures have been stable in 90s/50s since presentation to
   the MICU.  Although initially febrile, he was 94.8 and then 95.1 upon
   presentation to the MICU.  Would also have concern for CNS process
   given headaches and unequal pupils on exam, although clinical
   presentation does not suggest bacterial meningitis.  Of note, LP done
   [**7-/2188**] was negative.  CXR does not show infiltrate. EP consulted, and
   believe he has a poor prognosis and requires surgical intervention.  CT
   surgery consulted, and think pt would be a poor surgical candidate.
   Patient to have repeat TEE
   - F/U repeat TEE and discuss surgical plans with CT [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   - Continue Vanc/gent and flagyl with renal dosing

   - Imaging is low priority, but will consider once cardiac issues have
   been addressed.
   # ESRD on HD:
   - Next HD Tuesday.
   - Per Renal, DC nephrocaps, phoslo, continue cinacalcet, and sevelamer
   - monitor lytes closely

He presents with fevers, diarrhea, and positive blood cultures for Gram-positive cocci (GPC), suggesting bacterial endocarditis. He also has signs consistent with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, such as headaches and unequal pupils. The patient has undergone multiple procedures and is currently intubated for airway protection.

Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial Endocarditis: The patient has a history of endocarditis, and his current symptoms, including fevers and positive blood cultures for GPC, suggest a recurrence. This diagnosis is further supported by findings on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and the new PR prolongation on EKG.

2. CNS Process: The patient's headaches and unequal pupils raise concern for a CNS process. However, his clinical presentation does not suggest bacterial meningitis, and a previous lumbar puncture (LP) was negative. Further investigation, such as an MRI of the head, may be warranted.

3. Poor Surgical Candidate: Cardiac surgery consultation believes the patient has a poor prognosis and requires surgical intervention. However, CT surgery consultation thinks the patient would be a poor surgical candidate.

4. Anisocoria: The patient exhibits anis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old gentleman with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a past coagulation-negative Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis following mitral valve replacement (MVR) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was admitted with fevers and diarrhea and is now diagnosed with gonococcal prostatitis (GPC) based on a positive bacterial culture.

The patient's current clinical picture is consistent with bacterial endocarditis. The note expresses concern for a valve abscess, necessitating a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) today with anesthesia and temperature wire. The patient should continue receiving antibiotic therapy, and vancomycin levels should be checked today. Serial blood cultures will also be monitored.

In terms of potential medical complications, there are several considerations:

1. Bacterial Endocarditis: The patient's presentation suggests ongoing infection, which poses a risk of further complications such as heart failure, embolic events, or systemic spread of infection.

2. Valve Abscess: The concern for a valve abscess indicates a possible complication of the bacterial endocarditis. This can lead to heart valve dysfunction and potentially require surgical intervention.

3. ESRD: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing management, including hemodialysis sessions scheduled for today, tomorrow, and Saturday. Complications related to ESRD can"

The patient was admitted with fevers and diarrhea and now presents with good clinical signs of bacterial endocarditis.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:

1. Valve abscess: There is a concern for valve abscess due to bacterial endocarditis. A repeat transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is needed today in the cath lab with anesthesia to assess this further. Additionally, an electrophysiology (EP) wire will be placed temporarily.

2. Infection: The patient has an eyelid abscess, which may be related to blepharitis. Warm compresses and erythromycin ointment are being used to treat it. An ophthalmology consult is required if there is worsening.

3. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis (HD). Daily HD sessions are planned.

4. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension that is not due to shock. It needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and coagulation negativity. He was admitted with fevers and diarrhea and now presents with a good clinical picture for bacterial endocarditis. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Valve abscess: The concern for valve abscess in bacterial endocarditis needs further evaluation with a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). If a valve abscess is confirmed, the patient may require surgical intervention.

2. Endocarditis: The patient has signs and symptoms suggestive of bacterial endocarditis, which requires continued antibiotic therapy (ABX) and monitoring of vancomycin levels. Serial blood cultures should be obtained, and the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration.

3. ESRD: The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week. Complications related to ESRD, such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and anemia, should be closely monitored and managed appropriately.

4. Eyelid abscess: The patient has an eyelid abscess, which may be related to blepharitis. Conservative management with warm compresses and topical antibiotic ointment is recommended. An ophthalmology consult should be obtained if the condition worsens.

5. HIV/AIDS: The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS. Opportunistic infections"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic anemia, chronic thrombocytopenia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), HIV/AIDS, and hypotension. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic measures. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with SIMV/PSV/AutoFlow mode, receiving supplemental oxygen, and has a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/68 to 155/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's labs show elevated creatinine levels, low sodium levels, and other abnormalities. The patient remains febrile, and there are concerns about potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent fever indicates an ongoing infection, which could be related to his immunocompromised state due to HIV/AIDS. Monitoring for signs of worsening infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial.
2. Renal function deterioration: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest worsening renal function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and adjustment of medications accordingly are necessary.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's low sodium levels may lead to electrolyte imbalance and subsequent complications"

   now w/ Strep viridans bacteremia, endocarditis.
   # Bacterial Endocarditis:
   Patient is immunocompromised and has a history of endocarditis.  Of
   note, he has had prior recent admission in [**7-/2188**] with similar
   symptoms.  TTE and TEE findings as well as S. viridans bacteremia new
   PR prolongation on EKG are consistent with this diagnosis.  He
   responded appropriately to volume challenge and his blood pressures
   have been stable in 90-100s/50-60s since presentation to the MICU.
   Although initially febrile, he was 94.8 and then 95.1 upon presentation
   to the MICU.  Would also have concern for CNS process given headaches
   and unequal pupils on exam, although clinical presentation does not
   suggest bacterial meningitis.  Of note, LP done [**7-/2188**] was negative.
   CXR does not show infiltrate. EP consulted, and believes he has a poor
   prognosis and requires surgical intervention.  CT surgery consulted,
   and think pt would be a poor surgical candidate. Initial TEE did not
   show a descrete abcess but repeat TEE [**9-16**] showed tricuspid veg with
   thickened aortic root c/w probably abscess.
   He also had temp wire placed by IR which can remain for up to 1 monht

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and coag-negative Staphylococcal endocarditis post mitral valve replacement/ascending aortic valve replacement. He presented with fevers, diarrhea, and Strep viridans bacteremia, consistent with bacterial endocarditis. He also has tricuspid vegetation and a thickened aortic root, suggestive of an abscess. The patient underwent several procedures and is currently intubated for airway protection. He was recently extubated but experienced episodes of hypoglycemia and cardiac arrhythmias. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure range of 117/61-123/75 mmHg, heart rate of 65 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His physical examination revealed mild diffuse rales at the bases bilaterally, good air movement, and an AV fistula with thrill. The patient has anemia, thrombocytopenia, asthma, hypertension, elevated INR, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. His current medications include fentanyl, Vanc/gentamicin, metronidazole, and bactrim. The patient's medical team consulted with cardiology and infectious disease specialists, and surgery was considered but deemed unlikely due to the patient's poor prognosis and high risk of complications.

   for his fevers would include CMV colitis, viral gastroenteritis, C diff
   colitis, or [**Doctor First Name **].  He responded appropriately to volume challenge and
   his blood pressures have been stable in 90-100s/50-60s since
   presentation to the MICU.  Although initially febrile, he was 94.8 and
   then 95.1 upon presentation to the MICU.  Would also have concern for

","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and previous coagulase-negative Staphylococcus endocarditis after mitral valve replacement/atrial valve replacement (MVR/AVR). He presents with fevers and diarrhea, and is now positive for gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia. The patient has been admitted multiple times with similar symptoms in the past.

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bacterial Endocarditis: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, history of endocarditis, and positive GPC bacteremia, there is a high suspicion for bacterial endocarditis. This condition can lead to serious complications such as heart failure, embolic events, and septic shock.

2. Central Nervous System (CNS) Process: The patient's presentation of headaches and unequal pupils raises concern for a CNS process. However, the initial lumbar puncture (LP) was negative. Further evaluation with imaging studies, such as an MRI, may be necessary to rule out any CNS infection or other causes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS and is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 117/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's medical history includes renal failure, stage 5 chronic kidney disease, anemia, chronic thrombocytopenia, and hypotension. The patient is also taking medications such as gentamicin, vancomycin, metronidazole, fentanyl, and heparin.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and lactate, indicating possible renal dysfunction. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, while the platelet count is within normal range. Other lab values including glucose, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has a fever and elevated white blood cell count, which may suggest an underlying infection. Given the patient's immunocompromised status due to HIV/AIDS, there is an increased risk of opportunistic infections.

2. Renal failure: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coag-negative Staphylococcus endocarditis post mitral valve replacement/atrial valve replacement (MVR/AVR). He was admitted with fevers and diarrhea, and now presents with gram-positive cocci (GPC) positive blood culture. The patient's clinical picture is suggestive of bacterial endocarditis. There are concerns for a valve abscess, and a repeat transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned in the cath lab today with anesthesia. An elective permanent pacemaker placement will also be considered due to first-degree AV block. 

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABX), and vancomycin levels will be checked today. Serial blood cultures will be obtained. If the patient is not a surgical candidate, we will need a final statement from [initials] [last name] regarding further management. If medical therapy fails, we will discuss potential transfer to another hospital. 

The patient's respiratory status will be evaluated for extubation after procedures and sedation wears off. ESRD management includes HD today, tomorrow, and Saturday. An eyelid abscess is suspected as blepharitis, and warm compresses along with erythromycin ointment have been applied. An ophthalmology consult will be sought if the condition wors"

","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He was admitted with fevers and diarrhea and is now diagnosed with Staphylococcus viridans endocarditis. He has an aortic valve abscess and tricuspid valve vegetations confirmed by transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). He is currently receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy, and his vancomycin level will be checked today. Serial blood cultures are also necessary.

The patient has chronic anemia, chronic thrombocytopenia, hypotension (not in shock), and chronic renal failure. He requires ongoing management for these conditions.

Other medical issues include an eyelid abscess that has not improved with topical antibiotic ointment, and the need for an ophthalmology consultation to evaluate whether drainage is required.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, as he passed a spontaneous breathing trial this morning and is ready for extubation. He should continue to receive respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a plateau airway pressure (PIP) of 17 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, decreased"

","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a previous coag-negative Staphylococcus endocarditis status post mitral valve replacement (MVR)/aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was admitted with fevers and diarrhea and now presents with gram-positive cocci (GPC) positive blood culture. The patient's clinical picture is consistent with bacterial endocarditis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Valve abscess: The transesophageal echo confirms an aortic valve abscess and tricuspid valve vegetations. Continuous antibiotics will be given, and vancomycin levels will be checked today. Serial blood cultures will be taken, and the patient will need to follow up with an infectious disease specialist for further evaluation and discussion regarding surgical candidacy.
2. Respiratory issues: The patient passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for extubation this morning, indicating that he may be ready to be taken off the ventilator.
3. ESRD: The patient is scheduled for hemodialysis (HD) on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.
4. Eyelid abscess: The patient has an abscess on his eyelid, which may be related to blepharitis. Warm compresses and erythromycin ointment have been prescribed, but there has been no improvement. An ophthalmology consult will be"

   Assessment and Plan
   31yo gentleman with h/o HIV not on HAART, ESRD on HD, and h/o coag neg
   Staph endocarditis s/p MVR/AVR [**1-25**] admitted with fevers and diarrhea,
   now w/ Strep viridans bacteremia, endocarditis.
   # Bacterial Endocarditis:
   Patient is immunocompromised and has a history of endocarditis.  Of
   note, he has had prior recent admission in [**7-/2188**] with similar
   symptoms.  TTE and TEE findings as well as S. viridans bacteremia new
   PR prolongation on EKG are consistent with this diagnosis.  He
   responded appropriately to volume challenge and his blood pressures
   have been stable in 90-100s/50-60s since presentation to the MICU.
   Although initially febrile, he was 94.8 and then 95.1 upon presentation
   to the MICU.  Would also have concern for CNS process given headaches
   and unequal pupils on exam, although clinical presentation does not
   suggest bacterial meningitis.  Of note, LP done [**7-/2188**] was negative.
   CXR does not show infiltrate. EP consulted, and believes he has a poor
   prognosis and requires surgical intervention.  CT surgery consulted,
   and think pt would be a poor surgical candidate. Initial TEE did not
   show a descrete abcess but repeat TEE [**9-16**] showed tricuspid veg with
   thickened aortic root c/w probably abscess.
   He also had temp wire placed by IR which can remain for up to 1 monht
   - Continue Vanc/gent  with renal dosing. Check level in am
   - f/u repeat BCx, fungal cultures and speciation, f/u stool studies
   - ID following, appreciate recs. Will need to discuss duration of
   antibiotics, ? need for serial echos
   - EP following, appreciate recs
   - Will discuss possibility of surgery again with CT surgery given more
   probably abscess
   - Will consider CT spine if any neuro deficits or c/o back pain now
   extubated, more awake given risk for epidural abscess
   # Stye: Pt had new L eyelid edema with palpable mass. Seen by optho.
   C/w stye. Would treat with warm compresses, and e-mycin ointment.
   -          warm compresses
   -          erythromycin eye ointment.
   # Intubated for airway protection for multiple procedures.
   - Now extubated
   # Anisocoria
 Patient has mild anisocoria, stable. Will follow. No
   other neuro deficit at this time.
   # ESRD on HD:
   - Had HD Tuesday.  Received GENT/VANC w/ HD. Will check levels in am
   - monitor lytes closely
   - appreciate renal input
   # Chronic pain and h/o opioid dependance:
   - continue methadone 40mg tid
   # Oral thrush:
   - nystatin swich and swallow
   # HIV with CD 4 count of 34:
   Not on HAART as he does not tolerate it.
   - appreciate ID recs
   - continue bactrim (currently on weekly bactrim, may need to adjust
   dose per ID)
   # Anemia: At baseline
   - receiving Epo with dialysis
   - monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia: Current platelets 149, baseline 80-200
   [**Month (only) 60**] be low in setting of acute infection.  Also may be secondary to
   hepatosplenomegaly (chronic on his imaging).
   - monitor
   # Asthma:
   - continue albuterol
   # Elevated INR:
   Unclear if nutritional or if he has coagulopathy.  His INR is at his
   baseline.
   - Vitamin K given yesterday
   -monitor
   # HTN:
   Of note, he has had problems with hypertension in the past but his
   nephrologist reports that his BP has been increasingly easy to control
   of late
   - hold metoprolol while hypotensive
   # Elevated Alk Phos:
   Chronic.  Most likely from bone as bone alk phos was elevated when
   checked in past.  Nephrologist planning on bone scan.
   # HCV/HBV:
   - LFTs at baseline.
   .
   # FEN: NPO for procedures, careful with IV fluids for pressure support
   only as needed as he does not make urine.
   - Pt should be Extubated today after procedures and should able to
   restart PO
   - if stays intubated for CT-surgery, then will start TFs when returns
   to the floor

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and previous coag-negative Staphylococcus endocarditis after mitral valve replacement/aneurysm repair. The patient presented with fevers, diarrhea, and Strep viridans bacteremia, which are consistent with bacterial endocarditis. There is also a concern for a central nervous system process due to headaches and unequal pupils, although the clinical presentation does not suggest bacterial meningitis. A lumbar puncture performed previously was negative.

The patient has mild anisocoria, which is stable, and no other neuro deficits at this time. He has a chronic pain history, including opioid dependence, for which he continues to receive methadone. The patient also has oral thrush, for which nystatin is prescribed.

The patient's immunocompromised state and history of endocarditis raise concerns for potential medical complications. Some possible complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of endocarditis and recent findings of tricuspid valve vegetation with a thickened aortic root suggestive of an abscess, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias.

2. Neurological complications: The patient's symptoms of headaches and unequal pupils suggest a possible central nervous system involvement. This could lead to neurological deficits or even"

","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coag-negative Staphylococcus endocarditis post mitral valve replacement (MVR) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was admitted with fevers and diarrhea, and later found to have intermediate sensitivity Streptococcus viridans and prosthetic valve ring abscess, as well as tricuspid valve vegetation. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 102/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. His general appearance is described as lying in bed getting HD, sleepy but arousable to voice. On cardiovascular examination, he has an S3, S4, and a systolic murmur that is heard best at the apex. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 3.2 to 4.2 K/uL, hemoglobin ranging from 26.1 to 29.4 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 150 to 158 K/uL, creatinine ranging from 4.8 to 7.3 mg/dL, blood glucose ranging from 58 to 110 mg/dL, and sodium ranging from 124 to 140 mEq/L. Other lab results include elevated levels of BUN, potassium, and liver enzymes such as ALT and AST. The ECG shows a first-degree AV block. 

The patient's medical complications include fever (hypothermia), HIV, renal failure, hypotension, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and chronic hypertension. The plan includes continuing antibiotic therapy, serial ECGs, and serial blood cultures. The patient also requires hemodialysis on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and treatment for an eyelid abscess with warm compresses and erythromycin ointment. The back pain requires further evaluation with a spine CT scan due to the presence of a temperature wire and concern for epidural abscess. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of endocarditis, development of septic emboli leading to systemic involvement, worsening renal function, and further complications related to HIV/AIDS such as opportunistic infections or immunosuppression."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a coag-negative Staphylococcus infection. He was admitted with fevers and diarrhea and now presents with gram-positive cocci (GPC) positive blood culture. The patient has good clinical features for bacterial endocarditis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the progress note are as follows:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has a concern for valve abscess, which has been confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). There are vegetations on the tricuspid valve. The patient will continue antibiotic therapy, and vancomycin levels will be checked today. Serial blood cultures will be done. The patient needs to follow up with an infectious disease specialist and then have a final discussion about surgical candidacy.

2. ESRD: The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

3. Eyelid abscess: The patient has an abscess in the edge of the left eyelid. It is unclear if it is blepharitis. Warm compresses and erythromycin ointment have been prescribed. An ophthalmology consult has been requested to determine if drainage is necessary.

Other issues mentioned in the housestaff notes include ICU care, nutrition (renal diet), glycemic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a coag-negative Staphylococcus infection. He was admitted with fevers and diarrhea and now presents with gastrointestinal perfusion catheter (GPC) positive blood culture. The patient's clinical picture is consistent with bacterial endocarditis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:
1. Valve abscess: The patient has a confirmed aortic valve abscess and tricuspid valve vegetations. This increases the risk of valve rupture or fistula formation.
2. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing management and may be exacerbated by complications such as sepsis or medication toxicity.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure (102/58 mmHg) indicates hypotension, which could be due to septic shock or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring and appropriate intervention are necessary to maintain adequate organ perfusion.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia require ongoing monitoring and management, especially considering his immunocompromised state.
5. HIV infection: The patient's untreated HIV increases the risk of opportunistic infections and immune system-related complications.
6. Diarrhea: The patient's initial presentation with diarrhea may indicate gastrointestinal involvement, potentially secondary to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a previous coag-negative Staphylococcus endocarditis. He underwent mitral valve replacement (MVR) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) but is now presenting with intermediate sensitivity Strep viridans endocarditis, prosthetic valve ring abscess, and tricuspid valve vegetation. The patient is currently admitted with fevers and diarrhea. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient has endocarditis involving the prosthetic valve, which may lead to further complications such as valve dysfunction, heart failure, or systemic embolization.
2. Prosthetic Valve Ring Abscess: This condition can progress and potentially compromise the structural integrity of the valve, leading to valve dysfunction or the need for surgical intervention.
3. Tricuspid Valve Vegetation: If the vegetation dislodges, it could result in a systemic embolic event.
4. ESRD: The patient's renal function is impaired, and he requires regular hemodialysis sessions to manage his kidney failure. Poorly controlled ESRD can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased susceptibility to infections.
5. HIV/AIDS: As an immunocompromised patient, the patient is at higher risk for opportunistic infections and may have difficulty mounting an effective immune response against certain pathogens.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a medical history of HIV (not on HAART), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and a history of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus endocarditis post mitral valve replacement/repair (MVR/AVR). The patient is currently being treated for Streptococcus viridans endocarditis and bacteremia. The medical team is currently debating between medical and surgical management for the endocarditis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 107/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient has a first-degree AV block and is receiving prophylactic heparin.

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels ranging from 5.1 to 9.4 mg/dL, indicating impaired kidney function. Other lab values such as white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, troponin T, glucose, and liver enzymes are within normal limits.

The patient has several ongoing assessments and plans:
1. Strep Viridans Endocarditis: The patient is currently on vancomycin and gentamicin, with consideration for changing to penicillin at a later date. Duration of treatment is expected to be"
