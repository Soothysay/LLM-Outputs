","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and a history of H. pylori infection. She has been admitted to the ICU and has received 12 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) over the last several days. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/41 to 133/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient is oriented and follows simple commands, but has mild splenomegaly and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 68 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, and slightly low potassium and calcium levels. The patient's coagulation profile is within normal limits.

The patient has undergone various diagnostic procedures, including a tagged red blood cell study that localized the bleeding source to the distal duodenum or jejunum. She has also had an endoscopy at OSH showing antral bleeding and a capsule study showing bleeding in the duodenum/jejunum. A CT abdomen"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), with bleeding localized to the distal duodenum versus jejunum based on tagged red blood cell study. She has received 12 units of packed red blood cells over the last several days at OSH and is currently hemodynamically stable. The patient is awaiting evaluation by the gastrointestinal (GI) department, possibly including a push enteroscopy. She may also require evaluation by interventional radiology (IR)/surgery if the source of bleeding cannot be localized and she continues to bleed. The patient has a history of Helicobacter pylori infection, although it is unclear if it has been treated.

The patient has been managed with intravenous access, four units of blood typed and crossmatched, intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and nasogastric tube (NGT) lavage. She is currently NPO pending GI evaluation. The goal is to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) greater than 30, platelet count (Plt) greater than 50, and international normalized ratio (INR) less than 1.5.

The patient also has thrombocytopenia of unknown duration or etiology. Normal liver function tests (LFTs) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels suggest that the thrombocytopenia may not be due to hemolysis or liver disease. The"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and a known duodenal versus jejunal bleed identified via tagged red blood cells. She has received 12 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) over two days and is currently hemodynamically stable. The patient is awaiting gastrointestinal evaluation and may require further evaluation by interventional radiology (IR) or surgery if the bleeding cannot be localized.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient may continue to experience gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to further blood loss and potential hemodynamic instability.
2. Infection: Due to the patient's inability to eat (NPO), there is an increased risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or hospital-acquired infections.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if they travel to the lungs.
4. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of consuming several drinks per day, and sudden cessation of alcohol intake can lead to withdrawal symptoms, which may require close monitoring and appropriate management.
5. Stress-related mucosal disease: Prolonged periods of NPO status and critical illness can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract, potentially leading to gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 F with PMH significant for peptic ulcer disease, hypertension,
   hypothyroidism, CHF; transfer from OSH for management of GI bleed
   suspected to initiate from distal duodenum/proximal jejunum.
   # GI bleed.  Patient with both melena and BRBPR per OSH report.  EGD
   without acute bleeding at OSH; tagged scan with ?duodenal bleeding,
   consistent with capsule endoscopy results.
   - GI seeing, right now plan to push enteroscopy today
   - Surgery consult appreciated.  Consider IR consult.
   - transfuse for < 30 since actively bleeding.
   - Support INR (<1.5) and platelets (>50)
   - hold antihypertensives.
   - check H.pylori antibody.
   - IV PPI gtt.
   - CT abdomen vs. ultrasound to eval for mass lesions etc.
   # Anemia.  Predominantly acute blood loss anemia.  However, was
   macrocytic on initial presentation (?med vs. nutritional deficiency vs.
   high retics).  Retics not checked on OSH labs.  B12 and folate normal.
   TSH slightly elevated, but free T4 WNL..
   - Continue Q4-6 hour hct checks.
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Reportedly received platelets today at OSH.
   Normal (though low normal) at presentation to OSH, likely consumptive
   losses from active bleed.
   - get older baseline with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2445**].
   - goal > 50 while actively bleeding.
   - check peripheral smear.
   - check abdominal u/s vs. CT to assess splenomegaly.
   # CHF.  Hyperdynamic function per OSH notes on recent echo.  Also with
   TR and PA hypertension per notes, unclear etiology.
   - Obtain echo report.
   - Hold antiHTNs as above.
   - Will likely need lasix prn with blood products.
   # CKD.  Baseline unknown but stable in 1.7-1.9 range at [**Hospital1 **].
   - PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2445**].
   - continue to trend.
   - atenolol likely not best beta blocker for this patient.
   # Hypertension.  Has been getting meds at [**Hospital1 **] and BP tolerating
   well, but will continue to hold here.
   # Hypothyroidism.  TSH slightly elevated, free T4 WNL.  Continue
   levothyroxine.
   # Anxiety. Can add BZs at low dose prn as per home regimen if needed.
   # Bradycardia.  Asymptomatic during sleep.  On atenolol.  Will continue
   to hold BB and follow.
   # EtOH use.  [**1-6**] drinks per day.
   -          consider CIWA, though quite far out now.
   -          Start MVI.

","Summary:
The patient is a pleasant female with a history of peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and congestive heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU for management of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed suspected to originate from the distal duodenum/proximal jejunum. The patient presented with melena and bloody rinse in the bathroom, and an endoscopy showed no active bleeding. A tagged scan and capsule endoscopy indicated duodenal bleeding, leading to the decision to perform an enteroscopy. Surgery and interventional radiology consultations have been requested. The patient is being transfused for active bleeding, and efforts are being made to support an INR below 1.5 and platelets above 50. Antihypertensives have been held, and tests for H. pylori antibodies, as well as imaging studies, are planned. The patient's anemia is primarily due to acute blood loss, but there may also be a nutritional deficiency or high retics involved. B12 and folate levels are normal, and thyroid function tests show a slightly elevated TSH with normal free T4 levels. Thrombocytopenia is likely due to consumptive losses from the active bleed. Chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and anxiety are also noted. The patient's bradycardia is asymptomatic during sleep and is being monitored. Et"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 F with PMH significant for peptic ulcer disease, hypertension,
   hypothyroidism, CHF; transfer from OSH for management of GI bleed
   suspected to initiate from distal duodenum/proximal jejunum.
   # GI bleed.  Patient with both melena and BRBPR per OSH report.  EGD
   without acute bleeding at OSH; tagged scan with ?duodenal bleeding,
   consistent with capsule endoscopy results.
   - GI seeing, right now plan to push enteroscopy today
   - Surgery consult appreciated.  Consider IR consult.
   - transfuse for < 30 since actively bleeding.
   - Support INR (<1.5) and platelets (>50)
   - hold antihypertensives.
   - check H.pylori antibody.
   - IV PPI gtt.
   - CT abdomen vs. ultrasound to eval for mass lesions etc.
   # Anemia.  Predominantly acute blood loss anemia.  However, was
   macrocytic on initial presentation (?med vs. nutritional deficiency vs.
   high retics).  Retics not checked on OSH labs.  B12 and folate normal.
   TSH slightly elevated, but free T4 WNL..
   - Continue Q4-6 hour hct checks.
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Reportedly received platelets today at OSH.
   Normal (though low normal) at presentation to OSH, likely consumptive
   losses from active bleed.
   - get older baseline with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2445**].
   - goal > 50 while actively bleeding.
   - check peripheral smear.
   - check abdominal u/s vs. CT to assess splenomegaly.
   # CHF.  Hyperdynamic function per OSH notes on recent echo.  Also with
   TR and PA hypertension per notes, unclear etiology.
   - Obtain echo report.
   - Hold antiHTNs as above.
   - Will likely need lasix prn with blood products.
   # CKD.  Baseline unknown but stable in 1.7-1.9 range at [**Hospital1 **].
   - PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2445**].
   - continue to trend.
   - atenolol likely not best beta blocker for this patient.
   # Hypertension.  Has been getting meds at [**Hospital1 **] and BP tolerating
   well, but will continue to hold here.
   # Hypothyroidism.  TSH slightly elevated, free T4 WNL.  Continue
   levothyroxine.
   # Anxiety. Can add BZs at low dose prn as per home regimen if needed.
   # Bradycardia.  Asymptomatic during sleep.  On atenolol.  Will continue
   to hold BB and follow.
   # EtOH use.  [**1-6**] drinks per day.
   -          consider CIWA, though quite far out now.
   -          Start MVI.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a significant medical history of peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and congestive heart failure. She was transferred to the ICU for management of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which is suspected to originate from the distal duodenum or proximal jejunum. The patient has both melena (black, tarry stools) and bloody nasogastric aspirates (BRBPR), indicating an ongoing bleed. Endoscopy was performed without acute bleeding, and a tagged scan showed duodenal bleeding consistent with capsule endoscopy results. An enteroscopy is planned to identify the source of bleeding. A surgery consult has been requested, and a possible interventional radiology (IR) consult is being considered. The patient is being transfused for active bleeding, and efforts are being made to support her INR below 1.5 and platelets above 50. Antihypertensive medications have been held, and further investigations such as a CT scan of the abdomen or ultrasound may be performed to evaluate for mass lesions. The patient also has anemia, predominantly due to acute blood loss, although initial presentation suggested macrocytic anemia. Vitamin B12 and folate levels are normal, and thyroid function tests show a slightly elevated TSH level with normal free T4 levels. Thrombocytopenia is present, likely due to consumptive losses from the active"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a medical history of peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and congestive heart failure. He was transferred to the ICU for management of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, suspected to originate from the distal duodenum/proximal jejunum. The patient has both melena and bloody rumen per oral suction aspiration per outside hospital report. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) without acute bleeding was performed at the outside hospital, and a tagged scan with duodenal bleeding was consistent with capsule endoscopy results. An enteroscopy is planned for early morning, along with a surgery consult. There is potential involvement of interventional radiology (IR) if angio is beneficial. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) should be checked now, and transfusion should be done for HCT less than 30 due to active bleeding. Support of the international normalized ratio (INR) below 1.5 and platelets above 50 should also be continued. Fe studies are unlikely to be interpretable due to high transfusions. Blood consent has been signed, and antihypertensives should be held. Intravenous pantoprazole (Protonix) is being given at a rate of 8 mg/hour.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 F with PMH significant for peptic ulcer disease, hypertension,
   hypothyroidism, CHF; transfer from OSH for management of GI bleed
   suspected to initiate from distal duodenum/proximal jejunum.
   # GI bleed.  Patient with both melena and BRBPR per OSH report.  EGD
   without acute bleeding at OSH; tagged scan with ?duodenal bleeding,
   consistent with capsule endoscopy results.
   - GI seeing, right now plan to push enteroscopy today
   - Surgery consult appreciated.  Consider IR consult.
   - transfuse for < 30 since actively bleeding.
   - Support INR (<1.5) and platelets (>50)
   - hold antihypertensives.
   - check H.pylori antibody.
   - IV PPI gtt.
   - CT abdomen vs. ultrasound to eval for mass lesions etc.
   # Anemia.  Predominantly acute blood loss anemia.  However, was
   macrocytic on initial presentation (?med vs. nutritional deficiency vs.
   high retics).  Retics not checked on OSH labs.  B12 and folate normal.
   TSH slightly elevated, but free T4 WNL..
   - Continue Q4-6 hour hct checks.
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Reportedly received platelets today at OSH.
   Normal (though low normal) at presentation to OSH, likely consumptive
   losses from active bleed.
   - get older baseline with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2445**].
   - goal > 50 while actively bleeding.
   - check peripheral smear.
   - check abdominal u/s vs. CT to assess splenomegaly.
   # CHF.  Hyperdynamic function per OSH notes on recent echo.  Also with
   TR and PA hypertension per notes, unclear etiology.
   - Obtain echo report.
   - Hold antiHTNs as above.
   - Will likely need lasix prn with blood products.
   # CKD.  Baseline unknown but stable in 1.7-1.9 range at [**Hospital1 **].
   - PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2445**].
   - continue to trend.
   - atenolol likely not best beta blocker for this patient.
   # Hypertension.  Has been getting meds at [**Hospital1 **] and BP tolerating
   well, but will continue to hold here.
   # Hypothyroidism.  TSH slightly elevated, free T4 WNL.  Continue
   levothyroxine.
   # Anxiety. Can add BZs at low dose prn as per home regimen if needed.
   # Bradycardia.  Asymptomatic during sleep.  On atenolol.  Will continue
   to hold BB and follow.
   # EtOH use.  [**1-6**] drinks per day.
   -          consider CIWA, though quite far out now.
   -          Start MVI.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and congestive heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU for management of a gastrointestinal bleed suspected to originate from the distal duodenum/proximal jejunum. The patient presented with melena and blood-tinged nasogastric aspirate per OSH report. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed without acute bleeding, and a tagged scan showed duodenal bleeding consistent with capsule endoscopy results. An enteroscopy is planned for today. Surgical and interventional radiology consultations have been requested. The patient is being transfused for hemoglobin below 30 due to active bleeding. The goal is to maintain an INR below 1.5 and platelets above 50. Antihypertensive medications have been held. H. pylori serologies are pending. A CT scan of the abdomen or ultrasound is being considered to evaluate for mass lesions, among other things. The patient's anemia is predominantly acute blood loss anemia, although he was initially macrocytic. B12 and folate levels are normal, and TSH is slightly elevated with normal free T4 levels. The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to consumptive losses from the active bleed. Splenomegaly is a concern. The patient's congestive heart failure is hyperdynamic, and there is also evidence of"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 86-year-old male with a significant medical history including peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and congestive heart failure. The patient was admitted to the ICU for management of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed suspected to originate from the distal duodenum/proximal jejunum. 

Upon admission, the patient had melena and blood-tinged nasogastric aspirate, but no active bleeding was observed during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). A tagged scan showed duodenal bleeding consistent with capsule endoscopy results. The patient has been receiving intravenous pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, to reduce gastric acid production and protect the stomach lining. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/44 to 162/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory values indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 57 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 68,000/mL, and elevated creatinine levels of 1.6 mg/dL. Other lab results include normal white blood cell count, electrolyte levels, liver function tests, and kidney function tests.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, decreased breath sounds in the lung bases, soft abdomen with no localized tenderness, and lower extremity edema. The patient is neurologically intact with focused examination findings.

The patient's medical plan includes restarting antihypertensive medications as needed or on October 12th, checking h pylori and gastrin levels, continuing intravenous pantoprazole until October 12th, and performing a CT scan of the abdomen to assess for abdominal pathology or mass. The patient also has plans to address anemia, thrombocytopenia, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, anxiety, bradycardia, and ethanol use."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The source of the bleeding was identified as multiple duodenal ulcers, which were cauterized yesterday. The patient has remained hemodynamically stable since then. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UGIB: The patient's history of multiple duodenal ulcers increases the risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring and ongoing management are necessary to prevent further bleeding episodes.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to various causes, including bone marrow suppression as a result of EtOH abuse or other underlying conditions. Further evaluation is needed to determine the etiology and appropriate treatment.

3. CHF: The patient has a reported ejection fraction (EF) that is normal, indicating no evidence of heart failure. However, close monitoring of the patient's volume status is advised due to moderate pulmonary hypertension.

4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels were elevated at the previous facility, indicating potential renal impairment. Continuous monitoring of renal function and electrolyte balance is crucial.

Overall, the patient requires careful monitoring and management of their UGIB, thrombocytopenia, CHF, and renal function. A multidisciplinary approach involving gastroenterology, hematology, cardiology, and nephrology may be necessary to address these potential complications."

","The patient is an 86-year-old with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), who was found to have multiple duodenal ulcers and underwent cauterization. The patient remains hemodynamically stable, and the differential diagnosis includes Zollinger-Ellison syndrome versus Helicobacter pylori infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/44 mmHg to 162/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the right base of the chest and absent pulses in both right and left lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal limits, slightly low hemoglobin level of 11.4 g/dL, low platelet count of 68 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, normal glucose level of 95 mg/dL, and other electrolyte levels within normal range. The patient's Hct, WBC, Plt, and Cr levels have been trending within normal limits over the past few days.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. UGIB: Multiple duodenal ulcers s/p cautery, remains stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old individual with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), who presented with multiple duodenal ulcers that were cauterized yesterday. The patient has been hemodynamically stable and is currently receiving pantoprazole infusions. The differential diagnosis for the ulcers includes Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and Helicobacter pylori infection. The patient's thrombocytopenia is of unknown duration or etiology, with normal liver function tests (LFTs) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, raising suspicion for possible bone marrow suppression due to ethanol abuse. The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), with reported normal ejection fraction (EF) and moderate pulmonary hypertension. Renal failure is present, with creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 1.7-1.9 at the previous hospital (OSH). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/44 to 162/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UGIB recurrence: Despite the cauterization of the ulcers, there is still a risk of further bleeding.
2. Thrombocytopenia:"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), confirmed to be originating from the duodenum or jejunum based on tagged red blood cell scan. The patient has received 12 units of packed red blood cells over the last few days at OSH and remains hemodynamically stable. The patient underwent cauterization of multiple duodenal ulcers yesterday and continues to do well without additional transfusion requirement.

Potential medical complications:
1. UGIB: The patient has a history of multiple duodenal ulcers, which were cauterized yesterday. There is a possibility of re-bleeding or further complications related to the ulcers.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, but the exact duration or etiology is unknown. Normal liver function tests (LFTs) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels suggest that marrow suppression may not be the cause. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of thrombocytopenia.
3. Chronic alcohol abuse: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, which can contribute to various complications including liver disease, pancreatitis, and malnutrition.
4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has moderate pulmonary hypertension, and their reported ejection fraction (EF) is normal. Close monitoring of volume status is necessary to manage CHF effectively.
5. Renal failure: The patient had a"
