   Images:
   [**2160-8-2**] CT abdomen/pelvis (prelim):  New since the prior study on the
   6th, there is marked pericolonic dilatation. The colon, however, is
   thin-walled, with no significant adjacent stranding or inflammation.
   There are some stool balls appreciated in the sigmoid colon, with
   slight transition at this point, but there is no evidence of mechanical
   obstruction. Findings raise concern for possible colonic ischemia, and
   clinical correlation and laboratory correlation is advised. The bladder
   is decompressed by a Foley catheter. There is no free fluid in the
   pelvis or abdomen. Appendix is again prominent, though periappendiceal
   inflammation is absent.
   .
   [**2160-8-2**] CXR:
   The ET tube tip is approximately 6 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip
   is in
   the stomach. Heart size is severely enlarged, unchanged since the prior
   study. Right lung is essentially clear. Within the left lung there is
   questionable left upper lobe opacity seen but given the rotated
   character of
   this study it is difficult to appreciate.
   [**2160-8-3**]: CXR (my read): left sided pleural effusion
   [**2160-8-3**]: AXR:
   Current study is extremely limited most likely due to patient habitus
   and
   demonstrates two AP viewsof the abdomen where the dilatation of the
   colon is
   up to 10 cm. Compared to the recent chest CT it appears to be with no
   appreciable change (series 300B, image 21) on the prior chest CT and
   clinical
   correlation is recommended.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 2728**] is an 84 year old nursing home resident
   with dementia, mental retardation, DM2, chronic indwelling foley
   initially admitted with urosepsis and possible small extraperitoneal
   bladder perforation on [**7-26**] who subsequently developed hypoxemic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Possibly secondary to increased
   abdominal distention, atelectasis due to low lung volumes, and pleural
   effusion/consolidation.  In addition he likely has some aspiration and
   per his floor team thought to have some pulmonary edema.  He rec'd some
   lasix and nebs without much effect and after being hypoxic to 86-90% on
   a non rebreather he began to tire and become more somnolent.  It is
   possible the patient some unwitnessed aspiration prior to intubation,
   versus during intubation as his chest x ray has a possible retrocardiac
   opacity (although not much worse).
   -s/p intubation, will attempt to address primary cause which is likely
   due to colonic distension
   -attempt to wean ventilator settings -> Obtain ABG.  Can drop RR to
   14.  [**Month (only) 8**] consider increasing PEEP pending PaO2.
   -sputum cx given possible retrocardiac opacity
   -current abx are geared towards GI pathogens; monitor for clinical
   worsening
   .
   # Colonic dilation: related to a stool ball in his sigmoid colon, no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology.  Per surgery any
   surgical intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -fleets enemas x 2 per [**Doctor First Name 91**] and GI
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -electrolyte repletion
   -follow lactate
   -continue flagyl, cipro, fluconazole, bactrim as per gen [**Doctor First Name 91**]; consider
   narrowing spectrum
   -f/u GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   .
   # Hypotension: multifactorial, may be due to abdominal process in
   combination with higher PEEP and sedating medications.  Prior to
   intubation was normotensive and also on all of his home
   antihypertensives including HCTZ, metoprolol, isordil and norvasc.
   Hold antihypertensives and use pressors as necessary, goal MAP > 65.
   Currently requiring neo 0.5.
   - fluid boluses as necessary to keep MAP > 65
   - A line placed
   - obtain CVP
   - change neo to levophed; try to wean as tolerated
   - culture if spikes and will broaden coverage.
   .
   # Urosepsis: ID has been consulted.
   -f/u ID recs
   -continue bactrim for ecoli bacteremia and continue IV fluc for yeast
   in urine per ID
   .
   #Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   -maintain foley
   -call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   #Hypernatremia: stable.
   -in a.m. will calculate new free water deficit given fluid shifts and
   change in clinical status today
   .
   #Acute renal failure - currently 1.8 and has leveled off.  follow uop
   and bolus prn to maintain UOP > 30cc.
   -send urine lytes and urinalysis if creatinine worsens
   -trend
   -renally dose meds
   .
   #Hypothyroid - continue synthroid (now IV dose)
   .
   #h/o seizure disorder - continue dilantin, phenobarbital (IV)

","Summary:
- The patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with dementia, mental retardation, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted with urosepsis and possible small extraperitoneal bladder perforation on 7/26. He developed hypoxemic respiratory failure and was intubated. There are concerns about aspiration, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusion/consolidation.
- The patient has colonic dilation due to a stool ball in the sigmoid colon without evidence of mechanical obstruction. Surgical intervention may involve total colectomy, and conservative management is being pursued with NGT and rectal tube decompression.
- The patient is hypotensive and requires pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. He is also hypoxic and requires supplemental oxygen.
- He has a history of urosepsis, anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation (not currently an active issue), diabetes mellitus, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, and osteoporosis.
- The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antihypertensives, insulin, antiepileptics, and vitamins.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/52 to 143/125 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on ventilator, and sinus rhythm.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure and the need for intubation indicate a risk of further respiratory complications. This may include pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or worsening hypoxia.
2. Aspiration: The patient's risk factors, such as dementia, mental retardation, and altered mental status, increase the likelihood of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of wheezing, dry cough, and low lung volumes suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema, which can be exacerbated by fluid overload or heart failure.
4. Pleural effusion/consolidation: The presence of a possible retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray raises concerns about pleural effusion or consolidation, which may require further investigation.
5. Colonic ischemia: The marked pericolonic dilatation seen on imaging raises concern for possible colonic ischemia, especially considering the patient's history of vascular disease.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia and acute renal failure, indicating a potential risk of electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia or hyponatremia.
7. Infection: The patient's urosepsis and positive blood cultures indicate an ongoing infection risk, which could lead to septic shock or organ dysfunction.
8. Bladder perforation: Although the anterior extraperitoneal"

   There are some stool balls appreciated in the sigmoid colon, with
   slight transition at this point, but there is no evidence of mechanical
   obstruction. Findings raise concern for possible colonic ischemia, and
   clinical correlation and laboratory correlation is advised. The bladder
   is decompressed by a Foley catheter. There is no free fluid in the
   pelvis or abdomen. Appendix is again prominent, though periappendiceal
   inflammation is absent.
   .
   [**2160-8-2**] CXR AP (my read): scoliosis, rotation, L sided pleural effusion
   and retrocardiac opacity, R lung is clear.
   [**2160-8-3**]: left sided pleural effusion
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 2728**] is an 84 year old nursing home resident
   with dementia, mental retardation, DM2, chronic indwelling foley
   initially admitted with urosepsis and possible small extraperitoneal
   bladder perforation on [**7-26**] who subsequently developed hypoxemic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: the patient had diffuse wheezes and
   ronchi on exam, and left sided pleural effusion on CXR.  He has had
   slowly worsening oxygenation in addition to a abdomen that has become
   more distended over the past few days.  Atelectasis and low lung
   volumes related to a massively dilated colon is likely what caused this
   patient to have poor reserve.   In addition he likely has some
   aspiration and per his floor team thought to have some pulmonary
   edema.  He rec'd some lasix and nebs without much effect and after
   being hypoxic to 86-90% on a non rebreather he began to tire and become
   more somnolent.  It is possible the patient some unwitnessed aspiration
   prior to intubation, versus during intubation as his chest x ray has a
   possible retrocardiac opacity (although not much worse).
   -s/p intubation, will attempt to address primary cause which is likely
   due to colonic distension
   -attempt to wean ventilator settings
   -repeat ABG
   -increase PEEP
   -sputum cx given possible retrocardiac opacity
   .
   # Colonic dilation: related to a stool ball in his sigmoid colon, no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology.  Per surgery any
   surgical intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -fleets enemas x 2 per [**Doctor First Name 91**] and GI
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -electrolyte repletion
   -follow lactate
   -GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   -per general surgery c diff is a possibility, send a c diff toxin and
   treating w/ flagyl.  In addition per gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] would treat w/ cipro as
   well.  will continue for now but discuss in a.m. possible
   discontinuation of this antibiotic.
   .
   # Hypotension: likely related to higher PEEP and sedating medications.
   Prior to intubation was normotensive and also on all of his home
   antihypertensives including HCTZ, metoprolol, isordil and norvasc.
   Hold antihypertensives and use pressors as necessary, goal MAP > 65.
   Currently requiring neo 0.5.
   - fluid boluses as necessary to keep MAP > 65
   - A line placed
   -culture if spikes and will broaden coverage.
   .
   # Urosepsis: ID has been consulted.  The patient is on bactrim for his
   e coli bactermia and urosepsis.
   -f/u ID recs
   -continue bactrim
   -continue IV fluc for yeast in urine per ID
   .
   #Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   -maintain foley
   -call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   #Hypernatremia: follow a.m. sodium.
   -in a.m. will calculate new free water deficit given fluid shifts and
   change in clinical status today
   .
   #Acute renal failure - currently 1.5 and has leveled off.  follow uop
   and bolus prn to maintain UOP > 30cc.
   -send urine lytes and urinalysis if creatinine worsens
   -trend
   -renally dose meds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with a history of dementia, mental retardation, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was initially admitted with urosepsis and a possible small extraperitoneal bladder perforation on 7/26. The patient subsequently developed hypoxemic respiratory failure and required intubation due to worsening oxygenation and a massively distended abdomen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory condition has been worsening, leading to inadequate oxygenation and the need for intubation. Possible causes include atelectasis, aspiration, and pulmonary edema. The plan includes addressing the primary cause (likely colonic distension), attempting to wean ventilator settings, increasing PEEP, repeating ABG, and obtaining a sputum culture.

2. Colonic dilation: The patient has a stool ball in his sigmoid colon without evidence of mechanical obstruction. Surgical intervention may be necessary, with the possibility of a total colectomy. Non-surgical options include fleets enemas and NGT/rectal tube decompression.

3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, likely related to higher PEEP and sedating medications. Prior to intubation, the patient was normotensive and on antihypertensives. The plan involves holding antihypertensives, using pressors as necessary, and maintaining a mean arterial pressure"

   .
   Images:
   [**2160-8-2**] CT abdomen/pelvis (prelim):  New since the prior study on the
   6th, there is marked pericolonic dilatation. The colon, however, is
   thin-walled, with no significant adjacent stranding or inflammation.
   There are some stool balls appreciated in the sigmoid colon, with
   slight transition at this point, but there is no evidence of mechanical
   obstruction. Findings raise concern for possible colonic ischemia, and
   clinical correlation and laboratory correlation is advised. The bladder
   is decompressed by a Foley catheter. There is no free fluid in the
   pelvis or abdomen. Appendix is again prominent, though periappendiceal
   inflammation is absent.
   .
   [**2160-8-2**] CXR AP (my read): scoliosis, rotation, L sided pleural effusion
   and retrocardiac opacity, R lung is clear.
   [**2160-8-3**]: left sided pleural effusion
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 2728**] is an 84 year old nursing home resident
   with dementia, mental retardation, DM2, chronic indwelling foley
   initially admitted with urosepsis and possible small extraperitoneal
   bladder perforation on [**7-26**] who subsequently developed hypoxemic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: the patient had diffuse wheezes and
   ronchi on exam, and left sided pleural effusion on CXR.  He has had
   slowly worsening oxygenation in addition to a abdomen that has become
   more distended over the past few days.  Atelectasis and low lung
   volumes related to a massively dilated colon is likely what caused this
   patient to have poor reserve.   In addition he likely has some
   aspiration and per his floor team thought to have some pulmonary
   edema.  He rec'd some lasix and nebs without much effect and after
   being hypoxic to 86-90% on a non rebreather he began to tire and become
   more somnolent.  It is possible the patient some unwitnessed aspiration
   prior to intubation, versus during intubation as his chest x ray has a
   possible retrocardiac opacity (although not much worse).
   -s/p intubation, will attempt to address primary cause which is likely
   due to colonic distension
   -attempt to wean ventilator settings
   -repeat ABG
   -increase PEEP
   -sputum cx given possible retrocardiac opacity
   .
   # Colonic dilation: related to a stool ball in his sigmoid colon, no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology.  Per surgery any
   surgical intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -fleets enemas x 2 per [**Doctor First Name 91**] and GI
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -electrolyte repletion
   -follow lactate
   -GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   -per general surgery c diff is a possibility, send a c diff toxin and
   treating w/ flagyl.  In addition per gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] would treat w/ cipro as
   well.  will continue for now but discuss in a.m. possible
   discontinuation of this antibiotic.
   .
   # Hypotension: likely related to higher PEEP and sedating medications.
   Prior to intubation was normotensive and also on all of his home
   antihypertensives including HCTZ, metoprolol, isordil and norvasc.
   Hold antihypertensives and use pressors as necessary, goal MAP > 65.
   Currently requiring neo 0.5.
   - fluid boluses as necessary to keep MAP > 65
   - A line placed
   -culture if spikes and will broaden coverage.
   .
   # Urosepsis: ID has been consulted.  The patient is on bactrim for his
   e coli bacteremia and urosepsis.
   -f/u ID recs
   -continue bactrim
   -continue IV fluc for yeast in urine per ID
   .
   #Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   -maintain foley
   -call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   #Hypernatremia: stable.
   -in a.m. will calculate new free water deficit given fluid shifts and
   change in clinical status today

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with multiple medical conditions, including dementia, mental retardation, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient was initially admitted with urosepsis and a possible small extraperitoneal bladder perforation. Subsequently, the patient developed hypoxemic respiratory failure.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to several factors, including a massively dilated colon causing atelectasis and low lung volumes, aspiration, pulmonary edema, and possibly an unwitnessed aspiration event prior to or during intubation. The patient has been intubated, and ventilator settings will be adjusted to address the primary cause of colonic distension.

The patient also has colonic dilation related to a stool ball in the sigmoid colon, but no evidence of mechanical obstruction. Surgical intervention may involve a total colectomy, while a sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to stool. Enemas and NG/rectal tube decompression have been recommended for colonic decompression.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing hypotension, likely related to higher PEEP and sedating medications. The patient's blood pressure has been stable prior to intubation, and antihypertensives have been held. Pressors may be used as necessary to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male with h/o MR now with worsening abdominal distention in the
   setting of fecal ball in sigmoid with near complete obstruction leading
   to significant distention which in the setting of underlying chest wall
   restriction has not moved to hypoxemic respiratory failure.  He has
   compliance on the ventilator this morning which is decreased but still
   at >40.  He has underlying scoliosis which may well be additive in
   consequence of impaired ventilation.  He has left lower lobe opacity
   which is hard to further define this morning.
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-
   -Will continue with A/C support and decrease RR given alkalemia and
   likely impaired capacity for ventilation across time
   -Will re-evaluate with ABG and look to optimize PEEP for support with
   hypoxemia likely driven by atelectasis, LLL consolidation and possible
   PNA
   2)Bowel Obstruction
Partial obstruction
   -Will continue with OGT suction
   -Will continue with GI and Surgery support
   -No surgery at this time
   -Will follow exam
   -Cipro/Flagyl/Fluc
   3)Hypotension
he has continued support with Neo at this time with
   requirement seen
   Causes are likely related to vasodilatory effects of SIRS in the
   setting of bowel obstruction, possible pneumonia and respiratory
   Will check CVP and CVO2
   Will change to Levophed for pressor
   3)Urosepsis-Appears to be resolved in recent past but with persistent
   hypotension and fever all possible sources have to be considered.

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of mental retardation (MR) presenting with worsening respiratory failure in the setting of fecal ball in the sigmoid with near complete obstruction, leading to significant abdominal distention. This has resulted in hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with intubation performed with a bronchoscope.

The patient also has a left lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray, which may indicate pneumonia or atelectasis. There is evidence of sepsis with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient's abdominal distention is due to a fecal ball causing partial bowel obstruction.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to the combination of abdominal distention causing impaired ventilation and possible pneumonia. The patient will continue with assisted ventilation and optimization of PEEP to support oxygenation.

2. Bowel obstruction: The fecal ball in the sigmoid colon has caused partial bowel obstruction. The patient will continue with nasogastric tube suctioning, and further management will be determined by GI and surgery consultations.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely related to the vasodilatory effects of sepsis-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in the setting of bowel obstruction and possible pneumonia. Pressor support with Neo and Levophed will be continued.

      RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
   Imaging:
   CXR today (my read): RLL consolidation, consistent with infectious
   etiology. No volume overload.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 2728**] is an 84 year old nursing home resident
   with dementia, mental retardation, DM2, chronic indwelling foley
   initially admitted with urosepsis and possible small extraperitoneal
   bladder perforation on [**7-26**] who subsequently developed hypoxemic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Possibly secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and pneumonia which is evident on CXR. Patient
   sputum culture grew out GPC and GNR (speciation still pending). In
   addition per his floor team thought to have some pulmonary edema.  He
   rec'd some lasix and nebs without much effect and after being hypoxic
   to 86-90% on a non rebreather he began to tire and become more
   somnolent.  It is possible the patient some unwitnessed aspiration
   prior to intubation, versus during intubation.
   -continue to wean him off ventilator, now on PS.
   - get ABG on the new setting of PS 15/10 50%
   - touch base with ID regarding antibiotics, now on cipro, flagyl,
   cefepime, vanc and fluconazole broad coverage. Potentially can peel
   cipro off as overlapping with cefepime.
   -f/u sputum culture
   -continue GI decompression with NGT and rectal tube, tap water enemas
   .
   # Sepsis: meets the criteria. Patient has been spiking fevers and WBC
   has been rising for 3-4 days prior to transfer to ICU, and since
   intubation, patient has been requiring pressor to maintain MAP >65.
   Initially the hypotension was thought to be due to abdominal process in
   combination with higher PEEP and sedating medications as prior to
   intubation pt was normotensive and also on all of his home
   antihypertensives including HCTZ, metoprolol, isordil and norvasc.
   However, now that patient has been intubated for many hours and he
   continues to require pressors, and putting together his fevers and
   rising WBC, it is likely he is septic. In terms of the source of
   infection, GI source is most likely as patient has distended colon, it
   is possible that patient becomes transiently bacteremic through
   distended bowel loops.  GU source is also likely given positive UA and
   patient
s history of urosepsis during the earlier stay in ICU.
   Pulmonary infection could play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely
   occurred during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long
   intubation process. No skin breakdown to account for this sepsis. Other
   source of infection include [**Last Name (LF) 8869**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a CT sinus could be obtained
   to rule it out. TTE could be done to rule out endocarditis although
   patient has no new murmurs, and blood culture has been negative.
   - fluid boluses or levophed prn to maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-1**], ScvO2
   >70%
   - follow lactate
   - continue flagyl, cefepime, vanc and fluconazole broad coverage.
   Discontinue cipro. Cefepime and flagyl offer good GI coverage. HAP is
   covered with this regimen, atypical pneumonia is not covered but since
   patient has been in the hospital unlikely atypical pna. Pseudomonas is
   double covered.
   - f/u GI recs on
   - f/u blood culture, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - culutre if spikes
   - check vanc trough level tomorrow am
   .
   # Colonic dilation: no evidence of a mechanical obstruction per
   radiology, unclear if it is related to a stool ball in his sigmoid
   colon or patient has ileus and [**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome. Per surgery any
   surgical intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -tap water enemas every few hours, per GI
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -electrolyte repletion
   -follow lactate
   -continue flagyl, cipro, fluconazole, bactrim as per gen [**Doctor First Name 91**]; consider
   narrowing spectrum, follow up GI recs
   -f/u GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   .
   # Urosepsis: ID has been consulted.
   -f/u ID recs
   -continue bactrim for ecoli bacteremia and continue IV fluc for yeast
   in urine per ID
   .
   #Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   -maintain foley
   -call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   #Hypernatremia: resolved.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #Acute renal failure
 likely pre-renal in the setting of sepsis and
   hypotension
   - continue sepsis treatment

   Disposition : ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with dementia, mental retardation, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was initially admitted with urosepsis and a possible small extraperitoneal bladder perforation. The patient subsequently developed hypoxemic respiratory failure.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's sputum culture grew gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods (speciation pending). There is a possibility of pulmonary edema as well. The patient received lasix and nebs without much effect. He became hypoxic to 86-90% on a non-rebreather and more somnolent. It is possible that the patient had unwitnessed aspiration prior to intubation or during intubation. The plan is to continue weaning him off the ventilator and obtain an ABG on the new setting of PS 15/10 50%. Touch base with ID regarding antibiotics, currently on cipro, flagyl, cefepime, vanc, and fluconazole broad coverage. Potentially can peel cipro off as overlapping with cefepime. Follow up sputum culture.

2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis. He has been spiking fevers and WBC has been rising for 3-4 days prior to transfer to ICU. After intubation, the patient required a"

      RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
   Imaging:
   CXR today (my read): no acute cardiopulmonary process. No volume
   overload.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 2728**] is an 84 year old nursing home resident
   with dementia, mental retardation, DM2, chronic indwelling foley
   initially admitted with urosepsis and possible small extraperitoneal
   bladder perforation on [**7-26**] who subsequently developed hypoxemic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Possibly secondary to increased
   abdominal distention, atelectasis due to low lung volumes, and pleural
   effusion/consolidation.  In addition he likely has some aspiration and
   per his floor team thought to have some pulmonary edema.  He rec'd some
   lasix and nebs without much effect and after being hypoxic to 86-90% on
   a non rebreather he began to tire and become more somnolent.  It is
   possible the patient some unwitnessed aspiration prior to intubation,
   versus during intubation as his chest x ray has a possible retrocardiac
   opacity (although not much worse).
   -s/p intubation, will attempt to address primary cause which is likely
   due to colonic distension
   -attempt to wean ventilator settings -> Obtain ABG.  Can drop RR to
   14.  [**Month (only) 8**] consider increasing PEEP pending PaO2.
   -sputum cx given possible retrocardiac opacity
   -current abx are geared towards GI pathogens; monitor for clinical
   worsening
   .
   # Sepsis: meets the criteria. Patient has been spiking fevers and WBC
   has been rising for 3-4 days prior to transfer to ICU, and since
   intubation, patient has been requiring pressor to maintain MAP >65.
   Initially the hypotension was thought to be due to abdominal process in
   combination with higher PEEP and sedating medications as prior to
   intubation pt was normotensive and also on all of his home
   antihypertensives including HCTZ, metoprolol, isordil and norvasc.
   However, now that patient has been intubated for many hours and he
   continues to require pressors, and putting together his fevers and
   rising WBC, it is likely he is septic. In terms of the source of
   infection, GI source is most likely as patient has distended colon, it
   is possible that patient becomes transiently bacteremic through
   distended bowel loops.  GU source is also likely given positive UA and
   patient
s history of urosepsis during the earlier stay in ICU.
   Pulmonary source is less likely given clear CXR even after giving 3L NS
   yesterday (would expect infections to blossom with IVF repletion), but
   patient sputum culture grew out GPC and GNR (speciation still pending).
   No skin breakdown to account for this sepsis. Other source of infection
   include [**Last Name (LF) 8869**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a CT sinus could be obtained to rule it out. TTE
   could be done to rule out endocarditis although patient has no new
   murmurs, and blood culture has been negative.
   - fluid boluses or levophed prn to maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-1**], ScvO2
   >70%
   - follow lactate
   - continue cipro, flagyl, cefepime, vanc and fluconazole broad
   coverage. Cipro and flagyl offer good GI coverage. HAP is covered with
   this regimen, atypical pneumonia is not covered but since patient has
   been in the hospital unlikely atypical pna. Pseudomonas is double
   covered.
   - f/u blood culture, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - culutre if spikes
   .
   # Colonic dilation: no evidence of a mechanical obstruction per
   radiology, unclear if it is related to a stool ball in his sigmoid
   colon or patient has ileus and [**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome. Per surgery any
   surgical intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -tap water enemas every few hours, per GI
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -electrolyte repletion
   -follow lactate
   -continue flagyl, cipro, fluconazole, bactrim as per gen [**Doctor First Name 91**]; consider
   narrowing spectrum
   -f/u GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   .
   # Urosepsis: ID has been consulted.
   -f/u ID recs
   -continue bactrim for ecoli bacteremia and continue IV fluc for yeast
   in urine per ID
   .
   #Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   -maintain foley
   -call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   #Hypernatremia: stable.
   -in a.m. will calculate new free water deficit given fluid shifts and
   change in clinical status today
   .
   #Acute renal failure - currently 1.8 and has leveled off.  follow uop
   and bolus prn to maintain UOP > 30cc.
   -send urine lytes and urinalysis if creatinine worsens
   -trend
   -renally dose meds
   .
   #Hypothyroid - continue synthroid (now IV dose)

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male with h/o urosepsis and now re-admit to the [**Hospital Ward Name 29**] ICU with
   respiratory failure characterized by progressive hypoxemia all in the
   setting of evolution of significant abdominal distention in the setting
   of partial sigmoid obstruction.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient wtih move to PSV this morning with
   persistence of respiratory alkalosis.  He maintains elevated PEEP
   requirement but reasonable Ve requirement.
   -PSV 10/15
   -Will look to wean FIO2 to 0.4 prior to PEEP wean given significant
   abdominal compromise
   -Limitations to extubation do include mental status and ongoing active
   infection/sepsis which has shown some trend to better.
   -Cipro/Flagyl/Vanco/Cefepime all in place for what has evolved into a
   reasonably clear picture of pneumonia in the setting of likely
   aspiration.
   2)Partial Sigmoid Obstruction-
   -Continue wtih decompression
   -Continue wtih enemas
   -Follow exam
   -Appreciate surgery and GI input.
   -Will follow up CXR for any suggestion of free air
   3)Sepsis-Patient with recurrent and significant fevers persisting.  He
   has had some modest improvement in abdominal exam but with concerning
   and persistent high requirements for support of ventilation and
   oxygenation.  Patient did have worsening hypoxia overnight with higher
   PEEP requirement determined.  Pulmonary source is indeed most likely
   with hospital acquired pneumonia.
   -Patient with adequate volume given--CVP remains elevated in the
   setting of increaed PEEP.
   -Continue ABX
   -Move to wean pressors via maintanance of adequate volume

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of urosepsis, re-admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure characterized by progressive hypoxemia. He also has significant abdominal distention due to partial sigmoid obstruction. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving supplemental oxygen, and has an elevated PEEP requirement. His mental status is impaired, and he has ongoing active infection/sepsis.

The patient's labs show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and slightly low albumin levels. His arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory alkalosis. Imaging reveals evolution of right lower lobe infiltrate since admission.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure:
   - The patient will be monitored closely with ongoing respiratory support.
   - PSV mode will be maintained with a PEEP of 10-15, aiming to wean FiO2 to 0.4 before PEEP wean due to significant abdominal compromise.
   - Limitations to extubation include mental status and ongoing active infection/sepsis.

2. Partial Sigmoid Obstruction:
   - Decompression and enemas will continue to manage the obstruction.
   - Surgery and GI input will be followed up for further management.
   - A follow-up CXR will be performed to check for any suggestion of free air.

3. Sepsis:
   - The patient's recurrent fevers will be addressed with ongoing antibiotic therapy.

   consistent with infectious etiology. No volume overload. ETT visible in
   appropriate position.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 2728**] is an 84 year old nursing home resident
   with dementia, mental retardation, DM2, chronic indwelling foley
   initially admitted with urosepsis and possible small extraperitoneal
   bladder perforation on [**7-26**] who subsequently developed hypoxemic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Possibly secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and pneumonia which is evident on CXR. Patient
   sputum culture grew out GPC and GNR (speciation still pending). In
   addition per his floor team thought to have some pulmonary edema.  He
   rec'd some lasix and nebs without much effect and after being hypoxic
   to 86-90% on a non rebreather he began to tire and become more
   somnolent.  It is possible the patient some unwitnessed aspiration
   prior to intubation, versus during intubation.
   -continue to wean him off ventilator, now back on AC
   -continue broad coverage with cipro, flagyl, cefepime, vanc and
   fluconazole.
   - increase vanc to 1gm q12h
   -f/u sputum culture
   -continue GI decompression with NGT and rectal tube, tap water enemas
   -f/u ID recs on the course of antibiotics
   .
   # Sepsis: meets the criteria. Patient has been spiking fevers and WBC
   has been rising for 3-4 days prior to transfer to ICU, and since
   intubation, patient has been requiring pressor to maintain MAP >65.
   Initially the hypotension was thought to be due to abdominal process in
   combination with higher PEEP and sedating medications as prior to
   intubation pt was normotensive and also on all of his home
   antihypertensives including HCTZ, metoprolol, isordil and norvasc.
   However, now that patient has been intubated for many hours and he
   continues to require pressors, and putting together his fevers and
   rising WBC, it is likely he is septic. In terms of the source of
   infection, GI source is most likely as patient has distended colon, it
   is possible that patient becomes transiently bacteremic through
   distended bowel loops.  GU source is also likely given positive UA and
   patient
s history of urosepsis during the earlier stay in ICU.
   Pulmonary infection could play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely
   occurred during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long
   intubation process. No skin breakdown to account for this sepsis. Other
   source of infection include [**Last Name (LF) 8869**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a CT sinus could be obtained
   to rule it out. TTE could be done to rule out endocarditis although
   patient has no new murmurs, and blood culture has been negative.
   - pt is off pressor now
   - continue cipro flagyl, cefepime, vanc and fluconazole broad coverage.
   Cefepime, cipro and flagyl offer good GI coverage. HAP is covered with
   this regimen, atypical pneumonia is not covered but since patient has
   been in the hospital unlikely atypical pna. Pseudomonas is double
   covered.
   - f/u CT abd/pelvis
   - per GI, get daily KUB for 3 days, but since getting CT abd/pelvis,
   will defer KUB today
   - f/u blood culture, urine culture and sputum culture
   - fluid boluses prn to maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-1**], ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   - f/u GI and ID recs recs
   - tylenol for fever
   - culutre if spikes
   .
   # Colonic dilation: no evidence of a mechanical obstruction per
   radiology, unclear if it is related to a stool ball in his sigmoid
   colon or patient has ileus and [**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome. Per surgery any
   surgical intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -tap water enemas every few hours, per GI
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   - f/u CT abd/pelvis
   - per GI, get daily KUB for 3 days, but since getting CT abd/pelvis,

   -continue flagyl, cipro, fluconazole, bactrim as per gen [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   -f/u GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs

   # Anemia: hct has been trending down during the past several days.
   Baseline hct 37-39. no evidence of bleeding. Could be contributed by
   dilutional effect and anemia of inflammation (anemia of chronic
   disease)
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse if hct <21

   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.

   # Neuro status: this morning not moving right LE. On morning rounds,not
   alert enough to further assess neuro status, but does grimace to pain
   in all 4 extremities
   - re-assess neuro status when pt is more alert
   .
   #Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   -maintain foley
   -call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   #Hypernatremia: resolved.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #Acute renal failure

   air.
   - CXR today (my read): RLL consolidation stable compared to yesterday,
   consistent with infectious etiology. No volume overload. ETT visible in
   appropriate position.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 2728**] is an 84 year old nursing home resident
   with dementia, mental retardation, DM2, chronic indwelling foley
   initially admitted with urosepsis and possible small extraperitoneal
   bladder perforation on [**7-26**] who subsequently developed hypoxemic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Possibly secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and pneumonia which is evident on CXR. Patient
   sputum culture grew out GPC and GNR (speciation still pending). In
   addition per his floor team thought to have some pulmonary edema.  He
   rec'd some lasix and nebs without much effect and after being hypoxic
   to 86-90% on a non rebreather he began to tire and become more
   somnolent.  It is possible the patient some unwitnessed aspiration
   prior to intubation, versus during intubation.
   -continue to wean him off ventilator, now on PS.
   -continue cipro, flagyl, cefepime, vanc and fluconazole broad coverage.
   -f/u GI recs
   -f/u sputum culture
   -continue GI decompression with NGT and rectal tube, tap water enemas
   .
   # Sepsis: meets the criteria. Patient has been spiking fevers and WBC
   has been rising for 3-4 days prior to transfer to ICU, and since
   intubation, patient has been requiring pressor to maintain MAP >65.
   Initially the hypotension was thought to be due to abdominal process in
   combination with higher PEEP and sedating medications as prior to
   intubation pt was normotensive and also on all of his home
   antihypertensives including HCTZ, metoprolol, isordil and norvasc.
   However, now that patient has been intubated for many hours and he
   continues to require pressors, and putting together his fevers and
   rising WBC, it is likely he is septic. In terms of the source of
   infection, GI source is most likely as patient has distended colon, it
   is possible that patient becomes transiently bacteremic through
   distended bowel loops.  GU source is also likely given positive UA and
   patient
s history of urosepsis during the earlier stay in ICU.
   Pulmonary infection could play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely
   occurred during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long
   intubation process. No skin breakdown to account for this sepsis. Other
   source of infection include [**Last Name (LF) 8869**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a CT sinus could be obtained
   to rule it out. TTE could be done to rule out endocarditis although
   patient has no new murmurs, and blood culture has been negative.
   - fluid boluses or levophed prn to maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-1**], ScvO2
   >70%
   - follow lactate
   - continue cipro flagyl, cefepime, vanc and fluconazole broad coverage.
   Cefepime, cipro and flagyl offer good GI coverage. HAP is covered with
   this regimen, atypical pneumonia is not covered but since patient has
   been in the hospital unlikely atypical pna. Pseudomonas is double
   covered.
   - per GI, get daily KUB for 3 days
   - f/u GI recs
   - f/u blood culture, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - culutre if spikes
   .
   # Colonic dilation: no evidence of a mechanical obstruction per
   radiology, unclear if it is related to a stool ball in his sigmoid
   colon or patient has ileus and [**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome. Per surgery any
   surgical intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -tap water enemas every few hours, per GI
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -electrolyte repletion
   -follow lactate
   -continue flagyl, cipro, fluconazole, bactrim as per gen [**Doctor First Name 91**]; consider
   narrowing spectrum, follow up GI recs
   -f/u GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs

   # Anemia: hct has been trending down during the past several days.
   Baseline hct 37-39. no evidence of bleeding. Could be contributed by
   dilutional effect.
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse if hct <25
   .
   # Urosepsis: ID has been consulted.
   -f/u ID recs
   -continue bactrim for ecoli bacteremia and continue IV fluc for yeast
   in urine per ID
   .
   #Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   -maintain foley
   -call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   #Hypernatremia: resolved.
   -continue to monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with a history of dementia, mental retardation, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was initially admitted with urosepsis and a possible small extraperitoneal bladder perforation. The patient subsequently developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is believed to be secondary to increased abdominal distention and pneumonia. The patient's sputum culture grew out Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative rods (speciation pending).

The patient's current assessment includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, sepsis, colonic dilation, anemia, diabetes mellitus, anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation (resolved), hypernatremia (resolved), acute renal failure (resolved), hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, and osteoporosis.

The patient's treatment plan includes weaning off the ventilator, continuing broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with ciprofloxacin, flagyl, cefepime, vancomycin, and fluconazole. The patient's gastrointestinal decompression will continue with a nasogastric tube and rectal tube, and tap water enemas will be administered. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures will be followed up. The patient will also receive fluid boluses as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65, central venous pressure (CVP) >9, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) >70%. Ty"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 2728**] is an 84 year old nursing home resident
   with dementia, mental retardation, DM2, chronic indwelling foley
   initially admitted with urosepsis and possible small extraperitoneal
   bladder perforation on [**7-26**] who subsequently developed hypoxemic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Possibly secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and pneumonia which is evident on CXR. Patient
   sputum culture grew out GPC and GNR (speciation still pending). In
   addition per his floor team thought to have some pulmonary edema.  He
   rec'd some lasix and nebs without much effect and after being hypoxic
   to 86-90% on a non rebreather he began to tire and become more
   somnolent.  It is possible the patient some unwitnessed aspiration
   prior to intubation, versus during intubation.
   -continue to wean him off ventilator, now on PS.
   -continue cipro, flagyl, cefepime, vanc and fluconazole broad coverage.
   -f/u GI recs
   -f/u sputum culture
   -continue GI decompression with NGT and rectal tube, tap water enemas
   .
   # Sepsis: meets the criteria. Patient has been spiking fevers and WBC
   has been rising for 3-4 days prior to transfer to ICU, and since
   intubation, patient has been requiring pressor to maintain MAP >65.
   Initially the hypotension was thought to be due to abdominal process in
   combination with higher PEEP and sedating medications as prior to
   intubation pt was normotensive and also on all of his home
   antihypertensives including HCTZ, metoprolol, isordil and norvasc.
   However, now that patient has been intubated for many hours and he
   continues to require pressors, and putting together his fevers and
   rising WBC, it is likely he is septic. In terms of the source of

- The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, sepsis, colonic dilation, anemia, diabetes management, urosepsis, anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, osteoporosis, and uncertain goals of care (DNR vs. DNI).
- The patient's medical team is working to wean him off the ventilator, continue broad-spectrum antibiotics, follow gastrointestinal recommendations, and monitor for sepsis and other complications.
- The patient's family needs to be updated on the code status and potential surgical interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may require prolonged ventilation support.
2. Sepsis: The patient is already showing signs of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Colonic ischemia or perforation: The patient's colonic dilation could be due to a mechanical obstruction or ischemic changes leading to perforation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 2728**] is an 84 year old nursing home resident
   with dementia, mental retardation, DM2, chronic indwelling foley
   initially admitted with urosepsis and possible small extraperitoneal
   bladder perforation on [**7-26**] who subsequently developed hypoxemic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis which is
   evident on CXR. Patient sputum culture grew out GPC and GNR, culture
   revealed oropharyngeal flora and yeast. It is possible the patient some
   unwitnessed aspiration prior to intubation, versus during intubation.
   No evidence of volume overload.
   -continue to wean him off ventilator, now back on AC
   -continue broad coverage with cipro, cefepime, vanc for 8 days (day 1:
   Day 1 = [**8-3**]) , flagyl until colonic distention significantly
   decreases, and fluconazole for 14 days (day 1: [**8-2**]) .
   - check vanc trough level tomorrow
   -continue GI decompression with NGT and rectal tube, tap water enemas.
   Colonic distention appears to be decreasing on imaging and on physical
   exam.
   -f/u ID recs
   .
   # Sepsis: meets the criteria. Patient has been spiking fevers and WBC
   has been rising for 3-4 days prior to transfer to ICU, and since
   intubation, patient has been requiring pressor to maintain MAP >65.
   Initially the hypotension was thought to be due to abdominal process in
   combination with higher PEEP and sedating medications as prior to
   intubation pt was normotensive and also on all of his home
   antihypertensives including HCTZ, metoprolol, isordil and norvasc.
   However, now that patient has been intubated for many hours and he
   continues to require pressors, and putting together his fevers and
   rising WBC, it is likely he is septic. In terms of the source of
   infection, GI source is most likely as patient has distended colon, it
   is possible that patient becomes transiently bacteremic through
   distended bowel loops.  GU source is also likely given positive UA and
   patient
s history of urosepsis during the earlier stay in ICU.
   Pulmonary infection could play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely
   occurred during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long
   intubation process. No skin breakdown to account for this sepsis. Other
   source of infection include [**Last Name (LF) 8869**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a CT sinus could be obtained
   to rule it out. TTE could be done to rule out endocarditis although
   patient has no new murmurs, and blood culture has been negative.
   - pt is off pressor now
   - continue broad coverage with cipro, cefepime, vanc for 8 days (day 1:
   Day 1 = [**8-3**]) , flagyl until colonic distention significantly
   decreases, and fluconazole for 14 days (day 1: [**8-2**]) .
   - f/u blood culture
   - fluid boluses prn to maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-1**], ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   - f/u GI and ID recs recs
   - tylenol for fever
   - culutre if spikes
   .
   # Colonic dilation: improving on imaging and on clinical exam. no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, unclear if it is
   related to a stool ball in his sigmoid colon or patient has ileus and
   [**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome. Per surgery any surgical intervention will likely
   involve a total colectomy. Per GI sigmoidoscopy will not be able to
   relieve an obstruction related to stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -tap water enemas every few hours, per GI
   - continue broad coverage with cipro, cefepime, vanc for 8 days (day 1:
   Day 1 = [**8-3**]) , flagyl until colonic distention significantly
   decreases, and fluconazole for 14 days (day 1: [**8-2**]) .

   # Anemia: hct has been trending down during the past several days.

   dilutional effect and anemia of inflammation (anemia of chronic
   disease)
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse if hct <21

   Disposition : ICU
","The patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with dementia, mental retardation, DM2, chronic indwelling foley initially admitted with urosepsis and possible small extraperitoneal bladder perforation on [**7-26**] who subsequently developed hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated for many hours and continues to require pressors, and putting together his fevers and rising WBC, it is likely he is septic. The source of infection is most likely a gastrointestinal source, possibly due to a distended colon and transient bacteremia through distended bowel loops. Other potential sources of infection include a urinary tract infection and pulmonary infection.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed, including hypoxemic respiratory failure, sepsis, colonic dilation, anemia, diabetes mellitus, neuro status changes, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, osteoporosis, and anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation.

The patient's current treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin) for 8 days, flagyl until colonic distention significantly decreases, and fluconazole for 14 days. The patient also requires continued GI decompression with NGT and rectal tube, fluid boluses to maintain MAP >65, CVP >9, ScvO2 >70%, and close monitoring of lactate levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 2728**] is an 84 year old nursing home resident
   with dementia, mental retardation, DM2, chronic indwelling foley
   initially admitted with urosepsis and possible small extraperitoneal
   bladder perforation on [**7-26**] who subsequently developed hypoxemic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis which is
   evident on CXR. Patient sputum culture grew out GPC and GNR, culture
   revealed oropharyngeal flora and yeast. It is possible the patient some
   unwitnessed aspiration prior to intubation, versus during intubation.
   No evidence of volume overload.
   -change to pressure support as compliance is about 50 (better as
   colonic distension is better), can decrease PEEP, get ABG to monitor
   respiratory status after changing settings
   -continue broad coverage with cefepime, vanc for 8 days (day 1: Day 1 =
   [**8-3**]) , per ID d/c cipro,  can d/c flagyl as c.diff neg x 3, and
   continue fluconazole for 14 days (day 1: [**8-2**]) .
   - check vanc trough level tomorrow
   -continue GI decompression with NGT and rectal tube, tap water enemas.
   Colonic distention appears to be decreasing on imaging and on physical
   exam.
   -f/u ID recs
   .
   # Sepsis: meets the criteria. Patient has been spiking fevers and WBC
   has been rising for 3-4 days prior to transfer to ICU, and since
   intubation, patient has been requiring pressor to maintain MAP >65.
   Initially the hypotension was thought to be due to abdominal process in
   combination with higher PEEP and sedating medications as prior to
   intubation pt was normotensive and also on all of his home
   antihypertensives including HCTZ, metoprolol, isordil and norvasc.
   However, now that patient has been intubated for many hours and he
   continues to require pressors, and putting together his fevers and
   rising WBC, it is likely he is septic. In terms of the source of
   infection, GI source is most likely as patient has distended colon, it
   is possible that patient becomes transiently bacteremic through
   distended bowel loops.  GU source is also likely given positive UA and
   patient
s history of urosepsis during the earlier stay in ICU.
   Pulmonary infection could play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely
   occurred during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long
   intubation process. No skin breakdown to account for this sepsis. Other
   source of infection include [**Last Name (LF) 8869**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a CT sinus could be obtained
   to rule it out. TTE could be done to rule out endocarditis although
   patient has no new murmurs, and blood culture has been negative.
   - pt is off pressor now
   - continue broad coverage with cefepime, vanc for 8 days (day 1: Day 1
   = [**8-3**]) , per ID d/c cipro,  can d/c flagyl as c.diff neg x 3, and
   continue fluconazole for 14 days (day 1: [**8-2**]) .

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with dementia, mental retardation, and diabetes mellitus type 2.
- The patient was initially admitted with urosepsis and a possible small extraperitoneal bladder perforation.
- Subsequently, the patient developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to increased abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.
- The patient's sepsis is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) for 8 days.
- The patient's colonic dilation is improving, but it is unclear if it is related to a stool ball in the sigmoid colon or patient has ileus and [Last Name (un)] syndrome.
- The patient's anemia is likely due to dilutional effect and anemia of inflammation.
- The patient's neuro status is not alert enough to further assess, but grimaced to pain in all four extremities.
- Other medical conditions include hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, osteoporosis, and goals of care need clarification.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, which includes spiking fevers, rising WBC, and the need for pressor to maintain MAP >65. The source of infection is likely from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, sepsis, and abdominal distention. He was admitted with urosepsis and now presents with significant abdominal distention and fecal impaction. He also has a likely component of chest wall restriction and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure with a trend down in WBC count, suggesting a quieting of inflammation and pneumonitis following self-extubation and re-intubation. Management includes careful management of upper and central airway patency at the time of attempted extubation, continuation of Vanco/Cefepime for 8 days, and weaning of PEEP as tolerated.

2. Abdominal Distention secondary to Colonic Obstruction: The patient's abdominal distention has improved based on the CT scan. Management includes continued use of rectal tube and lactulose to clear colonic issues.

3. Urosepsis: The patient will maintain Fluc for a 14-day course, and other antibiotics will be continued as per the plan.

Other conditions mentioned include constipation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS).

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 84 year old nursing home resident with dementia,
   mental retardation, initially admitted with urosepsis and with
   development of hypoxemic respiratory failure, HAP, fecal impaction.
   .
   # Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis from
   extubation reintubation.  Patient sputum culture grew out GPC and GNR,
   culture revealed oropharyngeal flora and yeast.
   - continue to see WBC trending down.  Sputums continue to be suctioned.
   - changed to PS 14/12, PEEP was weaned down
   -continue broad coverage with cefepime, vanc (day 4 of 8 day course)
   (day 1: Day 1 = [**8-3**])
   - per ID d/c cipro,  can d/c flagyl as c.diff neg x 3
   - continue GI decompression with NGT and rectal tube, tap water enemas.
   Colonic distention appears to be decreasing on imaging and on physical
   exam.
   -f/u ID recs
   .
   # sepsis: likely Gu source given positive UA, and patient
s history of
   urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is also likely as patient
   has distended colon, it is possible that patient becomes transiently
   bacteremic through distended bowel loops.  Pulmonary infection could
   play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely occurred during
   intubation as a result of aspiration in the long intubation process.
   TTE could be done to rule out endocarditis although patient has no new
   murmurs, and blood culture has been negative.
   - continue fluconazole (day 6 of 14 day course) (day 1: [**8-2**])
   - per ID d/c cipro,  can d/c flagyl as c.diff neg x 3
   - f/u blood culture
   - fluid boluses prn to maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-1**], ScvO2 >70%
   - follow lactate
   - fu ID recs recs
   - tylenol for fever
   - culutre if spikes
   .
   # Colonic dilation: improving on imaging and on clinical exam. no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, likely related to a
   stool ball in his sigmoid colon vs. ileus. Per surgery any surgical
   intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -d/c enemas per GI
   - continue lactulose
   -continue broad coverage with cefepime, vanc for 8 days (day 1: Day 1 =
   [**8-3**])
   -GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] have signed off
   -electrolyte repletion
   -follow lactate
   .
   # Anemia: hct has been trending down during the past several days.
   Baseline hct 37-39. no evidence of bleeding. Could be contributed by
   dilutional effect and anemia of inflammation (anemia of chronic
   disease)
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   # Neuro status: On morning rounds,not alert enough to further assess
   neuro status, but did grimace to pain in all 4 extremities.
   - re-assess neuro status when pt is more alert
   .
   #Hypothyroid - continue synthroid (now IV dose)
   .
   #h/o seizure disorder - continue dilantin, phenobarbital (IV)
   .
   #osteoporosis - continue calcium and vitamin d
   .
   #Goals of care: Confirmed with HCP [**Name (NI) 792**] [**Name (NI) 8911**], pt is DNR. If
   medically optimized and pt is extubated, he would be DNI at that time,
   and comfort measures only if not tolerating after extubation
   .
   #Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   -maintain foley
   -call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   #Hypernatremia: resolved.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #Acute renal failure
 resolved.  likely pre-renal in the setting of
   sepsis and hypotension
   - continue sepsis treatment
   - maintain BP with IVF
   -send urine lytes and urinalysis if creatinine worsens
   -renally dose meds

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 84 year old nursing home resident with dementia,
   mental retardation, initially admitted with urosepsis and with
   development of hypoxemic respiratory failure, HAP, fecal impaction.
   .
   # Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis from
   extubation reintubation.  Continues to have secretions which will be a
   barrier to extubation.  Patient sputum culture grew out GPC and GNR,
   culture revealed oropharyngeal flora and yeast.
   - continue to see WBC trending down.
   - suction secretions
   - changed to PS 14/10, PEEP was weaned down
   - continue broad coverage with cefepime, vanc (day 5 of 8 day course)
   (day 1: Day 1 = [**8-3**]).  Check vanc level.
   - per ID d/c cipro,  can d/c flagyl as c.diff neg x 3
   - continue GI decompression with NGT and rectal tube.
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # sepsis: likely Gu source given positive UA, and patient
s history of
   urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is also likely as patient
   has distended colon, it is possible that patient becomes transiently
   bacteremic through distended bowel loops.  Pulmonary infection could
   play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely occurred during
   intubation as a result of aspiration in the long intubation process.
   - WBC continuing to trend down
   - continue fluconazole (day 6 of 14 day course) (day 1: [**8-2**])
   - per ID d/c cipro,  can d/c flagyl as c.diff neg x 3
   - f/u blood culture
   - fluid boluses prn to maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-1**], ScvO2 >70%
   - fu ID recs recs
   - tylenol for fever
   - culutre if spikes
   .
   # Colonic dilation: improving on imaging, stable on clinical exam. no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, likely related to a
   stool ball in his sigmoid colon vs. ileus. Per surgery any surgical
   intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -d/c enemas per GI
   - continue lactulose
   -continue broad coverage with cefepime, vanc for 8 days (day 1: Day 1 =
   [**8-3**])
   -GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] have signed off
   -electrolyte repletion
   -follow lactate
   .
   # Anemia: hct has been trending down during the past several days.
   Baseline hct 37-39. no evidence of bleeding. Could be contributed by
   dilutional effect and anemia of inflammation (anemia of chronic
   disease)
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   # Neuro status: On morning rounds,not alert enough to further assess
   neuro status, but did grimace to pain in all 4 extremities.
   - re-assess neuro status when pt is more alert
   .
   #Hypothyroid - continue synthroid (now IV dose)
   .
   #h/o seizure disorder - continue dilantin, phenobarbital (IV).
   - check dilantin level
   .
   #osteoporosis - continue calcium and vitamin d
   .
   #Goals of care: Confirmed with HCP [**Name (NI) 792**] [**Name (NI) 8911**], pt is DNR. If
   medically optimized and pt is extubated, he would be DNI at that time,
   and comfort measures only if not tolerating after extubation.  Should
   he self extubate, will re-intubate.
   .
   #Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   -maintain foley
   -call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   #Hypernatremia: resolved.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #Acute renal failure
 resolved.  likely pre-renal in the setting of
   sepsis and hypotension
   - continue sepsis treatment
   - maintain BP with IVF
   -send urine lytes and urinalysis if creatinine worsens
   -renally dose meds

   Disposition : ICU
","The patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with a history of mental retardation and dementia, initially admitted with urosepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has developed several medical complications.

1. Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure: The patient continues to have secretions, which will be a barrier to extubation. The sputum culture grew out GPC and GNR, and the culture revealed oropharyngeal flora and yeast. The patient's respiratory support is currently on CPAP/PSV mode, with a set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 14 cmH2O, RR set at 12, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and an ABG showing pH 7.41, PaCO2 43/28, HCO3 113/23, PaO2/FiO2 226, Ve 9.4 L/min, and SpO2 97%.

2. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis with a possible GU source given the positive urine analysis and the patient's history of urosepsis during a prior ICU stay. The GI tract is also a potential source, considering the patient's distended colon. Pulmonary infection could play a role as well, but it is believed to have occurred during intubation due to aspiration in the long int"

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of mental retardation. He was initially admitted with urosepsis and now presents with persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has capacity to follow commands and there has been a trend down in WBC count and some improvement in CXR opacity. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1) Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is limited by secretion volume and mental status. Efforts are being made to reduce pulmonary secretion volume before attempting extubation.

2) Sepsis: The patient is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and fluconazole. There has been an improvement in blood pressure this morning.

3) Fecal Impaction: The patient has persistent exam findings but improved on CT scan.

Overall, the patient's current condition is sepsis without organ dysfunction and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS). ICU care includes nutrition via TPN with lipids, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 84 year old nursing home resident with dementia,
   mental retardation, initially admitted with urosepsis and with
   development of hypoxemic respiratory failure, HAP, fecal impaction.
   .
   # Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis from
   extubation reintubation.  Continues to have secretions which will be a
   barrier to extubation.
   - continue to see WBC trending down.
   - suction secretions, which are less
   - changed to PS 14/10, PEEP weaned down to 8.  Will calculate RSBI and
   try SBT.
   - continue broad coverage with cefepime, vanc (day 6 of 8 day course)
   (day 1: Day 1 = [**8-3**]).  Vanc changed to q24h bc vanc level of 29.
   Check vanc level.
   - per ID d/c cipro,  can d/c flagyl as c.diff neg x 3
   - continue GI decompression with NGT and rectal tube.
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # sepsis: likely Gu source given positive UA, and patient
s history of
   urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is also likely as patient
   has distended colon, it is possible that patient becomes transiently
   bacteremic through distended bowel loops.  Pulmonary infection could
   play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely occurred during
   intubation as a result of aspiration in the long intubation process.
   - WBC continuing to trend down
   - continue fluconazole (day 6 of 14 day course) (day 1: [**8-2**])
   - per ID d/c cipro,  can d/c flagyl as c.diff neg x 3
   - f/u blood culture
   - fluid boluses prn to maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-1**], ScvO2 >70%
   - fu ID recs recs
   - tylenol for fever
   - culutre if spikes
   .
   # Colonic dilation: improving on imaging, stable on clinical exam. no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, likely related to a
   stool ball in his sigmoid colon vs. ileus. Per surgery any surgical
   intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -d/c enemas per GI
   - continue lactulose
   -continue broad coverage with cefepime, vanc for 8 days (day 1: Day 1 =
   [**8-3**])
   -GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] have signed off
   -electrolyte repletion
   -follow lactate
   .
   # Anemia: hct has been trending down during the past several days.
   Baseline hct 37-39. no evidence of bleeding. Could be contributed by
   dilutional effect and anemia of inflammation (anemia of chronic
   disease)
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   # Neuro status: On morning rounds,not alert enough to further assess
   neuro status, but did grimace to pain in all 4 extremities.
   - re-assess neuro status when pt is more alert
   .
   #Hypothyroid - continue synthroid (now IV dose)
   .
   #h/o seizure disorder - continue dilantin, phenobarbital (IV).
   - check dilantin level
   .
   #osteoporosis - continue calcium and vitamin d
   .
   #Goals of care: Confirmed with HCP [**Name (NI) 792**] [**Name (NI) 8911**], pt is DNR. If
   medically optimized and pt is extubated, he would be DNI at that time,
   and comfort measures only if not tolerating after extubation.  Should
   he self extubate, will re-intubate.
   .
   #Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   -maintain foley
   -call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   #Hypernatremia: resolved.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #Acute renal failure
 resolved.  likely pre-renal in the setting of
   sepsis and hypotension
   - continue sepsis treatment
   - maintain BP with IVF
   -send urine lytes and urinalysis if creatinine worsens
   -renally dose meds

   Disposition : ICU
","The patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with dementia and mental retardation, admitted initially with urosepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure, HAP, and fecal impaction. The patient continues to have secretions, which is a barrier to extubation. The vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/55 to 212/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 404 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP >10. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 226.

The physical examination reveals diffuse wheezes and ronchi bilaterally, warm and well-perfused extremities with 1+ lower extremity edema, and no signs of blood stagnation or fluid wave. The neurologic examination shows movement of both upper extremities but not lower extremities on commands.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 18"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 84 year old nursing home resident with dementia,
   mental retardation, initially admitted with urosepsis and with
   development of hypoxemic respiratory failure, HAP, fecal impaction.
   .
   # Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis from
   extubation reintubation.  Continues to have secretions which will be a
   barrier to extubation.
   - continue to see WBC trending down.
   - suction secretions
   - changed to PS 14/10, PEEP was weaned down
   - continue broad coverage with cefepime, vanc (day 6 of 8 day course)
   (day 1: Day 1 = [**8-3**]).  Check vanc level.
   - per ID d/c cipro,  can d/c flagyl as c.diff neg x 3
   - continue GI decompression with NGT and rectal tube.
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # sepsis: likely Gu source given positive UA, and patient
s history of
   urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is also likely as patient
   has distended colon, it is possible that patient becomes transiently
   bacteremic through distended bowel loops.  Pulmonary infection could
   play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely occurred during
   intubation as a result of aspiration in the long intubation process.
   - WBC continuing to trend down
   - continue fluconazole (day 6 of 14 day course) (day 1: [**8-2**])
   - per ID d/c cipro,  can d/c flagyl as c.diff neg x 3
   - f/u blood culture
   - fluid boluses prn to maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-1**], ScvO2 >70%
   - fu ID recs recs
   - tylenol for fever
   - culutre if spikes
   .
   # Colonic dilation: improving on imaging, stable on clinical exam. no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, likely related to a
   stool ball in his sigmoid colon vs. ileus. Per surgery any surgical
   intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -d/c enemas per GI
   - continue lactulose
   -continue broad coverage with cefepime, vanc for 8 days (day 1: Day 1 =
   [**8-3**])
   -GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] have signed off
   -electrolyte repletion
   -follow lactate
   .
   # Anemia: hct has been trending down during the past several days.
   Baseline hct 37-39. no evidence of bleeding. Could be contributed by
   dilutional effect and anemia of inflammation (anemia of chronic
   disease)
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   # Neuro status: On morning rounds,not alert enough to further assess
   neuro status, but did grimace to pain in all 4 extremities.
   - re-assess neuro status when pt is more alert
   .
   #Hypothyroid - continue synthroid (now IV dose)
   .
   #h/o seizure disorder - continue dilantin, phenobarbital (IV).
   - check dilantin level
   .
   #osteoporosis - continue calcium and vitamin d
   .
   #Goals of care: Confirmed with HCP [**Name (NI) 792**] [**Name (NI) 8911**], pt is DNR. If
   medically optimized and pt is extubated, he would be DNI at that time,
   and comfort measures only if not tolerating after extubation.  Should
   he self extubate, will re-intubate.
   .
   #Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   -maintain foley
   -call urology if foley requires flushing

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with dementia and mental retardation who was initially admitted with urosepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure: The patient continues to have secretions, which will be a barrier to extubation. The WBC count is trending down, indicating improvement. Suctioning of secretions, PS/PEEP adjustment, and continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics are ongoing.

2. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing a gastrointestinal source of infection, given the positive urine analysis and previous history of urosepsis during an ICU stay. Pulmonary infection could also play a role. The patient's WBC count is continuing to trend down, indicating improvement. Fluconazole and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued.

3. Colonic dilation: The patient's colonic dilation is improving on imaging and stable on clinical exam. No evidence of mechanical obstruction is seen on radiology. This is likely related to a stool ball in the sigmoid colon or ileus. Conservative management with NGT and rectal tube decompression, lactulose, and broad-spectrum antibiotics is being pursued.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with mental retardation, who has been admitted to the ICU with significant and persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's main barriers to extubation are mental status changes, weakness, and high volume secretions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), blood pressure ranging from 112/42-170/108 mmHg, heart rate between 83-95 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including Ciprofloxacin, Metronidazole, Cefepime, and Vancomycin, as well as antifungal medication Fluconazole. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Imaging shows no significant abnormalities.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure, for which he will continue to be weaned from PSV mode ventilation and monitored for extubation once secretions are minimized and abdominal distention is addressed. The patient also has abdominal distention and a history of sepsis, which has improved with antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure,"

   barrier to extubation.
   - continue to see WBC trending down.
   - suction secretions, which are less
   - changed to PS 14/8, PEEP weaned down to 8.  Will calculate RSBI again
   today and try SBT.
   - continue broad coverage with cefepime, vanc (day 6 of 8 day course)

   # sepsis: likely Gu source given positive UA, and patient
s history of
   urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is also likely as patient
   has distended colon, it is possible that patient becomes transiently
   bacteremic through distended bowel loops.  Pulmonary infection could
   play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely occurred during
   intubation as a result of aspiration in the long intubation process.
   - WBC continuing to trend down

   Disposition : ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with dementia and mental retardation. The patient was initially admitted with urosepsis and developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and fecal impaction.

The patient is currently intubated due to acute respiratory failure likely secondary to increased abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis from extubation reintubation. The patient continues to have secretions, which will be a barrier to extubation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 110/67 to 159/104 mmHg, heart rate between 81 and 97 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 16 and 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.0 x 10^9/L, elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, low platelet count of 105 x 10^9/L, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 112 mEq/L.

The patient's medical complications include hypoxemic acute respiratory failure, sepsis likely originating from the gastrointestinal tract, colonic dilation, anemia, diabetes mellitus, neuro status alteration, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, osteoporosis, anterior extraperitoneal bladder"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 84 year old nursing home resident with dementia,
   mental retardation, initially admitted with urosepsis and with
   development of hypoxemic respiratory failure, HAP, fecal impaction.
   .
   # Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis from
   extubation reintubation.  Continues to have secretions which will be a
   barrier to extubation.
   - continue to see WBC trending down.
   - suction secretions, which are less
   - changed to PS 14/8, PEEP weaned down to 8.  Will calculate RSBI again
   today and try SBT.
   - continue broad coverage with cefepime, vanc (day 6 of 8 day course)
   (day 1: Day 1 = [**8-3**]).  Vanc changed to q24h bc vanc level of 29.
   Check vanc level.
   - per ID d/c cipro,  can d/c flagyl as c.diff neg x 3
   - continue GI decompression with NGT and rectal tube.
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # sepsis: likely Gu source given positive UA, and patient
s history of
   urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is also likely as patient
   has distended colon, it is possible that patient becomes transiently
   bacteremic through distended bowel loops.  Pulmonary infection could
   play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely occurred during
   intubation as a result of aspiration in the long intubation process.
   - WBC continuing to trend down
   - continue fluconazole (day 6 of 14 day course) (day 1: [**8-2**])
   - per ID d/c cipro,  can d/c flagyl as c.diff neg x 3
   - f/u blood culture
   - fluid boluses prn to maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-1**], ScvO2 >70%
   - fu ID recs recs
   - tylenol for fever
   - culutre if spikes
   .
   # Colonic dilation: improving on imaging, stable on clinical exam. no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, likely related to a
   stool ball in his sigmoid colon vs. ileus. Per surgery any surgical
   intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -d/c enemas per GI
   - continue lactulose
   -continue broad coverage with cefepime, vanc for 8 days (day 1: Day 1 =
   [**8-3**])
   -GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] have signed off
   -electrolyte repletion
   -follow lactate
   .
   # Anemia: hct has been trending down during the past several days.
   Baseline hct 37-39. no evidence of bleeding. Could be contributed by
   dilutional effect and anemia of inflammation (anemia of chronic
   disease)
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   # Neuro status: On morning rounds,not alert enough to further assess
   neuro status, but did grimace to pain in all 4 extremities.
   - re-assess neuro status when pt is more alert
   .
   #Hypothyroid - continue synthroid (now IV dose)
   .
   #h/o seizure disorder - continue dilantin, phenobarbital (IV).
   - check dilantin level

   #osteoporosis - continue calcium and vitamin d
   .
   #Goals of care: Confirmed with HCP [**Name (NI) 792**] [**Name (NI) 8911**], pt is DNR. If
   medically optimized and pt is extubated, he would be DNI at that time,
   and comfort measures only if not tolerating after extubation.  Should
   he self extubate, will re-intubate.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with dementia and mental retardation who was initially admitted with urosepsis and developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), and fecal impaction. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure: The patient continues to have secretions, which will be a barrier to extubation. The respiratory support is ongoing with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP set at 8 cmH2O. The RSBI is 121, indicating a need for further assessment and potential spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).

2. Sepsis: The patient has a likely gastrointestinal (GI) source of infection given the positive urine analysis (UA) and previous history of urosepsis during an ICU stay. Other potential sources include pulmonary infection due to aspiration during intubation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) are being continued for 8 days, and fluconazole is given for fungal coverage. Cultures and fluid boluses are also being monitored.

3. Colonic dilation: The patient's colonic dilation is improving on imaging but remains stable on clinical exam. There is no evidence of mechanical obstruction, and it is likely related to a stool ball in the sigmoid colon or ileus. Surgical intervention, such as total colectomy, may be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an intubated, sedated male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of urosepsis, impaction, and pneumonia (PNA). The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/67 to 159/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates fluid balance with a total input of 2537 mL and output of 1945 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 592 mL. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, analgesics, and sedatives. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, increased creatinine, and abnormal arterial blood gas values. Radiology images show volume loss on the left side and hazy right base. The patient is being provided with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has multiple lines inserted for medical management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen due to the presence of pneumonia and the need for ventilator support.
2. Infection: Urosepsis is present, indicating a systemic infection that may require further treatment and monitoring.
3. Impaction: The patient's impaction needs to be addressed to prevent further complications related to bowel obstruction."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They have been intubated, sedated, and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/47 to 158/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 1,813 mL in and 2,430 mL out, resulting in a negative balance of 617 mL. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and dilantin.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory system, which shows bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has respiratory failure with pneumonia, effusions, and atelectasis. The plan includes weaning off positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and completing antibiotic therapy. There is also a suspicion of urinary tract infection (UTI) and funguria, for which antibiotics will be completed. Colonic distension is present, and a rectal tube will be continued with total parenteral nutrition (TP"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with dementia and mental retardation, admitted with urosepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure, HAP, and fecal impaction. The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing respiratory failure likely due to increased abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis from extubation reintubation. The patient has a positive urine culture showing yeast, Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, and Gram-negative rods. There is also evidence of colon dilation on imaging, which is improving but may require further intervention. The patient has anemia, diabetes, neurologic status changes, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, osteoporosis, and a history of anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation. The patient is DNR and DNI upon successful extubation.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure: The patient continues to struggle with respiratory failure, which may be secondary to increased abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis from extubation reintubation. Suctioning secretions and weaning off mechanical ventilation are ongoing.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely of gastrointestinal origin, given the positive urine culture and history of urosepsis during a previous ICU stay. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and blood cultures are pending.
3. Colonic dilation: The patient's colon remains dilated, which may require surgical intervention, such"

","The patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with dementia and mental retardation, initially admitted with urosepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure, HAP, and fecal impaction. The patient has multiple medical conditions including anemia, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, osteoporosis, and a history of anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation.

The patient's current assessment includes hypoxemic acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to increased abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis from extubation reintubation. Secretions have been a barrier to extubation, but are now better. The patient's white blood cell count is stable, and suctioning of secretions is planned. The patient's PEEP and PS will be decreased, and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with possible extubation tomorrow is recommended when healthcare providers (HCPs) are present.

The patient is also diagnosed with sepsis, likely originating from the gastrointestinal tract given positive urine analysis and the patient's history of urosepsis during a prior ICU stay. A pulmonary infection could also play a role, but it is believed to have occurred during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long intubation process.

Other assessments include colonic dilation, which is improving on imaging and stable on clinical exam. There is no evidence of mechanical obstruction per radiology, and it is likely related to a stool ball in the sigmoid colon"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 84 year old nursing home resident with dementia,
   mental retardation, initially admitted with urosepsis and with
   development of hypoxemic respiratory failure, HAP, fecal impaction.
   .
   # Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis from
   extubation reintubation.  Secretions have been barrier to extubation,
   now better.
   - suction secretions, which are less
   - switched back to AC due to tachypnea.  Repeat gas, may try changing
   to PS.  Ultimate goal of SBT and possible extubation.
   - can d/c vanc/cefepime today, but may want to check with ID
   considering low grade fever overnight (day 8 of 8 day course) (day 1:
   Day 1 = [**8-3**]).
   - per ID d/c cipro,  can d/c flagyl as c.diff neg x 3
   - continue GI decompression with NGT and rectal tube.
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # sepsis: likely Gu source given positive UA, and patient
s history of
   urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is also likely as patient
   has distended colon, it is possible that patient becomes transiently
   bacteremic through distended bowel loops.  Pulmonary infection could
   play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely occurred during
   intubation as a result of aspiration in the long intubation process.
   - WBC slightly increasing
   - continue fluconazole (day 10 of 14 day course) (day 1: [**8-2**])
   - f/u blood culture
   - fluid boluses prn to maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-1**], ScvO2 >70%
   - fu ID recs recs
   - tylenol for fever
   - culutre if spikes
   .
   # Colonic dilation: improving on imaging, stable on clinical exam. no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, likely related to a
   stool ball in his sigmoid colon vs. ileus. Per surgery any surgical
   intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -may want to consider re-imaging today for interval change and setting
   of fever spikes
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -d/c enemas per GI
   - continue lactulose
   -continue broad coverage with cefepime, vanc for 8 days (day 1: Day 1 =
   [**8-3**])
   -GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] have signed off
   -electrolyte repletion
   -follow lactate
   .
   # Anemia: hct stable at 25 for several days.  Baseline hct 37-39. no
   evidence of bleeding. Could be contributed by dilutional effect and
   anemia of inflammation (anemia of chronic disease)
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   # Neuro status: On morning rounds,not alert enough to further assess
   neuro status, but did grimace to pain in all 4 extremities.
   - re-assess neuro status when pt is more alert
   .
   #Hypothyroid - continue synthroid (now IV dose)
   .
   #h/o seizure disorder - continue dilantin, phenobarbital (IV).
   - check dilantin level
   .
   #osteoporosis - continue calcium and vitamin d
   .
   #Goals of care: Confirmed with HCP [**Name (NI) 792**] [**Name (NI) 8911**], pt is DNR. If
   medically optimized and pt is extubated, he would be DNI at that time,
   and comfort measures only if not tolerating after extubation.  Should
   he self extubate, will re-intubate.
   .
   #Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   -maintain foley
   -call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   #Hypernatremia: resolved.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #Acute renal failure
 resolved.  likely pre-renal in the setting of
   sepsis and hypotension
   - continue sepsis treatment
   - maintain BP with IVF
   -send urine lytes and urinalysis if creatinine worsens
   -renally dose meds

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with dementia and mental retardation who was initially admitted with urosepsis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and fecal impaction. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to increased abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis from extubation reintubation. There is also a possibility of sepsis from a gastrointestinal source. The patient has colonic dilation, which is improving on imaging and is likely related to a stool ball in the sigmoid colon. Other conditions include anemia, diabetes mellitus, neuro status changes, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, osteoporosis, and anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation (resolved). The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA-negative, yeast-positive, and gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters on sputum culture. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure ranging from 149/57mmHg to 170/91mmHg, heart rate of 100 bpm, respiratory rate of 20-40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's blood cultures showed >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field with budding yeast and pseudohyphae, as well as gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slight decrease in hemoglobin,"

   Assessment and Plan: 84 year old nursing home resident with dementia,
   mental retardation, initially admitted with urosepsis and with
   development of hypoxemic respiratory failure, HAP, fecal impaction.
   .
   # Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis from
   extubation reintubation.  Secretions have been barrier to extubation,
   improving.
   - suction secretions, which are less
   - switched back to AC due to tachypnea.  Repeat gas, may try weaning to
   PS.  Ultimate goal of SBT and possible extubation.
   - can d/c vanc/cefepime today, but may want to check with ID
   considering low grade fever overnight (day 8 of 8 day course) (day 1:
   Day 1 = [**8-3**]).  Considered adding fluoroquinoline and flagyl.
   - per ID d/c cipro,  can d/c flagyl as c.diff neg x 3
   - continue GI decompression with NGT and rectal tube.
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # sepsis: likely Gu source given positive UA of yeasts, and patient
   history of urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is also likely
   as patient has distended colon, it is possible that patient becomes
   transiently bacteremic through distended bowel loops.  Pulmonary
   infection could play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely occurred
   during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long intubation
   process.
   - WBC slightly increasing
   - continue fluconazole (day 10 of 14 day course) (day 1: [**8-2**])
   - f/u blood culture
   - fluid boluses prn to maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-1**], ScvO2 >70%
   - fu ID recs recs
   - tylenol for fever
   - culutre if spikes
   .
   # Colonic dilation: improving on imaging, stable on clinical exam. no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, likely related to a
   stool ball in his sigmoid colon vs. ileus. Per surgery any surgical
   intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -may want to consider re-imaging today for interval change and setting
   of fever spikes
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -d/c enemas per GI
   - continue lactulose

   # Anemia: hct stable at 25 for several days.  Baseline hct 37-39. no
   evidence of bleeding. Could be contributed by dilutional effect and
   anemia of inflammation (anemia of chronic disease)
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.

   # Neuro status: On morning rounds,not alert enough to further assess
   neuro status, but did grimace to pain in all 4 extremities.
   - re-assess neuro status when pt is more alert

   #Goals of care: Confirmed with HCP [**Name (NI) 792**] [**Name (NI) 8911**], pt is DNR. If
   medically optimized and pt is extubated, he would be DNI at that time,
   and comfort measures only if not tolerating after extubation.  Should
   he self extubate, will re-intubate.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with dementia and mental retardation, initially admitted with urosepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to increased abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis from extubation reintubation. Secretions have been a barrier to extubation, but there has been some improvement.

2. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis, possibly originating from the genitourinary system (yeasts in urine culture) or gastrointestinal tract (colon dilation). The pneumonia may have occurred during intubation as a result of aspiration.

3. Colonic dilation: The patient has been showing signs of colonic dilation, which is improving on imaging but stable on clinical examination. This could be related to a stool ball in the sigmoid colon or ileus. Surgical intervention may involve a total colectomy.

4. Anemia: The patient has stable hematocrit levels but has a history of anemia. It could be due to dilutional effect and anemia of inflammation.

5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's diabetes management includes glargine and sliding scale insulin.

6. Neurological status: The patient's neurological status is not well-assessed due to being unresponsive. There is a need to re-evaluate when the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure with abdominal distention and likely significant pneumonia. Despite receiving a significant course of antibiotics, the patient continues to have ongoing fevers and maintains significant inability to maintain adequate ventilation even with Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) support.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory failure indicates a need for continued airway support and ventilation assistance. The patient is currently on Assist-Control (A/C) ventilation, and PSV trials will continue to be attempted. Secretion clearance and maintaining a stable abdominal exam are also important to prevent further respiratory compromise.

2. Abdominal Distention: The patient has persistent abdominal distention, which could be due to various causes such as bowel obstruction, constipation, or fluid accumulation. Monitoring the abdominal exam and addressing any underlying issues will be crucial in managing this complication.

3. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection, possibly leading to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms is necessary to detect and manage sepsis promptly.

4. Constipation/Obstipation: The patient may be at risk for constipation or obstipation due to immobilization and decreased bowel motility. Prophylactic measures like the use of a laxative (FOS) should be considered to"

   abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis from
   extubation reintubation.  Secretions have been barrier to extubation,
   improving.
   - suction secretions, which are less
   - switched back to AC due to tachypnea on PS trial, continue current
   setting
   - per HCP, do not desire trach, will plan to extubate tomorrow in her

   # Sepsis: likely GU source given positive UA of yeasts, and patient
   history of urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is also likely
   as patient has distended colon, it is possible that patient becomes
   transiently bacteremic through distended bowel loops.  Pulmonary
   infection could play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely occurred
   during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long intubation
   process.
   - WBC slightly increasing

","The patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with dementia, mental retardation, initially admitted with urosepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including hypoxemic acute respiratory failure, sepsis, colonic dilation, anemia, diabetes mellitus, neuro status changes, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, osteoporosis, anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and stress ulcer.

Based on the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure: The patient may experience worsening difficulty in breathing and oxygenation, leading to further respiratory distress.
2. Sepsis: The patient may develop worsening infection and systemic inflammatory response, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Colonic dilation: The patient may experience worsening abdominal distension and potential risk of perforation or obstruction.
4. Anemia: The patient may experience worsening fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen carrying capacity.
5. Neuro status changes: The patient may experience further decline in mental status and neurological function.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient may experience worsening symptoms of hypothyroidism such as fatigue, cold intolerance, and weight gain.
7. Seizure disorder: The patient may experience recurrent seizures or increased risk of seizure activity.
8. Osteoporosis: The patient may experience increased risk of fractures and bone density loss"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with a history of dementia, mental retardation, initially admitted with urosepsis and hypoxemic respiratory failure, HAP, fecal impaction. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and has multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure: The patient has developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to increased abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis from extubation reintubation. Secretions have been a barrier to extubation, improving.

2. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis, with a suspected gastrointestinal source given positive urine analysis for yeasts and the patient's history of urosepsis during a prior ICU stay. The patient also has distended colon, which may have led to transient bacteremia through distended bowel loops. Pulmonary infection could also play a role, but the pneumonia likely occurred during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long intubation process.

3. Colonic dilation: The patient has colonic dilation, which is improving on imaging and stable on clinical exam. There is no evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, and it is likely related to a stool ball in the sigmoid colon versus ileus. Surgery suggests that any surgical intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI, sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male with respiratory failure--related to pulmonary infection,
   weakness of respiratory muscles and capacity to maintain airway
   clearnance,  restriction of chest wall with abdominal process but now
   with significant limitations in capacity to maintain upper airway
   patency in light of findings during re-intubation.  He has had period
   of treatment for infectious insult to lungs.  He has had extensive
   intervention for clearance of fecal obstruction of colon which has
   resulted in significant decompression.  In this setting we have pursued
   medical treatment to allow an optimal chance for independent
   maintenance of ventilation and oxygenation.  He will be limited by
   upper airway patency and likely mental status and capacity to clear
   secretions which has been of concern.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Continue to suction as needed
   -Will minimize sedation
   -Move to PSV trial today
   -Given clear understanding of patient wishes there are no plans for
   tracheostomy or chronic ventilator support and will move to extubation
   with [**Name (NI) 792**] (HCP) present and continue to support him as needed going
   forward
   2)Bowel Obstruction-
   -Improved
   3)Sepsis-
   -Improved in regards to WBC count and blood pressure but with
   persistent fevers

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with respiratory failure due to a pulmonary infection, weakness of respiratory muscles, and restricted chest wall. The patient also has a history of bowel obstruction, which has been decompressed, and sepsis, although improved. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to experience difficulty maintaining airway patency and oxygenation. This can be due to factors such as mental status changes and the inability to clear secretions.
2. Bowel Obstruction: Although the patient's bowel obstruction has improved, there is still a risk of recurrence or complications related to the previous obstruction.
3. Sepsis: Despite improvement in the patient's sepsis, persistent fevers indicate ongoing infection. Monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, should be continued.
5. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy should be continued to prevent gastric ulcers.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to mechanical"

   84 year old nursing home resident with dementia, mental retardation,
   initially admitted with urosepsis and with development of hypoxemic
   respiratory failure, HAP, fecal impaction.
   .
   # Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis from
   extubation reintubation.  Secretions have been barrier to extubation,
   improving.
   - suction secretions, which are less
   - switched back to AC due to tachypnea after previous PS trial,
   continue current settings
   - per HCP, do not desire trach, will plan to extubate today in her
   presence. Pt will be DNI after extubation
   - will have Morphine and Scopalamine available if needed
   post-extubation
   - finished 8 day course of Vanc/Cefepime
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # Sepsis: likely GU source given positive UA of yeasts, and patient
   history of urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is also likely
   as patient has distended colon, it is possible that patient becomes
   transiently bacteremic through distended bowel loops.  Pulmonary
   infection could play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely occurred
   during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long intubation
   process.
   - febrile, elev WBC
   - continue fluconazole (day 11 of 14 day course) (day 1: [**8-2**]), will
   recheck UA and culture upon completion of course
   - f/u blood culture
   - fluid boluses prn to maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-1**], ScvO2 >70%
   - fu ID recs recs
   - tylenol for fever
   - culture if spikes
   - RUQ ruled out cholecystitis
   .
   # Colonic dilation: improving on imaging, stable on clinical exam. no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, likely related to a
   stool ball in his sigmoid colon vs. ileus. Per surgery any surgical
   intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -d/c enemas per GI
   - continue lactulose
   -GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] have signed off
   -electrolyte repletion
   -follow lactate which has been normal
   - d/c AlOH
   .
   # Anemia: hct stable at 25 for several days.  Baseline hct 37-39. no
   evidence of bleeding. Could be contributed by dilutional effect and
   anemia of inflammation (anemia of chronic disease)
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse if hct <21

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with dementia and mental retardation. The patient was initially admitted with urosepsis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and fecal impaction. 

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxemic acute respiratory failure, sepsis with a likely GU source and possible GI source, colonic dilation, anemia, diabetes mellitus, neuro status changes, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, osteoporosis, anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure. 

The patient has been treated with various medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Cefepime, Fluconazole), pantoprazole, dilantin, heparin sodium, fentanyl, and TPN. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/57 mmHg to 182/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 509 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 144/131). 

The patient's plan includes suctioning secretions, switching back to assist-control ventilation due to tachypnea"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old nursing home resident with dementia, mental retardation,
   initially admitted with urosepsis and with development of hypoxemic
   respiratory failure, HAP, fecal impaction.
   .
   # Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis from
   extubation reintubation.  Secretions have been barrier to extubation,
   improving.
   - suction secretions, which are less
   - switched back to AC due to tachypnea on PS trial, continue current
   setting
   - per HCP, do not desire trach, will plan to extubate tomorrow in her
   presence. Pt will be DNI after extubation.
   - finished 8 day course of Vanc/Cefepime
   - continue GI decompression with NGT and rectal tube.
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # Sepsis: likely GU source given positive UA of yeasts, and patient
   history of urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is also likely
   as patient has distended colon, it is possible that patient becomes
   transiently bacteremic through distended bowel loops.  Pulmonary
   infection could play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely occurred
   during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long intubation
   process.
   - WBC slightly increasing
   - continue fluconazole (day 10 of 14 day course) (day 1: [**8-2**]), will
   recheck UA and culture upon completion of course
   - f/u blood culture
   - fluid boluses prn to maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-1**], ScvO2 >70%
   - fu ID recs recs
   - tylenol for fever
   - culture if spikes
   - given elev LFTs, will do RUQ
   .
   # Colonic dilation: improving on imaging, stable on clinical exam. no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, likely related to a
   stool ball in his sigmoid colon vs. ileus. Per surgery any surgical
   intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -d/c enemas per GI
   - continue lactulose
   -GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] have signed off
   -electrolyte repletion
   -follow lactate which has been normal
   .
   # Anemia: hct stable at 25 for several days.  Baseline hct 37-39. no
   evidence of bleeding. Could be contributed by dilutional effect and
   anemia of inflammation (anemia of chronic disease)
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   # Neuro status: On morning rounds,not alert enough to further assess
   neuro status, but did grimace to pain in all 4 extremities.
   - re-assess neuro status when pt is more alert
   .
   #Hypothyroid - continue synthroid (now IV dose)
   .
   #h/o seizure disorder - continue dilantin, phenobarbital (IV).
   - check dilantin level
   .
   #osteoporosis - continue calcium and vitamin d
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male with initial admission with urosepsis now with recurrent
   admission to [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU with respiratory failure with likey
   contribution from weakness, pulmonary secretions, pnumonia and
   restriction due to abdominal distention.  Now that we have completed
   course of treatment for infection and provided decompression of abdomen
   we have provided optimal intervention to give greatest chance of
   successful extubation.  Despite this there is signfiicant concern for
   patient capacity to maintain patent airway following extubation.  As
   described [**Hospital 9029**] [**Hospital 508**] health care proxy ([**Name (NI) 792**]) he clearly would
   not want trachestomy and has been DNR which leaves current plan to move
   to exbuation and continue to support him with a focus on comfort with
   extubation with [**Doctor First Name 792**] in attendance.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old admitted with urosepsis and with development of hypoxemic
   respiratory failure, HAP, fecal impaction.  Following goals of care
   meeting with HCP, will not continue tube feeds, will continue abx, lab
   tests, but no aggressive interventions.
   .
   # Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to aspiration
   pneumonia / pneumonitis from extubation reintubation.  Upper airway
   compromise evident based on wheezing and difficulty in clearing
   secretions.
   - morphine gtt stopped but will restart in distress
   - supplemental O2
   - NPO
   - nebulizers to treat bronchospasm
   -f/u CXR
   .
   # Sepsis: resolved.  likely GU source given positive UA of yeasts, and
   patient
s history of urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is
   also likely as patient has distended colon, it is possible that patient
   becomes transiently bacteremic through distended bowel loops.
   Pulmonary infection could play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely
   occurred during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long
   intubation process.
   - continue fluconazole (day 13 of 14 day course) (day 1: [**8-2**]), will
   recheck UA and culture upon completion of course
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u urine culture
   - f/u sputum culture
   .
   # Colonic dilation: improving on imaging, stable on clinical exam. no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, likely related to a
   stool ball in his sigmoid colon vs. ileus. Per surgery any surgical
   intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   - continue lactulose
   - GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] have signed off
   -electrolyte repletion
   - d/c AlOH, which can cause constipation
   .
   # Anemia: Stable.  hct stable at 25 for several days.  Baseline hct
   37-39. no evidence of bleeding. Could be contributed by dilutional
   effect and anemia of inflammation (anemia of chronic disease)
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   # Neuro status: On morning rounds,not alert enough to further assess
   neuro status, but did grimace to pain in all 4 extremities.
   - re-assess neuro status when pt is more alert
   .
   #Hypothyroid - continue synthroid (now IV dose)
   .
   #h/o seizure disorder - continue dilantin, phenobarbital (IV).
   - check dilantin level
   .
   #osteoporosis - continue calcium and vitamin d
   .
   #Goals of care: Confirmed with HCP [**Name (NI) 792**] [**Name (NI) 8911**], pt is DNR. If
   medically optimized and pt is extubated, he would be DNI at that time,
   and comfort measures only if not tolerating after extubation.  Should
   he self extubate, will re-intubate.
   - palliative care consult
   .
   #Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   -maintain foley
   -call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   #Hypernatremia: resolved.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #Acute renal failure
 resolved.  likely pre-renal in the setting of
   sepsis and hypotension
   - continue sepsis treatment
   - maintain BP with IVF
   -send urine lytes and urinalysis if creatinine worsens

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old nursing home resident with dementia, mental retardation,
   initially admitted with urosepsis and with development of hypoxemic
   respiratory failure, HAP, fecal impaction.
   .
   # Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to increased
   abdominal distention and aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis from
   extubation reintubation.  Secretions have been barrier to extubation,
   improving.
   - extubated, moved to comfort measures
   - on Morphine and Scopalamine available if needed post-extubation
   .
   # Sepsis: resolved.  likely GU source given positive UA of yeasts, and
   patient
s history of urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is
   also likely as patient has distended colon, it is possible that patient
   becomes transiently bacteremic through distended bowel loops.
   Pulmonary infection could play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely
   occurred during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long
   intubation process.
   - continue fluconazole (day 11 of 14 day course) (day 1: [**8-2**]), will
   recheck UA and culture upon completion of course
   - f/u blood culture
   .
   # Colonic dilation: improving on imaging, stable on clinical exam. no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, likely related to a
   stool ball in his sigmoid colon vs. ileus. Per surgery any surgical
   intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   -NGT and rectal tube in 30 cm for decompression
   -d/c enemas per GI
   - continue lactulose
   -GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] have signed off
   -electrolyte repletion
   -follow lactate which has been normal
   - d/c AlOH
   .
   # Anemia: Stable.  hct stable at 25 for several days.  Baseline hct
   37-39. no evidence of bleeding. Could be contributed by dilutional
   effect and anemia of inflammation (anemia of chronic disease)
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   # Neuro status: On morning rounds,not alert enough to further assess
   neuro status, but did grimace to pain in all 4 extremities.
   - re-assess neuro status when pt is more alert
   .
   #Hypothyroid - continue synthroid (now IV dose)
   .
   #h/o seizure disorder - continue dilantin, phenobarbital (IV).
   - check dilantin level
   .
   #osteoporosis - continue calcium and vitamin d
   .
   #Goals of care: Confirmed with HCP [**Name (NI) 792**] [**Name (NI) 8911**], pt is DNR. If
   medically optimized and pt is extubated, he would be DNI at that time,
   and comfort measures only if not tolerating after extubation.  Should
   he self extubate, will re-intubate.
   .
   #Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   -maintain foley
   -call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   #Hypernatremia: resolved.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #Acute renal failure
 resolved.  likely pre-renal in the setting of

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old nursing home resident with a history of dementia, mental retardation, urosepsis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), and fecal impaction. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on comfort measures with morphine and scopolamine available if needed post-extubation. The patient's conditions include hypoxemic acute respiratory failure, sepsis (resolved), colonic dilation (improving), anemia, diabetes mellitus, neuro status, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, osteoporosis, anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation (not a current active issue), hypernatremia (resolved), and acute renal failure (resolved).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of diffuse ronchi bilaterally on physical examination. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrent infection due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.
3. Colonic dilation: The patient's massively distended abdomen and evidence of stool impaction suggest a risk of bowel ischemia or perforation if not managed appropriately.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may continue to worsen if not"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male with initial admission for urosepsis and now with recurrent
   respiratory failure in the setting of abdominal distention--who now has
   had decrease in abdominal distention, has had optimal treatment for
   infection and now moved to extubation which he has tolerated with
   supplemental oxygen only.  He has required MSO4 PRN for respiratory
   distress.  He does have some capacity for clearance of secretions.
   This course was discussed extensively with [**Hospital 508**] health care proxy
   and will continue as follows until further discussions patient to be
   maintained, with-->
   1)Respiratory Distress-Given compromise of patient upper airway and
   inability to maintain adequate clearance of secretions he does have
   persistence of intermittent respiratory distress.  Will continue to
   treat with-->
   -MSO4 IV as needed for severe distress
   -Supplemental O2 in place
   -NPO to continue given aspiration risk
   -Given the multiple issues to discuss to consider patient priorities
   and medical interventions possible will involve palliative care for
   consideration of treatment options going forward
   -Nebulizers to continue for relief of bronchospasm
   2)Sepsis-
   Fluconazole to continue and is on day [**11-3**] for urinary fungal
   infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted for urosepsis and recurrent respiratory failure.
- The patient has tolerated extubation with supplemental oxygen only and required morphine sulfate for intermittent respiratory distress.
- The patient's abdominal distention has decreased, and treatment for infection is ongoing.
- The patient's upper airway is compromised, leading to inadequate clearance of secretions.
- The patient's respiratory distress persists despite treatment, including MSO4 IV as needed, supplemental O2, and nebulizers for bronchospasm relief.
- The patient's sepsis is being treated with fluconazole for a urinary fungal infection.
- The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and constipation.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, indicating do not resuscitate/do not intubate.
- The patient is being maintained on comfort care measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to experience intermittent respiratory distress despite receiving supplemental oxygen and MSO4 IV. This indicates a potential risk of recurrent or worsening respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient is receiving treatment for the urinary fungal infection with fluconazole, there is still a risk of ongoing sepsis or development of secondary infections due to the compromised immune system.
3. Aspiration Risk: The patient's inability to clear secretions and compromised upper airway pose a risk of aspiration pneumonia, especially considering"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old admitted with urosepsis and with development of hypoxemic
   respiratory failure, HAP, fecal impaction.  Following goals of care
   meeting with HCP, will not continue tube feeds, will continue abx, lab
   tests, but no aggressive interventions.
   .
   # Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to aspiration
   pneumonia / pneumonitis from extubation reintubation.  Upper airway
   compromise evident based on wheezing and difficulty in clearing
   secretions.
   - morphine gtt stopped but will restart in distress
   - continue supplemental O2
   - NPO
   - continue nebulizers to treat bronchospasm
   - f/u CXR
   .
   #Goals of care: Confirmed with HCP [**Name (NI) 792**] [**Name (NI) 8911**], pt is DNR. If
   medically optimized and pt is extubated, he would be DNI at that time,
   and comfort measures only if not tolerating after extubation.  Should
   he self extubate, will re-intubate.
- appreciate palliative care recs:
Per collateral information from a very suppo
rtive HCP, patient appeared to have a good quality of life at his nursing home,
and enjoyed simple activities there. These goals could potentially be reached wi
th minimally invasive treatments and physical/occupational rehabilitation, which
 appear to all be within desired goals of care. We will contact case management
to discuss potential disposition plans for patient and can contact the patient's
 HCP for further collateral information
   .
   # Sepsis: resolved.  likely GU source given positive UA of yeasts, and
   patient
s history of urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is
   also likely as patient has distended colon, it is possible that patient
   becomes transiently bacteremic through distended bowel loops.
   Pulmonary infection could play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely
   occurred during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long
   intubation process.
   - continue fluconazole (day 13 of 14 day course) (day 1: [**8-2**]), will
   recheck UA and culture upon completion of course
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u urine culture
   - f/u sputum culture
   .
   # Colonic dilation: improving on imaging, stable on clinical exam. no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, likely related to a
   stool ball in his sigmoid colon vs. ileus. Per surgery any surgical
   intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.
   -per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   - continue lactulose
   - GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] have signed off
   -electrolyte repletion
   - d/c AlOH, which can cause constipation
   .
   # Anemia: Stable.  hct stable at 25 for several days.  Baseline hct
   37-39. no evidence of bleeding. Could be contributed by dilutional
   effect and anemia of inflammation (anemia of chronic disease)
   - guaiac stool
   - transfuse if hct <21
   .
   #DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   # Neuro status: On morning rounds,not alert enough to further assess
   neuro status, but did grimace to pain in all 4 extremities.
   - re-assess neuro status when pt is more alert
   .
   #Hypothyroid - continue synthroid (now IV dose)
   .
   #h/o seizure disorder - continue dilantin, phenobarbital (IV).
   - check dilantin level
   .
   #osteoporosis - continue calcium and vitamin d
   .
   #Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   -maintain foley
   -call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   #Acute renal failure
 resolved.  likely pre-renal in the setting of

   Disposition : ICU for now, may be called out to floor
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male admitted with urosepsis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and HAP. The patient's goals of care have been discussed with the healthcare power of attorney (HCP), and it has been confirmed that the patient is do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of urosepsis during a prior ICU stay, and there is evidence of a likely GU source of infection given the positive urine analysis for yeasts. Additionally, the patient may have become transiently bacteremic through distended bowel loops. Therefore, continued treatment for sepsis is necessary.

2. Pulmonary infection: The patient has hypoxemic acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis from extubation reintubation. There is also evidence of an upper airway compromise based on wheezing and difficulty in clearing secretions. 

3. Colonic dilation: The patient has colonic dilation, which is improving on imaging but stable on clinical exam. It is likely related to a stool ball in the sigmoid colon versus ileus. Surgical intervention may involve a total colectomy, and conservative management with lactulose should be continued.

4. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 25 for several days."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the ICU with urosepsis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and fecal impaction. He has been extubated and is currently receiving supplemental oxygen. The patient has a history of seizure disorder, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, and DM. He is DNR/DNI and will receive comfort measures only if not tolerating after extubation. His goals of care were discussed with the healthcare power of attorney, and no aggressive interventions will be pursued. The patient's urine culture showed growing yeast, so fluconazole has been continued for a total of 14 days. Blood cultures have been sent, and the patient's sputum culture showed moderate growth of yeasts. Imaging revealed an L-sided pleural effusion and RML infiltrate. The patient's colonic dilation is improving on imaging, but there are no signs of mechanical obstruction. The patient has stable anemia, and his DM, neuro status, hypothyroidism, and osteoporosis will be managed accordingly. An anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation was ruled out. The patient's acute renal failure has resolved. The patient is currently on TPN with lipids and maintained on IVF. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is alert and oriented. The patient's family has agreed to palliative care recommendations.

   .
   # Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure:  extubated now. Now satting well
   on 2L NC. Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis from
   extubation reintubation.  Upper airway compromise evident based on
   wheezing and difficulty in clearing secretions.
   - continue supplemental O2, wean as tolerated
   - NPO, will get speech and swallow consult today
   - continue nebulizers to treat bronchospasm
   - f/u CXR

   # Goals of care: Confirmed with HCP [**Name (NI) 792**] [**Name (NI) 8911**], pt is DNR/DNI.
- appreciate palliative care recs:
Per collateral information from a very suppo
rtive HCP, patient appeared to have a good quality of life at his nursing home,
and enjoyed simple activities there. These goals could potentially be reached wi
th minimally invasive treatments and physical/occupational rehabilitation, which
 appear to all be within desired goals of care. We will contact case management
to discuss potential disposition plans for patient and can contact the patient's
 HCP for further collateral information
- no aggressive therapy, i.e., no PEG or tracheostomy
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt was on severeal blood pressure meds at home at
   baseline.
   - since he is not taking POs yet, will give metorpolol IV for now as he
   is also a bit tachycardic
   - also start hydralazine IV today
   .
   # Sepsis: resolved.  likely GU source given positive UA of yeasts, and
   patient
s history of urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is
   also likely as patient has distended colon, it is possible that patient
   becomes transiently bacteremic through distended bowel loops.
   Pulmonary infection could play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely
   occurred during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long
   intubation process.
   - d/c fluconazole today (day 14 of 14 day course) (day 1: [**8-2**])
   - will recheck UA and culture today
   - f/u all cultures
   .
   # Colonic dilation: improving on imaging, stable on clinical exam. no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, likely related to a
   stool ball in his sigmoid colon vs. ileus. Per surgery any surgical
   intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.  GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] have signed off
   - per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   - continue lactulose
   - electrolyte repletion prn
   .
   # Anemia: Stable.  Baseline hct 37-39. no evidence of bleeding. Could
   be contributed by dilutional effect and anemia of inflammation (anemia
   of chronic disease)
   - transfuse if hct <21
   .
   # DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.

   # Neuro status: back to baseline
   - continue to monitor

   # Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   - maintain foley
   - call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 resolved.  likely pre-renal in the setting of

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted with urosepsis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and fecal impaction. The patient has been extubated and is currently on 2L NC, showing good oxygen saturation. He has a history of hypertension and is tachycardic. The patient's sepsis has resolved, with a likely GU source. He also has colonic dilation, which is improving on imaging, and anemia that is stable. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes, neuro status back to baseline, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, and osteoporosis. His anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation is not currently an active issue. The patient's acute renal failure has resolved. The patient's goals of care are confirmed as DNR/DNI, and no aggressive interventions such as PEG or tracheostomy are planned. The patient's family has agreed to palliative care recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient may experience worsening respiratory distress or difficulty in clearing secretions, leading to further hypoxemia.
2. Colonic dilation: The patient may develop complications related to colonic dilation such as bowel perforation or obstruction.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen or lead to symptoms such as fatigue or shortness of breath.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure may not be well-controlled, leading to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted with urosepsis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and fecal impaction. He has a history of seizure disorder, osteoporosis, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus. The patient's goals of care were discussed with the healthcare provider (HCP) and it was decided to continue antibiotics, lab tests, but no aggressive interventions. The patient is DNR and if medically optimized and extubated, he would be DNI. Comfort measures only will be provided if not tolerating after extubation. The patient's condition has improved since admission, but he still requires ongoing management for several issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may worsen if there is further lung infection or difficulty clearing secretions.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis appears to have resolved, there is still a risk of recurrence if the source of infection is not fully treated or if his immune system remains compromised.
3. Colonic dilation: There is a risk of worsening colonic dilation leading to bowel perforation or obstruction. Conservative management with lactulose and electrolyte repletion should be continued.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if he continues to experience bleeding or if there is inadequate red blood cell production.
5. Neuro status: The patient's altered mental status may persist or worsen if his underlying"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old admitted with urosepsis and with development of hypoxemic
   respiratory failure, HAP, fecal impaction.
   .
   # Hypoxemic acute respiratory failure:  extubated now. Now satting well
   on 2L NC. Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis from
   extubation reintubation.  Upper airway compromise evident based on
   wheezing and difficulty in clearing secretions.
   - continue supplemental O2, wean as tolerated
   - NPO, will get speech and swallow consult today
   - continue nebulizers to treat bronchospasm
   - f/u CXR
   .
   # Goals of care: Confirmed with HCP [**Name (NI) 792**] [**Name (NI) 8911**], pt is DNR/DNI.
- appreciate palliative care recs:
Per collateral information from a very suppo
rtive HCP, patient appeared to have a good quality of life at his nursing home,
and enjoyed simple activities there. These goals could potentially be reached wi
th minimally invasive treatments and physical/occupational rehabilitation, which
 appear to all be within desired goals of care. We will contact case management
to discuss potential disposition plans for patient and can contact the patient's
 HCP for further collateral information
- no aggressive therapy, i.e., no PEG or tracheostomy
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt was on severeal blood pressure meds at home at
   baseline.
   - since he is not taking POs yet, will give metorpolol IV for now as he
   is also a bit tachycardic
   - also start hydralazine IV today
   .
   # Sepsis: resolved.  likely GU source given positive UA of yeasts, and
   patient
s history of urosepsis during prior ICU stay.  GI source is
   also likely as patient has distended colon, it is possible that patient
   becomes transiently bacteremic through distended bowel loops.
   Pulmonary infection could play a role as well, but the pneumonia likely
   occurred during intubation as a result of aspiration in the long
   intubation process.
   - d/c fluconazole today (day 14 of 14 day course) (day 1: [**8-2**])
   - will recheck UA and culture today
   - f/u all cultures
   .
   # Colonic dilation: improving on imaging, stable on clinical exam. no
   evidence of a mechanical obstruction per radiology, likely related to a
   stool ball in his sigmoid colon vs. ileus. Per surgery any surgical
   intervention will likely involve a total colectomy. Per GI
   sigmoidoscopy will not be able to relieve an obstruction related to
   stool.  GI and gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] have signed off
   - per HCP, no aggressive intervention: pursue conservative management
   - continue lactulose
   - electrolyte repletion prn
   .
   # Anemia: Stable.  Baseline hct 37-39. no evidence of bleeding. Could
   be contributed by dilutional effect and anemia of inflammation (anemia
   of chronic disease)
   - transfuse if hct <21
   .
   # DM: continue glargine and sliding scale insulin.
   .
   # Neuro status: back to baseline
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroid:
    - continue synthroid (now IV dose)
   .
   # h/o seizure disorder:
   - continue dilantin, phenobarbital (IV).
   .
   # osteoporosis:
   - continue calcium and vitamin d
   .
   # Anterior extraperitoneal bladder perforation: not a current active
   issue as per urology was likely a small perforation and self
   contained.  Per radiology no perforation was seen.
   - maintain foley
   - call urology if foley requires flushing
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 resolved.  likely pre-renal in the setting of
   sepsis and hypotension
   - maintain BP with IVF
   - send urine lytes and urinalysis if creatinine worsens

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old male admitted with urosepsis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and fecal impaction. The patient is currently extubated and oxygenating well on 2L nasal cannula. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable for now, but there is a possibility of worsening due to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis from extubation reintubation. Close monitoring and supportive care will be required.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has resolved, there is a risk of recurrence, especially if the source of infection is not adequately treated or if the patient develops another infection.

3. Colonic dilation: The patient has colonic dilation, which may improve with conservative management. However, surgical intervention may be necessary if there is evidence of obstruction or if conservative measures fail.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable at this time, but further evaluation and management may be needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.

5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's diabetes should be closely monitored and managed with insulin therapy as needed.

6. Neurological status: The patient's neurological status has returned to baseline, but ongoing monitoring is essential to detect any changes or deterioration.

7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism should be managed"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo male with initial admission with urosepsis who now has had quite
   good improvement in respiratory status following extubation with
   patient having bowel decompression completed and sepsis treatment
   completed and has been able to maintain adequate oxygenation with nasal
   cannula oxygen only.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -OOB to chair
   -Ambulation if possible
   -Continue to suction as needed
   -Will return to face mask as needed across the day today
   2)Bowel Obstruction-
   -Improved with decompression
   -Will return to po intake for pleasure
   -TPN to continue while in hospital

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with initial admission for urosepsis. The patient has shown improvement in respiratory status following extubation and bowel decompression. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications that can arise are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced respiratory failure and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen. Potential complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and the need for advanced respiratory support such as mechanical ventilation.

2. Bowel Obstruction: The patient had bowel obstruction, which has improved with decompression. However, there is still a risk of recurrent bowel obstruction or complications such as perforation or ischemia.

3. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with urosepsis, indicating a systemic infection. Although the patient has completed sepsis treatment, there is still a risk of relapse or development of new infections while in the ICU.

4. Cardiovascular Status: The patient's vital signs show a slightly low blood pressure (108/40 mmHg) and elevated heart rate (111 bpm). These findings suggest possible cardiovascular compromise or response to underlying conditions. Monitoring for signs of hypotension or tachycardia is important.

5. Kidney Function: The patient's serum creatinine levels have been fluctuating, with a high of 1.1 mg/dL and a low of 0.8 mg/dL. Close monitoring of"
