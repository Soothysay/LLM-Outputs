   Chief Complaint: transfer from [**Location (un) 3**] for cath
   24 Hour Events:
   50 year old male with no medical care in over 20 years. Patient
   presented to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3762**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8904**] office yesterday ([**2183-8-11**]) to
   establish primary care and was noted to have an elevated BP 180/120 and
   tachycardia 120. Patient was sent to [**Location (un) 3**] [**Hospital1 5**] ER and troponins
   were trended - 0.014, 0.02, 0.017. ECHO demonstrated EF 15-20% and
   consequently patient was transfered to [**Location (un) **] [**Hospital1 5**] for cath. Prior to
   transfer patient received ASA 325 mg and Heparin. Cath demonstrated
   clean coronaries, however did show elevated filling pressures,
   pulmonary hypertension and low CO. Patient was hypertensive in cath lab
   and started on Nitroglycerin and Nitropresside. Patient was admitted to
   CCU for further management of hypertensive urgency and heart failure.
   .
   Patient reports shortness of breath of one year duration, however
   worsened in the past month. Patient becomes SOB walking several yards,
   prior he was able to walk a 18-hole golf course. 1 month ago patient
   describes malaise, weakness, fatigue, increased urination and diarrhea
   for 1 week duration. Patient states it improved when he decreased his
   fluid intake (cola). During this peroid he had an epidose of dizziness
   (no LOC, syncope) which improved with rest.  Patient denies PND or
   lower extremity edema. Denies chest pain, but does complain of
   intermittent epigastric discomfort and palpitations. Patient unaware of
   an history of HTN or high cholesterol.
   .
   On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
   venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
   myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
   He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock
   or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of no medical care in over 20 years. He presented with elevated blood pressure (180/120 mmHg) and tachycardia (heart rate of 120 beats per minute). Troponin levels were trended, showing no significant elevation. An echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%, indicating systolic heart failure. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

The patient's medical history includes no prior medical care, and he denies any history of high blood pressure or high cholesterol. He has no significant family history of cardiac disease. His social history includes being a CFO machinery company, denying tobacco use, consuming 3-4 beers every couple of days, and reducing alcohol intake after experiencing an episode of dizziness. He denies illicit drug use.

On physical examination, the patient is an overweight gentleman who appears to be in no acute distress. Vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 123/70 mmHg, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has a regular heart rhythm and clear lungs bilaterally. There are no abnormalities detected in the abdomen or extremities.

The patient was hypertensive in the cath lab and started on nitroglycerin and nitropresside. He was admitted to the CCU for further management of hypertensive urgency and heart failure.

The patient's medical history is significant for shortness of breath for one year, worsening over the past month. He also experienced malaise, weakness, fatigue, increased urination, and diarrhea for a week, which improved with decreased fluid intake. He denies chest pain but complains of intermittent epigastric discomfort and palpitations. He is unaware of any history of hypertension or high cholesterol.

On examination, the patient is an overweight gentleman in no acute distress. His heart rhythm is sinus, with a PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line. There are no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No femoral bruits are present. His extremities show no clubbing or cyanosis. His pulses are bilaterally present and equal.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 14.5 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 23 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.2 mg/dL, glucose of 114 mg/dL, and an electrolyte imbalance with sodium (Na) at 142 mEq/L and potassium (K+) at 3.6 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Echocardiography demonstrates moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a mildly dilated left ventricular cavity, an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, increased wedge pressure, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), and mild right ventricular dilation with global hypokinesis. There is also mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hypertension, malignant (hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency): The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated and requires immediate management.
2. Cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic: The patient's echo shows evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is likely secondary to long-standing untreated hypertension.
3. Subacute systolic heart failure: The patient's ejection fraction is severely reduced, indicating systolic heart failure. He will need to be started on medications to improve his EF.
4. Renal artery patency: The renal arteries were found to be patent during the catheterization.
5. Coronaries: No significant coronary artery disease was found during the catheterization.
6. Rhythm: The patient's heart rhythm is currently sinus.

The patient's treatment plan includes converting blood pressure management to oral medications, weaning off nitropresside and nitroglycerin, initiating long-term heart failure medications (lisinopril, nifedipine CR, and possibly a beta-blocker once pheochromocytoma is ruled out), diuretics (Lasix) for fluid management, and further evaluation for other causes of cardiomyopathy (such as thyroid function tests and HIV screening).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening heart failure, hypertensive crisis, arrhythmias, renal impairment, and pulmonary complications due to pulmonary hypertension."

","The patient is a 50-year-old male who was transferred from another location for catheterization. He presented with a hypertensive emergency and systolic heart failure, which was confirmed by an echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of 15-20% and moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The catheterization revealed mild diffuse coronary artery disease without any focal lesions. 

The patient's cholesterol levels are within acceptable limits, so no lipid-lowering therapy is required at this time. However, he will be started on prophylactic aspirin therapy. His blood pressure is well-controlled with carvedilol and lisinopril. 

There are no rhythm disturbances, and his leukocytosis is mild with a left shift but trending down. There are no symptoms suggestive of infection, so cultures will be followed if the leukocyte count spikes. 

The patient is overweight and has a history of hypertension. The etiology of his hypertension is unclear, but it may be related to possible obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity. Further evaluation will include urine catecholamines to rule out pheochromocytoma. 

The patient has mild bilateral lower extremity edema, which will be managed with Lasix and monitored for urine output. Additionally, a neck CT without contrast will be performed to investigate a possible neck mass seen on the chest X-ray. 

The patient is advised to abstain from alcohol, and he will receive education and counseling for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old overweight male who was admitted to the ICU with a hypertensive emergency and systolic heart failure. He has been diagnosed with subacute systolic heart failure, with an estimated ejection fraction of 15-20% and moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The etiology of cardiomyopathy is unclear, but it is most likely due to long-standing hypertension or alcohol use. Other potential causes such as amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, thyroid disease, and HIV infection have been ruled out.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed mild diffuse coronary artery disease without any focal lesions. His cholesterol levels are within normal range, so lipid-lowering therapy is not necessary at this time. He will be started on prophylactic aspirin therapy.

His blood pressure is well-controlled with carvedilol and lisinopril. The patient also has leukocytosis, but there are no signs of infection. His electrolyte levels and renal function are within normal limits. Further evaluation is planned to rule out pheochromocytoma.

The patient is currently ambulating well and has had his heparin sodium discontinued. His oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. He has no neck masses or lymphadenopathy, but does have jugular venous distention 2 inches above the clavicle. His heart rhythm is sinus, and he has an S3 heart sound but normal S"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 50-year-old overweight male who was transferred from another location for cardiac catheterization. The patient presented with a hypertensive emergency and systolic heart failure, which is now being managed in the ICU. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is reported to be 15-20%, indicating reduced heart function. Additionally, the patient has moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). 

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed mild diffuse coronary artery disease with no focal lesions. Cholesterol levels are within normal limits. The patient is currently on carvedilol, lisinopril, and a low salt diet.

The patient also has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.3-15.1 thousand/mL. However, there are no symptoms suggesting an infection, and the patient's blood cultures have not been obtained yet.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Worsening systolic heart failure: Given the patient's low EF and symptoms of heart failure, there is a risk of further deterioration in cardiac function.
2. Hypertension: The patient was admitted with a hypertensive emergency, and while currently controlled, there is a need for ongoing management to prevent future hypertensive crises.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobile in the ICU, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots in the legs. Prophyl"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old overweight male with a history of hypertension, presenting with systolic heart failure. He was transferred from another hospital for cardiac catheterization due to a hypertensive emergency. The patient's condition improved after the catheterization, which showed clean arteries. However, an echocardiogram demonstrated a low ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% and moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The patient is currently on medications including lisinopril, carvedilol, and aspirin. His cholesterol levels are within normal limits. The patient's blood pressure is being managed, and he is on a low-salt diet. Further evaluation is needed for possible causes of cardiomyopathy, such as amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, thyroid disorders, or HIV infection. The patient's leukocytosis is mild and trending down, without any signs of infection. He has a history of hypertension and may also have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity, but primary hypertension is the most likely cause. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is ambulating well."
