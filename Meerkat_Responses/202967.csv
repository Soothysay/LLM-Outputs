   Assessment and Plan
   71 gentleman with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, refractory
   ascites s/p TIPS [**2119**] found to have occluded TIPS by U/S in [**12-18**] now
   s/p redo TIPS with portal vein thrombosis. Transfered with hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely due to aspiration event as pt is altered and was
   noted to have gurgling sounds and tacchypnea. CXR is consistent with
   RLL consolidations. Ruled out for MI. PE is a possibility but less
   likely given alternative cause.
   - vanc/zosyn for HAP
   - could consider intubating for sedation and further studies as patient
   may become more sick with worsening PNA
   - ABG to treand lactate
   -consider CTA
   -IVF
   .
   # Mental status changes: Coincides with redo-TIPs. Likely
   multifactorial secondary to post op delirium, encephalopathy from
   patent TIPS, and underlying cognitive dysfunction. Head CT done this am
   was negative for bleed but his ventricles were enlarged with ?
   communicating hydrocephalus. Primary team on the floor (liver) called
   neurology and this is not likely the cause of ms changes and is
   chronic. Patient also has afib and is not anticoagulated because of
   coagulopathy. Head CT did not show sign of stroke but was done without
   contrast. Patient moving all extremities and looks more
   encephalopathic, but this is on differential given his risk factors.
   Patient is too agitated for MRI and would need to be intubated and
   sedated to get this done. Also concern for sepsis with low UOP,
   borderline low BPs, elevated lactate. On vanc zosyn now for asp pna and
   empiric sbp treatment. UA negative. Bld cx ordered.  Also on the
   differential will be alcohol withdrawl.
   - lactulose and rifaximin, uptitrate to [**5-15**] bms today, place NG tube
   - ativan prn
   - 1:1 sitter
   - vanc zosyn for above infection, may benefit from diag paracentesis if
   his MS improves
   .
   # TIPS revision: This was done [**1-28**]. Thrombolysis, angioplasty done
   with gradient of 6 after procedure was finished. Per IR, no need for
   heparin. Briefly on lovenox but discontinued since pt at risk for
   bleeding. RUQ us demonstartes flow but could not assess gradient since
   agitated. will need sedation if want to assess gradient
   - F/U further IR recs
   - consider reversing tips due to gross encephalopathy
   .
   # Portal vein thrombosis: s/p thrombolysis and angioplasty.
   - no anti-coag per hepatology attending
   .
   # Pacemaker malfunction: Pacemaker not functioning properly per EP.
   Has a history of ? complete AVB.  Needs lead revision before discharge.
   - appreciate EP recs
   - no nodal agents
   .
   # Anemia: Transfused a unit on this admission, crit drop this am, pt ob
   pos yellow stools but trace guaic positive.  Transfused one unit today.
   Repeat crit with approp bump.
   - consider repeat egd at some point as hasnt had one since [**2119**]
   - check PM hct

   # Gout: Pt c/o L great toe pain likely [**3-13**] gout given h/o gout and
   holding colchicine previously secondary to renal failure.
   - restarted Colchicine, renally dosed
   .
   # LE edema: Pt had LLE edema greater than R concerning for DVT. LLE US
   negative for DVT but limited study due to agitation.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: Inactive on transplant list. Pt does not want
   liver transplant. Had nodules seen on U/S in [**Month (only) 2139**] enlarged in
   size.
   - Hold lasix and spironolactone given ARF
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old gentleman with alcoholic cirrhosis and portal hypertension, who underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. He has a history of thrombosed TIPS, which was revised recently. The patient is also known to have atrial fibrillation (AF) and is not anticoagulated due to coagulopathy. He presents with hypoxia, mental status changes, and potential infections.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 83 bpm with AF, blood pressure ranging from 169/149 mmHg to 204/171 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is agitated, repeating sentences, not oriented, and occasionally follows commands. Physical examination reveals a 2/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border, diminished breath sounds in the anterior lung fields, distended abdomen with fluid wave, trace bilateral lower extremity edema, and multiple ecchymosis spots on the skin.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, platelet count of 81 K/uL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose of 127 mg/dL, and sodium of 139 mEq/L. The patient's PT/PTT/INR values are elevated, as well as liver enzymes such as ALT/AST. Other findings include an elevated lactate level and abnormal arterial blood gas (ABG) values.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of aspiration event and shows signs of respiratory distress, with consolidations seen on chest X-ray. This could be due to pneumonia or another respiratory issue.

2. Mental status changes: The patient exhibits agitation, confusion, and disorientation. These symptoms could be attributed to multiple factors, including postoperative delirium, encephalopathy from patent TIPS, underlying cognitive dysfunction, or even alcohol withdrawal.

3. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and sepsis, indicated by low urine output (UOP), borderline low blood pressure, and elevated lactate levels.

4. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of thrombosed TIPS and recently underwent thrombolysis and angioplasty.

5. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level and has received blood transfusions.

6. Acute renal failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level and low UOP, which may suggest acute kidney injury.

7. Gout: The patient complains of left great toe pain, likely related to gout,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure due to portal hypertension and refractory ascites. He presented with hypoxia, which was initially thought to be due to aspiration, but further evaluation revealed right lower lobe (RLL) consolidations on chest X-ray. Other conditions include mental status changes, acute renal failure, gout, lower extremity edema, thrombocytopenia, chest pain, diabetes mellitus type 2, and fever/neutropenia. The patient's mental status changes are likely multifactorial and include postoperative delirium, encephalopathy from patent TIPS, and underlying cognitive dysfunction. He also has atrial fibrillation and is not anticoagulated due to coagulopathy. The patient's condition is unstable, and he requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient initially presented with hypoxia, which was initially thought to be due to aspiration. However, further evaluation revealed RLL consolidations, suggesting a possible pneumonia. The patient is receiving antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and may require intubation for sedation and further studies.

2. Mental status changes: The patient is experiencing mental status changes, which are likely multifactorial and include post"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including delirium tremens and seizures. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 169/149 to 66/21 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a SpO2 of 100%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows an atrial fibrillation rhythm, with a total intake of 1,500 mL and output of 345 mL. Fluid balance is positive at 1,155 mL. The patient has received a total of 1,000 mL of intravenous fluids and has had a blood transfusion of 50 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.5, and tidal volume of 6 mL/kg. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 213 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 20 mEq/L, base excess of -3 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Physical examination findings include decreased peripheral pulses, skin not assessed, and neurologic examination not performed due to the patient's unresponsiveness.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 3.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 24.8%, platelet (Plt) count of 81 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.3 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) level of 24 mg/dL, glucose level of 127 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes alcohol abuse and withdrawal symptoms. The patient is currently on prophylactic heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis, venous-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis, and is being closely monitored for any potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic heparin sodium is being administered to reduce this risk.

2. Venous-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. The patient's respiratory support and proper lung hygiene"

   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Hypoxia most likely secondary to
   aspiration given witnessed aspiration event, decreased O2 sats, new
   tachypnea, new infiltrate on CXR. Other less likely etiologies include
   PE, HPS. PE less likely since has been on anticoagulation, has INR>2,
   and HPS unlikely to have acute onset.
   - vanc/zosyn for HAP coverage with new infiltrate
   - intubate for sedation and further studies as likely to become more
   sick with developing infection and more altered without lactulose
   - ABG to trend lactate
   -consider CTA
   - prn nebs
   .
   # Mental status changes: Timing coincides with TIPS revision. Likely
   multifactorial secondary to post op delirium, encephalopathy from
   patent TIPS and lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction,
   and infection. Head CT negative for bleed but his ventricles were
   enlarged with ? communicating hydrocephalus. Per discussion with
   neurology, hydrocephalus unlikely cause of ms changes and is likely
   chronic. Head CT did not show any acute signs of hemorrhage which was
   concern while on anticoagulation. Patient is too agitated for MRI and
   would need to be intubated and sedated to get this done. Also concern
   for sepsis with low UOP, borderline low BPs, elevated lactate. On vanc
   zosyn now for asp pna and empiric sbp treatment. UA negative. Bld cx
   ordered.  Also on the differential will be alcohol withdrawal but less
   likely given time course, has been in hospital since [**1-21**] and only

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and portal hypertension. He underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure, but it became occluded and was revised with thrombolysis and angioplasty. The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure due to aspiration, mental status changes, hypotension, and anemia. He also has a pacemaker malfunction, acute renal failure, gout, lower extremity edema, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxia most likely secondary to aspiration. Other less likely etiologies include pulmonary embolism (PE) and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HPS). The patient requires intubation for sedation and further studies.

2. Mental status changes: The timing of the mental status changes coincides with the TIPS revision. Likely causes include post-operative delirium, encephalopathy from patent TIPS, lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction, and infection. The patient requires lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and further investigations are needed.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial and secondary to infection/sepsis, liver disease, concern for poor cardiac output, and possible pericardial effusion. Pressors (currently"

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient's medical history includes a history of alcohol abuse, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.

24-hour events:
- Transthoracic echo performed at 09:42 AM, which showed moderately dilated left and right atria, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular cavity size, low normal left ventricular ejection fraction, dilated right ventricular cavity with moderate global free wall hypokinesis, and abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
- Invasive ventilation started at 10:50 AM.
- Multi-lumen placed at 12:49 PM.
- Arterial line placed at 12:50 PM.
- Ultrasound performed at 02:39 PM.
- Paracentesis performed at 04:02 PM.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 68/48 mmHg to 98/52 mmHg.
2. Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough): The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 gentleman with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, refractory
   ascites s/p TIPS [**2119**] found to have occluded TIPS by U/S in [**12-18**] now
   s/p TIPS revision and prtal vein thrombolysis transferred with hypoxia
   and altered mental status.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Hypoxia most likely secondary to
   aspiration given witnessed aspiration event, decreased O2 sats, new
   tachypnea, new infiltrate on CXR. Other less likely etiologies include
   PE, HPS. PE less likely since has been on anticoagulation, has INR>2,
   and HPS unlikely to have acute onset.
   - vanc/zosyn for HAP coverage with new infiltrate
   - intubate for sedation and further studies as likely to become more
   sick with developing infection and more altered without lactulose
   - ABG to trend lactate
   -consider CTA
   - prn nebs
   .
   # Mental status changes: Timing coincides with TIPS revision. Likely
   multifactorial secondary to post op delirium, encephalopathy from
   patent TIPS and lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction,
   and infection. Head CT negative for bleed but his ventricles were
   enlarged with ? communicating hydrocephalus. Per discussion with
   neurology, hydrocephalus unlikely cause of ms changes and is likely
   chronic. Head CT did not show any acute signs of hemorrhage which was
   concern while on anticoagulation. Patient is too agitated for MRI and
   would need to be intubated and sedated to get this done. Also concern
   for sepsis with low UOP, borderline low BPs, elevated lactate. On vanc
   zosyn now for asp pna and empiric sbp treatment. UA negative. Bld cx
   ordered.  Also on the differential will be alcohol withdrawal but less
   likely given time course, has been in hospital since [**1-21**] and only

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, mental status changes, hypotension, and an occluded TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt). He underwent TIPS revision and portal vein thrombolysis. The patient's current conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, mental status changes, hypotension, potential sepsis, and possible hepatic hydrocephalus. The patient's vital signs are unstable, and he requires intubation for sedation and further studies. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxia most likely secondary to aspiration. Other less likely etiologies include pulmonary embolism (PE) and hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). 
2. Mental status changes: The timing coincides with TIPS revision, which could be due to postoperative delirium, encephalopathy from patent TIPS, lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction, and infection. 
3. Hypotension: It is likely multifactorial, secondary to infection/sepsis, liver disease, concern for poor cardiac output, and possible pericardial effusion. 
4. Potential sepsis: The patient has low urine output, borderline low blood pressures, elevated lactate, and new infiltrate on chest X-ray.

   Imaging
   TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is
   seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
   cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
   moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
   motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume
   overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets are moderately thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-10**]+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   moderately thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   The pulmonary artery pressure was not adequately determined. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
   CXR: ETT 4cm above carina, slight increased haziness on left, RIJ
   terminates in distal SVC
   Assessment and Plan
   71 gentleman with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, refractory
   ascites s/p TIPS [**2119**] found to have occluded TIPS by U/S in [**12-18**] now
   s/p TIPS revision [**2124-1-28**] and portal vein thrombolysis transferred
   with hypoxia and altered mental status.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Hypoxia most likely secondary to
   aspiration given witnessed aspiration event, decreased O2 sats, new
   tachypnea, infiltrates on CXR. [**Month (only) 51**] also have HAP although no fevers or
   elevated WBC. Also concerning for PE given RV dilation and hypokinesis.
   Pt had been anticoagulated until 3 days prior and INR >2.0, so PE less
   likely but has other clots (PV) and ? malignancy with nodules in liver
   so certainly could be hypercoagulable and embolize. Other less likely
   etiologies include HPS.
   - vanc/zosyn for HAP coverage
   - intubated now for obtaining studies, pressor and vent requirements
   - serial ABGS to trend lactate, has trended down
   - CTA today to eval for PE
   - No major changes with vent settings today but could decrease PEEP as
   tolerated which may help blood pressure
   .
   # Mental status changes: Timing coincides with TIPS revision. Likely
   multifactorial secondary to post op delirium, encephalopathy from
   patent TIPS and lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction,
   and possible infection. Head CT negative for bleed but his ventricles
   were enlarged with ? communicating hydrocephalus. Per discussion with
   neurology, hydrocephalus unlikely cause of ms changes and is likely
   chronic. Head CT did not show any acute signs of hemorrhage which was
   concern while on anticoagulation. Also concern for sepsis with low UOP,
   borderline low BPs, elevated lactate but these seem to be resolving. On
   vanc, zosyn now for asp pna and empiric sbp treatment. Para negative
   fro SBP. UA negative. Bld cx NGTD.  Also on the differential will be
   alcohol withdrawal but less likely given time course, has been in
   hospital since [**1-21**] and only received ativan after TIPS on [**1-28**].
   - lactulose and rifaximin once NGT (or OGT) placed
   - on fentanyl and versed for sedation, will titrate to avoid agitation
   and oversedation
   - vanc zosyn for above infection
   -  follow up blood cx, urine cx, ascetic cx, obtain sputum cx
   - could consider occluding TIPS if unable to reverse MS changes once
   NGT in place and lactulose given, infections being treated
   - GI to place NGT and scope
   .
   # Hypotension: Hypotension likely multifactorial secondary to
   infection/sepsis, liver disease, concern for poor cardiac output, ?
   pericardial effusion (Low voltage on ECG). UOP also low. Hypotension
   could also be related to PEEP or massive/submassive PE with RV dilation
   and hypokinesis. If PE on CTA will have to discuss anticoagulation
   management with heme.
   -          Continue pressors (currently on Levophed) titrate to MAP 65
   -          CTA to eval for PE with contrast load hydration with IVF
   with bicarb and NAC to decrease risk contrast nephropathy
   -          Broad ABx (Vanc/Zosyn)
   -          TTE
   -          Follow UOP
   -          Decrease PEEP as O2 sats tolerate
   # TIPS revision: Had revision [**1-28**]. Thrombolysis, angioplasty done
   with gradient of 6 after procedure was finished. Per IR, no need for
   heparin. Briefly on lovenox but discontinued since pt at risk for
   bleeding. RUQ us demonstrates flow but could not assess gradient since
   agitated.
   - F/U further IR recs
   - consider reversing tips due to gross encephalopathy
   .
   # Portal vein thrombosis: s/p thrombolysis and angioplasty.
   - no anti-coag for now, has INR>2.0
   # Pacemaker malfunction/ECG changes: Pacemaker not functioning properly
   per EP secondary to microdislodgement of RV lead per EP.  Has a history
   of high grade AVB.  Needs lead revision before discharge. If intubated,
   EP may be able to do sooner rather than waiting for MS to clear. Also
   has TWI in anterior leads, ruled out day prior to transfer
   - appreciate EP recs
   - no nodal agents
   - telemetry
   - daily EGS
   .
   # Anemia: Transfused 1 unit on this admission, HCT relatively stable
   since around baseline and bumped appropriately to I unit. No EGD since
   [**2119**]. Theoretically, if TIPS patent would not need prophylaxis for
   varices but TIPS gradient unknown. If HCT decreases, will consider
   checking [**Hospital1 7**] HCTS
   - Repeat egd by GI today with placement of NGT, unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4544**] of
   varices
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr~1. Cr has slowly trended up last
   24-36 hours, 1.4 today likely from hypotension and decreased renal
   perfusion. Urine lytes consistent with prerenal state. HRS also
   consideration but would expect urine Na<10
   - holding lasix and spironolactone
   - NS boluses prn low UOP
   - maintain MAP 65 to maintaijn perfusion pressure

   Assessment and Plan
   71 gentleman with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, refractory
   ascites s/p TIPS [**2119**] found to have occluded TIPS by U/S in [**12-18**] now
   s/p TIPS revision [**2124-1-28**] and portal vein thrombolysis transferred
   with hypoxia and altered mental status.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Hypoxia most likely secondary to
   aspiration given witnessed aspiration event, decreased O2 sats, new
   tachypnea, infiltrates on CXR. [**Month (only) 51**] also have HAP although no fevers or
   elevated WBC. Also concerning for PE given RV dilation and hypokinesis.
   Pt had been anticoagulated until 3 days prior and INR >2.0, so PE less
   likely but has other clots (PV) and ? malignancy with nodules in liver
   so certainly could be hypercoagulable and embolize. Other less likely
   etiologies include HPS.
   - vanc/zosyn for HAP coverage
   - intubated now for obtaining studies, pressor and vent requirements
   - serial ABGS to trend lactate, has trended down
   - CTA today to eval for PE
   - No major changes with vent settings today but could decrease PEEP as
   tolerated which may help blood pressure
   .
   # Mental status changes: Timing coincides with TIPS revision. Likely
   multifactorial secondary to post op delirium, encephalopathy from
   patent TIPS and lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction,
   and possible infection. Head CT negative for bleed but his ventricles
   were enlarged with ? communicating hydrocephalus. Per discussion with
   neurology, hydrocephalus unlikely cause of ms changes and is likely
   chronic. Head CT did not show any acute signs of hemorrhage which was
   concern while on anticoagulation. Also concern for sepsis with low UOP,
   borderline low BPs, elevated lactate but these seem to be resolving. On
   vanc, zosyn now for asp pna and empiric sbp treatment. Para negative
   fro SBP. UA negative. Bld cx NGTD.  Also on the differential will be
   alcohol withdrawal but less likely given time course, has been in
   hospital since [**1-21**] and only received ativan after TIPS on [**1-28**].
   - lactulose and rifaximin once NGT (or OGT) placed
   - on fentanyl and versed for sedation, will titrate to avoid agitation
   and oversedation
   - vanc zosyn for above infection
   -  follow up blood cx, urine cx, ascetic cx, obtain sputum cx
   - could consider occluding TIPS if unable to reverse MS changes once
   NGT in place and lactulose given, infections being treated
   - GI to place NGT and scope
   .
   # Hypotension: Hypotension likely multifactorial secondary to
   infection/sepsis, liver disease, concern for poor cardiac output, ?
   pericardial effusion (Low voltage on ECG). UOP also low. Hypotension
   could also be related to PEEP or massive/submassive PE with RV dilation
   and hypokinesis. If PE on CTA will have to discuss anticoagulation
   management with heme.
   -          Continue pressors (currently on Levophed) titrate to MAP 65
   -          CTA to eval for PE with contrast load hydration with IVF
   with bicarb and NAC to decrease risk contrast nephropathy
   -          Broad ABx (Vanc/Zosyn)
   -          TTE
   -          Follow UOP
   -          Decrease PEEP as O2 sats tolerate
   # TIPS revision: Had revision [**1-28**]. Thrombolysis, angioplasty done
   with gradient of 6 after procedure was finished. Per IR, no need for
   heparin. Briefly on lovenox but discontinued since pt at risk for
   bleeding. RUQ us demonstrates flow but could not assess gradient since
   agitated.
   - F/U further IR recs
   - consider reversing tips due to gross encephalopathy
   .
   # Portal vein thrombosis: s/p thrombolysis and angioplasty.
   - no anti-coag for now, has INR>2.0
   # Pacemaker malfunction/ECG changes: Pacemaker not functioning properly
   per EP secondary to microdislodgement of RV lead per EP.  Has a history
   of high grade AVB.  Needs lead revision before discharge. If intubated,
   EP may be able to do sooner rather than waiting for MS to clear. Also
   has TWI in anterior leads, ruled out day prior to transfer
   - appreciate EP recs
   - no nodal agents
   - telemetry
   - daily EGS
   .
   # Anemia: Transfused 1 unit on this admission, HCT relatively stable
   since around baseline and bumped appropriately to I unit. No EGD since
   [**2119**]. Theoretically, if TIPS patent would not need prophylaxis for
   varices but TIPS gradient unknown. If HCT decreases, will consider
   checking [**Hospital1 7**] HCTS
   - Repeat egd by GI today with placement of NGT, unclear [**Name2 (NI) 4544**] of
   varices
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr~1. Cr has slowly trended up last
   24-36 hours, 1.4 today likely from hypotension and decreased renal
   perfusion. Urine lytes consistent with prerenal state. HRS also
   consideration but would expect urine Na<10
   - holding lasix and spironolactone
   - NS boluses prn low UOP
   - maintain MAP 65 to maintaijn perfusion pressure
   - check urine lytes
   - [**Hospital1 7**] albumin
   .
   # Gout: On Colchicine
   .
   # LE edema: Pt had LLE edema greater than R concerning for DVT. LLE US
   negative for DVT but limited study due to agitation.
   - continue to monitor
   - repeat LENIS including UEs since has UE edema
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: Inactive on transplant list. Pt does not want
   liver transplant.
   - Hold lasix and spironolactone given ARF
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin  once NGT placed
   - egd to assess for varices since he has not had one since [**2119**]
   - appreciate hepatology recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt count stabilized, c/w prior baseline 80s-100s
   - continue to monitor

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old gentleman with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure and altered mental status. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated for respiratory support. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing, which is likely secondary to aspiration given the witnessed aspiration event, new infiltrates on chest X-ray, and hypoxia. There is also a possibility of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and pulmonary embolism (PE), although the latter is less likely due to recent anticoagulation and an INR >2.0.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status changes coincide with the TIPS revision procedure. It is likely multifactorial, caused by postoperative delirium, encephalopathy from a patent TIPS, lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction, and possible infection. The head CT did not show any signs of hemorrhage, and the possibility of sepsis is being considered.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely multifactorial, secondary to infection/sepsis, liver disease, concern for poor cardiac output, and possibly a massive or submassive PE with RV dilation and hypokinesis. Further evaluation with a CTA will be done to assess for PE, and management"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and alcohol withdrawal. They were admitted to the ICU with hypotension, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and altered nutrition. The patient's condition indicates the risk of aspiration, altered airway clearance, and cough due to their inability to protect their airway. There are also concerns about impaired wound healing and potential complications related to their medical history.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Pneumonia: Due to the patient's impaired ability to clear secretions and protect their airway, they are at risk of developing pneumonia.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased blood flow can increase the risk of blood clots forming in the deep veins, potentially leading to DVT.

3. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, especially if they are immobilized or lying in one position for extended periods.

4. Delirium or worsening mental status: The patient's altered mental status could progress to delirium, making it important to monitor their cognitive function closely.

5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to diabetes and alcohol withdrawal may make them more susceptible to infections, including hospital-acquired infections.

6. Respiratory failure: The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 gentleman with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, refractory
   ascites s/p TIPS [**2119**] found to have occluded TIPS by U/S in [**12-18**] now
   s/p TIPS revision [**2124-1-28**] and portal vein thrombolysis transferred
   with hypoxia and altered mental status now intubated with persistent
   hypotension and pressor requirement.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Hypoxia most likely secondary to
   aspiration given witnessed aspiration event, decreased O2 sats, new
   tachypnea, infiltrates on CXR. HAP less likely since no fever or
   elevated WBC. Also concerning for PE given RV dilation and hypokinesis
   but none seen on CTA. Other less likely etiologies include HPS.
   - will d/c vanc/zosyn for HAP coverage since no clear indication and
   may be causing drug reaction
   - would continue current vent settings for now
   - serial ABGS to trend lactate, monitor oxygenation and ventilation
   - CTA today to eval for PE
   .
   # Mental status changes: Timing coincides with TIPS revision. Likely
   multifactorial secondary to post op delirium, encephalopathy from
   patent TIPS and lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction,
   and possible infection. Head CT negative for bleed but his ventricles
   were enlarged with ? communicating hydrocephalus. Per discussion with
   neurology, hydrocephalus unlikely cause of ms changes and is likely
   chronic. Head CT did not show any acute signs of hemorrhage which was
   concern while on anticoagulation. Also concern for sepsis with low UOP,
   borderline low BPs. On vanc, zosyn now for asp pna and empiric sbp
   treatment but will stop since no cx data, no fevers and may be causing
   adverse reaction with rash. Para negative for SBP. UA negative. Bld cx
   NGTD.  Also on the differential will be alcohol withdrawal but less
   likely given time course, has been in hospital since [**1-21**] and only
   received ativan after TIPS on [**1-28**].
   - unable to treat encephalopathy without NGT
   - on fentanyl and versed for sedation, will titrate to avoid agitation
   and oversedation
   -  follow up blood cx, urine cx, ascetic cx, obtain sputum cx and
   restart abx if indicated
   - could consider occluding TIPS if unable to reverse MS changes but
   family not interested in invasive procedures
   .
   # Hypotension: Hypotension likely multifactorial secondary to liver
   disease, ventilator and PEEP, RV impairment, infection/sepsis.
   -          Continue pressors (currently on Levophed) titrate to lower
   MAP 60s
   -          would not add second pressor without family discussion
   regarding management, just bolus for now, accept lower BPs
   -          Follow UOP
   # TIPS revision: Had revision [**1-28**]. Thrombolysis, angioplasty done
   with gradient of 6 after procedure was finished. Per IR, no need for
   heparin. Briefly on lovenox but discontinued since pt at risk for
   bleeding. RUQ us demonstrates flow but could not assess gradient since
   agitated.
   - F/U further IR recs
   - consider reversing tips due to gross encephalopathy  but pt
s family
   does not want further invasive procedures
   .
   # Portal vein thrombosis: s/p thrombolysis and angioplasty.
   - no anti-coag for now, has INR>2.0
   # Pacemaker malfunction/ECG changes: Pacemaker not functioning properly
   per EP secondary to microdislodgement of RV lead per EP.  Has a history
   of high grade AVB.  If recovers, will need lead revision.
   - appreciate EP recs
   - no nodal agents
   - telemetry
   # Anemia: Transfused 1 unit on this admission, HCT relatively stable
   since around baseline and bumped appropriately to I unit. No EGD since
   [**2119**]. Theoretically, if TIPS patent would not need prophylaxis for
   varices but TIPS gradient unknown. If HCT decreases, will consider
   checking [**Hospital1 7**] HCTS
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr~1. Cr stable to improved, 1 today.
   Has had good UOP last 24 hours, requiring boluses x 2 for low UOP and
   BP but seems to respond well to this.
   - holding lasix and spironolactone
   - NS boluses prn low UOP
   - maintain MAP 60s to maintaijn perfusion pressure
   - [**Hospital1 7**] albumin
   .
   # Gout: On Colchicine
   .
   # LE edema: Pt had LLE edema greater than R concerning for DVT. LLE US
   negative for DVT but limited study due to agitation.
   LENIS negative for DVT
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: Inactive on transplant list.
   - Hold lasix and spironolactone given ARF
   - appreciate hepatology recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt count stabilized, c/w prior baseline 80s-100s

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and portal hypertension who underwent a TIPS procedure but had an occluded TIPS and subsequently underwent a revision and portal vein thrombolysis.
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a decreased PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
- He has hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration, as well as possible pulmonary embolism (PE) but with negative CTA.
- The patient's mental status changes coincide with the TIPS revision and may be due to postoperative delirium, encephalopathy from patent TIPS, lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction, and possible infection.
- The patient has hypotension, likely multifactorial, and is on vasopressor support.
- There is a concern for sepsis, but no clear source of infection has been identified.
- The patient's anemia is stable, and renal function has improved.
- Other issues include gout, lower extremity edema, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and alcoholic cirrhosis.
- The patient's family has requested no further invasive procedures or escalation of care, and the patient has made a DNR/DNI status.
- The patient is unable to feed due to the inability to place a nasogastric tube.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 gentleman with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, refractory
   ascites s/p TIPS [**2119**] found to have occluded TIPS by U/S in [**12-18**] now
   s/p TIPS revision [**2124-1-28**] and portal vein thrombolysis transferred
   with hypoxia and altered mental status now intubated with persistent
   hypotension and pressor requirement.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Hypoxia most likely secondary to
   aspiration given witnessed aspiration event, decreased O2 sats, new
   tachypnea, infiltrates on CXR. HAP less likely since no fever or
   elevated WBC. CTA negative for PE. Other less likely etiologies include
   HPS.  Finally, his respiratory support is in question at this point
   pending family meeting to discuss what their goals of care are, and
   whether extubation is within their wishes.
   - will d/c vanc/zosyn for HAP coverage since no clear indication and
   may be causing drug reaction
   - would continue to try and switch to PS and wean as tolerated, not to
   plan on extubating but to assess pulmonary status
   - ABGS as needed
   .
   # Mental status changes: Timing coincides with TIPS revision. Likely
   multifactorial secondary to post op delirium, encephalopathy from
   patent TIPS and lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction,
   and possible infection. Head CT negative for bleed but his ventricles
   were enlarged with ? communicating hydrocephalus. Per discussion with
   neurology, hydrocephalus unlikely cause of ms changes and is likely
   chronic. Head CT did not show any acute signs of hemorrhage which was
   concern while on anticoagulation. Also concern for sepsis with low UOP,
   borderline low BPs. On vanc, zosyn now for asp pna and empiric sbp
   treatment but will stop since no cx data, no fevers and may be causing
   adverse reaction with rash. Para negative for SBP. UA negative. Bld cx
   NGTD.  At this point the only issue not addressed is lactulose for
   encephalopathy, which is impossible without NGT placement. Family
   meeting will take place today to discuss goals of care and whether NGT
   is within their wishes.
   - unable to treat encephalopathy without NGT
   - on fentanyl and versed for sedation, will titrate to avoid agitation
   and oversedation
   -  follow up blood cx, urine cx, ascetic cx, obtain sputum cx and
   restart abx if indicated
   .
   # Hypotension: Hypotension likely multifactorial secondary to liver
   disease, ventilator and PEEP, RV impairment, infection/sepsis.
   -          Continue pressors (currently on Levophed) titrate to lower
   MAP 60s
   -          would not add second pressor without family discussion
   regarding management, just bolus for now, accept lower BPs
   -          Follow UOP
   # TIPS revision: Had revision [**1-28**]. Thrombolysis, angioplasty done
   with gradient of 6 after procedure was finished. Per IR, no need for
   heparin. Briefly on lovenox but discontinued since pt at risk for
   bleeding. RUQ us demonstrates flow but could not assess gradient since
   agitated.
   - F/U further IR recs
   - consider reversing tips due to gross encephalopathy  but pt
s family
   does not want further invasive procedures
   .
   # Portal vein thrombosis: s/p thrombolysis and angioplasty.
   - no anti-coag for now, has INR>2.0
   # Pacemaker malfunction/ECG changes: Pacemaker not functioning properly
   per EP secondary to microdislodgement of RV lead per EP.  Has a history
   of high grade AVB.  If recovers, will need lead revision.
   - appreciate EP recs
   - no nodal agents
   - telemetry
   # Anemia: Transfused 1 unit on this admission, HCT relatively stable
   since around baseline and bumped appropriately to I unit. No EGD since
   [**2119**]. Theoretically, if TIPS patent would not need prophylaxis for
   varices but TIPS gradient unknown. If HCT decreases, will consider
   checking [**Hospital1 7**] HCTS
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr~1. Cr stable to improved, 1 today.
   Has had good UOP last 24 hours, requiring boluses x 2 for low UOP and
   BP but seems to respond well to this.
   - holding lasix and spironolactone
   - NS boluses prn low UOP
   - maintain MAP 60s to maintaijn perfusion pressure
   - [**Hospital1 7**] albumin

   # Gout: On Colchicine

   # LE edema: Pt had LLE edema greater than R concerning for DVT. LLE US
   negative for DVT but limited study due to agitation.
   LENIS negative for DVT

   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: Inactive on transplant list.
   - Hold lasix and spironolactone given ARF
   - appreciate hepatology recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and portal hypertension. He underwent TIPS revision and portal vein thrombolysis but continues to experience hypoxemic respiratory failure, mental status changes, hypotension, and other complications. The patient's family is considering making him a comfort measure-only patient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxia most likely secondary to aspiration. Other less likely etiologies include HPS. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, but the need for continued respiratory support is uncertain pending family discussion.

2. Mental Status Changes: The timing of the mental status changes coincides with the TIPS revision. The cause is likely multifactorial, including post-operative delirium, encephalopathy from patent TIPS, lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction, and possible infection. Chronic hydrocephalus has been ruled out, and there is no evidence of hemorrhage.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, resulting from liver disease, ventilator and PEEP, right ventricular impairment, and infection/sepsis. Pressors are being used to maintain a MAP in the 60s, but further discussion with the family is needed regarding management.

4. TIPS Revision: The patient had a TIPS revision with thrombolysis and angioplasty. Although the gradient improved, the patient's gross encephalopathy may require further intervention. However, the family does not want any additional invasive procedures.

5. Portal Vein Thrombosis: The patient underwent thrombolysis and angioplasty for portal vein thrombosis. Anticoagulation is not recommended due to the patient's high INR.

6. Pacemaker Malfunction/ECG Changes: The patient's pacemaker is not functioning properly, and there are ECG changes. A lead revision may be necessary if the pacemaker recovers.

7. Anemia: The patient has received blood transfusions and requires further monitoring of hemoglobin levels.

8. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was around 1.0, which has improved to 1.1. Good urine output has been maintained with NS boluses as needed.

9. Gout: The patient is on colchicine for gout.

10. Lower Extremity Edema: The patient has left lower extremity edema, which could be concerning for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, the US study was limited due to agitation.

11. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient's alcoholic cirrhosis is inactive on the transplant list.

12. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has stabilized and is within the normal range.

13. DM2: The patient requires maintenance glycemic control with insulin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, type II, alcohol abuse, and chronic kidney disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and analgesics. The patient's condition has been stable with no major complications until the arterial line stopped working at 12:00 AM. The family has expressed their intention to pursue comfort measures only (CMO) if the patient's condition worsens. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of blood clots, which can lead to DVT and potentially PE.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could progress to delirium, especially due to the use of sedatives and the ICU environment.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential hypotension, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. Renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, and his renal function is currently impaired, increasing the risk of acute renal failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 gentleman with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, refractory
   ascites s/p TIPS [**2119**] found to have occluded TIPS by U/S in [**12-18**] now
   s/p TIPS revision [**2124-1-28**] and portal vein thrombolysis transferred
   with hypoxia and altered mental status now intubated with persistent
   hypotension and pressor requirement.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Hypoxia most likely secondary to
   aspiration given witnessed aspiration event, decreased O2 sats, new
   tachypnea, infiltrates on CXR. HAP less likely since no fever or
   elevated WBC. Also concerning for PE given RV dilation and hypokinesis
   but none seen on CTA. Other less likely etiologies include HPS.
   - will d/c vanc/zosyn for HAP coverage since no clear indication and
   may be causing drug reaction
   - would continue current vent settings for now
   - serial ABGS to trend lactate, monitor oxygenation and ventilation
   - CTA today to eval for PE
   .
   # Mental status changes: Timing coincides with TIPS revision. Likely
   multifactorial secondary to post op delirium, encephalopathy from
   patent TIPS and lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction,
   and possible infection. Head CT negative for bleed but his ventricles
   were enlarged with ? communicating hydrocephalus. Per discussion with
   neurology, hydrocephalus unlikely cause of ms changes and is likely
   chronic. Head CT did not show any acute signs of hemorrhage which was
   concern while on anticoagulation. Also concern for sepsis with low UOP,
   borderline low BPs. On vanc, zosyn now for asp pna and empiric sbp
   treatment but will stop since no cx data, no fevers and may be causing
   adverse reaction with rash. Para negative for SBP. UA negative. Bld cx
   NGTD.  Also on the differential will be alcohol withdrawal but less
   likely given time course, has been in hospital since [**1-21**] and only
   received ativan after TIPS on [**1-28**].
   - unable to treat encephalopathy without NGT
   - on fentanyl and versed for sedation, will titrate to avoid agitation
   and oversedation
   -  follow up blood cx, urine cx, ascetic cx, obtain sputum cx and
   restart abx if indicated
   - could consider occluding TIPS if unable to reverse MS changes but
   family not interested in invasive procedures
   .
   # Hypotension: Hypotension likely multifactorial secondary to liver
   disease, ventilator and PEEP, RV impairment, infection/sepsis.
   -          Continue pressors (currently on Levophed) titrate to lower
   MAP 60s
   -          would not add second pressor without family discussion
   regarding management, just bolus for now, accept lower BPs
   -          Follow UOP
   # TIPS revision: Had revision [**1-28**]. Thrombolysis, angioplasty done
   with gradient of 6 after procedure was finished. Per IR, no need for
   heparin. Briefly on lovenox but discontinued since pt at risk for
   bleeding. RUQ us demonstrates flow but could not assess gradient since
   agitated.
   - F/U further IR recs
   - consider reversing tips due to gross encephalopathy  but pt
s family
   does not want further invasive procedures
   .
   # Portal vein thrombosis: s/p thrombolysis and angioplasty.
   - no anti-coag for now, has INR>2.0
   # Pacemaker malfunction/ECG changes: Pacemaker not functioning properly
   per EP secondary to microdislodgement of RV lead per EP.  Has a history
   of high grade AVB.  If recovers, will need lead revision.
   - appreciate EP recs
   - no nodal agents
   - telemetry
   # Anemia: Transfused 1 unit on this admission, HCT relatively stable
   since around baseline and bumped appropriately to I unit. No EGD since
   [**2119**]. Theoretically, if TIPS patent would not need prophylaxis for
   varices but TIPS gradient unknown. If HCT decreases, will consider
   checking [**Hospital1 7**] HCTS
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr~1. Cr stable to improved, 1 today.
   Has had good UOP last 24 hours, requiring boluses x 2 for low UOP and
   BP but seems to respond well to this.
   - holding lasix and spironolactone
   - NS boluses prn low UOP
   - maintain MAP 60s to maintaijn perfusion pressure
   - [**Hospital1 7**] albumin
   .
   # Gout: On Colchicine
   .
   # LE edema: Pt had LLE edema greater than R concerning for DVT. LLE US
   negative for DVT but limited study due to agitation.
   LENIS negative for DVT
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: Inactive on transplant list.
   - Hold lasix and spironolactone given ARF
   - appreciate hepatology recs

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure and mental status changes. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has hypotension requiring vasopressor support, thrombocytopenia, anemia, acute renal failure, gout, lower extremity edema, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has undergone TIPS revision and portal vein thrombolysis. The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and colchicine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia is most likely secondary to aspiration given the witnessed aspiration event, decreased O2 saturation, new tachypnea, and infiltrates on CXR. HAP is less likely since there is no fever or elevated WBC. The patient may require further evaluation for PE with a CTA today.
2. Mental status changes: The timing of the mental status changes coincides with the TIPS revision. They are likely multifactorial, secondary to post-op delirium, encephalopathy from patent TIPS, lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction, and possible infection. A head CT was negative for bleed but showed enlarged ventricles with possible communicating hydrocephalus. Further investigation is needed, including blood cultures, urine cultures,"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 gentleman with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, refractory
   ascites s/p TIPS [**2119**] found to have occluded TIPS by U/S in [**12-18**] now
   s/p TIPS revision [**2124-1-28**] and portal vein thrombolysis transferred
   with hypoxia and altered mental status now intubated with persistent
   hypotension and pressor requirement.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Hypoxia most likely secondary to
   aspiration given witnessed aspiration event, decreased O2 sats, new
   tachypnea, infiltrates on CXR. HAP less likely since no fever or
   elevated WBC. CTA negative for PE. Other less likely etiologies include
   HPS.  Finally, his respiratory support is in question at this point
   pending family meeting to discuss what their goals of care are, and
   whether extubation is within their wishes.
   - will d/c vanc/zosyn for HAP coverage since no clear indication and
   may be causing drug reaction
   - would continue to try and switch to PS and wean as tolerated, not to
   plan on extubating but to assess pulmonary status
   - ABGS as needed
   .
   # Mental status changes: Timing coincides with TIPS revision. Likely
   multifactorial secondary to post op delirium, encephalopathy from
   patent TIPS and lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction,
   and possible infection. Head CT negative for bleed but his ventricles
   were enlarged with ? communicating hydrocephalus. Per discussion with
   neurology, hydrocephalus unlikely cause of ms changes and is likely
   chronic. Head CT did not show any acute signs of hemorrhage which was
   concern while on anticoagulation. Also concern for sepsis with low UOP,
   borderline low BPs. On vanc, zosyn now for asp pna and empiric sbp
   treatment but will stop since no cx data, no fevers and may be causing
   adverse reaction with rash. Para negative for SBP. UA negative. Bld cx
   NGTD.  At this point the only issue not addressed is lactulose for
   encephalopathy, which is impossible without NGT placement. Family
   meeting will take place today to discuss goals of care and whether NGT
   is within their wishes.
   - unable to treat encephalopathy without NGT
   - on fentanyl and versed for sedation, will titrate to avoid agitation
   and oversedation
   -  follow up pending cultures
   - discuss w/family if EGD to place NGT is ok
   .
   # Hypotension: Hypotension likely multifactorial secondary to liver
   disease, ventilator and PEEP, RV impairment, infection/sepsis.  He
   continues to require pressors and has minimal UOP (20-30cc/hr). Will
   add on a second pressor today and continue to monitor.  There is
   question whether A line is [**Location (un) **] accurately.
   -          Continue levophed, add vasopressin
   -          Bolus NS
   -          Follow UOP
   -          ? [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1619**] [**Location (un) **] may be positional, correlate with NBP
   .
   # TIPS revision: Had revision [**1-28**]. Thrombolysis, angioplasty done
   with gradient of 6 after procedure was finished. Per IR, no need for
   heparin. Briefly on lovenox but discontinued since pt at risk for
   bleeding. RUQ US demonstrates flow but could not assess gradient since
   agitated.
   - F/U further IR recs
   - will likely not undergo reversal given family
s wishes to avoid
   invasive procedures
   .
   # Portal vein thrombosis: s/p thrombolysis and angioplasty.
   - no anti-coag for now, has INR>2.0
   # Pacemaker malfunction/ECG changes: Pacemaker not functioning properly
   per EP secondary to microdislodgement of RV lead per EP.  Has a history
   of high grade AVB.  No revision at this time.
   - appreciate EP recs
   - no nodal agents
   - telemetry
   # Anemia: Transfused 1 unit on this admission, HCT relatively stable
   since around baseline and bumped appropriately to I unit. No EGD since
   [**2119**]. Theoretically, if TIPS patent would not need prophylaxis for
   varices but TIPS gradient unknown. If HCT decreases, will consider
   checking [**Hospital1 7**] HCTS
   -stable
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr~1. Cr stable to improved, 1 today.
   To maintain minimal UOP requires bolus NS and continued pressors. Will
   monitor at this time and add vasopressing.
   - holding lasix and spironolactone
   - NS boluses prn low UOP
   - maintain MAP 60s to maintaijn perfusion pressure
   - [**Hospital1 7**] albumin
   .
   # Gout: On Colchicine
   .
   # LE edema: Pt had LLE edema greater than R concerning for DVT. LLE US
   negative for DVT but limited study due to agitation.
   LENIS negative for DVT
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: Inactive on transplant list.
   - Hold lasix and spironolactone given ARF
   - appreciate hepatology recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, and withdrawal who was admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia. The patient has been on invasive ventilation since admission and has experienced multiple complications, including acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, inability to protect airway, altered mental status, and alteration in nutrition. The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.5 C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 57/28 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is also on comfort measures only and has a code status of do not resuscitate.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is on invasive ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-associated events such as barotrauma or volutrauma due to high pressures.

2. Renal Failure: The patient already has acute renal failure, which may worsen if proper renal function is not maintained. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and poor wound healing.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 gentleman with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, refractory
   ascites s/p TIPS [**2119**] found to have occluded TIPS by U/S in [**12-18**] now
   s/p TIPS revision [**2124-1-28**] and portal vein thrombolysis transferred
   with hypoxia and altered mental status now intubated with persistent
   hypotension and pressor requirement.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Hypoxia most likely secondary to
   aspiration given witnessed aspiration event, decreased O2 sats, new
   tachypnea, infiltrates on CXR. HAP less likely since no fever or
   elevated WBC. CTA negative for PE. Other less likely etiologies include
   HPS.  Finally, his respiratory support is in question at this point
   pending family meeting to discuss what their goals of care are, and
   whether extubation is within their wishes.
   - will d/c vanc/zosyn for HAP coverage since no clear indication and
   may be causing drug reaction
   - would continue to try and switch to PS and wean as tolerated, not to
   plan on extubating but to assess pulmonary status
   - ABGS as needed
   .
   # Mental status changes: Timing coincides with TIPS revision. Likely
   multifactorial secondary to post op delirium, encephalopathy from
   patent TIPS and lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction,
   and possible infection. Head CT negative for bleed but his ventricles
   were enlarged with ? communicating hydrocephalus. Per discussion with
   neurology, hydrocephalus unlikely cause of ms changes and is likely
   chronic. Head CT did not show any acute signs of hemorrhage which was
   concern while on anticoagulation. Also concern for sepsis with low UOP,
   borderline low BPs. On vanc, zosyn now for asp pna and empiric sbp
   treatment but will stop since no cx data, no fevers and may be causing
   adverse reaction with rash. Para negative for SBP. UA negative. Bld cx
   NGTD.  At this point the only issue not addressed is lactulose for
   encephalopathy, which is impossible without NGT placement. Family
   meeting will take place today to discuss goals of care and whether NGT
   is within their wishes.
   - unable to treat encephalopathy without NGT
   - on fentanyl and versed for sedation, will titrate to avoid agitation
   and oversedation
   -  follow up pending cultures
   - discuss w/family if EGD to place NGT is ok
   .
   # Hypotension: Hypotension likely multifactorial secondary to liver
   disease, ventilator and PEEP, RV impairment, infection/sepsis.  He
   continues to require pressors and has minimal UOP (20-30cc/hr). Will
   add on a second pressor today and continue to monitor.  There is
   question whether A line is [**Location (un) **] accurately.
   -          Continue levophed, add vasopressin
   -          Bolus NS
   -          Follow UOP
   -          ? [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1619**] [**Location (un) **] may be positional, correlate with NBP
   .
   # TIPS revision: Had revision [**1-28**]. Thrombolysis, angioplasty done
   with gradient of 6 after procedure was finished. Per IR, no need for
   heparin. Briefly on lovenox but discontinued since pt at risk for
   bleeding. RUQ US demonstrates flow but could not assess gradient since
   agitated.
   - F/U further IR recs
   - will likely not undergo reversal given family
s wishes to avoid
   invasive procedures
   .
   # Portal vein thrombosis: s/p thrombolysis and angioplasty.
   - no anti-coag for now, has INR>2.0
   # Pacemaker malfunction/ECG changes: Pacemaker not functioning properly
   per EP secondary to microdislodgement of RV lead per EP.  Has a history
   of high grade AVB.  No revision at this time.
   - appreciate EP recs
   - no nodal agents
   - telemetry
   # Anemia: Transfused 1 unit on this admission, HCT relatively stable
   since around baseline and bumped appropriately to I unit. No EGD since
   [**2119**]. Theoretically, if TIPS patent would not need prophylaxis for
   varices but TIPS gradient unknown. If HCT decreases, will consider
   checking [**Hospital1 7**] HCTS
   -stable
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr~1. Cr stable to improved, 1 today.
   To maintain minimal UOP requires bolus NS and continued pressors. Will
   monitor at this time and add vasopressing.
   - holding lasix and spironolactone
   - NS boluses prn low UOP
   - maintain MAP 60s to maintaijn perfusion pressure
   - [**Hospital1 7**] albumin
   .
   # Gout: On Colchicine
   .
   # LE edema: Pt had LLE edema greater than R concerning for DVT. LLE US
   negative for DVT but limited study due to agitation.
   LENIS negative for DVT
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: Inactive on transplant list.
   - Hold lasix and spironolactone given ARF
   - appreciate hepatology recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis, who had undergone TIPS revision and portal vein thrombolysis. He is currently intubated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly secondary to aspiration. The patient also has mental status changes, likely multifactorial, including post-operative delirium and encephalopathy from a patent TIPS. He requires pressors for hypotension, possibly due to liver disease, ventilator, and PEEP. There is a question regarding the accuracy of an arterial line placement. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, anemia, acute renal failure, gout, lower extremity edema, thrombocytopenia, and DNR/DNI status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially requiring increased ventilatory support or extracorporeal life support.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, such as hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia, due to intubation and immunosuppression.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which can worsen without appropriate lactulose therapy.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if fluid and electrolyte balance is not carefully managed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is the inability to protect their airway, which resulted in invasive ventilation being stopped at 03:30 PM. The patient was extubated and the family is at the bedside. 

The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and underwent TIPS revision with portal vein thrombolysis on [**1-28**]. They also have mental status changes that coincide with the TIPS revision, which are likely multifactorial secondary to post-operative delirium, encephalopathy from a patent TIPS, lack of lactulose, underlying cognitive dysfunction, and possible infection. A head CT showed enlarged ventricles with a possible communicating hydrocephalus, but neurology believes it is chronic and not the cause of the mental status changes. There are no acute signs of hemorrhage on the head CT, and the patient is off anticoagulation. 

The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension, for which they were made comfort measures only (CMO) yesterday and extubated. They appear comfortable with minimal urine output (0-5 cc per hour) and are on fentanyl drip. 

The patient also has anemia and required transfusion of one unit during this admission. Their hematocrit (HCT) is relatively stable and has been appropriately bumped to an additional unit. 

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, with baseline creatinine (Cr) around 1"
