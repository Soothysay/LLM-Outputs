   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old woman with immunodeficiency on IVIG, COPD, dyslipidemia, ?
   h/o CVA, tobacco abuse and DM2 was found
   unresponsive.
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Unclear etiology.  Could be secondary to
   SIRS. Urine was suspicous for UTI.  Need to rule out CVA.  Seizure is
   unlikely even though CKs are elevated.  Serum tox screen is negative.
   Worsened renal function raises the suspcion for renally cleared
   medications contributing to this.
   - appreciate neurology recs
   - LP results, prelim not consistent with infection/inflammation
   - MRA/DW to evaluate for CVA

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including immunodeficiency, COPD, dyslipidemia, history of CVA, tobacco abuse, and DM2.
- She was found unresponsive and has altered mental status with an unclear etiology. Possible causes include SIRS, UTI, or CVA. Serum tox screen is negative.
- The patient's worsened renal function raises suspicion for renally cleared medications contributing to her condition.
- Other assessments include fever, leukocytosis, elevated lactate (suggestive of sepsis), intubation for airway protection, acute renal failure, elevated CK (possibly due to recent seizure), and elevated liver function tests (AST markedly elevated than ALT).
- The patient is currently in sinus rhythm after experiencing atrial fibrillation, and there is a need for anticoagulation given mental status change.
- Other ongoing issues include COPD, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, chronic back pain, depression, and the need for repletion of electrolytes and hydration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate suggest the possibility of sepsis. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection and provide appropriate antibiotic treatment.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Suspicion for UTI arises from the patient's altered mental status and the presence of urine"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Parkinson's disease, acute renal failure, and multi-lumen lines placed. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 112/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal ventilation with FiO2 set at 40%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous lines can increase the risk of developing DVT, a blood clot in the deep veins of the legs.

   # Altered Mental status:  Unclear etiology.  Could be secondary to
   SIRS. Urine was suspicous for UTI.  Need to rule out CVA.  Seizure is
   unlikely even though CKs are elevated.  Serum tox screen is negative.
   Worsened renal function raises the suspcion for renally cleared
   medications contributing to this.
   - appreciate neurology recs
   - LP results, prelim not consistent with infection/inflammation
   - MRA/DW to evaluate for CVA
   - cont Vanc, ceftriaxone, ampicillin and acyclovir
   - BCx, UCx, CSF culture.
   - early goal directed therapy, MAP > 65

   # Intubation:  ? airway protection.  CXR not suspicous for
   intrapulmonary process.
   - evaluate once mental status improves
   .
   # ARF:  Cr on [**2158-6-9**] was 0.8.  Unclear reason for renal dysfunction.
   No known history of recent contrast administration prior to today.
   Most likely due to prerenal etiology given recent confusion and unknown
   oral intake.
   - keep well hydrated
   - urine lytes

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with several medical conditions including immunodeficiency, COPD, dyslipidemia, history of CVA (cerebrovascular accident), tobacco abuse, and DM2 (type 2 diabetes mellitus). She was found unresponsive and her current assessment includes altered mental status with unclear etiology, suspicion of urinary tract infection (UTI), and need to rule out CVA. The serum tox screen is negative, but there is a worsening of renal function which raises suspicion for renally cleared medications contributing to this. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is intubated, on mechanical ventilation, and has an endotracheal tube in place. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 112/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, troponin T, lactate, liver enzymes (ALT and AST), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The electrocardiogram (EKG) shows sinus rhythm. 

The plan includes ruling out infection/inflammation through lumbar puncture (LP"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, indicating acute respiratory failure. However, it is specified that this is not ARDS.

2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has low potassium (K+), low magnesium (Mg++), and low phosphate (PO4) levels, along with a low corrected calcium level. These imbalances need to be corrected.

3. Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) suggest muscle breakdown, which is consistent with rhabdomyolysis.

4. Liver Function Abnormalities: Abnormal liver function tests indicate possible liver dysfunction.

5. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient's body temperature has been fluctuating.

6. Altered Mental Status (not delirium): The patient is experiencing changes in mental status, although it is noted as not delirium.

7. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis but does not exhibit organ dysfunction at this time.

8. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Bronchitis, Emphysema: The patient has a history of COPD without acute exacerbation.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old woman with immunodeficiency on IVIG, COPD, dyslipidemia, ?
   h/o CVA, tobacco abuse and DM2 was found
   unresponsive.
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Unclear etiology.  Could be secondary to
   SIRS. Urine was suspicous for UTI.  Need to rule out CVA.  Seizure is
   unlikely even though CKs are elevated.  Serum tox screen is negative.
   Worsened renal function raises the suspcion for renally cleared
   medications contributing to this.
   - appreciate neurology recs
   - LP results, prelim not consistent with infection/inflammation
   - MRA/DW to evaluate for CVA
   - cont Vanc, ceftriaxone, ampicillin and acyclovir
   - BCx, UCx, CSF culture.
   - early goal directed therapy, MAP > 65
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis/elevated lactate:  ? sepsis.  ? urine source.
   - cont Antibiotics as above
   - follow up cultures as above
   .
   # Intubation:  ? airway protection.  CXR not suspicous for
   intrapulmonary process.
   - evaluate once mental status improves
   .
   # ARF:  Cr on [**2158-6-9**] was 0.8.  Unclear reason for renal dysfunction.
   No known history of recent contrast administration prior to today.
   Most likely due to prerenal etiology given recent confusion and unknown
   oral intake.
   - keep well hydrated
   - urine lytes
   - will hold meloxicam
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Unlcear etiology.  ? Recent seizure.  No known trauma
   and patient was found in her bed.
   - continue to trend
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: AST markedly elevated than ALT.  ? from muscle.
   -          trend LFTs
   -          Hep panel pends
   -          RUQ u/s pends
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  No known history.  Currently in sinus rhythm.
   -          ? need for anticoagulation given mental status change
   -          Talk with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1960**] ? hx of Afib

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including immunodeficiency, COPD, dyslipidemia, history of CVA, tobacco abuse, and DM2. She was found unresponsive and her current diagnosis includes altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute renal failure, respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, rhabdomyolysis, liver function abnormalities, and fever.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening of COPD, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), progression of renal failure, further liver damage, and potential cardiac issues due to atrial fibrillation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, renal function, liver enzymes, electrolyte levels, and mental status. Timely interventions such as appropriate antibiotic therapy, fluid management, and nutritional support should be implemented to prevent further complications and improve the patient's condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including immunodeficiency, COPD, dyslipidemia, a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), tobacco abuse, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The patient was found unresponsive and has been diagnosed with several potential medical complications:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, and the cause is unclear. Possible causes include sepsis, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or other factors. Further evaluation is needed, including neurology recommendations, lumbar puncture (LP) results, magnetic resonance angiography/diffusion-weighted imaging (MRA/DW) to evaluate for CVA, and continued vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir.

2. Fever/Leukocytosis/Elevated Lactate: The patient exhibits signs of possible sepsis, with fever, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels. Antibiotics have been continued, and follow-up cultures are pending.

3. Intubation: The patient required intubation due to airway protection concerns. A chest X-ray (CXR) showed no suspicious findings for intrapulmonary processes. Evaluation for extubation will be considered once the patient's mental status improves.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old woman with immunodeficiency on IVIG, COPD, dyslipidemia, ?
   h/o CVA, tobacco abuse and DM2 was found
   unresponsive.
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Unclear etiology.  Could be secondary to
   SIRS. Seizure not witnessed even though CKs are elevated.  Serum tox
   screen is negative.  Worsened renal function raises the suspcion for
   renally cleared medications contributing to this. Current theory is
   that pt was confused over last week [**2-4**]  unknown process, OD on narcs
   (pt known to frequently overmedicate) causing hypotension /
   unresponsible leading to shock liver, ARF.
   - appreciate neurology recs.  Originially thought to have Bilateral
   cerebellar [**Doctor Last Name **]. However, this is very unlikely to have BL emboli
   strokes. MRA showed PCA arising from carotid and not posterior
   circulation making this even less likely. Article found showing similar
   MR finding in pt with leukoencephalopathy [**2-4**] histocytosis. This is
   know the suspected underlying process.
   - However acuity of onset still no consistant with histocytosis
   therefore another process is possible
   - LP results, prelim not consistent with infection/inflammation
   - d/c Vanc, ceftriaxone, ampicillin as afebrile and no sign of bac

   # ARF:  Cr on [**2158-6-9**] was 0.8.  Unclear reason for renal dysfunction.
   No known history of recent contrast administration prior to today.
   Most likely due to prerenal etiology given recent confusion and unknown

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including immunodeficiency, COPD, dyslipidemia, a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), tobacco abuse, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
- She was found unresponsive and brought to the ICU.
- Initial assessment revealed altered mental status, possible seizure activity, elevated creatine kinase (CK), liver function tests (LFTs), and renal dysfunction.
- The patient has a history of confusion over the past week, with unknown etiology.
- Serum toxicology screen is negative, and the patient is known to frequently overmedicate.
- There is suspicion of renally cleared medications contributing to the mental status change.
- Current theory suggests that the patient may have experienced hypotension/unresponsiveness leading to shock liver and acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and fever, raising suspicion for sepsis.
- Intubation is considered due to airway protection concerns, and there is no evidence of intrapulmonary process on chest X-ray.
- The patient has elevated CK levels, possibly due to recent seizure activity or muscle injury.
- LFTs, particularly AST, are markedly elevated, indicating potential liver involvement.
- The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, currently in sinus rhythm.
- She has a history of COPD and asthma,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with immunodeficiency, COPD, dyslipidemia, history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), tobacco abuse, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). She was found unresponsive and is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has altered mental status. There are several potential medical complications that could arise, including:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's confusion may be due to sepsis, medication overdose, or an unknown process. Renal dysfunction raises suspicion for renally cleared medications contributing to this. The theory suggests that the patient was confused over the last week due to an unknown process, opioid overdose (patient known to frequently overmedicate) causing hypotension/unresponsiveness leading to shock liver, acute renal failure (ARF).
2. Fever/Leukocytosis/Elevated Lactate: There is a possibility of sepsis, potentially from a urinary source. Urine culture has not been sent; will resend urine analysis and culture. The patient has remained afebrile, and leukocytosis may be a stress response.
3. Intubation: The patient required intubation for airway protection, as she was unable to protect her own airway. Chest X-ray does not show any suspicious intrapulmonary process.
4. ARF: The patient's creatinine"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old woman with immunodeficiency on IVIG, COPD, dyslipidemia, ?
   h/o CVA, tobacco abuse and DM2 was found
   unresponsive.
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Unclear etiology.  Could be secondary to
   SIRS. Seizure not witnessed even though CKs are elevated.  Serum tox
   screen is negative.  Worsened renal function raises the suspcion for
   renally cleared medications contributing to this. Current theory is
   that pt was confused over last week [**2-4**]  unknown process, OD on narcs
   (pt known to frequently overmedicate) causing hypotension /
   unresponsible leading to shock liver, ARF.
   - appreciate neurology recs.  Originially thought to have Bilateral
   cerebellar [**Doctor Last Name **]. However, this is very unlikely to have BL emboli
   strokes. MRA showed PCA arising from carotid and not posterior
   circulation making this even less likely. Article found showing similar
   MR finding in pt with leukoencephalopathy [**2-4**] histocytosis. This is
   know the suspected underlying process.
   - However acuity of onset still no consistant with histocytosis
   therefore another process is possible
   - LP results, prelim not consistent with infection/inflammation
   - d/c Vanc, ceftriaxone, ampicillin as afebrile and no sign of bac
   infection in CSF.
   - continue acyclovir until HSV PCR negative. Increased dose to 500mg IV
   q8h as per pharmacy
   - BCx, UCx, CSF culture.
   - early goal directed therapy, MAP > 65
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis/elevated lactate:  ? sepsis.  ? urine source.  UA
   not overtly positive. U cult never sent? Will resend UA and cult. Has
   remained afebrile, VSS. Leukocytosis likely stress response
   -d/c  Antibiotics as above
   - follow up cultures as above
   .
   # Intubation:  ? airway protection.  CXR not suspicous for
   intrapulmonary process.
   - MS improved this am. Was extubated without diffculty.
   .
   # ARF:  Cr on [**2158-6-9**] was 0.8.  Unclear reason for renal dysfunction.
   No known history of recent contrast administration prior to today.
   Most likely due to prerenal etiology given recent confusion and unknown
   oral intake. Cr back to baseline
   - keep well hydrated
   - will hold meloxicam

   # Elevated CK:  Unlcear etiology.  ? Recent seizure.  No known trauma
   and patient was found in her bed.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is unresponsive and has an unclear etiology for their altered mental state. This could be due to various factors such as sepsis, medication overdose, or a neurological condition.

2. Sepsis: The patient exhibits fever, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels, suggesting the possibility of sepsis. However, the source of infection is uncertain and further investigation is needed.

3. Renal failure: The patient has shown a decrease in urine output and an increase in creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure. The cause of renal dysfunction is unclear, but it may be related to prerenal causes or an intrinsic renal pathology.

4. Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) suggest the possibility of rhabdomyolysis, which could be caused by recent trauma, prolonged immobilization, or medication-related muscle damage.

5. Liver function abnormalities: Markedly elevated AST levels indicate liver dysfunction. This could be due to various factors such as drug-induced liver injury or a pre-existing liver disease.

6. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is at risk for acute exacerbations. Monitoring and management of respiratory symptoms are crucial.

7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was found to have atrial fibr"
