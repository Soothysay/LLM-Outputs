   61M w DLBCL s/p multiple doses of chemotherapy w hospital course c/b
   AF/RVR, hypercalcemia, and upper extremity DVT, who is being
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with afib with RVR in the setting of hypotension.
   # Hypotension: unclear etiology, likely in the setting of afib with
   RVR, poor po intake, possible sepsis although no fevers.
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - TTE
   - no aline for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR: recurrent in the setting of hypovolemia vs
   malignant pericardial effusions vs infection. Converted overnight to
   NSR s/p amiodarone load, IVFs, phenylephrine gtt.
   - rate control w digoxin
   - consider starting po amiodarone in am.
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - Check TTE
   - f/u bl cxs
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - Telemetry
   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   # h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Check TTE to r/o RV strain.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC up to 11K from 5.6 on AM labs. Likely in setting
   of stress dose steroids, possibly secondary to stress reaction from AM
   events, or due to developing infection.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   .
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - AG 18, has been increasing over past
   few days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for
   treatment and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count
   should be kept greater than 50K.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse for > 50K.
   .
   #. Anemia - Likely related to anemia of chronic disease. Less likely
   that anemia is [**1-20**] chemo nadir at this point as last chemo was 1 month
   ago.
   - Follow Hct, transfuse for less than 24 per BMT.
   - Keep T&S active.
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #. Nausea - Per BMT note, etiology unclear. Pt not currently
   complaining of this. Evaluated by GI and neurology on previous
   admission. GI recommended continuing with max dose reglan and an
   outpatient esophagael motility study.
   - reglan 2.5 mg PO tid with meals and prn
   - zyprexa 5 mg ODT TID prn
   - IV zofran prn
   .
   #. Back pain - Evaluated by pain service on last admission. Not
   currently complaining of back pain. Continue methadone.

   #. GERD - Continue pantoprazole.
   .
   #. FEN - regular, low Ca, caffeine-free diet
   .
   #. PPX - acyclovir, fluconazole, pantoprazole; bowel regimen prn. On
   treatment doses of enoxaprin for known DVTs

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis secondary to pneumonia. The patient's current condition shows signs of improvement, with stable vital signs and adequate oxygenation. However, there are concerns regarding hypotension and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate persistent hypotension. This could be due to septic shock, fluid loss, or medication side effects. Monitoring the patient's fluid balance and administering appropriate vasopressor medications may be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events. Anticoagulation therapy with medications such as heparin or warfarin may be required to prevent thromboembolism. Rate control and rhythm restoration strategies should also be considered.
3. Sepsis: Although the patient appears to be improving, there is still a risk of sepsis recurrence. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and infection control measures should continue to prevent further complications related to sepsis.
4. Delirium: The patient has a history of confusion and delirium. Monitoring for changes in mental status and providing appropriate sedation and delirium management strategies are"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, s/p multiple doses
   of chemotherapy with hospital course complicated by afib with RVR,
   hypercalcemia, and upper extremity DVT who is being transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   with afib with RVR in setting of hypotension.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - Has been recurrent since initial diagnosis of
   DLBCL per wife and did require ICU admission during last hospital
   course for similar reasons (hypotension, afib with RVR). Also has prior
   h/o malignant pericardial tamponade. Has not been diuresed for several
   days on the floor; however, pt with poor po intake and intravascular
   hypovolemia may be contributing. Other considerations for recurrent
   afib are possibility of infection, recurrent lymphoma involvement of
   pericardium, inability to tolerate consistent dosing of beta-blockers
   on the floor due to hypotension over the weekend, or PE with RV
   overload --> increased RA filling pressures. Doubt hyperthyroid state.
   Now back in NSR s/p amiodarone load, IVFs, neo gtt.
   - Attempt to wean neo gtt. Pt and wife have declined further attempts
   at aline for now.
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - Check TTE.
   - Blood cxs peripherally and from central line.
   - Empiric abx coverage with IV vancomycin, cefepime for now.
   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   - Hold metoprolol for now given hypotension.
   - Telemetry.
   - Consider starting po amiodarone in am.
   .
   # Hypotension - In setting of afib with RVR, poor po intake, possible
   sepsis although no fevers.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs as above, f/u cx data and narrow abxs as
   appropriate.
   - Wean off neo gtt as tolerated with IVF boluses as above.
   - TTE
   - No aline for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   .
   #. h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Check TTE to r/o RV strain.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   #. Leukocytosis - WBC up to 11K from 5.6 on AM labs. Likely in setting
   of stress dose steroids, possibly secondary to stress reaction from AM
   events, or due to developing infection.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   .
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - AG 18, has been increasing over past
   few days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for
   treatment and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count
   should be kept greater than 50K.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse for > 50K.
   .
   #. Anemia - Likely related to anemia of chronic disease. Less likely
   that anemia is [**1-20**] chemo nadir at this point as last chemo was 1 month
   ago.
   - Follow Hct, transfuse for less than 24 per BMT.
   - Keep T&S active.
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #. Nausea - Per BMT note, etiology unclear. Pt not currently
   complaining of this. Evaluated by GI and neurology on previous
   admission. GI recommended continuing with max dose reglan and an
   outpatient esophagael motility study.
   - reglan 2.5 mg PO tid with meals and prn
   - zyprexa 5 mg ODT TID prn
   - IV zofran prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, who has been admitted to the ICU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. The patient's medical history also includes malignant pericardial tamponade, hypercalcemia, and bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis with an inferior vena cava filter in place. The patient has not been diuresed for several days and has poor oral intake.

The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm after receiving amiodarone. He is receiving IV fluids and neosynephrine to maintain urine output and mean arterial pressure above 60. Blood cultures have been obtained peripherally and from the central line. Empiric antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and cefepime has been initiated. Due to the presence of a thrombus in the right internal jugular vein, attempts to re-site the central line to the left subclavian vein are planned. If the patient develops fever or worsening hemodynamics, femoral lines or peripheral intravenous lines may be considered.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11K, likely secondary to stress or infection. The patient has metabolic anion gap acidosis with a gap of 18, which may be due to lactic acidosis from hypoperfusion or increased cell turnover from recurrent lymphoma. The patient's platelet count is low at 105 K/uL, possibly due to chemotherapy. Anemia is present, likely related to anemia of chronic disease.

The patient is experiencing nausea, but no longer complains of it. Back pain has been evaluated and is currently not present. The patient is on a regular low calcium, caffeine-free diet and is receiving treatment doses of enoxaparin for known deep vein thrombosis. The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate order with his wife as the healthcare proxy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has a history of recurrent atrial fibrillation, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and potential complications such as heart failure or thromboembolic events.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate poor perfusion and could contribute to organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of multiple deep vein thromboses, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism.
4. Metabolic anion gap acidosis: The patient's acidosis may indicate lactic acidosis, which can be a sign of poor tissue perfusion or increased cell turnover from recurrent lymphoma.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level may contribute to fatigue or inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
7. Nausea: Although the patient is currently not complaining of nausea, it may be a persistent issue and could be related to medications or gastrointestinal issues."

   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   # h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation (AF), hypercalcemia, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is currently being transferred to a different hospital unit due to AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
- Heart rate: 114 beats per minute (bpm) with an irregular rhythm
- Blood pressure: 102/50 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 9 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 93% on nasal cannula

The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, but he appears delirious and occasionally makes statements that do not make sense. His peripheral pulses are diminished on the right side compared to the left side. The patient's skin is warm and without rashes.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.0 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 105 K/uL, and an elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include several potential medical complications"

The plan includes attempting to wean phenylephrine infusion, conducting a trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and providing supportive care.

Other ongoing issues include leukocytosis, metabolic anion gap acidosis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, back pain, GERD, and a history of DVTs. The patient has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place and is on enoxaparin therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypotension, recurrent AF/RVR leading to cardiac arrhythmias, progression of DVTs to pulmonary embolism (PE), infection/sepsis due to indwelling lines, worsening metabolic acidosis, and bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia."

   # Hypotension: unclear etiology, likely in the setting of afib with
   RVR, poor po intake, possible sepsis although no fevers.
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - TTE
   - no aline for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR: recurrent in the setting of hypovolemia vs
   malignant pericardial effusions vs infection. Converted overnight to
   NSR s/p amiodarone load, IVFs, phenylephrine gtt.
   - rate control w digoxin
   - consider starting po amiodarone in am.
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - Check TTE

   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - Telemetry
   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   # h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has been admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR), hypercalcemia, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's current medications include digoxin, phenylephrine, metoprolol, haloperidol, enoxaparin, and sodium bicarbonate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology but is likely due to AF/RVR, poor oral intake, and possible sepsis. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) and is being closely monitored.

2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AF/RVR): The patient has recurrent episodes of AF/RVR, which have been difficult to control. The patient was converted to normal sinus rhythm overnight with amiodarone load, IV fluids, and phenylephrine. Rate control is being maintained with digoxin, and consideration is being given to starting oral amiodarone.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low due to chemotherapy and enoxaparin therapy. The patient's platelet count should be kept above 50K to prevent bleeding complications. Transfusion of plate"

The patient is being transferred to another hospital unit.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR): The patient has episodes of AF/RVR, which can lead to poor cardiac output, hypotension, and potential organ dysfunction.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or other factors. This could lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.

3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated levels of calcium in the blood, which can impair cardiac function and lead to arrhythmias, renal dysfunction, and other complications.

4. Right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) if a clot were to dislodge and travel to the lungs.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection or inflammation.
