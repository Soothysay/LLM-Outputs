   [**3-7**] CTA ab/pelvis: WET READ: CTA demonstrates intraluminal contrast
   extravasation in the cecum, localizing
   this as the likely site of bleeding. the wall of the cecum and
   ascending colon are thickened. additional wall thickening is seen
   involving the splenic flexure, descending and sigmoid colon, albeit
   exagerrated by underdistention. this is consistent with colitis, which
   may be infectious or ischemic given underlying atherosclerosis. there
   is diffuse atheroscrlotic involvement of the aorta and mesenteric
   vessels, though all appear patent. the SMV is patent. Abd/pelv: no
   acute abnormality involving the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas or
   adrenals. s/p right nephrectomy. left kidney markedly atrophic. small
   bowel appears normal though note is made of a bowel contained in a
   right inguinal hernia without evidence of complciation.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and prostate cancer. He presented to the hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), which was initially managed conservatively but required interventional radiology (IR) embolization due to ongoing bleeding. The patient's current condition includes recurrent GIB, hypotension, and leukocytosis with a possible infectious colitis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has already experienced significant GIB, and there is a risk of recurrence. This can lead to hypotension, shock, and potentially death if not managed promptly and effectively.

2. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis and positive blood cultures suggests a possible infection, which needs to be addressed with appropriate antibiotic therapy. Additionally, the patient's immunocompromised state due to ESRD increases the risk of infections.

3. Colitis: The CT abdomen/pelvis shows thickening of the cecum and ascending colon, indicating possible colitis. This could be infectious or ischemic in nature, especially considering the underlying atherosclerosis. The patient is already on empiric ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, but further evaluation and management may be necessary.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring frequent interventions with vasopressors"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and prostate cancer. He presented from a nursing home with bloody bowel movement, hemoglobin drop, and hypotension. He was initially managed medically for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and then underwent an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement due to recurrent GIB. 

The patient has been admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) multiple times for the same issues. He has received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since admission. His hemoglobin concentration has trended downward from 29% to 26%. 

The patient is currently on proton pump inhibitor therapy for stress ulcers and receiving IV ciprofloxacin for suspected colitis. He also has leukocytosis and positive cultures for Gram-positive cocci (GPC). 

He has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM) without angina symptoms but with elevated troponin levels on admission. His EKG changes are non-specific. 

The patient has undergone dialysis on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule using a right fistula access. He will likely need dialysis today as well. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of GIB, which can lead to significant blood loss and hypotension. He"

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and prostate cancer. He presents to the ICU with bloody rice krispie-like stools (BRBPR), hematocrit drop, and hypotension. The patient has undergone an interventional radiology (IR) procedure for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), specifically embolization of an area in the ascending colon. He has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since admission, with 2 units given overnight along with 4 liters of normal saline (NS).

Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient has experienced recurrent GIB, which localized to the cecum. He underwent an IR embolization procedure for this condition. His hematocrit post-procedure remains unchanged. Prophylactic measures include holding antiplatelet medications, maintaining a high hematocrit level above 26, and administering pantoprazole (Protonix) BID.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with GPC UTI, and 2/4 blood cultures also growing GPC. This suggests an infectious colitis, and further investigations are needed, including trending white blood cell count, temperature curve, and following up with urine, stool, and blood cultures. Vancomycin will be continued per HD protocol, and empirical ciprof"

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and prostate cancer. He presents from a nursing home with bloody stool per rectum (BRBPR), hematocrit drop, and hypotension. He has been transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for recurrent BRBPR and hypotension following an intra-arterial (IR) procedure. The patient has received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since 3/6 at 6pm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding: The patient has multiple areas of erythema and ulcerations found during colonoscopy, indicating possible GI bleeding. The current bleed appears to localize to the cecum, and he underwent IR embolization of the ascending colon. The HCT post-procedure remains unchanged.
2. Infectious Colitis: The patient has a GPC UTI (strep viridans) with 2/4 blood cultures also growing GPC (coag neg staph), suggesting the possibility of infectious colitis. Afebrile in the last 24 hours, but any fevers that develop may be secondary to blood products.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.2, possibly due to infection or inflammation.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolytes need to be repleted, especially considering ongoing blood transfusions.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has elevated lipids and requires statin therapy.
6. Gout: The patient has a history of gout and requires allopurinol treatment.
7. Dementia: The patient has dementia and is on Aricept and risperidone.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed, especially in the setting of GI bleeding.
9. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels need to be monitored due to ongoing transfusions.
10. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and requires ongoing renal management, including hemodialysis.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and prostate cancer. He presents with bloody brown pigment in the rectum (BRBPR), hematocrit drop, hypotension, and is now transferred back to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for recurrent BRBPR and hypotension after undergoing an interventional radiology (IR) procedure. The patient has received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since March 6th at 6pm. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has been experiencing ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, with multiple areas of erythema and ulcerations found during colonoscopy. Despite the IR embolization of the bleeding area in the ascending colon, the patient continues to have diffuse oozing from a 20 cm region throughout the ulcerated region of the cecum. This can lead to further blood loss and the need for additional transfusions.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation. It is important to monitor for any signs of fever or worsening infection.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has developed thrombocytopenia, which is characterized by a low platelet count. This can increase the risk of bleeding and should be closely monitored.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's renal function is compromised due to ESRD, and he is receiving hemodialysis. There is a need to replete electrolytes, especially calcium, as the patient is receiving blood transfusions.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, which requires management with statin therapy.
6. Gout: The patient has gout, and allopurinol should be considered for treatment.
7. Dementia: The patient has dementia, and medications such as Aricept and risperidone may be prescribed for management.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension should be managed carefully, especially in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding. Antihypertensive medications should be held for now.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and prostate cancer. He presents with blood in the rectum per rectum (BRBPR), hematocrit drop, and hypotension. The patient underwent an interventional radiology (IR) procedure to embolize bleeding in the ascending colon. Despite receiving a total of seven units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), the patient continues to bleed.

Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, localized to the cecum. He has received multiple units of PRBCs but continues to bleed. The source of bleeding is being managed with medical therapy, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and holding antihypertensive medications. Further endoscopic or surgical intervention may be considered if re-bleeding occurs significantly.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with an elevated white blood cell count, likely secondary to a gastrointestinal tract infection (GPC UTI) caused by Streptococcus viridans. There is also a coag-negative Staphylococcus infection present in the blood culture.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has developed thrombocytopenia following dialysis and PRBC transfusion. This may be due to hemolysis-induced immune thrombocytopen"

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and prostate cancer. He presents with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), recurrent blood transfusions, and ongoing bleeding. The patient has been treated with interventional radiology (IR) embolization of the bleeding site and has received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). He continues to bleed, although there has been a reduction in the amount of blood loss.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's current condition indicates ongoing bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, specifically localized to the cecum. This can lead to hypotension, tachycardia, and potentially shock if not managed promptly.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of UTI and colitis, which may increase the risk of developing further infections. Close monitoring of vital signs and regular assessment of blood cultures are necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding. It is important to monitor platelet levels and consider the possibility of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or other causes of thrombocytopenia.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which can be dangerous and may require urgent treatment to lower potassium levels"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and prostate cancer. The patient presented from a nursing home with blood in the stool, hematocrit drop, and an episode of hypotension, and was transferred back to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for recurrent blood in the stool and hypotension.

The patient has received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since March 6th at 6pm. He has been started on pantoprazole (Protonix) 40 mg IV BID, and his antihypertensives have been held in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The plan includes continuing to monitor the patient's central venous pressure (CVP), repleting calcium as needed, and continuing vancomycin per HD protocol.

The patient also has leukocytosis and a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Streptococcus viridans, with blood cultures growing Gram-positive cocci (GPC). There is suspicion of infectious colitis based on a CT scan of the abdomen. The patient is afebrile in the last 24 hours.

The patient's ESRD on HD is being managed with dialysis sessions on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday using a right fistula for access. The"
