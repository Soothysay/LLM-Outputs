","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old female with a medical history of bipolar disorder who presented with paranoia and inability to sleep for seven days. She has been admitted to the ICU due to suspected acute manic episode, likely exacerbated by polypharm abuse including Ritalin and benzodiazepines. The patient has received multiple doses of Valium and Haldol orally. She has allergies to Reglan (Metoclopramide Hcl) and muscle spasm. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for tachycardia. She has been given N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for acetaminophen overdose and completed the recommended protocol. Her laboratory results show no evidence of liver damage or kidney dysfunction. The patient requires close monitoring for benzodiazepine withdrawal, serotonin syndrome, and potential electrolyte imbalances. She is also being evaluated for chronic Tylenol ingestion, numbness/pain in her lower extremities suggestive of neuropathy, and chronic bronchitis. The patient's nutritional status is being assessed, and she is receiving prophylactic heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's code status is full, and she will be transferred to the medical floor once stabilized."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old female with a medical history of bipolar disorder. She was brought in by her family for paranoia and an inability to sleep for seven days. The patient presents with evidence of psychosis, including thought disorder, paranoid ideation, lability, and pressured speech.

The patient's current condition includes an acute manic episode, tachycardia, chronic Tylenol overdose, chronic bronchitis, and potential medication misuse. She has received multiple doses of Valium and Haldol, and her allergies include muscle spasm from Reglan (Metoclopramide Hcl).

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 90 bpm (84-125 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 130/89 mmHg to 114/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (19-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation at 96%. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals normal readings.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 4,776 mL with an output of 1,800 mL, resulting in a balance of 2,976 mL. Respiratory support is not required, and the patient's ABG results are within normal limits.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count at 10.3 K/uL, hemoglobin at 11.3 g/dL, and platelet count at 473. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other labs, including PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatase/TBili, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, are also within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include the following:
1. H/O poisoning/overdose, acetaminophen (Tylenol/APAP): The patient has a history of chronic Tylenol overdose. She was given an NAC loading dose in the ER for a Tylenol level of 38. The plan is to continue with the Tylenol protocol of 50mg/kg over 4 hours followed by 100mg/kg over 16 hours.
2. Tachycardia: The patient developed a tachycardic episode with flushing. There is concern for serotoninergic vs anticholinergic side effects, but it is unclear if the patient had other ingestions. An ECG was obtained to evaluate the QT interval. Tox screen results positive for opiates and benzos suggest potential medication misuse. CIWA scale for benzo withdrawal will be monitored, and Haldol 1-2mg PO PRN agitation will be continued. Lexapro and Ritalin usage will be held pending psychiatric recommendations.
3. Acute manic episode: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and presents with evidence of psychosis. Psychiatric recommendations will be followed, including consideration for Section 12.
4. Chronic bronchitis:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, admitted to the ICU for acute mania, overdose, and withdrawal from Ritalin, Ativan, and Vicodin. She presented with agitation, which was controlled with valium and haldol. Her tachycardia improved but did not respond to fluids. TSH levels are normal. The patient has a history of chronic Tylenol overdose and completed N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment. She also has leg swelling and pain, likely related to neuropathy, and is being evaluated by a psychiatrist for possible hallucinations. The patient is currently on medium-chain triglyceride (MVI) and has been started on prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She is also on stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and she is expected to be transferred to the floor once her condition stabilizes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose: The patient has a history of chronic Tylenol overdose, which can lead to liver damage. Regular monitoring of liver function tests, such as ALT and AST, should be done to assess for hepatotoxicity.

2. Neuropathy: The patient is experiencing leg swelling and pain, which may indicate neuropathy. Further evaluation and management are required to address this issue.

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, admitted for acute mania and suspected overdose of acetaminophen (Tylenol). She also has withdrawal symptoms from Ritalin, Ativan, and Vicodin. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a slight elevation in heart rate. She is sedated and follows simple commands. There is no evidence of endotracheal or nasogastric tubes. The patient's general appearance is well-nourished and not in acute distress, but she is diaphoretic. Her cardiovascular examination shows a regular heart rhythm, with no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds without crackles or wheezes. Abdominal examination is unremarkable, with soft and non-tender bowel sounds present. Extremities are warm and without cyanosis or clubbing. Skin is warm and without rash or jaundice. Neurologic examination is normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is slightly elevated, which could be due to benzodiazepine withdrawal or other underlying conditions such as hyperthyroidism or cardiac ischemia.
2. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) Overdose: The patient has a history of chronic Tylenol overdose, which can lead to liver damage. Monitoring of liver function tests and serum osmolar gap is recommended.
3. Leg Swelling and Pain: The patient presents with leg swelling and pain, which may be related to neuropathy. Further evaluation, including a thorough neurological examination and consideration of a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), is needed to determine the cause.
4. Psychiatric Issues: The patient is experiencing acute mania, which requires psychiatric intervention and management. Monitoring for agitation and controlling symptoms with medication as needed is essential.
5. Medication Reactions: Close monitoring for potential adverse reactions to medications such as Haldol, which can cause QTc prolongation, is necessary.
6. Infection Risk: As an ICU patient, the patient is at an increased risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Adequate infection control measures and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis should be implemented."

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, admitted for acute mania, overdose, and withdrawal from Ritalin, Ativan, and Vicodin. She has been agitated but controlled with Valium and Haldol. The patient's tachycardia is still present, but her TSH levels are normal. A CT scan of the head is pending due to bizarre hallucinations. The patient has completed N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for chronic Tylenol overdose. She is expected to be transferred to the floor as she is no longer critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) Overdose: The patient has a history of chronic Tylenol overdose. Although she has completed NAC treatment, there may still be potential liver damage or acute liver failure.
2. Bipolar Disorder: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is currently experiencing an acute manic episode. This condition can lead to mood swings, irritability, and potential aggressive behavior.
3. Medication Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing withdrawal symptoms from Ritalin, Ativan, and Vicodin. Withdrawal from these medications can cause various physical and psychological symptoms.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, indicating tachycardia. This could be due to stress, infection, or other underlying medical conditions.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 31-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, was admitted to the ICU for agitation, frequent medication dosing, and tachycardia. She had allergies to Reglan (Metoclopramide Hcl) and muscle spasm. The patient received 1 mg of Ativan IV twice for acute anxiety. She was given a 1L NS bolus without effect. The patient's allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, other ICU medications, and other medications are noted.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs were within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.7 C (98%), heart rate of 98 bpm (90-113), blood pressure ranging from 118/81 to 135/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (14-29), and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's heart rhythm was sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance showed a total input of 1,718 mL and a total output of 1,283 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 435 mL. Her respiratory support included oxygen delivery with a SpO2 of 94%. The patient's physical examination was generally unremarkable, with clear lungs and a supple neck. Laboratory results showed normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes."

","The patient is a 31-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder who was admitted with acute mania, overdose, and withdrawal from Ritalin, Ativan, and Vicodin. The patient is currently receiving treatment for agitation, which is well controlled with prn valium per CIWA and prn + regular haldol. The patient's QTc interval is within normal limits. Lexapro has been restarted, and Ritalin has also been restarted.

The patient's tachycardia is being monitored, and it has shown improvement. The cause of the tachycardia is unknown, but the patient's TSH level is normal, indicating that thyroid dysfunction is not the cause. There has been no response to IV fluids, but the patient remains asymptomatic.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, and incentive spirometry has been prescribed for mild hypoxemia likely related to atelectasis.

Regarding the chronic Tylenol OD, the patient has completed N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment.

The patient is experiencing leg swelling and pain, which is likely related to neuropathy. A physical therapist (PT) evaluation has been ordered, and the patient's rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was negative. The patient is currently on multivitamin therapy (MVI) and receiving ICU care.

In terms of nutrition and glycemic control, the patient's nutritional needs and blood sugar levels will be monitored and managed"

The patient is a 31-year-old female with bipolar disorder who was admitted for acute mania, overdose, and withdrawal from Ritalin, Ativan, and Vicodin. She is currently in the ICU and has shown improvement in her agitation overnight. Her tachycardia is resolving, and her vital signs are stable. The patient's medical history includes allergies to Reglan, muscle spasm, and previous antibiotic use. She has been receiving various medications and infusions in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient initially presented with tachycardia, but it is now improving. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the tachycardia and to prevent any potential complications related to an elevated heart rate.

2. Respiratory issues: The patient has mild hypoxemia likely related to atelectasis. Incentive spirometry has been prescribed to help improve lung expansion and prevent further respiratory complications.

3. Chronic Tylenol overdose: The patient had a previous overdose of acetaminophen (Tylenol), for which she completed N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment. Regular monitoring of liver function is necessary to detect any potential liver damage due to the overdose.

4. Leg swelling and pain: The patient is experiencing leg swelling and pain, which is likely related to neuropathy. A physical therapy evaluation has been ordered, and appropriate measures will be taken to"
