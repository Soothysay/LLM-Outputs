   Assessment and Plan
   49 y.o. female with Hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis, initially admitted
   with variceal bleeding to OSH, stabilized, but developed hepatic
   encephalopathy, intubated for airway protection, and cerebral edema.
   # Cerebral edema.  Etiology not entirely clear but could related to
   severe hepatic encephalopathy.  Not typical as she has relatively
   compensated liver disease.  Also consider other types of encephalitis
   such as infectious.  Received mannitol on [**2180-12-19**], but no further dose
   given.
   - Neuro recs apprec: will obtain MRI, EEG, and LP.
   - start Acyclovir 10mg/kg Q8H (900mg Q8H) per neuro to cover HSV
   encephalitis
   - repeat CT head --> b/l temporal lobe edema
   - check na/osm Q6H; goal Na 150, goal serum osm 330 or less
   - Q1H neuro check
   - continue lactulose/rifaxamin for encephalopathy.
   - check TSH --> wnl
   # Respiratory failure.  Initially was intubated for airway protection,
   [**1-15**] GI bleed.  Later became confused, felt [**1-15**] hepatic encephalopathy.
   Now has fever and MRSA in sputum, ? VAP.  At baseline has
   hepatopulmonary syndrome with PaO2 in the 60s.
   - continue vanco for MRSA; did receive one dose zosyn overnight
   - pan culture (sputum, blood, urine, BAL)
   - f/u osh cultures (sputum with MRSA on [**12-18**]/, treatment begun [**2179-12-20**])
   - serial CXR/ABG
   - VAP precautions, daily wake up, RSBI when appropriate
   - wean vent when tolerated (FIO2, peep).
   # GI bleeding.  [**1-15**] esophageal varices.  Now stable after banding x 2.
   In total, received 13 units PRBCs, 12 units FFP, 20 units PLTs
   - monitor hemodynamics
   - Monitor Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   - IV protonix daily
   - liver team following
   # Hypernatremia.  Unclear etiology.  Does not look like she received
   hypertonic saline.  Could be dehydration, as TFs were held due to high
   residuals.
   - Goal sodium 150-160 to help cerebral edema
   - Na Q6H
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Likely [**1-15**] liver disease.  Received several
   platelet transfusion at [**Hospital3 1959**] hosptial.
   - continue to monitor
   # ESLD.  Decompensated with encephalopathy and variceal bleeding.
   - stable from UGI bleeding standpoint
   - has been on levoflox so covered for SBP; need to discuss with liver
   whether she'll need prophylaxis for SBP
   - lactulose until she stools large volume
   - trend transaminases, Tbili, albumin, coags
   # Depression: hold meds given mental status
   # FEN: will need tube feeds
   # Access: R subclav, a-line from OSH; these will need to be re-sited

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding and stabilized, but then developed hepatic encephalopathy, intubated for airway protection, and cerebral edema. The patient's condition has led to multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, and end-stage liver disease (ESLD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Edema: The patient is experiencing b/l temporal lobe edema, which could be related to severe hepatic encephalopathy. This can lead to increased intracranial pressure and potentially herniation if not managed appropriately.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to airway protection and subsequent respiratory failure. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), especially with the presence of fever and MRSA in the sputum.

3. GI Bleeding: The patient had esophageal varices bleeding, which required banding and blood product transfusions. There is a risk of re-bleeding or further complications related to the varices.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, but the exact cause is unclear. This can lead to neurological complications such as cerebral edema and seizures if not corrected properly.

5. Thrombocytopen"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding, stabilized, and then developed hepatic encephalopathy. She was intubated for airway protection and cerebral edema. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, possibly due to VAP, MRSA in sputum, and hepatopulmonary syndrome. She also has a history of GI bleeding from esophageal varices and received banding treatment. The patient has hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), and depression. She requires tube feeds and has multiple lines, including an arterial line and multi-lumen line.

Potential medical complications:
1. Cerebral edema: The patient has symptoms of cerebral edema, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and potential herniation.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease has led to hepatic encephalopathy, causing confusion and altered mental status.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may be due to VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) and her underlying hepatopulmonary syndrome.
4. MRSA infection: The presence of MRSA in the patient's sputum indicates a potential bacterial infection that needs to be treated.
5. GI bleeding: The patient had a significant"

     -Start Acyclovir and ceftriaxone in addition to vanco she's already
   on.
     -After discussion with neurology team, we will delay LP at this time
   given possible risk of herniation given edema.
     -Check EEG, if seizure activity-->AED
     -Check sodium/osms Q4hr.  If sodium <150, osms <330-->mannitol
     -Continue lactulose for encephalopathy
     -Head CT in next 48 hours to determine safety of LP.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of HCV and etoh cirrhosis, presenting with variceal bleeding. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated due to a seizure and bitemporal cerebral edema. The patient has multiple medical complications, including encephalopathy, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cirrhosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cerebral herniation: The patient's bitemporal cerebral edema increases the risk of cerebral herniation, especially if the edema worsens or if a lumbar puncture (LP) is performed without proper evaluation.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections, especially due to the use of mechanical ventilation and central lines. She has already been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir, to cover for possible infections such as pneumonia and herpes simplex virus encephalitis.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis puts her at risk for recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. This can be managed with lactulose and other supportive measures.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be multifactorial, including factors such as ascites, encephalopathy, and possible pneumonia. Ventilatory support will need to be continued, and efforts should be made to optimize"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of HCV and etoh cirrhosis who presented with variceal bleeding. She was intubated, experienced a seizure, and has bitemporal cerebral edema. The patient is currently in the ICU and is critically ill. She has been diagnosed with encephalopathy and is being treated with lactulose. Her respiratory failure is likely multifactorial and she is receiving ventilator support. The patient also has gastrointestinal bleeding, which is currently stable. Further diagnostic tests, including an arterial blood gas analysis, head CT scan, and diagnostic paracentesis, are planned to assess her condition. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening encephalopathy, respiratory failure, infection (due to prolonged intubation), and hepatic decompensation."

   49 y.o. female with Hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis, initially admitted
   with variceal bleeding to OSH, stabilized, but developed hepatic
   encephalopathy, intubated for airway protection, and cerebral edema.
   Found now to be seizing by EEG.
   # Cerebral edema.  Etiology not entirely clear but could related to
   severe hepatic encephalopathy.  Not typical as she has relatively

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding but developed hepatic encephalopathy, airway protection, and cerebral edema. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She is also experiencing seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral edema: The patient has been found to have cerebral edema, which could be related to severe hepatic encephalopathy. Other possible causes include infectious encephalitis (such as HSV or bacterial meningitis). The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and lumbar puncture may be necessary to rule out meningitis while considering the risk of herniation.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for airway protection due to GI bleeding and later became confused with hepatic encephalopathy. She now has a fever and MRSA in her sputum, raising the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is being treated with antibiotics covering MRSA and other potential bacterial infections. Serial chest X-rays and arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis will help assess her respiratory status.

3. GI bleeding: The patient had esophageal varices bleeding, which has been stabilized after banding. She received a significant amount of blood transfusions to manage the bleeding. Monitoring her hemodynamics and hematocrit levels is crucial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding and later developed hepatic encephalopathy, cerebral edema, and seizures. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, specifically esophageal varices, and is being treated with banding. She is experiencing hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, and end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Other medical conditions include depression and hepatopulmonary syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral edema: The patient has cerebral edema, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and potentially herniation if not managed properly.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further deterioration in mental status.
3. Seizures: The patient is experiencing seizures, and antiepileptic medication (keppra) has been initiated. Continuous EEG monitoring should be continued to detect any additional seizure activity.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator will depend on her ability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
5. GI bleeding: Although the patient's GI bleeding has been stabilized with banding, there is a risk of recurrent bleeding."

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of HCV and etoh cirrhosis. She has been admitted to the ICU due to a variceal bleed. The patient's condition has deteriorated, leading to intubation, seizure, and bitemporal cerebral edema. The differential diagnosis for the cerebral edema includes encephalopathy, encephalitis (HSV), and bacterial meningoencephalitis. The neuroservice recommends continuing antiviral therapy (ACV), antibiotics (ceftriaxone), and vancomycin. They suggest holding on lumbar puncture for now and repeating a head CT tomorrow morning to assess edema/mass effect. If safe, they plan to perform an LP. The patient is also loaded on Keppra and will be monitored for seizures. Sodium and osmolarity levels should be checked every 4 hours, and mannitol should be administered if sodium <150 and osms <330. Lactulose will be continued for encephalopathy. The respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including ascites, encephalopathy, and possible PNA/effusion. Hepatopulmonary syndrome may also contribute to the increased oxygen requirement. Vancomycin levels should be maintained between 15-20, and FiO2 should be weaned today. The patient's gastrointestinal bleed is currently stable. Cirrhosis management includes monitoring hematocrit levels and continuing lactul"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of HCV and etoh cirrhosis. The patient presented with variceal bleeding and was transferred from OSH. She required intubation, had a seizure, and developed bitemporal cerebral edema. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cerebral edema: The patient is experiencing bitemporal cerebral edema, which can be caused by factors such as encephalopathy, encephalitis (HSV), or bacterial meningoencephalitis. Immediate measures should be taken to manage this condition, including repeating Head CT tomorrow morning to assess edema/mass effect, considering a lumbar puncture if safe, and closely monitoring sodium and osmolality levels every four hours.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to multifactorial reasons, including ascites, encephalopathy, and possible pneumonia/effusion. Management should involve weaning FiO2 and continuing with appropriate antibiotics.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): Although the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding seems to be stable for now, it is crucial to closely monitor hematocrit levels and be prepared for any potential bleeding episodes.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, and measures should be continued to prevent complications associated with this condition, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). This includes"

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis, admitted with variceal bleeding. She developed hepatic encephalopathy, intubated for airway protection, and cerebral edema. She is currently experiencing seizures as indicated by the EEG. The patient's condition includes respiratory failure, GI bleeding, and hypernatremia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cerebral edema: The patient already has cerebral edema, which could worsen if not managed properly.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease has led to encephalopathy, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to her underlying condition and the current need for ventilatory support.
4. GI bleeding: Although the patient has been stabilized after banding of esophageal varices, there is a risk of re-bleeding.
5. Infection: The presence of fever and positive sputum culture for MRSA suggests the possibility of hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and if not managed carefully, it could lead to dehydration and further complications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding but developed hepatic encephalopathy, airway protection, and cerebral edema. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Cerebral edema: The patient's neurological status has been deteriorating, with symptoms such as seizures, encephalopathy, and diffuse hypodensity involving the white matter tracks, predominantly involving the temporal and frontal lobes. This indicates possible cerebral edema, which could be related to severe hepatic encephalopathy. Other types of encephalitis, such as infectious (HSV, bacterial), should also be considered. Immediate interventions include mannitol administration, EEG monitoring, and appropriate antibiotics coverage for potential infections.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for airway protection due to GI bleeding. Subsequently, she became confused, developed hepatic encephalopathy, and presented with fever and MRSA in sputum, suggesting the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's baseline condition includes hepatopulmonary syndrome with PaO2 in the 60s. Management involves ABX therapy targeting MRSA and other common pathogens, serial chest X-rays, ABG analysis, VAP precautions, daily wake-up"

","The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted with variceal bleeding and was stabilized but later developed hepatic encephalopathy, intubated for airway protection, and cerebral edema. The patient has been experiencing ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), with bright red blood noted in the nasogastric (NG) tube. The source of the bleeding is suspected to be esophageal varices, as she had a significant bleed previously for which she underwent banding. She received multiple blood products including packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets. Her hematocrit levels have been monitored, and she is on IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for gastric acid suppression.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and she is intubated on assist-control ventilation (ACV) due to airway protection and respiratory failure. She has MRSA in her sputum, and there is concern for possible pneumonia at the left base. She also has hepatopulmonary syndrome with PaO2 in the 60s. Her EEG indicates sporadic seizure activity, and she is on keppra for seizure control.

The patient is hypernatremic, with an unclear etiology. The goal is to dry out brain edema, so hypertonic saline is being used to bring her sodium levels back up to 150-160. She has thrombocytopenia, likely related to liver disease, and has received platelet transfusions. Her liver disease has decompensated, leading to encephalopathy and variceal bleeding. She is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's medical history includes depression, and her medications have been held due to her altered mental status. She has a central venous line (CVL) placed, and she is on multiple medications for various conditions."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding and was stabilized. However, she developed hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and on mechanical ventilation. She has bright red blood lavaged from her nasogastric tube, indicating ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The source of bleeding is suspected to be esophageal varices. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and has thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UGIB: The patient is experiencing ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has developed hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function as a result of severe liver disease. This can manifest as confusion, altered mental status, and seizures.
3. Cerebral edema: The patient has cerebral edema, which can cause increased intracranial pressure and potentially lead to herniation if not managed appropriately.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for airway protection due to the risk of aspiration. She now has respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, possibly due to hepatopulmonary syndrome or pneumonia.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with Hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis who was initially admitted for variceal bleeding. She developed hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema, leading to intubation for airway protection. The patient also has a history of GI bleeding, respiratory failure, and hypernatremia. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum meningeal antibiotics, hypertonic saline, and other ICU medications. 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding, which is a significant risk factor for re-bleeding. Continuous monitoring and close observation are necessary to detect any signs of active bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating a concern for infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and regular assessment of laboratory parameters are important to detect any signs of infection.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which can present with altered mental status. Monitoring for changes in mental status and maintaining lactulose and rifaximin therapy is crucial.
4. Cerebral edema: The patient has cerebral edema, as evidenced by the head CT scan. Close monitoring of neurological status and maintaining appropriate sodium levels through hypertonic saline administration is necessary to manage cerebral edema.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has a"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) CEREBRAL EDEMA:  HSV encephalitis remains a possibility.  Head CT is
   stable and she appears to be interacting somewhat today.
   -Continue acyclovir empirically for HSV, holding off on LP due to
   cerebral edema.
   -Will d/c ceftriaxone as there is no evidence of bacterial meningitis
   -Hypertonic saline to maintain sodium 150.
   -Serial head CT and neuro exams.
   -Keppra for seizures.  EEG monitoring for epilepsy team.
   -Continue lactulose/rifaximin
   2) HEMATEMESIS:  Some clots from OGT over the weekend.  None recently
     -Continue to monitor Hct's through the day.
     -GI following.  Cont PPI.
   3) RESP FAILURE:  Though she has a MRSA pneumonia, her cerebral edema
   has also limited extubation.
     -Check compliance
     -PSV trial today.
     -Diurese today, goal CVP <6.  Consider paracentesis soon to improve
   chest wall mechanics.
     -Continue vancomycin.
    4) CIRRHOSIS:
    -Continue lactulose, rifaxmin.
    5) NUTRITION:
    -Resume TFs today
   Rest of plan per Resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently in the ICU. The patient's condition is complicated by cerebral edema, respiratory failure, hematemesis, cirrhosis, and malnutrition. The patient has been diagnosed with HSV encephalitis, MRSA pneumonia, and liver cirrhosis. They are being treated with multiple medications including acyclovir, vancomycin, hypertonic saline, lactulose, rifaximin, and proton pump inhibitors. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but they require respiratory support through mechanical ventilation. The patient's blood tests show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, total CO2, glucose, and liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal the presence of an endotracheal tube and central venous catheter, as well as low lung volumes. The patient's neurological examination is impaired due to sedation, and their abdominal examination shows distention and firmness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Edema: The patient's condition is complicated by cerebral edema, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological complications if not managed properly.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires respiratory support through mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. This could be due to the MRSA pneumonia or the limited lung volumes seen on the chest X-ray.
3. Hematemesis: The patient has experienced hematemesis, which"

   Ascites:  NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   1) CEREBRAL EDEMA:  HSV encephalitis remains a possibility.  Head CT is
   stable and she appears to be interacting somewhat today.
   -Continue acyclovir empirically for HSV, holding off on LP due to
   cerebral edema.
   -Will d/c ceftriaxone as there is no evidence of bacterial meningitis
   -Hypertonic saline to maintain sodium 150.
   -Serial head CT and neuro exams.
   -Keppra for seizures.  EEG monitoring for epilepsy team.
   -Continue lactulose/rifaximin
   2) HEMATEMESIS:  Some clots from OGT over the weekend.  None recently
     -Continue to monitor Hct's through the day.
     -GI following.  Cont PPI.
   3) RESP FAILURE:  Though she has a MRSA pneumonia, her cerebral edema
   has also limited extubation.
     -Check compliance
     -PSV trial today.
     -Diurese today, goal CVP <6.  Consider paracentesis soon to improve
   chest wall mechanics.
     -Continue vancomycin.
    4) CIRRHOSIS:
    -Continue lactulose, rifaxmin.
    5) NUTRITION:
    -Resume TFs today

   Other white matter disease cannot be excluded. MRI of the head is the
   best
   modality for evaluation of the white matter disease and cerebral edema.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted initially for variceal bleeding and later developed hepatic encephalopathy, leading to intubation for airway protection and cerebral edema. She also has respiratory failure, possibly due to hepatopulmonary syndrome. The patient has multiple medical complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, cerebral edema, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, end-stage liver disease, and potential depression. She is currently being treated with hypertonic saline, diuretics, antibiotics, and other medications to manage her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding and recent bright red blood lavaged from the NG tube. There is concern for ongoing bleeding or rebleeding.
2. Cerebral edema: The patient has diffuse hypodensity involving the white matter tracts, predominantly involving the temporal lobe, also involving the frontal lobes. This indicates cerebral edema, which can be a life-threatening complication in patients with liver failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has baseline hepatopulmonary syndrome with PaO2 in the 60s. She requires ventilatory support and diuresis to manage her respiratory failure.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has an unclear etiology of hypernatremia. It is being managed with hypertonic saline to"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) CEREBRAL EDEMA:  HSV encephalitis remains a possibility.  Head CT is
   stable and she appears to be interacting even more today.
     -Continue acyclovir empirically for HSV, holding off on LP due to
   cerebral edema.
     -Hypertonic saline to maintain sodium 150.
     -Serial head CT and neuro exams, will discuss with neurology
   regarding timing of next head CT.
     -Keppra for seizures.  EEG monitoring per epilepsy team.
     -Continue lactulose/rifaximin
   2) HEMATEMESIS:  Some clots from OGT over the weekend.  None recently

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing cerebral edema, which is being managed with acyclovir for suspected HSV encephalitis, hypertonic saline to maintain sodium levels, serial head CT scans, Keppra for seizures, lactulose, and rifaximin. The patient also has hematemesis, which is being monitored closely with Hct measurements. Respiratory failure is present due to MRSA pneumonia and limited extubation caused by cerebral edema. The patient's lines include an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and an 18-gauge line. Prophylactic measures include DVT boots, stress ulcer PPI, and VAP mouth care. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Edema: The patient's cerebral edema could worsen, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential brain herniation.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could progress, resulting in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, potentially leading to respiratory arrest.
3. Hematemesis: If the patient continues to experience hematemesis, it could lead to significant blood loss, resulting in hypotension and shock.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections due to the presence of invasive lines and immobility in the ICU.
5. Hepatic Enceph"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) CEREBRAL EDEMA:  HSV encephalitis remains a possibility.  Head CT is
   stable and she appears to be interacting even more today.
     -Continue acyclovir empirically for HSV, holding off on LP due to
   cerebral edema.
     -Hypertonic saline to maintain sodium 150.
     -Serial head CT and neuro exams, will discuss with neurology
   regarding timing of next head CT.
     -Keppra for seizures.  EEG monitoring per epilepsy team.
     -Continue lactulose/rifaximin
   2) HEMATEMESIS:  Some clots from OGT over the weekend.  None recently
     -Continue to monitor Hct's through the day.
     -GI following.  Cont PPI.
   3) RESP FAILURE:  Though she has a MRSA pneumonia, her cerebral edema
   has also limited extubation.
     -PSV trial today with weaning as able.
     -Diurese today, goal CVP <6.
     -Continue vancomycin.
    4) CIRRHOSIS:
     -Continue lactulose, rifaxmin.
    5) NUTRITION:
     -Continue TF.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding and later developed hepatic encephalopathy, requiring intubation for airway protection and treatment for cerebral edema. 

The patient has a history of GI bleed, with bright red blood lavaged from the NG tube, and there is concern for a variceal bleed. She has received blood products and PPI therapy to manage the bleeding. 

The patient also has respiratory failure, initially intubated for airway protection, and now suspected to be due to hepatopulmonary syndrome with PaO2 in the 60s. She is on AV ARDSNET ventilation and diuresis with IV lasix and PO spironolactone.

The patient has hypernatremia, possibly due to hypertonic saline administration to manage cerebral edema. Thrombocytopenia is present, likely related to liver disease, and she has received platelet transfusions. 

The patient's liver disease has led to decompensation with encephalopathy and variceal bleeding. She is being treated with lactulose/rifaxamin for encephalopathy, and diagnostic paracentesis was negative for SBP.

There are also mentions of depression, access lines, and communication in the note.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, further gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding and subsequently developed hepatic encephalopathy, airway protection, and cerebral edema. The patient has also experienced respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleeding. She has been diagnosed with MRSA in her sputum, possible pneumonia at the left base, and hepatopulmonary syndrome. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving hypertonic saline, lactulose/rifaximin, and antibiotics for MRSA coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease has led to hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by altered mental status and confusion. It is crucial to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further deterioration.
2. Cerebral edema: The patient has cerebral edema, which can worsen if not properly managed. Hypertonic saline and close monitoring of sodium levels are important to prevent increased intracranial pressure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Daily weaning trials should be considered while maintaining vigilance for any signs of respiratory distress or worsening oxygenation.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has experienced recurrent GI bleeding, likely due to portal hypertension from her cirrhosis. Continued monitoring and management of coagulopathy, along with prophylactic measures, are essential"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition remains stable, with no new culture data available. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), blood pressure ranging from 97/61 to 142/82 mmHg, heart rate between 88-116 bpm, respiratory rate at 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient's CVP is within normal range, and fluid balance is positive. The patient is receiving various medications including propofol, furosemide, pantoprazole, and others. 

The patient's MRI brain is pending, and the head CT is stable. The patient appears to be interacting more today. Acyclovir is being continued empirically for HSV, and hypertonic saline is being used to maintain sodium levels at 150. Keppra is also being given for seizures. Lactulose and rifaximin are being continued for cirrhosis.

The patient has had episodes of hematemesis, and the cause is being monitored. Respiratory support is still required due to the patient's respiratory failure, limited by cerebral edema and hepatopulmonary syndrome. A PSV trial is planned today with weaning as able, along with diuresis to achieve a CVP less than 6. Vancomycin will be completed tomorrow after a 7-day"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding and later developed hepatic encephalopathy, leading to intubation for airway protection and cerebral edema. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypernatremia (possibly iatrogenic), thrombocytopenia (likely due to liver disease), end-stage liver disease (ESLD) with decompensation, and depression (meds held due to mental status). She also has hepatopulmonary syndrome. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition may worsen, leading to further deterioration in the patient's mental status and increased risk of infection.
2. Cerebral edema: The patient's brain swelling could progress, potentially leading to increased intracranial pressure and the risk of herniation.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support may be required for an extended period, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: There is a possibility of recurrent bleeding, especially if the patient's liver disease worsens.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count may continue to decrease, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels could persist or wors"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding and developed hepatic encephalopathy, leading to intubation for airway protection and cerebral edema. The patient has had multiple complications including respiratory failure, GI bleed, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, ESLD, and depression. She is currently on various medications and treatments to manage these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Edema: The patient's condition of cerebral edema is a serious concern. It can lead to increased intracranial pressure, herniation, and potentially death if not managed properly.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to her underlying liver disease and the development of hepatopulmonary syndrome. This can result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. GI Bleeding: The patient's history of variceal bleeding indicates a risk of further gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to hypotension, shock, and anemia.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels can cause neurological symptoms and increase the risk of cerebral edema.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the context of her liver disease.
6. ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease): The patient's liver disease has"

","The patient is a critically ill individual with several ongoing medical conditions and complications. The chief complaint is not specified, but the patient's progress note provides information about various events, treatments, and assessments.

1. PSV trial yesterday: The patient attempted a spontaneous breathing trial but developed tachypnea and was not successful in weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Mild hypotension after lasix bolus dose: The patient experienced a slight drop in blood pressure after receiving a dose of lasix, but no further intervention was required.
3. Allergies: The patient has a known allergy to nadolol and another unknown allergy.
4. Medications: The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including propofol, pantoprazole, furosemide, peridex, rifaximin, ursodiol, RISS, lactulose, Reglan, keppra, spironolactone, and albuterol. The last doses of antibiotics (ceftriaxone, acyclovir, vancomycin) were administered on different dates.
5. Physical examination: The patient appears well-nourished and shows no signs of acute distress. However, there are diminished breath sounds in the chest, and the abdomen is distended. Neurological examination is incomplete due to sedation.
6. Vital signs: The patient's temperature is within normal range, but their heart rate is slightly elevated. Blood pressure is stable, with some fluctuations"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted with variceal bleeding and developed hepatic encephalopathy, leading to intubation for airway protection and cerebral edema. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), respiratory failure, GI bleed, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), and potential infections such as HSV encephalitis and bacterial meningitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SVT: The patient experienced an episode of SVT, which was initially managed with metoprolol but required further monitoring and attention to electrolyte balance.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation for airway protection initially due to GI bleed and later developed respiratory failure, likely related to hepato-pulmonary syndrome.
3. GI Bleed: The patient presented with variceal bleeding, which resulted in significant blood loss and subsequent encephalopathy.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient developed hypernatremia, likely iatrogenic due to hypertonic saline administration.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, possibly related to liver disease, and received platelet transfusions.
6. ESLD: The patient has end-stage liver disease, evidenced by hepatic Decomp"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted with variceal bleeding and developed hepatic encephalopathy, leading to airway protection and intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with cerebral edema, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, and end-stage liver disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral edema: The patient's brain swelling can worsen, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential brain herniation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate, resulting in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: There is a risk of further bleeding from the varices or other sources, which can lead to hypotension and shock.
4. Hypernatremia: The high sodium levels can cause neurological complications, such as seizures and cerebral edema.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, especially in the context of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. End-stage liver disease: The patient's liver function may continue to deteriorate, leading to hepatic encephalopathy and multiorgan failure.
7. Infections: The patient is at risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), due to her compromised"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) CEREBRAL EDEMA:  HSV encephalitis remains a possibility.  MRI
   suggestive of HSV vs edema related to liver disease but also some
   question of hypoxic injury
     -Continue acyclovir empirically for HSV, holding off on LP due to
   cerebral edema.
     -Per neuro, reasonable to keep sodium above 140 at this point.  D/C
   hypertonic saline
     -Keppra for seizures.
     -Continue lactulose/rifaximin
    2) RESP FAILURE:  Though she had a MRSA pneumonia, her cerebral edema
   has also limited extubation.  Also has known hepatopulmonary syndrome
     -SBT today
     -Continue diuresis as below.  Will use lasix drip to avoid
   hypotension.
     -Vancomycin course now completed
   3) SVT:  Possibly related to diuresis
     -Gentle diuresis
     -Replete lytes
     -Adenosine PRN
   4) HEMATEMESIS:  Some clots from OGT over last weekend.  None recently
     -Continue to monitor Hct's
     -GI following.  Cont PPI.
    5) CIRRHOSIS:
     -Continue lactulose, rifaxmin.
    6) NUTRITION:
     -Continue TF.
   Rest of plan per Resident note.

The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple ongoing medical issues. They have been admitted to the ICU, where they are receiving various treatments and interventions. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. The patient experienced a sudden onset of SVT overnight, which was managed with metoprolol and resulted in the patient reverting to sinus rhythm. The patient has been placed on assisted ventilation and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient's allergies include nadolol, with unknown allergies to other medications. The patient has received antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and acyclovir, but their last doses are not specified. The patient is currently on several infusions, including propofol, furosemide (Lasix), and metoprolol. Other medications include rifaximin, ursodiol, RISS, reglan, keppra, aldactone, lactulose, hypertonic saline, and pantoprazole (Protonix). The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 97 bpm with a normal range of 83-175 bpm, blood pressure of 104/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute with a normal range of 15-32 breaths per minute, oxygen"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) CEREBRAL EDEMA:  HSV encephalitis remains a possibility.  MRI
   suggestive of HSV vs edema related to liver disease but also some
   question of hypoxic injury
     -Continue acyclovir empirically for HSV, holding off on LP due to
   cerebral edema.
     -Per neuro, reasonable to keep sodium above 140 at this point.  D/C
   hypertonic saline
     -Keppra for seizures.
     -Continue lactulose/rifaximin
    2) RESP FAILURE:  Though she had a MRSA pneumonia, her cerebral edema
   has also limited extubation.  Also has known hepatopulmonary syndrome
     -SBT today
     -Continue diuresis as below.  Will use lasix drip to avoid
   hypotension.
     -Vancomycin course now completed
   3) SVT:  Possibly related to diuresis
     -Gentle diuresis
     -Replete lytes
     -Adenosine PRN
   4) HEMATEMESIS:  Some clots from OGT over last weekend.  None recently
     -Continue to monitor Hct's
     -GI following.  Cont PPI.
    5) CIRRHOSIS:
     -Continue lactulose, rifaxmin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU with suspected HSV encephalitis. They have a history of cirrhosis and are experiencing respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia, as well as hepatopulmonary syndrome. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. They have had episodes of SVT, hematemesis, and cerebral edema. The patient is on multiple medications including acyclovir, metoprolol, pantoprazole, rifaximin, ursodiol, reglan, keppra, aldactone, and lactulose. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 104/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's labs show abnormal liver function tests and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging shows low lung volumes, a central venous catheter in place, and a retrocardiac opacity. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and various treatments and interventions are being implemented to manage their multiple medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Edema: The patient has evidence of cerebral edema, which can be a complication of HSV encephalitis or related to liver disease and hypoxic injury. This condition can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological deterioration.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted with variceal bleeding and later developed hepatic encephalopathy, requiring intubation for airway protection and treatment for cerebral edema. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, end-stage liver disease (ESLD), and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to multiple factors such as hepatic encephalopathy, potential pneumonia at the left base, and hepatopulmonary syndrome. Continuous monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation are necessary.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which may be iatrogenic due to hypertonic saline administration. The goal is to maintain a sodium level above 140 mEq/L. Close monitoring of sodium levels and fluid balance is required.

3. Thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to liver disease. The patient has received platelet transfusions in the past. Continuous monitoring of platelet count and prompt transfusion for active bleeding are important.

4. ESLD: The patient has decompensated ESLD with encephalopathy and massive variceal bleeding. Daily monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is necessary. Prophylactic therapy with proton"

   Assessment and Plan
   49 y.o. female with Hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis, initially admitted
   with variceal bleeding to OSH, stabilized, but developed hepatic
   encephalopathy, intubated for airway protection, and cerebral edema.
    # SVT
   - broke with metoprolol, held BP
   - no further evidence on monitor
   - monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] while on lasix
   # Cerebral edema.  hepatic decompensation vs infectious vs anoxic brain
   injury after hypotensive when presented to OSH with variceal bleed.
   - MRI with evidence of grey-white matter cortical involvement,
   concerning for anoxic brain injury but location (symmetric
   temporal/insular) concerning for HSV encephalitis
   - Neuro input appreciated
   - goal Na > 140 given we are out of acute period
   - stop hypertonic saline
   - serial Na [**Hospital1 7**]; goal Na > 140 per neuro
   - reserve use of mannitol in case evidence of herniation
   - continue keppra
   - Acyclovir dose decreased to 650mg based on IBW, Q8H to cover HSV
   encephalitis; course is 14-21 days ([**12-21**] - )
   - peeled off CTX for coverage of bacterial meningitis - vanco continued
   for MRSA in sputum
   - continue lactulose/rifaxamin for encephalopathy.
   # Respiratory failure.  Initially was intubated for airway protection,
   [**1-15**] GI bleed.  Later became confused, felt [**1-15**] hepatic encephalopathy.
   Had MRSA in sputum, ? PNA at left base.  At baseline has
   hepatopulmonary syndrome with PaO2 in the 60s.    On lasix gtt
   - continue diuresis with lasix/spironolactone today as BP tolerates
   - tolerated PS , will try SBP again today
   - ABX: vanco course completed (for MRSA in sputum [**2180-12-21**]- [**2180-12-28**])
   - VAP precautions, daily wake up, RSBI when appropriate
   - consider  paracentesis (large volume) to assist with her breathing
   but only if diuresis does not work after 2-3 days
   # Hypernatremia.  Iatragenic with hypertonic saline
   - Goal sodium > 140 now that acute period has passed
   - Na [**Hospital1 7**]
   - stopped  hypertonic saline
    # Thrombocytopenia.  Likely [**1-15**] liver disease.  Received several
   platelet transfusion at [**Hospital3 1959**] hosptial.  Also received 1 unit
   PLTs here on [**2180-12-21**]
   - transfuse platelets for active bleeding
   - continue to monitor
   - consider DIC if clinical picture suggestive
   # ESLD.  Decompensated with encephalopathy and massive variceal
   bleeding at [**Hospital3 1959**] Hosp , s/p banding x 2 and 13 units PRBCs, 12
   units FFP, 20 units PLTs there.  Here,  bright red blood with clots
   lavaged from NG tube [**2180-12-24**].   GI aware of new bleeding, but felt not
   large volume.  Hemodynamically stable with stable Hct x days.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding and stabilized, but then developed hepatic encephalopathy, intubated for airway protection, and cerebral edema. The patient has multiple medical complications including SVT, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, end-stage liver disease (ESLD), depression, and central venous line (CVL) placement.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. SVT: Supraventricular tachycardia can lead to complications such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure, or even a stroke if left untreated.
2. Respiratory failure: This can result in hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis. If not managed properly, it may lead to further lung infections or respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Hypernatremia: Excessively high sodium levels can cause neurological symptoms like confusion, seizures, and even coma if not corrected promptly.
4. Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet counts increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. ESLD: End-stage liver disease can progress to liver failure, leading to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and an increased risk of infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of HCV and cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for hematemesis and airway protection due to MRSA VAP. The patient has experienced seizures and cerebral edema, with concerns of herniation. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 106/60 mmHg to 126/77 mmHg, heart rate between 97-109 bpm, respiratory rate of 18-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving diuretics and lactulose for cerebral edema and hepatic encephalopathy. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and cerebral edema pose a risk for further neurological deterioration, including herniation.
2. Pulmonary complications: Intubation and mechanical ventilation may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other lung infections. The patient's small lung volumes seen on chest X-ray indicate possible lung collapse or atelectasis.
3. Renal complications: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, considering his history of cirrhosis and potential hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and liver failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old with a history of Hepatitis C and cirrhosis, presenting with hepatopulmonary syndrome. They were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hematemesis and required intubation for airway protection. The patient developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and experienced a seizure, leading to concerns of cerebral edema and potential herniation. The patient's mental status has shown improvement, but they continue to require mechanical ventilation and have been on diuretics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/60 mmHg to 126/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes and low albumin levels, along with other abnormalities in kidney function and electrolytes. Imaging shows the endotracheal tube positioned correctly and small lung volumes. The patient's care plan includes managing neurologic symptoms, optimizing pulmonary support, monitoring cardiovascular status, addressing gastrointestinal issues, assessing renal function, managing hemodynamics, and treating any infections."

   Assessment and Plan
   49 y.o. female with Hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis, initially admitted
   with variceal bleeding to OSH, stabilized, but developed hepatic
   encephalopathy, intubated for airway protection, and cerebral edema.
    # SVT
   - broke with metoprolol, held BP
   - no further evidence on monitor
   - monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] while on lasix
   # Cerebral edema.  hepatic decompensation vs infectious vs anoxic brain
   injury after hypotensive when presented to OSH with variceal bleed.
   - MRI with evidence of grey-white matter cortical involvement,
   concerning for anoxic brain injury but location (symmetric
   temporal/insular) concerning for HSV encephalitis
   - Neuro input appreciated
   - repeat CT head [**12-31**]
   - goal Na > 140 given we are out of acute period
   - stop hypertonic saline
   - serial Na [**Hospital1 7**]; goal Na > 140 per neuro
   - reserve use of mannitol in case evidence of herniation
   - continue keppra
   - Acyclovir dose decreased to 650mg based on IBW, Q8H to cover HSV
   encephalitis; course is 14-21 days ([**12-21**] - )
   - peeled off CTX for coverage of bacterial meningitis - vanco continued
   for MRSA in sputum
   - continue lactulose/rifaxamin for encephalopathy.
   # Respiratory failure.  Initially was intubated for airway protection,
   [**1-15**] GI bleed.  Later became confused, felt [**1-15**] hepatic encephalopathy.
   Had MRSA in sputum, ? PNA at left base.  At baseline has
   hepatopulmonary syndrome with PaO2 in the 60s.    On lasix gtt
   - continue diuresis with lasix/spironolactone today as BP tolerates
   - tolerated PS , but MS still poor; defer SBT today
   - ABX: vanco course completed (for MRSA in sputum [**2180-12-21**]- [**2180-12-28**])
   - VAP precautions, daily wake up, RSBI when appropriate
   - consider  paracentesis (large volume) to assist with her breathing
   but only if diuresis does not work after 2-3 days
   # Hypernatremia.  Iatragenic with hypertonic saline
   - Goal sodium > 140 now that acute period has passed
   - Na [**Hospital1 7**]
   - stopped  hypertonic saline
    # Thrombocytopenia.  Likely [**1-15**] liver disease.  Received several
   platelet transfusion at [**Hospital3 1959**] hosptial.  Also received 1 unit
   PLTs here on [**2180-12-21**]
   - transfuse platelets for active bleeding
   - continue to monitor
   - consider DIC if clinical picture suggestive
   # ESLD.  Decompensated with encephalopathy and massive variceal
   bleeding at [**Hospital3 1959**] Hosp , s/p banding x 2 and 13 units PRBCs, 12
   units FFP, 20 units PLTs there.  Here,  bright red blood with clots
   lavaged from NG tube [**2180-12-24**].   GI aware of new bleeding, but felt not
   large volume.  Hemodynamically stable with stable Hct x days.
   - daily Hct
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - stable from UGI bleeding standpoint
   - liver input appreciated
   - lactulose/rifaxamin
   - RUQ u/s shows patent portal flow on [**2180-12-21**]
   - diagnostic paracentesis [**2180-12-21**] was negative for SBP
   - trend transaminases, Tbili, albumin, coags

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding and was stabilized. However, she developed hepatic encephalopathy, which led to intubation for airway protection and cerebral edema.

The patient has multiple medical complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, as indicated by confusion and altered mental status. Lactulose and rifaximin are being used to manage this condition.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation initially for airway protection due to GI bleeding and later became confused, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy. She also has MRSA in her sputum and possible pneumonia at the left base. She has hepatopulmonary syndrome with PaO2 in the 60s. Diuretics are being used to manage her respiratory failure.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely caused by hypertonic saline administration. The goal is to maintain a sodium level above 140 now that the acute period has passed.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely due to liver disease. She received platelet transfusions at another hospital and also received one unit of PLTs here.

5. End-Stage Liver Disease (ES"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding and stabilized, but then developed hepatic encephalopathy, intubated for airway protection, and cerebral edema. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of improvement and deterioration. She has been diagnosed with anoxic brain injury and HSV encephalitis, and is currently receiving treatment for both conditions. 

The patient's respiratory status is stable, and she is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 40%. Her vital signs are within normal limits, and she is diuresing well. She has a history of MRSA in sputum and possible pneumonia at the left base, but her recent UCx was negative. 

The patient also has thrombocytopenia likely due to liver disease, and her platelet count has been monitored. She received platelet transfusions in the past but is currently stable without evidence of active bleeding. 

The patient has decompensated liver disease with encephalopathy and massive variceal bleeding. She has received blood transfusions and has stable hemodynamics with a stable Hct. 

There are no signs of ongoing GI bleeding, and her RUQ ultrasound shows patent portal flow. Diagnostic paracentesis was negative for SBP. 

The patient is on multiple medications, including lactulose/rifaxamin"

   Assessment and Plan
   49 y.o. female with Hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis, initially admitted
   with variceal bleeding to OSH, stabilized, but developed hepatic
   encephalopathy, intubated for airway protection, and cerebral edema.
   # Cerebral edema.  hepatic decompensation vs infectious vs anoxic brain
   injury after hypotensive when presented to OSH with variceal bleed.
   - MRI with evidence of grey-white matter cortical involvement,
   concerning for anoxic brain injury but location (symmetric
   temporal/insular) concerning for HSV encephalitis
   - Neuro input appreciated
   - repeat CT head [**12-31**]
   - goal Na > 140 given we are out of acute period
   - stop hypertonic saline
   - serial Na [**Hospital1 7**]; goal Na > 140 per neuro
   - reserve use of mannitol in case evidence of herniation
   - continue keppra
   - Acyclovir dose decreased to 650mg based on IBW, Q8H to cover HSV
   encephalitis; course is 14-21 days ([**12-21**] - )
   - peeled off CTX for coverage of bacterial meningitis - vanco continued
   for MRSA in sputum
   - continue lactulose/rifaxamin for encephalopathy.
   # Respiratory failure.  Initially was intubated for airway protection,
   [**1-15**] GI bleed.  Later became confused, felt [**1-15**] hepatic encephalopathy.

   - ABX: vanco course completed (for MRSA in sputum [**2180-12-21**]- [**2180-12-28**])
   - VAP precautions, daily wake up, RSBI when appropriate
   - consider  paracentesis (large volume) to assist with her breathing
   but only if diuresis does not work after 2-3 days
   # Hypernatremia.  Iatragenic with hypertonic saline
   - Goal sodium > 140 now that acute period has passed

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding and later developed hepatic encephalopathy, requiring intubation for airway protection and cerebral edema. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, end-stage liver disease (ESLD), and depression. She is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated due to airway protection and respiratory failure. She also has hepatopulmonary syndrome, which can contribute to further respiratory complications.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, which needs to be managed carefully to avoid complications such as cerebral edema.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet count, which can lead to increased bleeding risk. Platelet transfusions have been given to address this issue.
4. End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD): The patient's liver disease has progressed to ESLD, leading to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and portal hypertension.
5. Depression: The patient is being held on medications for depression due to mental status changes.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and testing may be required to fully assess the"

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C Cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with esophageal variceal bleeding. He required 13 units of packed red blood cells, 20 units of platelets, and 12 units of fresh frozen plasma. The patient experienced hypovolemic shock and was intubated for airway protection. He developed MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and had a seizure, for which he received hypertonic saline and mannitol. The patient has been treated with lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy and empiric therapy for HSV encephalitis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure of 105/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. The patient is well-nourished but somnolent, responding to commands. Lung examination reveals crackles on the side, and distant heart sounds are noted. The abdomen is distended but soft, and no nasogastric tube output is mentioned. Lower extremities are warm and dry. Peripheral pulses are not assessed. Skin is warm, and neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.2, hemoglobin of 11."

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted with variceal bleeding and stabilized, but then developed hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema. The patient was intubated for airway protection and treatment of hypotension. Imaging showed evidence of grey-white matter cortical involvement, concerning for anoxic brain injury or HSV encephalitis. Antibiotic coverage was adjusted accordingly.

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, and end-stage liver disease (ESLD). She has had episodes of GI bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which has been treated. The patient has hepatopulmonary syndrome with PaO2 in the 60s and is being diuresed with Lasix/spironolactone. Paracentesis was deferred due to good diuresis and compliance.

The patient received platelet transfusions at another hospital and here, and her platelet count is currently low. She has been extubated and is on Combivent nebs every 4 hours.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hepatic encephalopathy, further episodes of GI bleeding, respiratory failure, infection (such as SBP or MRSA), and thrombocytopenia."

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis who was initially admitted for variceal bleeding. She developed hepatic encephalopathy and was intubated for airway protection and cerebral edema. The patient has a history of liver disease, and her condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition is characterized by impaired brain function due to severe liver disease. The patient may experience confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for airway protection and later became confused, suggesting respiratory failure. She also has a history of MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and hepatopulmonary syndrome, which can cause low oxygen levels in the blood.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is likely related to her liver disease. Platelet transfusions have been given, but she remains at risk for bleeding complications.
4. ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease): The patient's liver disease has progressed to end-stage liver disease, leading to complications such as massive variceal bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy. She will require ongoing management and may eventually require liver transplantation.
5. GI bleeding: Although the patient's upper GI bleeding appears to have resolved, she continues"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of HCV-related cirrhosis who was admitted with a variceal bleed. He was intubated for airway protection and diagnosed with MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient experienced a seizure and cerebral edema, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy or HSV encephalitis. He is now extubated and showing slow improvement in mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatopulmonary syndrome: The patient's history of cirrhosis and ongoing low oxygen saturation (SpO2) despite being on high-flow oxygen suggest the possibility of hepatopulmonary syndrome.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's seizure and cerebral edema could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a common complication of advanced liver disease.
3. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA VAP and may be at risk for other infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
4. Variceal bleeding: Although the patient was initially admitted with variceal bleeding, it is unclear from the progress note whether he is currently bleeding or at risk for rebleeding.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been prophylaxed for DVT, indicating a potential risk for blood clots in the deep veins, particularly given his immobility and prolonged bed rest in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C virus cirrhosis, who was admitted with a variceal bleed and intubated for airway protection. The patient had MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and experienced a seizure, leading to a diagnosis of cerebral edema, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy or herpes simplex virus encephalitis. The patient was extubated yesterday and is showing slow improvement in mental status. 

24-hour events include the extubation, with ongoing high oxygen saturation in the 80s, consistent with hepatopulmonary syndrome. The patient's mean arterial pressures (MAPs) have been stable. Allergies include nadolol, with unknown allergen. The patient is currently on several medications including furosemide, lactulose, rifaximin, ursodiol, Keppra, and albuterol/atrovent.

Flowsheet data reveals the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results. The patient's blood pressure is low, with a heart rate within normal limits. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a slightly elevated pH and normal oxygen levels. Physical examination notes the patient as well-nourished, with no acute distress."

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted with variceal bleeding, stabilized, but developed hepatic encephalopathy, intubated for airway protection, and cerebral edema. She has been improving over the last few days. The patient is currently in the ICU, still experiencing some mental status changes, on supplemental oxygen, and receiving various medications including lactulose/rifaximin, keepra, and PPI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes and previous diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy indicate a risk for further deterioration in cognitive function.
2. Cerebral edema: The patient's history of cerebral edema and improvement suggest ongoing monitoring for any signs of recurrent cerebral edema.
3. Respiratory failure: Although the patient has been doing well 72 hours post-extubation, she remains on supplemental oxygen, indicating a potential risk for respiratory failure if not closely monitored.
4. Hepato-pulmonary syndrome: The patient's symptoms suggest a possible component of hepato-pulmonary syndrome, which can lead to severe hypoxemia and respiratory distress.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Despite stable hemodynamic status and daily Hct being stable, the patient has experienced multiple episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, putting her at risk for further bleeding events.
6. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SB"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted with variceal bleeding and later developed hepatic encephalopathy, intubated for airway protection, and cerebral edema. The patient also has respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, and end-stage liver disease (ESLD).

Assessment and Plan:
1. MS (mental status) improving, goal Na > 140 given we are out of acute period. Serial Na checks, no need for mannitol. Continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis, acyclovir dose decreased to 650mg based on IBW, Q8H to cover HSV encephalitis. Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.
2. Respiratory failure. Initially intubated for airway protection. Now extubated. Deferring paracentesis as diuresing well and compliance measured at ~70 on 12/31, which is not significantly impaired. Continue diuresis with lasix/spironolactone today as BP tolerates; goal 1-2 liters negative.
3. Thrombocytopenia. Likely secondary to liver disease. Received several platelet transfusion at another hospital. Also received 1 unit PLTs here on 12/21. Transfuse platelets for active bleeding (no evidence currently). Continue to monitor. Consider DIC if clinical picture suggestive.
4. ESLD. Decompensated with encephalopathy and massive variceal bleeding at another hospital. S/p banding x 2 and 13 units PRBCs, 12 units FFP, 20 units PLTs there. Here, bright red blood with clots lavaged from NG tube on 12/24. GI aware of new bleeding, but felt not large volume. Hemodynamically stable with stable Hct x days. Daily Hct. Changed IV PPI to PO PPI QD; no evidence of ongoing GI bleeding. Stable from UGI bleeding standpoint. Restart propranolol. Liver input appreciated. Lactulose/rifaximin. RUQ u/s shows patent portal flow on 12/21. Diagnostic paracentesis on 12/21 was negative for SBP. No need for SBP ppx per liver (protein in ascetic fluid > 1). Trend transaminases, Tbili, albumin, coags.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has already shown signs of hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status and potentially progress to coma if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may persist or recur, especially if there is an underlying infection or ongoing bleeding.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
4. ESLD: The patient's end-stage liver disease may continue to deteriorate, leading to further complications such as hepatic hydrothorax, hepatopulmonary syndrome, or hepatorenal syndrome.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted with variceal bleeding and later developed hepatic encephalopathy, leading to intubation for airway protection and cerebral edema. The assessment and plan include multiple medical complications that can arise.

1. MS (mental status) improving: The patient's mental status is improving, but she still has poor mental status and delirium. This can be a potential complication due to hepatic encephalopathy.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for airway protection and later became confused with respiratory failure. She had MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which has been treated with vancomycin. The patient also has hepatopulmonary syndrome, which is a complication of liver disease.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient likely has thrombocytopenia due to liver disease. She has received platelet transfusions at another hospital and also received 1 unit of PLTs here. Close monitoring of platelet levels is essential.

4. ESLD (end-stage liver disease): The patient has decompensated liver disease with encephalopathy and massive variceal bleeding at another hospital. She received banding and blood transfusions there. The patient still has GI bleeding, but it is not large in volume, and she is hemodynamically stable"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), and varices. They were initially admitted with a variceal bleed and had complications of cerebral edema and seizure. The patient's neurologic status improved slightly today, with increased wakefulness but still experiencing some speech latency and disorientation. The patient continues on acyclovir for viral hepatitis treatment, lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and Keppra for seizure prophylaxis. In the gastrointestinal department, the patient is on propranolol for bleed prophylaxis and does not require spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis. Renal management includes diuresis and a return to the home diuretic regimen. Pulmonary care involves extubation and FiO2 titration to maintain SpO2 at 88%. The patient is tolerating tube feeds and requires further evaluation. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, arterial line placement, DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and they are planned for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's disorientation and speech latency may indicate hepatic encephalopathy. Continued use of lactulose and rifaximin is appropriate for managing this condition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease), hepatopulmonary syndrome, and varices. He was initially admitted with a variceal bleed and had complications including cerebral edema and a seizure. The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Neurological status: More awake today, still with some speech latency and disorientation.
- GI (gastrointestinal): No need for SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) prophylaxis per liver, on propranolol for bleed prophylaxis.
- Renal: Diuresed TBB -500cc today, put back on home diuretic regimen today.
- Pulmonary: Extubated and doing well, persistent FiO2 requirement may be related to known HPS (hepatopulmonary syndrome), titrate FiO2 to keep SpO2= 88%, pulmonary toilet with MIE (mechanical insufflation-exsufflation) as needed.
- FEN (enteral nutrition): Tolerating TF (tube feeding) at goal.
- ICU care: Nutrition support through Fibersource HN (Full), glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, arterial line in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: Due to immunosuppression from ESLD, the patient is at increased risk of infections, including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and nosocomial infections.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted initially for variceal bleeding and later developed hepatic encephalopathy, intubation for airway protection, and cerebral edema. The patient has been improving over the last few days with the management of multiple medical complications. She is currently extubated and receiving supplemental oxygen. Her vital signs are stable, and she is alert and oriented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can cause cognitive impairment and altered mental status. It needs to be managed with lactulose and rifaximin.
2. Cerebral edema: The patient has shown improvement in cerebral edema, but it should be closely monitored.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is still on supplemental oxygen, indicating some component of hepato-pulmonary syndrome. Aggressive diuresis has been initiated to reduce ascites load and improve chest wall compliance.
4. Esophageal varices bleeding: Although the patient has undergone banding procedures, there have been instances of bleeding from the NG tube. Close monitoring for any signs of re-bleeding is necessary.
5. Hepatitis C: The patient's underlying liver disease needs to be managed appropriately.
6. HSV encephalitis: Acyclovir has been prescribed as a preventive measure.
7. Depression: The patient's mental status should be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding and stabilized, but then developed hepatic encephalopathy, intubated for airway protection, and cerebral edema. The patient's condition has been improving over the last few days. 

Potential medical complications:
1. MS (Multifactorial) cerebral edema: This could be due to hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema (possibly related to liver disease or HSV encephalitis) as well as ICU delirium.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient remains on supplemental O2 and is likely experiencing some component of hepatopulmonary syndrome. She has been aggressively diuresed to reduce ascites load and improve chest wall compliance.
3. ESLD (End-stage liver disease): The patient is decompensated with encephalopathy and massive variceal bleeding. She has received banding procedures and blood transfusions in the past. There is ongoing bright red blood with clots being lavaged from her NG tube.
4. Depression: The patient's mental status is poor, making it unsafe for her to take depression medications.
5. FEN (feeding): The patient is unable to tolerate oral intake due to poor mental status, so she is being fed through a nasogastric tube.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old female with Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted with variceal bleeding and stabilized, but then developed hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema. The patient was intubated for airway protection and later extubated on December 31st. She has been receiving lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and her cerebral edema is improving. The patient remains on supplemental oxygen and is expected to continue weaning off it as tolerated. She has been aggressively diuresed to reduce ascites load and improve chest wall compliance. No paracentesis is needed at the moment.

The patient has a history of decompensated end-stage liver disease (ESLD) with encephalopathy and massive variceal bleeding. She received banding twice and blood transfusions at the previous hospital. Here, she experienced bright red blood with clots lavaged from her nasogastric tube. Her hemodynamic status has been stable with stable hematocrit levels for several days. The patient is prescribed proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and continues with lactulose and rifaximin. There is no indication for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis per liver guidelines.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can cause altered mental status, confusion, and other neurological symptoms due to the buildup"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted for variceal bleeding and stabilized but later developed hepatic encephalopathy, requiring intubation for airway protection. She was extubated on 12/31/2180. The patient's condition has been improving, although she still exhibits increased speech latency and some confusion. She requires occasional suctioning and encouragement to cough.

Medical Complications:
1. MS (Multifactorial), Cerebral edema: The patient likely has multifactorial cerebral edema from hepatic encephalopathy and possibly HSV encephalitis. She is being treated with lactulose/rifaximin and monitored closely.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has shown improvement after being extubated 72 hours ago. She remains on supplemental O2 and is suspected to have a component of hepato-pulmonary syndrome. Aggressive diuresis has been administered to reduce ascites load and improve chest wall compliance.
3. ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease): The patient's liver disease is decompensated with encephalopathy and massive variceal bleeding. She received blood transfusions at the previous hospital and is now experiencing bright red blood with clots from the NG tube. Her hemodynamic status is stable, with daily Hct being stable.
4. Depression: The patient's mental status is currently being monitored, and antidepress"

   49yo with ESLD, hepatopulm syndrome, varices.  Initially admitted with
   variceal bleed, course c/b cerbral edema and seizure.
    Neuro:  More awake today but clearly still some cognitive deficit.
     -Concitnue Acyclovir course (total 3 weeks)
     -continue lactulose and Rifaximin although will decrease lactuose
   today given large stool outptu.
     -Keppra for seizure prophylaxis, time course to be determined by
   neuro, follow up EEG from yesterday.
    GI
     -No need for SBP prophylaxis per liver
     -On propranolol for bleed prophylaxis
   Renal:  Started back on home diuretic regimen yesterday. Lasix held

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old individual with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), and varices. They were initially admitted for a variceal bleed and later developed cerebral edema and seizures. The patient's current condition is still characterized by some cognitive deficit. The medical team continues the Acyclovir course for a total of three weeks, lactulose, and Rifaximin, although the dose of lactulose will be decreased due to significant stool output. Keppra is prescribed for seizure prophylaxis, with the timing to be determined by the neurologist and follow-up EEG from yesterday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatopulmonary Syndrome (HPS): The patient has HPS, which can lead to low blood oxygen levels due to abnormal blood vessels in the lungs. This can result in hypoxemia and respiratory distress.
2. Variceal Bleed: The patient initially presented with a variceal bleed, indicating a risk of further bleeding episodes from the enlarged veins in the esophagus or stomach.
3. Cerebral Edema: The patient developed cerebral edema, which is a potentially life-threatening condition that can cause increased intracranial pressure and neurological complications.
4. Seizures: The patient experienced seizures, which can be recurrent in patients with ESLD and require proper management to prevent further seizure episodes.
5. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid"

","The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding and subsequently developed hepatic encephalopathy, requiring intubation for airway protection. The patient was extubated and transferred out of the ICU but was readmitted with hypoxia and possible aspiration.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to hepato-pulmonary syndrome, and has been receiving aggressive pulmonary toilet, weaning of oxygen as tolerated, and continued diuresis to reduce ascites load.

The patient also has cerebral edema, which is improving, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy, cerebral edema, and ICU delirium. Treatment includes the continuation of lactulose/rifaximin, follow-up neuro recommendations, and monitoring for seizures.

Additionally, the patient has end-stage liver disease (ESLD) with complications such as massive variceal bleeding and ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. Treatment includes daily Hct monitoring, PO PPI, lactulose, rifaximin, and no indication for SBP PPX per liver.

Other conditions include depression, for which medication has been held due to mental status, and feeding tube placement with a pureed diet.

The patient's code status is full code, and her current disposition is in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   49 y.o. female with Hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis, initially admitted
   with variceal bleeding to OSH, stabilized, but developed hepatic
   encephalopathy, intubated for airway protection (extubated on [**2180-12-31**]),
   and cerebral edema.   Extubated, transferred out of ICU on [**1-3**], but
   re-admitted with hypoxia and ? aspiration.
   # Respiratory failure: Had been doing well post-extubation; remains on
   supplemental O2; likely some component of hepato-pulmonary syndrome;
   has been aggressively diuresed lately to reduce ascites load and
   improved chest wall compliance.  On the floor [**1-3**], desatted to 85% on
   5L NC; came up quickly,  unknown if aspirated, CXR essentially
   unchanged.
   -- monitor closely, hold on adding antibiotics for now
   -- aggressive pulmonary toilet
   -- wean O2 as tolerated; Sats > 88% ok
   -- continue diuresis goal I/O negative ~1L goal today; written for
   standing lasix 20 mg IV QD (home dose 40 mg QD)
   -- c/s paracentesis to assist with breathing
   -- cont nebulizers PRN as needed for wheezing
   # Cerebral edema: Mental status improving greatly over last few days;
   likely multifactorial from hepatic encephalopathy &  cerebral edema
   (possibly [**1-15**] liver disease +/- HSV encephalitis)  &  ICU dilirum.
   -- cont lactulose/rifaximin
   -- f/u neuro recs; no need for repeat imaging currently
   -- cont keppra, though will discuss with neuron when possible to d/c;
   no recent seizure activity
   -- Acyclovir dose decreased to 650mg based on IBW, Q8H to cover HSV
   encephalitis; course is 21 days (d1 = [**12-21**])
   # ESLD.  Decompensated with encephalopathy and massive variceal
   bleeding at [**Hospital3 1959**] Hosp , s/p banding x 2 and 13 units PRBCs, 12
   units FFP, 20 units PLTs there.  Here,  bright red blood with clots
   lavaged from NG tube [**2180-12-24**].   GI aware of new bleeding, but felt not

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding and stabilized, but then developed hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema. She was extubated and transferred out of the ICU, but returned with hypoxia and suspected aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on supplemental oxygen and is being closely monitored. It is likely that she has a component of hepato-pulmonary syndrome, which is a complication of liver disease. She has been aggressively diuresed to reduce ascites load and improve chest wall compliance.

2. Cerebral Edema: The patient's mental status is improving, likely due to a combination of hepatic encephalopathy, cerebral edema, and ICU delirium. Treatment includes continuing lactulose/rifaximin, following up with neuro recommendations, and discussing the possibility of discontinuing keppra since there have been no recent seizure activities.

3. End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD): The patient has decompensated ESLD with encephalopathy and massive variceal bleeding. She has undergone banding procedures and received blood transfusions. Daily Hct has been stable, and there are no indications for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis per liver guidelines.

4. Depression: The patient's mental status prevents the administration of depression medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old individual with ESLD (end-stage liver disease), hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), and varices. They were initially admitted for a variceal bleed and later developed cerebral edema and a seizure. The patient was sent back to the ICU due to a transient drop in oxygen saturation (sats). The current assessment indicates hypoxemia, likely caused by a combination of resolving pneumonia, atelectasis from abdominal distention, and HPS. The patient's cognitive deficit persists, and they continue to receive treatment for their neurological condition, gastrointestinal issues, and renal function. The patient is tolerating tube feeding at goal and is being closely monitored for dysphagia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has hypoxemia and is at risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening atelectasis.
2. Neurological Complications: The patient's cognitive deficit persists, indicating ongoing neurological issues. There is a risk of recurrent seizures or progression of neurological deterioration.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications: Although the patient is currently stable, they have a history of variceal bleeding and may be at risk for future bleeding episodes or development of other GI complications.
4. Renal Complications: The patient's renal function is being managed, but there is still a risk of renal deterioration due to ongoing liver disease or other factors.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), and varices. They were initially admitted with a variceal bleed, followed by cerebral edema and a seizure. The patient was sent back to the ICU for a transient drop in oxygen saturation (sat's). Hypoxemia is likely due to resolving pneumonia (PNA), secretions, atelectasis from abdominal distention, and HPS. The patient's cognitive deficit persists, and they continue on Acyclovir, lactulose, rifaximin, and keppra. The patient tolerates tube feeding at goal and is able to eat a dysphagia diet with close monitoring. The rest of the plan is per the resident note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's hypoxemia and history of PNA put them at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, atelectasis, and further desaturation.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's ESL and ongoing use of lactulose and rifaximin indicate a risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause cognitive deficits and seizures.
3. Bleeding: The patient's history of variceal bleed and current use of propranolol for prophylaxis suggest a risk for further bleeding episodes.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored due to the use of diuretics and potential ESL-related renal impairment.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to ESL and ongoing use of immunosuppressive medications increases the risk of infections, including bacterial and viral infections.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of respiratory status, hepatic encephalopathy, bleeding risk, renal function, and infection risk."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted with variceal bleeding and later developed hepatic encephalopathy, requiring intubation for airway protection. The patient was extubated and transferred out of the ICU but was readmitted with hypoxia and suspected aspiration.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains on supplemental oxygen due to respiratory failure, which is likely related to hepato-pulmonary syndrome. She has been aggressively diuresed to reduce ascites load and improve chest wall compliance.

2. Cerebral edema: The patient's mental status has improved over the last few days, likely due to a combination of hepatic encephalopathy, cerebral edema (possibly related to liver disease or HSV encephalitis), and ICU delirium.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for variceal bleeding and later developed hepatic encephalopathy, leading to intubation for airway protection. The patient was extubated on [**2180-12-31**] and transferred out of the ICU but was readmitted with hypoxia and suspected aspiration. She remains on supplemental oxygen and has been aggressively diuresed to reduce ascites load and improve chest wall compliance. The patient's mental status is stably poor due to anoxic brain injury, hepatic encephalopathy, and cerebral edema. She is currently being treated with lactulose and rifaximin, and acyclovir is being continued to cover possible HSV encephalitis. The patient's condition is complicated by ESLD (end-stage liver disease), decompensated with encephalopathy and massive variceal bleeding. She has received banding procedures and blood transfusions. The patient's current concerns include hypoxemia, cerebral edema, and ESLD. She is also being monitored for potential complications such as depression, fever, neutropenia, and sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hepato-pulmonary syndrome: This condition is characterized by abnormal oxygen exchange in the lungs due to advanced liver disease. It may contribute to the patient's ongoing hypoxia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old individual with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), and varices. The patient was initially admitted with a variceal bleed, experienced cerebral edema and seizures, and was sent back to the ICU for a transient drop in oxygen saturation (sats). 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia, likely due to a combination of resolving pneumonia with secretions, atelectasis from abdominal distention, and HPS. Oxygen requirements are being decreased and are currently on 3 liters per minute. The plan is to titrate the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to keep sats above 88%. Pulmonary toilet will also continue.

Neurological deficits persist, but the EEG shows no evidence of seizure activity. Acyclovir course will be continued for a total of three weeks, along with lactulose and rifaximin. The patient will continue on keppra as prescribed by the neurologist.

   Assessment and Plan
   49yo with ESLD, hepatopulm syndrome, varices.  Initially admitted with
   variceal bleed, course c/b cerbral edema and seizure.  Sent back to the
   ICU for transient drop in sats.
   Hypoxemia:  Likely combination of resolving PNA with secretions,
   atelectasis from abdominal distention and HPS.  Oxygen requirements
   continuing to decrease, currently on 3L.
     -Titrate FiO2 to keep sat's >88%.
     -Continue pulmonary toilet
   Neuro:  Cognitive deficit persists.  EEG without evidence of seizure.
     -Concitnue Acyclovir course (total 3 weeks)
     -continue lactulose and Rifaximin.
     -continues on keppra per neuro.
    GI
     -No need for SBP prophylaxis per liver
     -On propranolol for bleed prophylaxis
    Renal:  Started back on home diuretic regimen.
     -Will target negative fluid balance.
    FEN:  Restart TF. Per SLP, able to eat dysphagia diet with close
   monitoring.
     -Will change NGT to Dobhoff in preparation for going to rehab.
   Dispo:  OK to go to the floor, also screening for rehab.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old individual with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), and varices. The patient was initially admitted for a variceal bleed and experienced cerebral edema and a seizure. They were sent back to the ICU due to a transient drop in oxygen saturation (sats).

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia, which is attributed to a combination of resolving pneumonia, atelectasis from abdominal distention, and HPS. Oxygen requirements are being gradually decreased, and the patient is currently on 3 liters of oxygen. The plan is to titrate the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to maintain sats above 88%.

The patient also has cognitive deficits persisting, with an EEG showing no evidence of seizure activity. The medical team has decided to continue the course of Acyclovir for a total of three weeks, as well as lactulose and rifaximin. The patient is also being continued on keppra per neurologic evaluation.

Regarding gastrointestinal health, the patient does not require small bowel prophylaxis per liver guidelines, but is on propranolol for bleed prophylaxis. In terms of renal health, the patient has been restarted on their home diuretic regimen, targeting a negative fluid balance.

For enteral feeding, the patient will resume tube feeding (TF) per speech-language pathologist (SLP) assessment, allowing"
