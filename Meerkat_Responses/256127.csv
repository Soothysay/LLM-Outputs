","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for evaluation and management of her respiratory symptoms. The patient required invasive ventilation and was placed on CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. A bronchoscopy was performed, showing evidence of tracheal collapse but no granulation tissue. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104-117/44-46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's labs show normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. The patient's main concern is dyspnea, and she may be a candidate for a Y stent placement in the future. She also has chronic respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, depression/anxiety, chronic pain, and anemia. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications:
1. Tracheomalacia: The patient has a history of tracheomalacia, which is the weakness and collapse of the tracheal walls. This can lead to airway obstruction and respiratory distress.
2. Granulation tissue: Although not present at the time of bronchoscopy, the development of granulation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for invasive ventilation due to shortness of breath. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation, with a tracheostomy tube in place. She has undergone an EKG, bronchoscopy, and will have a CT chest today. Her vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. She has limited air movement in the lungs with prolonged expiration phase and expiratory wheeze. There is also evidence of left-sided flank tenderness. The patient's lab results indicate slightly low hemoglobin levels and slightly elevated potassium levels. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Tracheomalacia: The patient has a known history of tracheomalacia, which can cause airway collapse leading to respiratory distress.
2. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient's history of chronic respiratory failure puts her at risk for further respiratory complications.
3. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: Being on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation, the patient may be at risk for ventilator-associated complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
4. Flank tenderness: The presence of left-sided flank tenderness may indicate a urinary tract infection or kidney involvement.
5. Anemia: The slightly low hemoglobin levels suggest anemia, which can contribute to decreased oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure who underwent tracheostomy for COPD. She is currently experiencing shortness of breath and possible tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) based on observations during bronchoscopy. The patient appears stable at this time. The plan is to proceed with a CT chest, followed by an operation for Y stent placement and tracheostomy tube change. She will continue her chronic prednisone medication and MDIs. Other medications for CHF/CAD, depression/anxiety, and chronic pain will also be continued as per previous prescriptions. The patient is currently on ICU care with appropriate nutrition, glycemic control, lines/intubation, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and her current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM): The patient's symptoms and bronchoscopic findings suggest TBM, which is characterized by weakness and collapse of the cartilage in the trachea and bronchi. This can lead to airway collapse during breathing, resulting in respiratory distress.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on invasive ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP, a type of lung infection that can occur in individuals receiving mechanical ventilation.
3. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure due to COPD, who underwent tracheostomy placement. She presents with respiratory distress and possible tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). The patient is currently stable and receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM): TBM is a condition characterized by weakness and floppiness of the cartilage in the trachea or bronchi, leading to airway collapse during inhalation. In this case, the patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest significant posterior membrane tenting into the lower end of the tracheostomy tube, which can cause physiology similar to TBM.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status and implement appropriate measures such as oral hygiene and appropriate antibiotic therapy if necessary.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: As the patient is immobile and critically ill, there is an increased risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin is recommended.

4. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: Critically ill patients, especially those receiving mechanical ventilation, are at higher risk of developing stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for evaluation and treatment. The patient underwent a tracheal Y stent placement yesterday due to tracheomalacia, but experienced discomfort and had bronchoscopy to confirm stent placement. She also developed a fever of 101.9°F. Her urine culture showed the presence of Proteus mirabilis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheomalacia: Tracheomalacia is the weakness and floppiness of the cartilage in the trachea, which can lead to airway collapse and breathing difficulties. The patient's recent tracheal Y stent placement aims to address this issue.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of fever and possible bilateral basilar atelectatic changes on the chest X-ray suggest the possibility of pneumonia.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The urine culture results indicating the growth of Proteus mirabilis, along with the fever, suggest a urinary tract infection.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection that occurs in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest in the ICU can increase the risk of developing blood clots"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and COPD. She underwent tracheal Y stent placement yesterday and is currently experiencing discomfort. She also has a fever of 101.9, which may be related to the stent placement or a urinary tract infection (UTI). The urine culture is positive for Proteus mirabilis. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9 C (98.4 F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 128/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are within normal limits. The patient's physical examination reveals right-sided wheezing, clear tracheostomy site, and marked tenderness in the left flank and abdomen without rebound or guarding. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Imaging shows little change with the tracheostomy tube in place and probable bilateral basilar atelectasis. The patient has multiple medical conditions including tracheobronchomalacia, chronic respiratory failure, left flank pain, fever, UTI, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), depression/anxiety, chronic pain, and anemia. She is currently on various"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure secondary to COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, and tuberculosis. She has been admitted to the ICU for tracheostomy placement and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain with fever overnight, and laboratory tests revealed urinary catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) with Proteus species. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen is ordered, and intravenous ceftriaxone has been started. The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and coronary artery disease (CAD), depression/anxiety, and chronic pain. She is receiving multiple medications for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia: This condition involves weakness in the cartilage of the trachea and bronchi, leading to airway collapse. It can cause respiratory distress and recurrent infections.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The presence of Proteus species suggests a bacterial infection, which may lead to pyelonephritis or sepsis if not treated promptly.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain could be due to various causes such as diverticulitis, peritonitis, or another intra-abdominal infection.
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient's underlying COPD can exacerbate during her hospital stay,"

   67 yo F with history of chronic respiratory failure s/p trach for COPD,
   tracheomalacia, now with shortness of breath, transferred from NH for
   evaluation by IP.
   # Tracheomalacia-  Y stent placed yesterday. In good place on re-bronch

   # L flank pain
 unclear etiology
 unremarkable UA but positive
   culture raises suspicion for pyelo. Will obtain a CT abd/pelvis to eval
   for pyelo/stranding or other intraabdominal pathology.
   # Fever
 likely related to stent placement vs. UTI, but given left
   flank pain, obtaining CT.
   # UTI
 on CTX for proteus; awaiting sensies.
   # Chronic Respiratory Failure s/p trach - patient usually without trach

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy placement for COPD and tracheomalacia. She presented with shortness of breath and was transferred from a nursing home for evaluation by the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient has been diagnosed with tracheomalacia, for which a Y stent was placed yesterday. She continues to receive CPAP/PS (continuous positive airway pressure/pressure support) ventilation, suctioning, pulmonary toilet, MDI (metered-dose inhaler), and chronic prednisone treatment.

The patient is also experiencing left flank pain with an unclear etiology. Her urine analysis is unremarkable, but she has a positive culture for Proteus Mirabilis, indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI). She is currently being treated with ceftriaxone for the UTI, but the sensitivity results are pending.

Additionally, the patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure following tracheostomy placement, and she is currently on CPAP/PS. It is unclear whether she tires during the day or if this is the standard of care at the nursing home.

The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), depression/anxiety, chronic pain, and anemia. Her medications include lasix, ACE inhibitor, aspirin, Zocor, toprol XL, effexor, seroquel, ativan prn, oxycontin, oxycodone prn, lidoderm patch, and iron.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F) at the highest point, heart rate ranging from 71-97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/41-157/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count. Liver function tests are within normal limits, but creatinine levels are slightly elevated. Blood cultures have been sent and are pending. The urine culture has identified Proteus Mirabilis, a common cause of urinary tract infections.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to tracheomalacia or Y stent complications, progression of UTI or development of renal infection, and exacerbation of CHF or CAD. It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, manage her UTI appropriately, and optimize her cardiovascular medications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy for COPD, tracheomalacia, and current symptoms including fever, altered mental status, and shortness of breath. She was transferred to the ICU for evaluation and is now on CPAP/PSV with an FiO2 of 50%. Blood cultures were sent due to fever, and urine culture revealed a Proteus mirabilis infection. The patient's LFTs are normal, but a CT scan showed mild biliary ductal dilation. She has multiple medical issues including tracheomalacia, chronic respiratory failure, UTI, CHF, CAD, depression/anxiety, chronic pain, anemia, and FEN. The plan includes holding sedating medications and oxygen, obtaining an abdominal ultrasound, following cultures, and switching antibiotics for the UTI.

Potential Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has an altered mental status which could be due to an infection, possibly secondary to the UTI caused by Proteus mirabilis. Monitoring of vital signs, regular assessment of mental status, and adherence to antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent worsening of the infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of chronic respiratory failure and tracheomalacia puts her at risk for respiratory compromise. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary. Adjustments to CPAP/PSV settings may be required to maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheobronchomalacia, COPD, tracheostomy, and Y stent. She has been intubated and is currently on CPAP. The patient is very somnolent and has severe abdominal pain on palpation with fever overnight. Her vital signs show a temperature of 38.3 C (100.9 F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/43 to 106/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's blood cultures were taken at 04:55 PM on 01/16/2126 for a temperature of 100.9 F. She was started on ceftriaxone for a suspected proteus urinary tract infection (UTI) and tried tidal volume (TM) ventilation twice yesterday, with current CPAP support overnight. The patient has a history of allergies to tetanus-diphtheria vaccine, NSAIDs, and unknown medications. She has not had a dose of antibiotics since 08:20 AM on 01/17/2126. The patient is receiving various ICU medications including lorazepam and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. She is also on chronic prednisone, MDIs, aspirin, ACEI, zocor, toprol XL, and lasix. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.2 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, and normal platelet count of 247 K/uL. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are within normal limits. The patient has an infection with proteus and pending blood culture results. The patient's tracheobronchomalacia is still present, and she is comfortable on CPAP. It is planned to check arterial blood gas (ABG) and attempt tidal volume ventilation again in the morning. The patient's severe abdominal pain with fever overnight could be related to her UTI. Further investigation is needed, including a whole abdomen ultrasound (US) and check of pancreatic enzymes. The patient's other medical conditions including congestive heart failure (CHF) and coronary artery disease (CAD) should be managed accordingly. The patient's chronic pain management may need to be adjusted. The patient's nutritional needs should be addressed with cautious oral intake due to the risk of aspiration. Glycemic control should be maintained with rissole. The patient requires better intravenous access. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for evaluation and has been experiencing altered mental status, shortness of breath, and L flank pain. The patient has undergone several tests and interventions, including an abdominal ultrasound (ABD U/S), urine culture, and CT abdomen/pelvis.

Impressions from the ABD U/S include a tortuous and enlarged common duct, with the distal common bile duct not visualized. No intrahepatic biliary dilatation is seen. An MRCP or ERCP is recommended to evaluate the distal CBD and ampulla. There are no gallstones identified and no signs of cholecystitis. No hydronephrosis is observed.

The urine culture revealed the presence of Proteus mirabilis, with a high number of organisms/ml. The organism is sensitive to several antibiotics, including cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and others.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/62 mmHg to 161/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 476 mL"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and COPD, was initially somnolent and disoriented but then woke up. 
- The patient has been experiencing shortness of breath and was transferred from a nursing home for evaluation.
- The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to infection or CO2 retention. Sources of infection include urine and bowel. Liver function tests are within normal limits, but there is ductal dilation seen on CT abdomen/pelvis. There is no evidence of pyelonephritis based on the CT scan.
- The patient has tracheomalacia, for which a Y stent was placed on 01/15/2026.
- The patient also has left flank pain with unclear etiology. Urine analysis is unremarkable, but a positive culture raises suspicion for pyelonephritis. CT abdomen/pelvis showed no signs of pyelonephritis or cholecystitis, and liver function tests are negative. An abdominal ultrasound is being obtained.
- The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is currently being treated with ceftriaxone. The causative organism is Proteus mirabilis. It is planned to switch to cefpodoxime for better coverage against Proteus.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure secondary to COPD, tracheomalacia, and other comorbidities including CHF, CAD, depression/anxiety, chronic pain, anemia, and FEN (likely referring to fecal incontinence). The patient was admitted to the ICU due to shortness of breath and altered mental status.

The patient's recent events include being initially somnolent but then waking up disoriented yesterday. Oxycontin and seroquel were held. UOP (urine output) dropped off, and the patient received two 500cc NS (normal saline) boluses.

Abdominal ultrasound findings revealed a tortuous and enlarged common duct with the distal common bile duct unable to be visualized. No intrahepatic biliary dilatation was seen, but there were no gallstones or signs of cholecystitis. An MRCP or ERCP is recommended to evaluate the distal CBD (common bile duct) and ampulla.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 135/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on CPAP/PSV ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure due to COPD and tracheobronchomalacia. She has undergone tracheostomy and Y stent placement. The patient tolerated the tracheostomy for a short time yesterday but is currently on CPAP and somnolent. Her abdominal pain has improved. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 171/76 mmHg, heart rate of 68 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature within normal range. The patient is on multiple medications including chronic prednisone, MDIs, cefpodoxamine for a Proteus UTI, aspirin, ACEI, zocor, toprol XL, and lasix for CHF/CAD. She is also on antihypertensive medication and has been advised to hold sedating medications, pain medications, and have cautious oral intake due to the risk of aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure due to COPD and tracheobronchomalacia. There is a potential risk of worsening respiratory failure, especially if the tracheostomy site becomes obstructed or if there is an infection.

2. Tracheostomy complications: The patient has recently undergone tracheostomy, and there is a potential risk of complications such as"

   COMPARISON: [**2126-1-15**].
   TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images through the chest without IV contrast
   using lung
   algorithm protocol.
   Coronal and sagittal reformatted views were displayed.
   CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Since prior study, there has been
   interval placement of Y-shaped tracheal stent. No other significant
   changes
   are noted. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum,
   pleural
   or pericardial effusion. Severe emphysema is again noted. There is no
   mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy. Atelectasis in the
   right
   middle lobe are noted. Aortic calcifications at the arch. Tracheostomy
   tube
   is again seen. Bilateral dependent atelectasis in the lower lobes.
   This study is not designed for evaluation of the abdomen, however, the
   visualized portions of the upper abdomen demonstrate a ventral hernia
   containing a loop of bowel and unchaged since prior study.
   BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
   IMPRESSION: Status post tracheal stent placement. No evidence of
   pneumomediastinum.
   .
   CXR [**1-18**] - HISTORY: Chronic respiratory failure. Rigid bronchoscopy
   with Y stent and
   tracheal tube change.
   IMPRESSION: Lung volumes remain low, and large band of atelectasis
   still
   crosses the left lower lung. Upper lungs clear. Tracheobronchial Y
   stent in

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mrs [**Known lastname 4084**] had a CT of chest that did not
   reveal PTX or pneumomediastinum
   Exam notable for elderly feamle with trach with diffuse exp wheezing to
   exam in all lung fields. Tm99.7 BP150/68 HR of 80 RR of [**7-15**] with sats
   of 94% on 30% FiO2 .
   Agree with plan to transfer back to rehab since there are no acute
   needs in ICU anymore. She will resume weaning on Trach collar at rehab
   during daytime and 'rest' at night. follow up will be with IP service.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath and altered mental status. The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with Y stent placement. Her current condition is improving, and she is responding well to CPAP/PSV ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumomediastinum: The patient initially had a question of pneumomediastinum, but subsequent CT scans did not reveal any evidence of pneumomediastinum.
2. Tracheomalacia: The patient has a history of tracheomalacia, for which a Y stent was placed. She will continue on CPAP/PSV for now and undergo pulmonary toilet.
3. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI), which is being treated with cefpodoxime.
4. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure secondary to tracheostomy and COPD. She will be weaned off the tracheostomy collar during the day and continue at night.
5. L-Flank Pain: The patient has unclear etiology of L-flank pain. Further evaluation is needed.
6. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, and iron supplementation will be continued.

   or pericardial effusion. Severe emphysema is again noted. There is no
   mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy. Atelectasis in the
   right
   middle lobe are noted. Aortic calcifications at the arch. Tracheostomy
   tube
   is again seen. Bilateral dependent atelectasis in the lower lobes.
   This study is not designed for evaluation of the abdomen, however, the
   visualized portions of the upper abdomen demonstrate a ventral hernia
   containing a loop of bowel and unchaged since prior study.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and COPD. She presented with shortness of breath and altered mental status. She was transferred from a nursing home for evaluation. The patient has been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy, placement of a Y-shaped tracheal stent, and administration of antibiotics. The patient's condition improved after receiving higher levels of oxygen and holding sedating medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of chronic respiratory failure and tracheomalacia puts her at risk for ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring of vital signs and oxygenation is necessary.

2. UTI: The patient has been diagnosed with a UTI and is currently being treated with cefpodoxime. It is important to ensure that the appropriate antibiotics are administered and to monitor for signs of infection.

3. L flank pain: The patient presents with unclear etiology of L flank pain. Further evaluation may be needed to determine the cause, which could potentially be pyelonephritis based on the positive culture.

4. Tracheomalacia: The patient has tracheomalacia and underwent placement of a Y-shaped tracheal stent. Monitoring for any complications related to the stent placement or worsening tracheomalacia is necessary.
