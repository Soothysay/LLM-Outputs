   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan: Pt. is a 32 year old painter w/PMH of unspecified
   childhood rheumatological diseases who presents with 10 day hx of
   fevers to 102.5, chills, nausea, vomiting, and a frontal headache, all
   of possibly infectious, possibly rheumatologic etiology.
   .
   ## Fevers, lymphadenopathy: Possible sources of his fevers are
   infectious. He had an LP which was negative for meningitis. CSF
   cultures were negative. CXR does have b/l bibasilar opacities and
   patient is hypoxic with a dry cough. No tonisillar process. No
   abdominal pain or diarrhea. UA negative. Blood cultures ngtd. No e/o
   active joint infection- has full range of motion with no pain. Patient
   has had negative babesia, anaplasma and lyme tests at osh. Viral (EBV,
   CMV, hepatitis) or tick borne illness is still a possibility. Given he
   lives in MV and has fever, LAD, HSM, rash, etc we must also entertain
   the possibility of tularemia. Another thought is a rheumatologic
   process such as Adult Stills disease given his fever, arthralgias,
   macular rash, lymphadenopathy, spleenomegaly, elevated lfts. [**Doctor First Name **]
   pending. Rh factor normal at 9. It is difficult to make this diagnosis
   in the context of ? infectious etiology, however.
   -          F/u pending labs and cultures
   -          f/u GI, derm, ID recs
   -          Continue antibiotics for now (Vanc/Zosyn/Doxy/Strepto)
   -          Get sputum culture, gram stain, fungal culture and AFB
   (expectorated)
   # Hypoxia: Most likely due to primary pulmonary process (as above).
   Will treat underlying cause accordingly ant continue with supplemental
   oxygen for now. Will continue antibiotics as above as well.
   # Transaminitis- Patient has elevated liver enzymes. This could be due
   to viral process including hepatitis, hiv, ebv. Could also be tick
   borne disease although babesia and erlichia were negative. No new
   medications and pt was only on trazadone which is not known to cause
   any LFT abnormalities. TSH was normal.
   -Obtain abdominal u/s to assess liver
   -trend lfts
   -add on hep a serology
   -f/u hep b and c as well as HIV and EBV
   .
   # Headache: CT head negative, LP negative. Unlikely to be post-LP
   headache given time frame and he had it prior to the LP. Likely due to
   fever, dehydration.
   - ibuprofen prn
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting: CT head negative for intracranial process. No abd
   pain, diarrhea. Patient is constipated which could be contributing.
   -cont compazine
   -bowel regimen
   .
   # Heartburn: EKG with TWI in v1, 2. 2 sets normal ces. This does not
   sound cardiac in nature. Symptoms sound more consistent with GERD or
   reflux. This could be due to doxycycline and or ibuprofen.
   -famotidine
   -complete romi
   -ekg
   .
   # Sinus Tacchycardia: Patient appears volume overloaded with elevated
   JVP but he is likely intravascularly deplete given fevers and poor po
   intake. Per floor team, patient was minimally responsive to IV boluses
   and HR dropped to low 100s after 2 liters last night. TSH normal and no
   PE on exam.
   - cont to monitor
   - hold off on IVF for now and f/u on echo
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia: no evidence of active bleeding.
   -check iron studies, b12, folate
   -guaic stools
   -look at peripheral smear
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient's plts are 189 today. On admission to [**Hospital **]
   hospital they were 225 and trended down to low 100s. Plts trending up.
   -monitor plts
   -check peripheral smear r/o schistos
   -check fibrinogen although DIC unlikely
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of unspecified childhood rheumatological diseases. He presents with a 10-day history of fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, and a frontal headache. The possible sources of his fevers are infectious, as indicated by negative results for meningitis and CSF cultures. The patient also has bibasilar opacities on CXR and is hypoxic with a dry cough. There are no tonsillar processes, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. The patient's urine analysis is negative, and blood cultures have not grown anything yet.

The patient lives in MV and has fever, lymphadenopathy, headache, spleenomegaly, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and a rash. Given these symptoms, the possibility of tularemia and a rheumatologic process such as Adult Still's disease should be considered. The patient's Rh factor is normal at 9.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxia: Most likely due to a primary pulmonary process. Treatment will focus on addressing the underlying cause, and supplemental oxygen will be continued for now.
2. Transaminitis: Elevated liver enzymes could be due to viral processes including hepatitis, HIV, or EBV. It could also be related to tick-borne disease, although Babesia and Ehrlichia tests were negative. No new medications have been introduced,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan: Pt. is a 32 year old painter w/PMH of unspecified
   childhood rheumatological diseases who presents with 10 day hx of
   fevers to 102.5, chills, nausea, vomiting, and a frontal headache, all
   of possibly infectious, possibly rheumatologic etiology.
   .
   ## Fevers, lymphadenopathy: Possible sources of his fevers are
   infectious. He had an LP which was negative for meningitis. CSF
   cultures were negative. CXR does have b/l bibasilar opacities and
   patient is hypoxic with a dry cough. No tonisillar process. No
   abdominal pain or diarrhea. UA negative. Blood cultures ngtd. No e/o
   active joint infection- has full range of motion with no pain. Patient
   has had negative babesia, anaplasma and lyme tests at osh. Viral (EBV,
   CMV, hepatitis) or tick borne illness is still a possibility. Given he
   lives in MV and has fever, LAD, HSM, rash, etc we must also entertain
   the possibility of tularemia. Another thought is a rheumatologic
   process such as Adult Stills disease given his fever, arthralgias,
   macular rash, lymphadenopathy, spleenomegaly, elevated lfts. [**Doctor First Name **]
   pending. Rh factor normal at 9. It is difficult to make this diagnosis
   in the context of ? infectious etiology, however.

   - add on hep a serology
   - check tularemia serologies
   - check rmsf serologies
   - consider sending another smear for parasites and lyme titers as can

   - consider ID consult ? empiric tularemia tx with streptomycin
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
   -consider rheum consult
   -obtain derm consult for bx
   .
   # Transaminitis- Patient has elevated liver enzymes. This could be due
   to viral process including hepatitis, hiv, ebv. Could also be tick
   borne disease although babesia and erlichia were negative. No new
   medications and pt was only on trazadone which is not known to cause
   any LFT abnormalities. TSH was normal.
   -Obtain abdominal u/s to assess liver
   -trend lfts
   -add on hep a serology
   -f/u hep b and c as well as HIV and EBV
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient has b/l basilar opacities on cxr which could
   represent pna. No e/o active ischemia. CTA negative for PE. Appears
   volume depleted on exam. BNP is elevated and patient has elevated JVP.
   -f/u echo
   -supplemental oxygen
   -treat empirically for pna with vanc and zosyn as developed infiltrates
   in hospital
   -obtain sputum cx induced, consider bronch
   -f/u urine legionella

   # Headache: CT head negative, LP negative. Unlikely to be post-LP
   headache given time frame and he had it prior to the LP. Likely due to
   fever, dehydration.
   - ibuprofen prn
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting: CT head negative for intracranial process. No abd
   pain, diarrhea. Patient is constipated which could be contributing.
   -cont compazine
   -bowel regimen
   .
   # Heartburn: EKG with TWI in v1, 2. 2 sets normal ces. This does not
   sound cardiac in nature. Symptoms sound more consistent with GERD or
   reflux. This could be due to doxycycline and or ibuprofen.
   -famotidine
   -complete romi
   -ekg
   .
   # Sinus Tacchycardia: Patient appears volume overloaded with elevated
   JVP but he is likely intravascularly deplete given fevers and poor po
   intake. Per floor team, patient was minimally responsive to IV boluses
   and HR dropped to low 100s after 2 liters last night. TSH normal and no
   PE on exam.
   - cont to monitor
   - hold off on IVF for now and f/u on echo
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia: no evidence of active bleeding.
   -check iron studies, b12, folate
   -guaic stools
   -look at peripheral smear

   ICU admission was triggered by worsening hypoxia in the setting of

   has moved proximally with prominent components of erythema, warmth and
   burning sensation but minimal pruritis.  His hypoxia was associated
   with significant and bilateral consolidations.
   1)Hypoxia-Certainly the physiology is likely related to functional
   shunt through basilar consolidations.  However, the source of these
   consolidations remains unclear.  On CXR he has evolved significant and
   bilateral effusions which do appear to be increased from yesterday to
   today.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan: Pt. is a 32 year old painter w/PMH of unspecified
   childhood rheumatological diseases who presents with 10 day hx of
   fevers to 102.5, chills, nausea, vomiting, and a frontal headache, all
   of possibly infectious, possibly rheumatologic etiology.
   .
   ## Fevers, lymphadenopathy: Rheumatologic disease unlikely in the
   setting of negative [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, negative ESR. This still may be an
   infectious process by an atypical bacteria/paracyte snce EBV, CMV
   serologies are negative for acute infection. We are awaiting the
   preliminary [**Doctor First Name 1021**] result for HIV and most of the tick-borne and endemic
   diseases in the area. We also need to cosider granulomatous diseases
   such with the preliminary findings in the skin biopsy.
   -          F/u pending labs and cultures
   -          f/u GI, derm, ID recs
   -          F/u skin biopsy results
   -          Continue antibiotics for now (Vanc/Zosyn/Doxy/Strepto)- Day
   3
   # Hypoxia: Most likely due to primary pulmonary process (as above).
   Will treat underlying cause accordingly ant continue with supplemental
   oxygen for now. Will continue antibiotics as above as well.
   # Transaminitis- Patient has elevated liver enzymes. Trending up. This
   could be due to viral process including hepatitis, hiv, ebv. Could also
   be tick borne disease although babesia and erlichia were negative. No
   new medications and pt was only on trazadone which is not known to
   cause any LFT abnormalities. TSH was normal. Normal abdominal USG;
   negative hepatitis serologies.
   -trend lfts
   .
   # Heartburn: EKG with TWI in v1, 2. 2 sets normal ces. This does not
   sound cardiac in nature. Symptoms sound more consistent with GERD or
   reflux. This could be due to doxycycline and or ibuprofen.
   -famotidine
   .
   # Sinus Tacchycardia: Patient appears volume overloaded with elevated
   JVP but he is likely intravascularly deplete given fevers and poor po
   intake. Per floor team, patient was minimally responsive to IV boluses
   and HR dropped to low 100s after 2 liters last night. TSH normal and no
   PE on exam.
   - cont to monitor
   - hold off on IVF for now and f/u on echo
   .
   # Normocytic Anemia: no evidence of active bleeding. Normal b12 &
   flolate. Iron profile comptabile with chronic disease.
   -guaic stools
   .
   # FEN: HD stable but tacchycardic, replete lytes prn, regular diet
   .
   # PPx: famodtidine, Bowel regimen, HSC

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan: Pt. is a 32 year old painter w/PMH of unspecified
   childhood rheumatological diseases who presents with 10 day hx of
   fevers to 102.5, chills, nausea, vomiting, and a frontal headache, all
   of possibly infectious, possibly rheumatologic etiology.
   .
   ## Fevers, lymphadenopathy: Rheumatologic disease unlikely in the
   setting of negative [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, negative ESR. This still may be an
   infectious process by an atypical bacteria/paracyte snce EBV, CMV
   serologies are negative for acute infection. We are awaiting the
   preliminary [**Doctor First Name 1021**] result for HIV and most of the tick-borne and endemic
   diseases in the area. We also need to cosider granulomatous diseases
   such with the preliminary findings in the skin biopsy.
   -          F/u pending labs and cultures
   -          f/u GI, derm, ID recs
   -          F/u skin biopsy results
   -          Continue antibiotics for now (Vanc/Zosyn/Doxy/Strepto)- Day

   # Hypoxia: Most likely due to primary pulmonary process (as above).
   Will treat underlying cause accordingly ant continue with supplemental
   oxygen for now. Will continue antibiotics as above as well.
   # Transaminitis- Patient has elevated liver enzymes. Trending up. This
   could be due to viral process including hepatitis, hiv, ebv. Could also
   be tick borne disease although babesia and erlichia were negative. No
   new medications and pt was only on trazadone which is not known to
   cause any LFT abnormalities. TSH was normal. Normal abdominal USG;
   negative hepatitis serologies.
   -trend lfts
   .
   # Heartburn: EKG with TWI in v1, 2. 2 sets normal ces. This does not
   sound cardiac in nature. Symptoms sound more consistent with GERD or
   reflux. This could be due to doxycycline and or ibuprofen.
   -famotidine
   .
   # Sinus Tacchycardia: Patient appears volume overloaded with elevated
   JVP but he is likely intravascularly deplete given fevers and poor po
   intake. Per floor team, patient was minimally responsive to IV boluses
   and HR dropped to low 100s after 2 liters last night. TSH normal and no
   PE on exam.
   - cont to monitor

","Summary of the Progress Note:

- The patient is a 32-year-old painter with a history of unspecified childhood rheumatological diseases.
- The patient presents with 10 days of fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, and a frontal headache, possibly of infectious or rheumatologic origin.
- Initial assessment suggests that the fevers, lymphadenopathy may not be due to rheumatologic disease, given negative ANCA and ESR results.
- Infectious process by atypical bacteria/parasite is still a possibility, especially since EBV and CMV serologies are negative for acute infection.
- Preliminary skin biopsy findings indicate granulomatous involvement, which raises suspicion for granulomatous diseases.
- The patient's hypoxia is likely due to a primary pulmonary process, and treatment should focus on addressing the underlying cause.
- The patient's transaminitis, characterized by elevated liver enzymes, could be caused by viral processes, including hepatitis, or tick-borne diseases.
- The patient's heartburn symptoms are not consistent with cardiac origin and may be due to GERD or reflux, possibly induced by doxycycline and ibuprofen.
- The patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP but is intravascularly depleted given fevers and poor oral intake.
- Normocytic anemia is present without evidence of active bleeding, and the iron profile is compatible with chronic disease.
- The patient's FEN (fistula evaluation and management) is stable but tachycardic, with replete lytes PRN (as needed) and regular diet.
- The patient's PPx (pre-procedural plan) includes famotidine, bowel regimen, and HSC (hepatobiliary scintigraphy).
- The patient's access is through a PIV (peripheral intravenous) line.
- The patient's code status is full, and emergency contact information is provided.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infectious Process: The patient's presentation suggests an infectious etiology, possibly involving atypical bacteria or parasites. Further evaluation of cultures and serologies is necessary to identify the causative agent.

2. Granulomatous Disease: The preliminary skin biopsy findings indicate granulomatous involvement, raising suspicion for granulomatous diseases. Further investigation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.

3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to a primary pulmonary process. Addressing the underlying cause and providing supplemental oxygen may be necessary to improve oxygenation.

4. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes could be indicative of viral hepatitis or a tick-borne disease. Monitoring liver function and evaluating for specific viral infections is essential.

5. Heartburn/GERD: The patient's heartburn symptoms may be due to GERD or reflux, potentially induced by medications such as doxycycline and ibuprofen. Managing the underlying cause and providing appropriate treatment for GERD is necessary.

6. Volume Overload/Depletion: The patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP but is intravascularly depleted given fevers and poor oral intake. Close monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   32 yo male admitted with prodrome of fever/rash and significant
   pulmonary consolidations.  He has had extensive serologies without
   clear answer in terms of bacterial infection or connective tissue
   disease being identified.  He has had some significant improvement in
   pulmonary infiltrates and respiratory status on empiric antibiotics.
   1)Fever/Rash-Tularemia negative, EBV, CMV negative as well as testing
   for rheum diseases to date.  Tick borne illnesses also have been tested
   as negative.  This makes final diagnosis still unclear.  In this
   setting he has had clinical improvement and cultures negative.  Of
   concern is that the patient is having persistent fevers.  Persistent
   fevers and rare granulomatous changes on biopsy would still suggest
   continued leading diagnosis may be Tularemia and/or Tick Borne illness.
   -Doxycycline
will continue until RMSFnegative
   -Vanco/Zosyn
no evidence of bacterial infection but suspicion was for
   lung infection given infiltrates but this was in absence of significant
   clinical evidence of pneumonia so woud favor D/C of Vanco/Zosyn at this
   time.
   -Streptomycin
will D/C with Tularemia negative confirmed after
   discussion with ID and clear evidence that a negative test in this
   setting crosses the threshold for considering acute disease not
   present.  At this point favor continued support with Streptomycin and
   follow up testing at a time when titers may be positive.

","The patient is a 32-year-old male admitted with fever, rash, and significant pulmonary consolidations. He has undergone extensive serologies without a clear answer regarding bacterial infection or connective tissue disease. The patient has shown some improvement in pulmonary infiltrates and respiratory status on empiric antibiotics. However, his final diagnosis is still unclear, with persistent fevers and rare granulomatous changes on biopsy suggesting a possible ongoing infection such as tularemia or tick-borne illness.

The patient is currently on doxycycline, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Doxycycline will continue until the RMSF (Rickettsia rickettsii infection) test is negative. Vancomycin and Zosyn will be discontinued as there is no evidence of bacterial infection. Streptomycin will be continued with discussion about discontinuing it once tularemia is confirmed negative.

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition through a PO diet, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is planned for transfer to the floor."
