","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and complete heart block, who presented to the emergency department for right leg wound evaluation after undergoing a right leg three-compartment fasciotomy for compartment syndrome. The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypotension. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypoglycemia, a large left lower quadrant hematoma, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 81/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 2 L nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating persistent hypotension. This could be due to hypovolemia, acute blood loss, sepsis, or other causes. Further evaluation and management are needed to stabilize the patient's blood pressure.

2. Large Left Lower Quadrant Hematoma: The patient has a significant hematoma in the left lower quadrant. This could potentially lead to further complications such as infection, necrosis, or additional bleeding. Monitoring and appropriate management are required to prevent these complications.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which may be secondary to volume depletion or other causes. Correcting the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and complete heart block who underwent a right leg three-compartment fasciotomy for compartment syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension. The patient's medical complications include hypotension, RLE wound, hematuria, hyponatremia, CHF with systolic dysfunction, BPH, CAD, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea.

The patient's hypotension is likely due to hypovolemia caused by dehydration or acute blood loss. The elevated BUN/Cr ratio, hyponatremia, and physical exam findings support dehydration. There is also a possibility of sepsis given the patient's post-operative status, recent hospitalization, and fever.

The patient's RLE wound is a result of the fasciotomy procedure performed due to compartment syndrome. The wound is saturated with blood, indicating ongoing bleeding.

Hematuria is mentioned as a complication that occurred during post-operative care. It is important to contact urology regarding this issue.

Hyponatremia may be secondary to volume depletion, but after IV fluid resuscitation, the patient appears dry. It is necessary to trend sodium levels and provide gentle IVF boluses.

The patient's CHF with systolic dysfunction should be managed by holding Lasix due to marginal blood pressures and considering rein"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20% in 2015, complete heart block, and pacemaker dependence. He presented to the emergency department for right lower extremity (RLE) wound evaluation after undergoing a right leg three-compartment fasciotomy for compartment syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has been resolved but may recur. It is important to monitor his vital signs closely and adjust his medications accordingly. The patient should be given a hct bump if necessary and continue with lovenox and ASA as recommended by the vascular surgery team. A type and screen should be done to prepare for any potential blood transfusions.

2. RLE wound post fasciotomy: The patient's RLE wound appears to be stable at the moment, but it is crucial to follow up with the vascular surgeon's recommendations. The dose of lovenox should be adjusted if needed based on the 10A level.

3. Bladder distension: The patient has bladder distension as seen on the CT scan. The Foley balloon is inflated in the urethra, and it is important to advance the Foley catheter and monitor the urine output (UOP).

4. Hematuria"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), complete heart block, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20% in 2157, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presented to the emergency department for evaluation of his right lower extremity (RLE) wound after undergoing a three-compartment fasciotomy for compartment syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and is currently being managed for several conditions.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension was due to bleeding but has now resolved and is related to post-obstructive diuresis. The I/O (intake/output) should be matched, and the patient's hematocrit should be followed. The patient is on LMWH (low molecular weight heparin) per vascular surgery for popliteal aneurysms, and an active type and screen should be maintained. Antihypertensives have been held as the patient only experiences hypotension while sleeping.

2. RLE wound: The patient has a developing fluid collection in the RLE wound post fasciotomy. An outline of the fluid collection should be done, and a discussion plan for the fluid collection with vascular surgery is needed. Antibiotics may be considered given the patient's diabetes and recent compromised blood flow. The patient's 10A level should be followed and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20% in [**2157**], and complete heart block, who is pacer dependent. He presented to the emergency department for right lower extremity (RLE) wound evaluation after undergoing a three-compartment fasciotomy for compartment syndrome in his RLE. 

The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, which initially was due to bleeding but is now related to post-obstructive diuresis. The patient has had a significant drop in hematocrit (hct), which is likely related to the RLE. The patient has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (uPRBC) with an appropriate hct bump, and the trend for hct is to be checked every 12 hours. The patient is also on lovenox and aspirin per vascular surgery recommendations for popliteal aneurysms. 

The patient's right lower extremity wound, which underwent fasciotomy, shows no current bleeding, and the vascular surgeon's recommendations will be followed. The patient's Foley catheter was advanced, resulting in significant urine output and resolution of acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's hematuria has resolved, and he will undergo an outpatient urologic evaluation today."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20% in [**2157**], and complete heart block, who presents to the emergency department for right lower extremity (RLE) wound evaluation after undergoing a 3-compartment fasciotomy for compartment syndrome. The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, blood thinners, cardiac medications, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which has been partially resolved but may require further management.
2. RLE wound s/p fasciotomy: There is a concern about the wound healing and potential infection, especially since there is a small area of fluctuance noted below the wound.
3. Bladder distension: The patient has a markedly distended bladder, likely due to the presence of a foley balloon inflated in the urethra.
4. Hematuria: Although currently not present, there is a history of hematuria that may return and require further management.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is improving with IV fluids but needs close monitoring, especially considering the expected post-obstructive diuresis.

The patient presents to the emergency department for right lower extremity (RLE) wound evaluation after undergoing a right leg three-compartment fasciotomy for compartment syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension is likely due to bleeding, but now it is complicated by post-obstructive renal failure diuresis. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and appropriate management are necessary.
2. RLE Wound: The patient has undergone a fasciotomy for compartment syndrome in his right leg. There is no current bleeding, but further evaluation and follow-up with a vascular surgeon are recommended. Adjusting the dose of lovenox may be required based on the 10A level. A distal fluid collection should be addressed, and empirical antibiotic therapy may be considered.

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20% in [**2157**], and complete heart block, who presents to the emergency department for right lower extremity (RLE) wound evaluation after undergoing a right leg 3-compartment fasciotomy for compartment syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and his course has been complicated by bladder distension and renal failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/61 mmHg to 132/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and a heart rhythm of ventricular paced. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation is 55%, and fluid balance shows an input of 4,610 mL and output of 6,030 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,420 mL.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including dextrose 50%, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and others. His allergies include Procardia (Nifedipine) and Benadryl (Diphenhydramine Hcl). He has a Foley catheter in place, and his last dose of antibiotics was given at [**2161-6-14**] 04:45 AM and 08:16 AM.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, PERRL, normocephalic head, cervical lymph nodes within normal limits, crackles in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, wrapped right leg with surrounding edema and sita to wound vac, and trace edema on the left leg. His neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.7 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) of 10.0 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) of 545 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.1 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.01 ng/mL, glucose of 120 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include various medical conditions and complications such as hypotension, RLE wound, post-obstructive renal failure, CHF with systolic dysfunction, CAD, and obstructive sleep apnea. The plan involves monitoring for hct drop, adjusting lovenox dose, active type and screen, f/u with vascular surgeon, bladder distension/hematuria management, renal failure management, holding lasix for low BPs, f/u TTE today, holding ASA 325"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, and complete heart block. He presents to the emergency department for right lower extremity (RLE) wound evaluation after undergoing a right leg three-compartment fasciotomy for compartment syndrome. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has been resolved temporarily while sleeping, and antihypertensives have been held. Close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic parameters is recommended. Further evaluation by a vascular specialist is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

2. RLE Wound: There is no current bleeding from the RLE wound following fasciotomy. However, it is important to follow up with a vascular specialist for further recommendations. Monitoring of the wound and adjusting the dose of lovenox (a blood thinner) based on 10A levels may be necessary.

3. Bladder Distension: The patient has been observed to have bladder distension on CT scan, with a Foley balloon inflated in the urethra. Advancement of the Foley catheter and monitoring of urine output (UOP) are recommended.

4. Hematuria: Currently, there is no hematuria present, but if it"
