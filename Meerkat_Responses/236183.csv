   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who presented with symptoms of pneumonia, sepsis, and hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on invasive ventilation and arterial line monitoring. The patient has a history of minimal past medical history. He has been treated with antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin. The patient's vital signs show fever, hypotension, and lactic acidosis. His respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CMV/ASSIST mode ventilation, set Vt of 550 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 24, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and ABG results indicating respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure and is on invasive ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged intubation time. Regular assessment of respiratory status and implementation of measures to prevent VAP, such as elevating the head of bed (HOB), mouth care, and daily wake-up trials, are necessary.

2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia and sepsis. Despite receiving antibiotics, there is a possibility of developing further infections, including hospital-acquired infections. Monitoring for any signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic management will be crucial.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old male who presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and developed hypoxic respiratory failure, along with pre-syncope in the emergency department. The patient has a history of pneumonia and sepsis. 

The patient was initially admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient's vital signs include a fever of 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit, hypotension, and lactic acidosis. The patient has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management.

The patient's respiratory support consists of invasive ventilation and an endotracheal tube with a low tidal volume strategy. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 140, and a respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory values show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 181 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia. Imaging results reveal bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the central and bronchovascular distributions throughout the lungs.

The patient's condition is described as acute respiratory failure, septic shock, and bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient is also suspected to have aspiration pneumonia due to the presence of GGOs.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a chief complaint of pneumonia and sepsis. He presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and developed hypoxic respiratory failure with pre-syncope in the emergency department. A CT chest showed diffuse ground-glass opacities (GGO) in both lungs. The patient was intubated and started on mechanical ventilation, and an arterial line was placed. He was also started on antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.8°F, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 103/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. He is sedated and on continuous infusions of midazolam and fentanyl. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 181 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 103 mg/dL. The patient's imaging shows bilateral GGO in the central and bronchovascular distribution, apices, and posterior portions of the inferior lung. 

Assessment and plan:
The patient has respiratory failure due to acute pneumonia and septic shock. There is a concern for viral infection, but the gram stain is consistent with Streptococcus pneumoniae or aspiration pneumonia. The patient is responding"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 82-year-old male who presented with nausea, vomiting, and developed hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of pneumonia and sepsis. The patient's condition has been critical, requiring invasive ventilation and arterial line placement. Fever and lactic acidosis were noted, indicating ongoing infection and tissue hypoperfusion.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.8°F (39.3°C), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/56 mmHg to 126/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with FiO2 of 60%.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 181 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 20 mg/dL, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 103 mg/dL. Blood cultures are pending.

Imaging shows bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the central and bronchovascular distributions, most prominent in the apices and posterior segments of the inferior lung.

The patient is diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and bacterial pneumonia. The cause of the respiratory failure is likely community-acquired pneumonia, although viral infection cannot be completely ruled out. The patient is not suspected to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) based on the"

   # Respiratory failure:  intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   LIkely secondary to pneumonia and/or ARDS. Currently on PSV but appears
   to be tiring.
   - sedate and AC ventilate
   - ARDsNET tidal volumes
   - arterial line
   - investigate for infectious source as below
   .
   # Sepsis: Bandemia and leukopenia.  Given CT with multifocal
   infiltrates, most likely an atypical pneumonia. Acuity of process is
   concerning for a bacterial process, however.
   - IVF and levophed as needed with goal UOP >30cc/h, goal CVP 10-12
   - follow lactate (currently increased, will give an additional 1 L NS
   and continue to bolus)
   - UA and cx
   - sputum cx
   - stool cx
   - f/u blood cx
   - urine legionella
   - vanc/zosyn/levaquin
   - legionella urinary antigen
   .
   # Nausea/vomitting:  most likley secondary to systemic process given
   absence of pain and course of symptoms, however, will check abdominal
   labs
   - LFTs, lipase
   .
   # Hct drop: from 35 to 27, likely secondary to fluids
   .
   # hyperlipidemia
   - holding atorvastatin while acutely ill
   .
   # underlying pulmonary process:  saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 206**] as an outpatient. This
   does seem to be a related process given similar distribution.
   - touch base with dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 206**] regarding admission and current
   presentation
   - may need broncoscopic biopsy in the future
   .
   # AAA:  3 cm, newly discovered, seen by vascular in ED

","The patient is an 84-year-old man with sepsis secondary to pneumonia. He is currently intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was previously seen by a pulmonologist for an underlying pulmonary process. The patient's fever, leukopenia, and bandemia suggest a bacterial infection as the cause of his sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not managed appropriately.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bandemia and leukopenia indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to septic shock if not promptly treated.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest a bacterial pneumonia, which may require further investigation and antibiotic therapy.
4. Nausea/vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting could be secondary to the systemic infection or another underlying cause.
5. Hct drop: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 35 to 27, which may be due to fluid administration or another cause.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has elevated lipid levels, which may require monitoring and management during his acute illness.
7. Underlying pulmonary process: The patient's previous visit to the pulmonologist indicates a chronic pulmonary condition that may need further evaluation and management.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. He has a history of pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but appears to be tiring.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/57 to 130/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 4 mmHg, and his fluid balance shows an intake of 4,080 mL with an output of 1,030 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,050 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.4 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose level of 110 mg/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 122 mEq/L, and elevated lactate levels at 1.5 mmol/L. Other lab results, including kidney function tests, liver function tests, and electrolyte levels, are within normal range.

   Assessment and Plan
   84F with little PMH, presents with nausea, diarrhea, pulmonary
   infiltrates, and coag pos staph in sputum. Concern for staph aureus
   pneumonia. Worsening respiratory acidosis noted with pressure support,
   although Aa gradient appears to be improved. He does remain febrile,
   although BP has improved over time.
   For now will switch to assist control and ventilate to higher minute
   ventilation. Will switch from midazolam to propofol to try to prevent
   vent dyssynchrony (previoiusly dyssynch with assist control).
   Will stop levofloxacin and continue other abx.

   Assessment and Plan
   84F with little PMH, presents with nausea, diarrhea, pulmonary
   infiltrates, and coag pos staph in sputum. Concern for staph aureus
   pneumonia. Worsening respiratory acidosis noted with pressure support,
   although Aa gradient appears to be improved. He does remain febrile,
   although BP has improved over time.
   For now will switch to assist control and ventilate to higher minute
   ventilation. Will switch from midazolam to propofol to try to prevent
   vent dyssynchrony (previoiusly dyssynch with assist control).
   Will stop levofloxacin and continue other abx.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 84-year-old female with little past medical history who presents with nausea, diarrhea, pulmonary infiltrates, and coag positive staph in sputum. She has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is currently intubated and on pressure support ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/50 mmHg to 130/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.4 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 135 mg/dL, elevated potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, low bicarbonate level of 20 mEq/L, and an elevated lactate level of 1.5 mmol/L. The blood culture is positive for coagulase positive staphylococcus aureus. 

The patient's imaging shows no new infiltrates on chest X-ray. 

The assessment and plan include concern for staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, worsening respiratory acidosis despite pressure support, and improvement in oxygenation. The plan is to switch to assist control ventilation with higher minute ventilation and change from midazolam to propofol to prevent ventilator dy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is intubated and currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. They are sedated and unresponsive to commands. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Cefepime, and Vancomycin. Their vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, stable blood pressure, and normal heart rate. They have a first-degree AV block. The patient's fluid balance is within normal limits, with adequate intake and output. Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation. The patient's ABG results indicate adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Physical examination reveals diffuse crackles in the chest and no signs of abdominal tenderness or peripheral edema. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels, but slightly elevated glucose and lactate levels. The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines are being managed in the ICU. The patient has a diagnosis of septic shock, respiratory failure, pneumonia, and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's prolonged immobilization due to being intubated and sedated increases the risk of developing VAP and VILI. Additionally, the presence of diffuse crackles in the chest"

   # Respiratory failure:  intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure,
   secondary to pneumonia and/or ARDS. Required increased sedation
   yesterday for dyssynchrony with the ventilator. RSBI 27 this morning,
   more synchronous now. ABG this morning was 7.35/45/100.
   - SBT in a few hours; will try to extubate today
   - treat pneumonia as below
   # Pneumonia: sputum cx grew out coagulase-positive Staphylococcus
   aureus. Blood cx has been negative to date. However, WBC is still
   trending up slowly, and patient continues to have low-grade fevers;
   therefore, will continue empiric GNR coverage as well.
   - continue vancomycin and cefepime
   - f/u final sputum and blood cultures
   .
   # Hct drop: Hct 28.4 today, down from 29.6 yesterday and from 35 on
   admission, likely secondary to fluids. No active sign of bleeding.
   - monitor closely
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia
   - holding atorvastatin while acutely ill

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and respiratory failure due to probable Staphylococcus pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple antibiotics. His condition has been slowly improving, but he still requires aggressive management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying small airways disease and failure to wean off the ventilator suggest a high risk for ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's septic shock has resolved, there is still an ongoing infection with coagulase-positive Staphylococcus in his sputum. Continued antibiotic treatment is necessary.
3. AAA (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm): The patient's abdominal examination is unremarkable, and further information about the AAA is not provided. However, close monitoring and follow-up on extubation are recommended.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin to prevent DVT.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and daily spontaneous breathing trials should be implemented to reduce the risk.
6. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal limits, but close"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis due to Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been sedated. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/56 mmHg to 152/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has a first-degree AV block and right-sided lower extremity edema. 

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function with elevated creatinine levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for low potassium. The blood culture shows coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to probable Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. The underlying small airways disease seen on the prior CT scan may contribute to this failure. The patient's attempts to breathe spontaneously with pressure support ventilation (PSV) have resulted in desaturation and increased peak inspiratory pressure, indicating a need for further evaluation and consideration of using a 7L positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during weaning.

","The patient is an 84-year-old man who presents with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and/or ARDS, septic shock, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/62 to 171/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.3 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen of 22 mg/dL, and normal creatinine levels. Electrolyte imbalances include hyponatremia (Na+: 142 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (K+: 5.3 mEq/L), and hypophosphatemia (PO4: 2.6 mg/dL).

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, for the suspected Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. Fluid resuscitation has been provided, but the patient remains hypotensive. 

There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case. Firstly, the patient's respiratory failure may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pneumonia and sepsis, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been receiving IV antibiotics and diuretics for fluid management. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/62 to 171/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's temperature is within normal range, but there is evidence of fatigue and increased work of breathing. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and normal kidney function. The patient's nutritional status is a concern, as indicated by altered nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's acute respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
2. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and sepsis, indicating an increased risk of further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection.
3. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored due to the use of diuretics. There is a risk of fluid overload or hypovolemia, which can affect cardiac output and renal function.
4. Cardiovascular Complications:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, pneumonia, and sepsis. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission. Over the past 24 hours, the patient was transitioned from SIMV/ASSIST to PSV 5/5, but appeared more uncomfortable and fatigued, leading to being placed back on assist control mode for the night.

The patient received IV Lasix and had an increased urine output but still had persistent secretions. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and respiratory rate, but oxygen saturation remains good. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, with a current temperature of 37.6°C and a maximum temperature of 38.2°C.

The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a CVP of 4 mmHg. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,288 mL and an output of 3,210 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,922 mL.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 38, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 194.

Radiology images are attached, but not viewable in this format."

","The patient is an 84-year-old man who presents with Staph pneumonia. He was initially intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia. However, his condition has been improving today, but he is not tolerating a spontaneous breathing trial. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is initially caused by MRSA pneumonia. Since he is still experiencing worsening secretions, fevers, and intolerance to spontaneous breathing trials, there is a risk of continued respiratory distress or failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient's clinical presentation suggests sepsis, as indicated by his fevers, worsening condition, and signs of systemic infection. The presence of pneumonia increases the risk of sepsis, and the patient's vital signs, including tachycardia and tachypnea, are consistent with this diagnosis.

3. Organ dysfunction: Although the patient is currently classified as sepsis without organ dysfunction, there is a risk that his condition could progress to septic shock or involve other organ systems, leading to organ dysfunction.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has bacterial community-acquired pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus species. There is a risk of worsening or complications related to the pneumonia, such as abscess formation, empyema, or dissemination of infection.

5. AAA (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm): The patient has a 3"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male admitted with septic shock and respiratory failure due to probable Staphylococcus aureus infection. The patient tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) for 8 hours yesterday but exhibited hemodynamic instability (hypertension and tachycardia) with spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today with a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 49.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory rate (RR) set at 20 breaths per minute. The patient's blood pressure is currently 110/50 mmHg, heart rate (HR) is 95 beats per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 99%, and temperature (Tmax) is 38.7°C.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 153 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 29.6%, platelet count (Plt) of 139 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 26 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.8 mg/dL, and sodium (Na+) level of 142 mEq/L. The patient's microbiology tests indicate the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the sputum culture.

The patient's imaging shows persistent bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR), which may be less dense compared to the previous day. The assessment and plan include continued treatment for pneumonia, respiratory failure, septic shock, and other conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying small airways disease, along with the Staphylococcus aureus infection and persistent bilateral infiltrates on CXR, may lead to worsening respiratory function.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of DVT.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness and septic shock can predispose him to stress ulcers.
5. Delirium: The patient's age, sepsis, and sedation can contribute to the development of delirium.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate potential renal impairment.
7. Cardiovascular complications: Septic shock and hypertension may increase the risk of cardiac events.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, renal function, and overall clinical progress to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Staph pna.
   1. Resp failure- likely due to Staph pna. Some underlying small airways
   disease on prior CT scan. Today w/ incr secretions, still w/ TBB +5L,
   also w/ agitation
   -cont diuresis for goal CVP 3-5, TBB another neg 1-2L
   -cont txing pna as below; given fever as below monitor for
   recrudescence
   -assess MS on minimal sedation
   -touch base w/ family about reintubation
   2. Septic shock- shock now resolved
   3. Fevers- monitor for ICU-related fever, no indication to broaden yet
   but will follow repeat pan-culture
   -check LFTs, lipase

   An 84 year-old man presents with Staph pneumonia.  Improving today, but
   not tolerating a spontaneous breathing trial.
   # Respiratory failure from PNA:  Initially intubated for hypoxic
   respiratory failure, secondary to MRSA pneumonia. Significantly
   diuresed yesterday but failed SBT today.  Worsening secretions,
   febrile, perhaps the PNA is not just MRSA.
   - Continue Vancomycin
   - Diuresis today goal 1-2L negative
   - Continue PSV
   - Blood/Urine/Sputum resent today with continue fevers
   - Check Amylase/Lipase LFTs
   # Hct drop: Likely fluid hydration as it has improved with diuresis.
   - Daily Hcts
   # Hyperlipidemia
   - holding atorvastatin while acutely ill
   # AAA:  3 cm, newly discovered, seen by vascular in ED
   - per vascular, will need repeat US in 6 months
   FEN: continue TF, replete lytes prn
   PPX: PPI per home regimen, SC heparin
   CODE STATUS:  DNR/DNI, but OK to continue current ventilation for now,
   will re-address re-intubation

","The patient is an 84-year-old man with a history of Staph pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU and is responding well to furosemide 40 mg IV x 1 in the morning. The patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) in the morning, but switched back to assist control (AC) overnight to rest. Fentanyl was added as the patient looked uncomfortable with pain.

The patient has had a fever of 101.7°F since 8:36 AM and has been on antibiotics, including cefepime and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/59 mmHg to 160/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and sedated, and does not open his eyes to voice or follow commands.

Physical examination shows diffuse crackles in the chest, no jugular venous distention, and no peripheral edema. Neurological examination reveals pupils reactive to light and follows commands.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.9 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin at 10.0 g/dL, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 23 mg/dL, and normal creatinine at 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's potassium is slightly low at"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. They have been responding well to furosemide 40 mg IV and have been on pressure support ventilation (PSV) in the morning, but switched back to assist-control (AC) ventilation at night. The patient's temperature is 101.7°F and their heart rate is 103 bpm. Blood cultures were taken at 08:36 AM. They have been receiving various medications including cefepime, vancomycin, fentanyl, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs show a low respiratory rate (RR) of 35 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation level of 95%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated temperature, increased heart rate, and low blood pressure suggest the possibility of sepsis, especially considering their recent infection and antibiotic treatment.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with assist-control mode, indicating respiratory failure or severe respiratory distress.
3. Pneumonia: Given the presence of diffuse crackles in the chest, along with the patient's fever and low oxygen saturation, there is a possibility of pneumonia.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) suggest potential kidney dysfunction.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old man with a chief complaint of respiratory failure from pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.7°F, blood pressure ranging from 135/59-160/74 mmHg, heart rate of 103 bpm, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's medical history includes a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 3 cm. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, normal kidney function, and altered liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, but there is a slight decrease in albumin levels.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin, diuresis with a goal of 1-2 liters negative, pressure support ventilation (PSV), and sending blood, urine, and sputum for culture. The patient's Hct has improved with diuresis, so daily Hcts will be performed. The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old man with a chief complaint of respiratory failure from Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. He was initially intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and has been receiving treatment with vancomycin. The patient has been diuresed and is currently on positive pressure ventilation (PSV). He remains febrile and is experiencing worsening secretions, indicating a possible non-MRSA infection. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies.

24-hour events include the administration of antibiotics (cefipime and vancomycin), as well as various medications such as propofol, fentanyl, lansoprazole, and furosemide. The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.7°F, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/59 to 160/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and sedated.

Physical examination reveals diffuse crackles in the chest and no other significant findings. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has several diagnoses including fever, alteration in nutrition, septic shock, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The primary issue"

   Patient seen and examined with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5199**], and house staff team.
   I have reviewed his note and agree with assessment and plan.  Would
   add/emphasize.
   84 yo man with MRSA  PNA, septic shock, respiratory failure.  Has been
   febrile, and failed SBT.
   Exam notable for mild rhoncherous BS b/l.  crackles audible
   anteriorly.  Patient sedated unresponsive.
   A/P
   Respiratory failure:  MRSA PNA.  Slowly improving.  Not unexpected that
   he is still febrile and recovering slowly.  However he is close to
   extubation.
   Fevers:  check urine cx and re-add GNR coverage as urine looks
   infected.
   Agitation:  added zyprexa in effort to remove propofol drip.

","The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted with septic shock and respiratory failure due to probable Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. He is currently sedated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/67 mmHg to 160/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient has been receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy with cefepime and vancomycin. His laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 197 K/uL and elevated lactate levels at 1.2 mmol/L. The patient's blood glucose levels have been well controlled. 

Imaging reveals improvement in the interstitial pattern and left pleural effusion on chest X-ray. The patient's sputum culture on April 13th showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), while the blood cultures on April 16th and 17th are pending. 

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, and weaning from mechanical ventilation has been limited by secretions and hemodynamic instability. The plan includes continued diuresis to achieve a central venous pressure (CVP) of 3-5 mmHg and goal fluid balance of -1 to -2"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted with septic shock and respiratory failure due to probable Staphylococcus aureus infection. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management. The patient's vital signs show fever, increased heart rate, and respiratory rate. Blood cultures have been taken and the patient is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. Imaging shows improvement in interstitial pattern and left effusion on chest X-ray. The patient is expected to remain in the ICU for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to underlying small airways disease and Staphylococcus aureus infection.
2. Agitation and delirium due to sedation hold.
3. Fevers, possibly due to ICU-related causes or recurrence of infection.
4. Potential development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.
6. Possible complications related to long-term sedation and mechanical ventilation."

   An 84 year-old man presents with Staph pneumonia.  Improving today, but
   not tolerating a spontaneous breathing trial.
   # Respiratory failure from Staph PNA:  Initially intubated for hypoxic
   respiratory failure, secondary to MRSA pneumonia. Has been diuresed
   well. However, has been very tachypneic in the 30s-40s on both AC and
   pressure support. Unlikely due to benzo withdrawal given that patient
   has been on propofol infusion. ?CNS etiology. ?pulmonary source: known
   pna vs. ?PE.
   - Continue abx as below
   - continue diuresis with furosemide 40mg IV x1
   - try standing quetiapine
   - LENIS
   # Pna: Cefepime was added back yesterday due to persistent fevers and
   respiratory instability.
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime
   # Persistent fevers: ?pna, ?abscess, ?PE.  Unclear etiology.
   - LENIS
   - consider CT scan if still spikes
   # Recent Hct drop: Stable now.
   - Daily Hcts
   # Hyperlipidemia
   - holding atorvastatin while acutely ill
   # AAA:  3 cm, newly discovered, seen by vascular in ED
   - per vascular, will need repeat US in 6 months
   FEN: continue TF, replete lytes prn
   PPX: PPI per home regimen, SC heparin
   CODE STATUS:  DNR/DNI, but OK to continue current ventilation for now,
   will continue to update family daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old man presenting with Staph pneumonia. The patient has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to MRSA pneumonia and is currently in the ICU. The patient's main issues include fever, worsening ventilation, and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/52 to 145/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's CVP is within normal range, and fluid balance shows an input of 3,420 mL and output of 2,880 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator in CMV/AutoFlow mode with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 11 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 43 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 225.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, platelet count of 197 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 156 mg/dL, and sodium of 143 mEq/L. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's medical conditions include fever (hypothermia), alteration in nutrition, shock (septic), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient also has pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which initially led to intubation.

The plan includes continuing vancomycin, diuresis with Lasix, trial pressure support ventilation (PSV), and further evaluation of the fever workup. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, but it is okay to continue current ventilation for now."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock and respiratory failure due to probable Staphylococcus aureus infection. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. He has been febrile overnight and experienced a transient hypotensive episode, which spontaneously resolved. The patient is currently on cefepime and vancomycin. His vital signs show a fever, tachycardia, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and low oxygen saturation. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.50, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 225. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally, but with crackles in the left base. The patient has right lower extremity edema but no other significant findings. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), lactate, and C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as decreased platelet count (Plt) and albumin. Imaging shows no significant changes on chest X-ray, and microbiology indicates MRSA in the sput"

   84yo male admitted w/ septic shock and resp failure due to probable
   Staph pna.
   1. Resp failure- likely due to Staph pna. Some underlying small airways
   disease on prior CT scan. Weaning has been limited by secretions and
   tachypnea/ hemodynamic instability on sedation hold.
   -treat agitation and assoc tachypnea as below
   -cont diuresis for goal CVP 3-5, TBB another neg 1-2L
   -cont txing pna as below; given fever as below monitor for
   recrudescence
   -touch base w/ family about reintubation --> fam mtg tomorrow
   2. [**Name (NI) 13749**] unclear if an agitated delirium
   -add Seroquel to regimen
   -use fentanyl for pain
   3. Fevers- monitor for ICU-related fever. MRSA in sputum
   -will recheck vanco level and possibly up-dose today
   -consider CT torso
   -LENIs for asymmetric LE edema
   4. AAA- f/u on extubation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted with septic shock and respiratory failure due to probable Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. He is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient's vital signs show fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and increased respiratory rate. He is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a code status of do not resuscitate (DNR).

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 9.0 K/uL and elevated lactate levels at 1.2 mmol/L. His blood culture is positive for MRSA, and his sputum culture also shows MRSA with a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of less than 0.5.

The patient's respiratory status is being managed with minimal ventilatory support, but he is not yet ready for extubation. The plan includes treating agitation and associated tachypnea, continuing diuresis for a goal central venous pressure (CVP) of 3-5 mmHg, and treating the pneumonia with vancomycin and cefepime. The patient's fever is being monitored, and there is a concern for possible Clostridium difficile infection, so flagyl has been added to the antibiotic regimen. An abdominal CT scan is planned to rule out intrabdominal pathology.

The patient's nutritional status is being addressed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old male with Staphylococcus pneumonia.
- He has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to MRSA pneumonia.
- The patient has been tachypneic in the 30s-40s on both AC and pressure support.
- There are concerns about the cause of the tachypnea, including potential CNS etiology or pulmonary source such as known pneumonia or possible pulmonary embolism.
- The patient has persistent fevers, and the etiology is unclear.
- The patient's Hct has dropped, but it is now stable.
- The patient has hyperlipidemia and is currently not taking atorvastatin.
- A 3 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was discovered, which will need a repeat ultrasound in 6 months.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, but it is acceptable to continue current ventilation for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure from Staph PNA: The patient initially required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia. Despite improving, he continues to be tachypneic, which may indicate ongoing respiratory distress or failure.
2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has persistent fevers, indicating ongoing infection. Given his respiratory instability and known pneumonia, there is a concern for sepsis.
3. Pneumonia, bacterial"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man who presented with Staphylococcus pneumonia and persistent respiratory failure. He was initially intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia. Despite therapeutic vancomycin levels and diuresis, the patient's condition has worsened, with CT scans showing worsening infiltrates. The patient remains tachypneic in the 30s-40s on both assisted control (AC) and pressure support ventilation (PSV). There is evidence of central involvement, possibly pain and agitated delirium. No deep vein thrombosis (DVT) to suggest pulmonary embolism (PE). 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure from Staphylococcus pneumonia: The patient initially required intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure caused by MRSA pneumonia. Despite treatment, his respiratory condition has not improved, with worsening infiltrates on CT scans.
2. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient is experiencing sepsis with organ dysfunction, as indicated by his unstable vital signs and the presence of pneumonia.
3. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient has bacterial pneumonia acquired in the community. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the infection.
4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has elevated triglyceride levels, which need to be managed.
5. AAA (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm): The patient has a"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man who presents with Staph pneumonia and persistent respiratory failure. He was initially intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to MRSA pneumonia. Despite being diuresed well, his CT scan yesterday showed worsening infiltrates. He has been very tachypneic in the 30s-40s on both AC and pressure support, with a central component. Pain and agitated delirium are likely at play. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for pneumonia, including cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin. His fever persists despite the antibiotics. He also has a recent Hct drop and hyperlipidemia. The patient has a 3 cm AAA, which was discovered recently and will need repeat US in 6 months. His code status is DNR/DNI, but he is currently on ventilation and the family will be updated daily. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure is a significant concern. Despite being intubated and receiving respiratory support, his condition has not improved, as indicated by worsening infiltrates on the CT scan.
2. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and respiratory instability suggest the possibility of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection becomes dysregulated.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia caused by Staphylo"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old man with respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia. He has persistent fevers, failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning, and is tachypneic despite increased levels of support. The patient was briefly on levophed yesterday, but it has now been weaned down.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/49 to 160/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 27 mmHg, and he has received a total of 5,842 mL of fluids since admission, with 1,694 mL being given through the peripheral line, 3,738 mL through the IV fluids, and 1,111 mL lost as urine output.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 451 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 100. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH of 7.52, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 228, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 37.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal cardiovascular examination, right and left radial pulses not assessed, right and left digital pulses not assessed, respiratory examination showing rhonchorous breath sounds, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and edema in both lower extremities. The patient's neurologic examination is also not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 27.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 188 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 38 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.0 mg/dL, glucose of 208 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 142 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 107 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) of 7.4 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.0 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO43-) of 2.2 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes fever, alteration in nutrition, shock (septic), respiratory failure (acute), pneumonia (bacterial, community-acquired), and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The plan involves adding additional antibiotics, managing pain with fentanyl, and continuing ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, atelectasis, delirium, nosocomial infections, and multiorgan dysfunction."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with a history of Staph pneumonia and persistent respiratory failure. He has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to MRSA pneumonia. Despite therapeutic vancomycin levels and diuresis, the patient's condition has not improved. CT scans have shown worsening infiltrates. The patient remains tachypneic in the 30s-40s on both AC and pressure support. There seems to be a central component, and pain and agitated delirium are likely contributing factors. No DVT is present to suggest PE. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, to cover for MRSA and pseudomonas. The patient's recent Hct drop has stabilized, and his AAA needs to be monitored with repeat US in 6 months. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, but it is acceptable to continue current ventilation for now. Daily updates to the family will be provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function and difficulty in weaning off the ventilator.
2. Sepsis: The patient's underlying infection (MRSA pneumonia) and the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics indicate a risk of sepsis. This can lead to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and potentially death.
3. Pneumonia: The"

   # Respiratory failure from Staph PNA:  Initially intubated for hypoxic
   respiratory failure, secondary to MRSA pneumonia. Has been diuresed
   well.  CT yesterday showed worsening infiltrates despite therapeutic
   vanc levels and diuresis. He has remained very tachypneic in the
   30s-40s on both AC and pressure support.  There seems to be a central
   component.  Pain and agitated delirium are likely at play.   No DVT to
   suggest PE.
   - Continue abx as below
   - start fentanyl gtt; titrate to comfort
   - continue standing quetiapine
   - re-address goals of ventilator management with family later today
   (previously indicated desire for no long-term ventilatory support)
   # Pna: currently on broad spectrum antibiotics, which were broadened
   further yesterday to double cover pseudomonas
   - continue vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin
   # Recent Hct drop: Stable now.
   - Daily Hcts
   # Hyperlipidemia
   - holding atorvastatin while acutely ill
   # AAA:  3 cm, newly discovered, seen by vascular in ED

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old man with a history of Staphylococcus pneumonia and persistent respiratory failure. He was initially intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to MRSA pneumonia. The patient has been diuresed well, but his condition has not improved despite therapeutic vancomycin levels and diuresis. He remains tachypneic in the 30s-40s on both AC and pressure support, indicating ongoing respiratory distress.

The patient's medical history includes several comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. His recent laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.2 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 156 to 208 mg/dL, and slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 27.3% to 28.1%.

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for MRSA and pseudomonas infections. His antibiotics include vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. The plan is to continue these antibiotics while monitoring the patient's response.

The patient has also been started on fentanyl patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) to manage pain and agitation, as well as quetiapine to address delirium. The family has previously indicated their desire for no long-term ventilatory support, and a discussion about the goals of ventil"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, MRSA pneumonia, and persistent fevers. He failed a spontaneous breathing trial this morning and is tachypneic despite an increased level of support. The patient was intubated yesterday and briefly required levophed, which has since been weaned down.

24-hour events include a fever of 101.7°F at 4:00 AM. The patient has no known drug allergies. He received multiple doses of antibiotics, including cefepime, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

The patient is receiving fentanyl for pain management and lansoprazole for acid suppression. He is also on heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications include unspecified ICU medications.

The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged except for the noted information above.

Flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results. The patient's temperature is elevated, with a current temperature of 38.7°C (101.7°F). His heart rate is within normal range, but his blood pressure is on the lower side. Respiratory rate is increased, and oxygen saturation remains stable at 97%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 657 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of "

His vital signs include a temperature of 101.7°F, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 112/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted information. His flow sheet data shows a fluid balance since 55 AM, with a total intake of 4,336 mL and a total output of 1,600 mL. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and low albumin levels. His arterial blood gas values indicate a normal pH, PaCO2, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, pain control medication, and prophylactic treatments. The assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia, persistent fevers, and the need for long-term recovery. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with respiratory failure and MRSA pneumonia. He has persistent fevers and failed a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) on [**4-20**]. The family meeting decided to extubate today and not reintubate. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 40%, and PS 18 cmH2O. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.7°F, blood pressure ranging from 112/48 to 160/70 mmHg, heart rate between 76 and 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's physical examination reveals intubation, sedation, but awakening and answering yes/no questions, as well as alertness and answering questions. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. The patient's plan is to continue with the current level of support through the weekend with a plan to attempt extubation in the next 48 hours. Additional antibiotics have been added due to persistent fevers, and the source of infection remains unclear. Pain control is managed with a fentanyl drip, and the patient is receiving tube feeds and prophylactic treatments for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is DNR, and he is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration or failure to wean off mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: Despite receiving antibiotics, the patient's persistent fevers indicate an ongoing infection, which may be due to MRSA pneumonia or another source. Identifying and treating the infection promptly is crucial to prevent worsening of the patient's condition.
3. Delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium can complicate the weaning process and increase the risk of complications such as falls or pressure ulcers.
4. Organ dysfunction: The elevated lactate level suggests potential organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys, as indicated by the increased creatinine level. Monitoring renal function closely is important to detect any further deterioration.
5. Pressure injuries: Prolonged immobility due to intubation can increase the risk of developing pressure injuries, especially in vulnerable areas like the sacrum and heels.
6. Bloodstream infection: The presence of an arterial line and multi-lumen catheter increases the risk of bloodstream infections, which can be life-threatening if not managed appropriately.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The use of prophylactic heparin reduces the risk of DVT, but there is still a possibility of developing a clot, especially in critically ill patients.

It is important for the healthcare team to closely monitor the patient's condition, collaborate with relevant specialists"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with a history of Staph pneumonia and persistent respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to MRSA pneumonia. Despite therapeutic levels of vancomycin and diuresis, the patient's condition has worsened with worsening infiltrates on CT scan and persistent tachypnea. There appears to be a central component to his respiratory failure, possibly due to pain and agitated delirium. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for MRSA and potential pseudomonas infection. His recent Hct has dropped but is now stable. The patient has hyperlipidemia and a newly discovered AAA that will require repeat US in 6 months. His code status is DNR/DNI, but it is okay to continue current ventilation for now. The patient's contact information and ICU consent have been provided.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to MRSA pneumonia, which has not improved despite therapeutic levels of vancomycin and diuresis. There seems to be a central component contributing to his respiratory failure, possibly due to pain and agitated delirium. Continuing with broad-spectrum antibiotics is recommended.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to his bacterial infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and early recognition of any signs"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has experienced several medical complications, including fever, alteration in nutrition, shock, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and pneumonia. The patient is receiving various medications, including fentanyl for pain management, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, lorazepam for sedation, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 137/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose levels, and lactic acid levels. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and clinical presentation suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and organ dysfunction is necessary.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's low respiratory rate and increased tidal volume indicate respiratory failure. Continuous oxygen supplementation and close monitoring of oxygen saturation are essential.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest bacterial pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy should be tailored based on culture and sensitivity results.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's alteration in nutrition may require nutritional support. Ent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with a history of Staphylococcus pneumonia and persistent respiratory failure. He has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to MRSA pneumonia. Despite therapeutic vancomycin levels and diuresis, his condition has not improved. He remains tachypneic in the 30s-40s on both AC and pressure support. The patient is now awake but anxious, showing signs of improvement from yesterday. The family prefers to continue the current management plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates a risk of continued hypoxia and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, altered nutrition, and signs of shock suggest ongoing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potential mortality if not promptly treated.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has bacterial community-acquired pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus. This infection may require long-term antibiotic therapy, and there is a risk of antibiotic resistance development.
4. Delirium/Anxiety: The patient's recent improvement in alertness but persistent anxiety indicates a risk of delirium. Proper sedation management and psychological support should be provided.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications during critical illness.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old man with respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia, persistent fevers, and agitation. The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) on [**4-20**] but has been off pressors for the past two days. The family had been prepared to make him comfort measures only (CMO), but he is now improving, so he remains intubated and is showing improvement in respiratory and mental status.

The patient experienced some anxiety overnight, which was treated effectively with ativan. His allergies include no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics given were metronidazole on [**2153-4-22**] at 12:00 AM, cefepime at 04:00 AM, ciprofloxacin at 04:00 AM, and vancomycin at 04:00 AM.

The patient is currently on various infusions, including fentanyl (concentrate) at 50 mcg/hour, propofol, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) at [**2153-4-22**] 12:00 AM. Other ICU medications include lorazepam (ativan) at [**2153-4-22**] 12:00 AM, chlorhexidine, lansoprazole, and seroquel 25mg TID.

","The patient is an 84-year-old man with respiratory failure and MRSA pneumonia. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/56 to 138/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is sedated but arousable and able to answer questions. Physical examination findings include clear lung sounds bilaterally, 1+ edema in both lower extremities, and no rash. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.2 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level at 9.0 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's temperature has been fluctuating but is currently within normal range.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Proper adherence to ventilator care bundles, such as maintaining a semi-upright head-of-bed position, using appropriate sedation and analgesia, and performing regular oral hygiene, can help reduce the risk of VAP.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old man with respiratory failure and MRSA pneumonia. He failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) on [**4-20**] and is currently off pressors for the past 1-2 days. The decision has been made to extubate the patient today and not reintubate. 

The patient's arterial line stopped at 11:14 AM on [**4-21**]. He received various antibiotics, including metronidazole, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin, with the last doses administered on [**4-22**].

The patient is receiving fentanyl for pain management, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and lorazepam (Ativan) for sedation. Other medications include prophylactic antibiotics and fluids.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/56 mmHg to 138/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His weight is currently 82.7 kg, and his height is 69 inches. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 4 mmHg.

The patient has received a total of 2,833 mL of fluids since [**55**] AM, with an intake of 625 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), 565 mL through tube feedings, and 1,813 mL through intravenous fluids. He has had a total output of 1,850 mL, including 490 mL of urine output.

The patient is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tidal volume (Vt) of 535 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 68, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) result of 7.46/38/95.[**Numeric Identifier 218**]/27/2.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, white blood cell count of 11.2 K/uL, platelet count of 264 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 27 mEq/L, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose level of 155 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal ranges.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-associated events such as ventilator-associated conditions (VAC), infection-related ventilator-associated complications (IVAC), and possibly delirium or pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and MRSA pneumonia. He has been improving slowly, showing better respiratory and mental status. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. He is also sedated but arousable and able to answer questions. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/56 mmHg to 138/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has mild bilateral lower extremity edema and no rash. Laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, electrolytes, and liver function tests. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 238, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 27 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Proper adherence to ventilator care bundles, including maintaining a semi-upright position and regular aspiration of subglottic secretions, should be continued.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism"

","The patient is an 84-year-old man with respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia, persistent fevers, and agitated delirium. He remains intubated but is showing signs of improvement. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is still intubated, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as maintaining proper oral hygiene, elevating the head of bed, and regularly assessing and changing the ventilator circuit can help reduce the risk.
2. Delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium may increase the risk of complications such as falls, pressure ulcers, and medication errors. Frequent reorientation, providing a calm environment, and using low-dose sedatives may be helpful in managing delirium.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility associated with ICU admission can increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic heparin is being administered to reduce this risk.
4. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at higher risk of developing stress ulcers. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are being used to reduce the risk.
5. Infection: Despite the improvement, the patient still has persistent fevers, indicating a potential ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been added, and further investigations are needed to identify and treat any underlying infection."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 69-88 bpm, blood pressure between 137/56 mmHg and 138/68 mmHg, respiratory rate between 21-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.8°C (100°F). The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, heparin sodium, lorazepam, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and the use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a positive balance of 983 mL, indicating potential fluid overload.
5. Hypotension:"

   Although terminal extubation had been considered, given recent
   apparently improvement family would like to continue current management
   .
   - Continue abx as below
   - stop fentanyl gtt; start boluses
   - Ativan boluses PRN to improve RR and anxiety, plan to decrease PEEP
   as tolerated
   - continue standing quetiapine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a chief complaint of persistent tachypnea. He was initially intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to MRSA pneumonia. Despite therapeutic vancomycin levels and diuresis, the patient's condition has not improved, with worsening infiltrates on CT. The patient remains very tachypneic and is now more awake, with improved RR and anxiety. Family prefers to continue current management. Antibiotics have been broadened to double cover pseudomonas. Recent Hct drop is stable. Hyperlipidemia and AAA are also noted, with plans for repeat US in 6 months. Code status is DNR/DNI, but it is okay to continue current ventilation for now. Daily updates to family will be provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent tachypnea and worsening infiltrates on CT indicate ongoing respiratory failure. This may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachypnea, and hypotension suggest ongoing sepsis. Without appropriate management, this can progress to septic shock and organ dysfunction.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired bacterial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). If not adequately treated, the infection may worsen, leading to complications such as abscess formation or pleural effusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis, respiratory failure, pneumonia, and shock. The patient's vital signs show tachypnea, with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. Blood pressure is stable at 128/55 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is at 97% on CPAP/PSV ventilator support. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.7 degrees Celsius. The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics and morphine for pain management. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,383 mL and output of 3,515 mL, indicating a negative balance of 132 mL. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased lactate levels. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of sputum cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary to prevent and treat this condition.
2. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay also increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections such as central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old man with Staph pneumonia and persistent respiratory failure.
- He was initially intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia.
- Despite therapeutic vancomycin levels and diuresis, the patient's condition has not improved.
- The patient remains tachypneic but showed slight improvement in alertness yesterday.
- Family prefers to continue current management rather than terminal extubation.
- The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.
- Recent Hct drop has stabilized.
- The patient has hyperlipidemia and a small abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).
- Code status is DNR/DNI, but it is okay to continue current ventilation for now.
- Daily updates will be provided to the family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates a high risk of continued difficulty in breathing and potential worsening of his condition if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: Given the presence of bacterial pneumonia and systemic signs of infection, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Pneumonia Complications: As the patient has community-acquired pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, there is a risk of developing complications such as lung abscesses, pleural eff"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old man who presents with Staph pneumonia and persistent respiratory failure. The patient was initially intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia and has been diuresed well. Despite therapeutic vancomycin levels and diuresis, the patient's condition has not improved, and there are worsening infiltrates on CT. 

The patient remains very tachypneic in the 30s-40s on both AC and pressure support. However, there has been an apparent improvement in the patient's condition, as he is now more awake. The family prefers to continue with the current management plan.

The plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential pseudomonas infection, maintaining the current ventilator settings, and monitoring the patient's response. The patient's recent Hct drop is stable, and daily Hcts will be performed. The hyperlipidemia medication will be held while the patient is acutely ill.

Additionally, the patient has a newly discovered 3 cm AAA, which needs to be monitored with repeat US in 6 months. The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis will continue as before.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates a risk of continued hypoxia and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure:  day 11 of ventilation.  Seems like he is close to
   extubation, generating good Vt, but tachypneic.  Likely a combination
   of high dead space and also anxiety/agitation.
   Place on scheduled morphine bolus.
   Agitation:  increased seroquel, continue ativan as he is chronic ativan
   user.
   fluid overload:  continue to diurese as he is very net positive.
   antibiotics:  can d/c C. diff treatment one he is negative for C.diff.
   can stop cipro as no Pseudomonal was cultured.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man who is critically ill and currently in the ICU. He has severe pneumonia and has been on mechanical ventilation for 11 days. He is showing signs of agitation and anxiety, with intermittent tachypnea. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/53 to 140/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (cefipime, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole), furosemide, lorazepam, heparin, and propofol. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, elevated potassium and magnesium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has edema in both lower extremities and is experiencing fluid overload. His nutritional status is not mentioned, and he has a history of chronic ativan use. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, indicating that he does not wish to be resuscitated or placed on life support. The patient's overall condition remains unchanged, with ongoing respiratory failure and agitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for 11 days, increasing the risk of developing VAP. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of Staphylococcus pneumonia and persistent respiratory failure. He is currently stable with controlled vital signs and no signs of septic shock. The patient has expressed a desire to avoid reintubation if possible. Treatment plans include continuing IV morphine for pain management, anxiolytic medication, vancomycin and cefepime antibiotics for another day, and monitoring fluid balance. Other medical issues include constipation, hyperlipidemia, and an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that requires regular monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration, requiring reintubation or the use of non-invasive ventilation.
2. Sepsis: Despite initial improvement, there is a risk of developing sepsis due to ongoing infection or inadequate antibiotic coverage.
3. Pneumonia Complications: The Staphylococcus pneumonia may lead to complications such as lung abscess, pleural effusion, or empyema.
4. Constipation: The patient's constipation could progress to impaction, which may require more aggressive interventions like enemas or rectal stimulation.
5. Hyperlipidemia: Untreated hyperlipidemia increases the risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
6. AAA: The presence of an AAA indicates a potential risk of rupture, especially if"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with a history of Staphylococcus pneumonia and persistent respiratory failure. He continues to be tachypneic, with high minute ventilation but normal PCO2, indicating large dead space ventilation. The patient appears uncomfortable at times, and pain control with IV morphine and anxiolytic medication has been initiated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates a potential complication. It is essential to continue monitoring his oxygenation and ventilation status closely.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has bacterial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus species. Proper antibiotic therapy should be continued to treat the infection effectively and prevent any complications related to the pneumonia.

4. Diuretic use: The patient is receiving diuretics to manage fluid balance. Close monitoring of fluid status and electrolyte levels is crucial to avoid complications such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.

5. Constipation: The patient has been prescribed a bowel regimen to prevent constipation. Regular monitoring of bowel movements is essential to ensure proper management.

6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, but statin therapy has been held due to his acute illness"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male who presents with Staphylococcus pneumonia and persistent respiratory failure. He is currently being treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. The patient has been febrile but has now become afebrile. He is experiencing discomfort and is receiving pain and anxiety medication. His respiratory failure continues, with tachypnea and high minute ventilation but normal PCO2, indicating large dead space ventilation. Other medical issues include shock, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and potential nutrition alteration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other complications such as pneumonia or sepsis.

2. Sepsis: The presence of sepsis increases the risk of organ dysfunction and potential development of septic shock, which can be life-threatening.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's bacterial pneumonia may worsen or spread to other areas of the lungs, leading to complications such as lung abscesses or pleural effusion.

4. Shock: The patient's current state of shock increases the risk of inadequate tissue perfusion and organ hypoxia, potentially leading to organ dysfunction and failure.

5. Nutrition Alteration: The patient's alteration in nutrition may lead to malnutrition and weakened immune system, increasing the risk of further"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock and respiratory failure due to a probable Staphylococcus aureus infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 131/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 320 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 19 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 33 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 97%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying small airways disease and tachypnea may limit extubation success. Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters and oxygenation is necessary.
2. Staphylococcus aureus Infection: The patient's septic shock and respiratory failure are likely due to a probable Staphylococcus aureus infection. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and infection markers is necessary. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued and adjusted based on culture and sensitivity"

   Assessment and Plan
   84yo male admitted w/ septic shock and resp failure due to probable
   Staph pna.
   1. Resp failure- likely due to Staph pna. Some underlying small airways
   disease on prior CT scan. Extubation had been limited by tachpnea which
   is likely due to anxiety and pain
   -treat agitation w/ sched Ativan and MSO4
   -cont vanco + cefepime today; plan to dc tomorrow if no change/ cx data
   -cont gentle diuresis, goal TBB even to slight neg
   2. AAA- f/u on extubation
   3. Goals of care- may need to reverse code status based on patient's
   wishes; readdress based on pt's wishes to be clarified post-extubation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male admitted with septic shock and respiratory failure due to probable Staphylococcus aureus infection. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and is currently on mechanical ventilation support. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised due to the underlying infection and small airways disease. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory status if not adequately managed.

2. Infection: Although the patient has been receiving antibiotics, there is still a risk of ongoing or new infections due to his weakened immune system and prolonged hospital stay.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which can worsen his respiratory status and increase the duration of mechanical ventilation.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and hospitalization can increase the risk of developing DVT, which may lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.

5. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating the possibility of dehydration. This can affect his overall organ perfusion and function.

6. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's serum creatinine levels are within normal range, but there is a slight decrease in urine output. Monitoring for any signs of acute kidney injury or worsening renal function is important.
