","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, currently admitted for alcohol detoxification. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, possible alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and signs of liver dysfunction. The patient has been started on benzodiazepines for withdrawal management and is being monitored with CIWA assessments. Further investigations are planned to evaluate the cause of his atrial fibrillation, assess the extent of liver damage, and rule out other potential causes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal, which can include agitation, tremors, seizures, and delirium tremens. Close monitoring and administration of benzodiazepines are necessary to prevent progression to more severe withdrawal symptoms.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation likely contributed by alcohol use. Rate control measures need to be implemented to prevent complications associated with uncontrolled heart rate.
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests indicate elevated liver enzymes and an increased echogenic pattern in the liver, suggesting fatty infiltration or fibrosis/cirrhosis. Continued monitoring of liver function and evaluation for other potential etiologies are required.
4. Anion gap: The patient has an elevated anion gap on admission, which may be related to alcoholic ketoacidosis. Further investigation is needed to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other causes of metabolic acidosis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, currently undergoing ethanol detoxification. The patient presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is experiencing agitation, requiring high doses of benzodiazepines for withdrawal symptoms. Other findings include an echogenic pattern in the liver suggestive of fatty infiltration or fibrosis/cirrhosis, as well as moderate gallbladder sludge.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), blood pressure ranging from 142/94 mmHg to 106/56 mmHg, heart rate between 109-158 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented but appears anxious and tremulous.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with decreased sodium, potassium, and glucose levels. The liver function tests show elevated ALT and AST levels, along with an increased alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. The patient also has an elevated anion gap and a high level of lactate.

Assessment and plan:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms, requiring benzodiazepine administration for detoxification.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 58-year-old with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ethanol detoxification. They were found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
- The patient is currently experiencing alcohol withdrawal, requiring high doses of benzodiazepines for agitation. They are being closely monitored with CIWA assessments.
- Diazepam is being administered IV every 30 minutes to 1 hour as needed for agitation, and the possibility of transitioning to oral medications in the evening will be assessed.
- Thiamine, folate, and MVI supplements are being given.
- Suboxone has been held.
- The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation of uncertain duration, likely contributed by alcohol use. Other possible causes include hyperthyroidism, hypertension, or pulmonary embolism. The CHADs-2 score is zero, indicating no indication for long-term anticoagulation with ASA at this time. Diltiazem 60 mg PO QID has been prescribed.
- There is a new finding of cardiomyopathy on echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 40-45%. No signs of congestive heart failure are present. This may be due to prolonged tachyarrhythmia, alcohol use, HIV, viral infection, or idiopathic causes. Further workup for HIV is planned when the patient is off"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old with a history of polysubstance abuse admitted for ETOH detoxification. The patient has several medical complications including alcohol withdrawal, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 40-45%, alcoholic hepatitis, and anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing high doses of benzodiazepines for CIWA monitoring, indicating severe withdrawal symptoms. If left untreated, this can lead to delirium tremens, seizures, and potential cardiac arrhythmias.

2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. If not managed properly, this can result in hemodynamic instability, stroke, or other thromboembolic events.

3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has developed a new cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction. This can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and increased risk of sudden cardiac death if not managed appropriately.

4. Alcoholic Hepatitis: The patient has evidence of alcoholic hepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure if not treated. Monitoring liver function and providing supportive care is crucial.

5. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient initially presented with an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to alcoholic ketoacidosis. Close monitoring of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, currently admitted for ETOH detoxification. The patient has been experiencing increasing IV diazepam requirements, indicating ongoing alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He has also been found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's medical history includes a new cardiomyopathy seen on Echo with an ejection fraction of 40-45%. There are no signs of congestive heart failure. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated total bilirubin, and an anion gap of 16 (resolved from previous value of 19). These findings suggest alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic ketoacidosis. Additionally, the patient has a history of polysubstance abuse, including ETOH, and is currently on suboxone for opioid dependency.

Plan:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient requires high doses of benzodiazepines for symptom management and frequent CIWA monitoring. Diazepam 20mg PO Q1-2H CIWA is prescribed.
2. Atrial fibrillation: Diltiazem 90 mg PO QID is prescribed for rate control. Long-term anticoagulation with ASA should be considered, but will be held off in the acute setting.
3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's new cardiomyopathy may be due to prolonged tachyarrhythmia, ETOH use, HIV"

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note above and I
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 8014**] is less anxious
   and less tremulous from his alcohol withdrawal, but he is still
   tachycardic despite high dose Dilt (360 mg /day), and  quite
   diaphoretic too.  Aggressive p.o. Valium with extra IV doses per CIWA
   scale is continuing. We will liberalize his IV fluids given his high
   insensible losses, while watching his urine output and being sure the
   patient doesn
t develop any pulmonary edema (has cardiomyopathy).  He
   is getting some glucose p.o. and his LFT
s are improving.  He has a
   cough but lungs are so far clear.   I anticipate a  couple more days of
   MICU care will be needed for this moderately severe case of alcohol
   withdrawal.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, currently admitted for ethanol detoxification. He is experiencing symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal, including high doses of benzodiazepines required for agitation. The patient also has new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, likely contributed by excessive alcohol consumption. There are no signs of congestive heart failure, but an echocardiogram shows a reduced ejection fraction of 40-45%, suggesting cardiomyopathy. Additionally, the patient exhibits transaminitis likely related to alcohol abuse and hepatitis, along with biliary sludge in the gallbladder but no evidence of obstruction. An initial anion gap was observed but has since resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal, which can progress to severe complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. If left untreated or poorly managed, this can lead to complications like stroke, heart failure, and hemodynamic instability.

3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's reduced ejection fraction indicates cardiomyopathy, which may be related to prolonged tachyarrhythmia, alcohol abuse, HIV, viral infection, or idiopathic causes. This condition can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias,"

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note above and
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 8014**] is much improved
   even from yesterday, with less tremor and no diaphoresis and has gone
   6hr since last valium dose.  CIWA scale this am would appear to be less
   than [**9-17**]. Other metabolic issues have been improving (eg LFTs) and he
   is eating and taking po
s.   He is already well connected to a
   psychopharmacologist and therapist on the outside as well as AA, and is
   expressing no interest in a rehab facilitiy.  I think he is ready to go
   to the floor, to continue with prn valium at a likely progressively
   lower daily dose.

   # Alcohol withdrawal:  With history of ETOH abuse, in clear withdrawal,
   requiring high doses of benzos, frequent CIWA monitoring.  Currently
   requesting detox.   Pt showing less signs of withdrawal and requiring
   less valium
   - decrease CIWA to Diazepam [**11/2175**]mg PO Q4H.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - Hold suboxone

   # Atrial fibrillation:  With new onset atrial fibrillation of uncertain
   duration.  Likely contributed [**3-12**] ETOH.  Less likely etiologies include
   hyperthyroidism (no other systemic sxs), hypertension (no past history)
   or PE (no cardio-pulmonary sxs).  CHADs-2 score of zero.  Would benefit
   from ASA for long-term thromboembolic ppx, but will hold off in acute
   setting.
   - diltiazem XT 360mg daily
   # Cardiomyopathy: Patient has a new cardiomyopathy seen on Echo with EF
   40-45%. No signs of CHF. Most likely due to a prolonged tachyarrhythmia

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, currently admitted for ETOH detoxification. The patient was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal and requires frequent monitoring with CIWA. The patient has been receiving high doses of valium for symptom control.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is in clear withdrawal and requires continued monitoring with CIWA. The dose of diazepam should be decreased to 11 mg PO Q4H.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation of uncertain duration. It is likely contributed by ETOH abuse. Other less likely etiologies include hyperthyroidism, hypertension, or pulmonary embolism. The patient has a CHADS-2 score of zero. Long-term thromboembolic prophylaxis with ASA is recommended, but will be held in the acute setting. Diltiazem XT 360mg daily is prescribed.
3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a new cardiomyopathy seen on Echo with an ejection fraction of 40-45%. No signs of congestive heart failure are present. The cardiomyopathy is most likely due to prolonged tachyarrhythmia and EtOH use. Other processes in the differential include HIV, viral infection, hemochromatosis, or idiopathic causes. Iron"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, currently admitted for ethanol detoxification. The patient has been diagnosed with alcohol withdrawal, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, alcoholic hepatitis, cardiomyopathy, and anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium tremens: This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can occur in individuals with a history of chronic alcohol abuse. It is characterized by sudden and severe mental or neurological changes, which may include confusion, agitation, hallucinations, fever, and tremors.

2. Arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response indicates an abnormal heart rhythm. This condition increases the risk of blood clots forming in the heart, which can then travel to the brain, causing a stroke. Additionally, atrial fibrillation can lead to an irregular and often rapid heart rate that may decrease blood flow to the body's organs and tissues.

3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has developed cardiomyopathy, a condition where the heart muscle weakens and becomes enlarged. This can lead to heart failure, where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Symptoms of heart failure may include shortness of breath, fatigue, fluid retention, and decreased exercise tolerance.

4. Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient's liver function tests indicate transaminitis, likely related to alcohol abuse and/or hepatitis. Alcoholic"
