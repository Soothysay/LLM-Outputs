","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine. He presented with weakness and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely caused by pneumonia with aspiration or urinary tract infection due to chronic foley catheterization. Other potential causes include hypovolemia, neurogenic, or cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is a possibility due to an elevated central venous pressure (CVP) of 20. However, there are no EKG findings suggestive of ischemia or infarction, and the elevated troponin may be a result of acute renal failure (ARF) and hypoperfusion.

The patient's current treatment plan includes central venous line removal, IV fluids to maintain a target CVP of 8-12, levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and urine output above 30cc/hr, neosynephrine weaning as tolerated, broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for sepsis including pulmonary and genitourinary sources, follow-up blood, urine, and sputum cultures, trend white blood cell count fever curve, stress dose steroids due to chronic dexamethasone use, trend lactate levels, and an echocardiogram in the morning.

 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC (lactic)
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 ACUTE MI (most likely demand)
   There may be multiple sources of infection.  The most likely are
   pneumonia and urinary.  At present there is no headache and he follows
   commands; there were no meningitic prodrome.  C diff is in the
   differential.
          Cover MRSA and GNR.
          Cover atypicals
          Cultures including influenza and C diff, with appropriate
   precautions.
          No signs of intra-abdominal pathology at present
          PCP is less likely given overall picture; will test but not
   treat empirically at this point.
   For hemodynamic management
          Echocardiogram today (urgent but not emergent)
          Keep CVP >=[**10-18**]
          Wean levophed as tolerated
          Stress dose steroids
          Will leave intubated until shock state resolved.
   For cardiac:
          Echo today
          EKG and serial enzymes
          Unstable plaque seems very unlikely
   Will discuss spinal cord and oncologic issues with his oncologist.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine. He presented with weakness and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions including myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, cancer (anaplastic astrocytoma), septic shock, metabolic acidosis, pneumonia (aspiration vs. urosepsis), and acute kidney injury. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient is also receiving various medications and treatments for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's elevated lactate levels and the presence of indwelling catheters increase the risk of septic shock. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, CVP, and urine output is essential. Prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics is crucial.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's acute respiratory failure and potential aspiration pneumonia, there is a risk of developing ARDS. Close monitoring of oxygenation parameters and respiratory status is necessary. Supportive measures such as pressure support ventilation may be required.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has evidence of myocardial infarction with elevated troponin levels. Continuous cardiac monitoring and consideration of antiplatelet therapy may be needed.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's gap metabolic acidosis may worsen due to ongoing sepsis and lactic acidosis. Close monitoring of acid-base balance"

   Identified source of infections are:
   1)       GNR urinary tract infection
   2)       GNR bacteremia
   3)       Probable aspiration pneumonia
   We will continue to treat for GNR (narrow to Ancef based on
   sensitivities).  We will test for C diff and treat empirically given
   diarrhea, recent hospitalization, and PPI use.
   We will try to wean levophed as tolerated.  He is now adequately volume
   replete.  Begin steroid wean tomorrow.
   We will discuss whether anticoagulation is needed for his apical
   akinesis with cardiology.  If recommended, will discuss bleeding risks
   with his oncologists.
   Thrombocytopenia is most likely related to sepsis +/- ABX, though
   pancytopenia is concerning.  Will continue SQH for now, since risks of
   DVT >> likelihood of HIT at this point but will re-evaluate
   frequently.  [**Month (only) 51**] need further evaluation if pancytopenia progresses.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has several medical conditions. The patient has thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), acute urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia (presence of bacteria in the blood), acute heart failure (CHF), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), cancer (malignant neoplasm) specifically astrocytoma, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, pneumonia (aspiration), and possible pneumonia (ICU-acquired).

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature within normal range, heart rate within the normal range, blood pressure slightly low, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient is receiving various medications including fentanyl for pain management, famotidine for acid reflux, and heparin sodium as prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results show low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low sodium levels, high potassium levels, elevated creatinine, elevated troponin T levels, elevated glucose levels, and other abnormal values indicating possible organ dysfunction. The patient's coagulation profile (PT/INR/PTT) is abnormal, indicating a bleeding risk.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,994 mL with an output of 1,340 mL resulting in a positive balance of 1,654 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on"

   # Septic shock- Levophed weaned by 80% overnight. Sources still include
   question aspiration PNA vs Urosepsis secondary to indwelling foley.
   Now with GNR septicemia sensitive to cefazolin.
   Identified source of infections are:
   1)       GNR urinary tract infection
   2)       GNR bacteremia
   3)       Probable aspiration pneumonia
   We will continue to treat for GNR (narrow to Ancef based on
   sensitivities).  We will test for C diff and treat empirically given
   diarrhea, recent hospitalization, and PPI use.
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12, currently above goal.
   - Wean Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Cont Cefazolin/Flagyl antiobiotics to covering for simultaneous
   Urosepsis and potential C diff..
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Stress dose steroids, given chronic dexa at home.

   We will try to wean levophed as tolerated.  He is now adequately volume
   replete.  Begin steroid wean tomorrow.
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt much improved this AM with repeat RSBI
   of 55. Not Hypoxemic or Hypercarbic, however will keep intubated for
   the present time given cardiac issues and volume overload at this time.
   - Transitioned to pressure support.
   # Elevated Troponin: Trop 0.3 from .15 in AM, but leveled off and
   CK/Trop trending down this AM. Poor R wave progression, question
   anterior t-wave flattening. Troponin bump likely secondary to demand.
   Plaque rupture unlikely.  TTE with evidence of takatsubo physiology
   -          Ask cardiology about need for anticoagulation
   -          Hold off on ASA

   # Thrombocytopenia: ? of HIT but most likely etiology is GNR
   septicemia.  Will keep Heparin SQ for PPx given risk of DVT. We will
   discuss whether anticoagulation is needed for his apical akinesis with
   cardiology.  If recommended, will discuss bleeding risks with his
   oncologists. Most likely related to sepsis +/- ABX, though pancytopenia
   is concerning.  Will continue SQH for now, since risks of DVT >>
   likelihood of HIT at this point but will re-evaluate frequently.  [**Month (only) 51**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine, presenting with weakness and hypotension. He was admitted to the ICU for septic shock, suspected aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and bacteremia caused by Gram-negative rods (GNR). The patient has been receiving treatment with antibiotics sensitive to cefazolin and flagyl. Other conditions include acute respiratory failure, heart failure (systolic), cancer (malignant neoplasm), shock (septic), metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to GNR septicemia or other causes such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count raise concerns about pancytopenia. This condition can lead to increased susceptibility to infections, anemia, and bleeding complications.
3. GNR Bacteremia: The patient's infection with GNR bacteria can progress to bacteremia, leading to sepsis and septic shock. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent further complications.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a urinary tract infection, which can"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine. He was admitted with weakness and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with septic shock due to GNR bacteremia, which is sensitive to cefazolin. The patient has also been treated for possible C. difficile infection and has shown improvement after changing antibiotics. His Takasubo cardiomyopathy has resulted in a decreased ejection fraction of 30%. The patient's platelet count is low at 46 today, with a possible diagnosis of GNR septicemia and consumption. There is concern for thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia. The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely secondary to sepsis and lactic acidosis. He has a history of malignancy, which may contribute to his anemia and leukopenia. The patient's acute renal failure has resolved with intravenous fluids and pressors. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation included weakness and hypotension, and he was diagnosed with septic shock due to GNR bacteremia. There is a risk of ongoing sepsis or infection.
2. Takasubo Cardiomyopathy: The patient's ejection fraction has decreased to 30%, indicating impaired heart function. This condition can lead to heart failure and arrhythmias.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine. He presented with weakness and hypotension and was diagnosed with septic shock caused by GNR bacteremia. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and is now off pressors. Aspiration pneumonia is less likely given the resolution of retrocardiac opacity, which was likely atelectasis. The patient still has loose stools, and C. diff has been sent for testing. He is being treated empirically with Flagyl.

The patient's cardiac function has been affected by Takatsubo cardiomyopathy, with an ejection fraction of 30%. This may be due to septic shock without coronary distribution. Gentle diuresis will be started tomorrow, and the oncology team will be consulted regarding anticoagulation.

Thrombocytopenia is present, with a platelet count of 46. This could be due to GNR septicemia or consumption. Heparin sodium prophylaxis has been initiated, and further evaluation for HIT and platelet transfusion will be considered.

The patient's leukopenia is likely secondary to chemotherapy, and he is not currently neutropenic. However, he will be placed on neutropenic precautions if his absolute neutrophil count is less than 500.

The patient also has anemia, which is likely secondary to chemotherapy +/- ACD. Iron studies, trending H"

   Assessment and Plan
   41-year-old man with malignancy astrocytoma who presented with
   respiratory failure and septic shock from a urinary source.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 BACTEREMIA
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
          Shock now resolved
          Will need antibiotics for two weeks for presumptive
   pyelonephritis.  There was no evidence of a peri-nephric abscess on
   CCT.
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE
          Essentially pancytopenic at this point.
          HIT is in DDx given time course, exposure, and platelet
   level; however, other causes are more likely.
          Will therefore assess for PF4 and hold heparin but not
   exchange CVL at this point
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE (stress cardiomyopathy / apical
   ballooning syndrome)
          Discuss with cardiology regarding need for anticoagulation
          Echo in a week or so to assess for resolution
          Just off pressors for < 24 hours.  Consider diuresis late
   today or tomorrow.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
          Now extubated
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   astrocytoma

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of malignancy (astrocytoma) who presented with respiratory failure and septic shock from a urinary source. The patient is currently stable and off pressors. The patient was extubated and is now breathing on his own. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Urinary tract infection (UTI) and bacteremia: The patient has a history of UTI and bacteremia, which can lead to further infections if not properly managed.
2. Acute thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet levels, which increases the risk of bleeding and clotting disorders.
3. Acute heart failure (stress cardiomyopathy/apical ballooning syndrome): The patient may have developed stress-induced heart failure, which requires monitoring and treatment.
4. Respiratory failure: Although the patient is now extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to underlying conditions.
5. Cancer (malignant neoplasm): The patient has a history of astrocytoma, and the progression of this cancer should be closely monitored.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management of these potential complications are necessary to ensure the best possible outcome."

","Based on the provided information, the patient has a complex medical history with multiple conditions including acute respiratory failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, cancer (astrocytoma), septic shock, metabolic acidosis, pneumonia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient was extubated yesterday morning and has been doing well off the ventilator for the past 24 hours. They have a negative fluid balance and their mental status is good. However, they are experiencing some mobility issues, specifically an inability to move their right foot due to chronic issues related to their astrocytoma, as well as decreased strength in their left foot compared to pre-admission.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/71 mmHg to 123/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is slightly low at 35.8°C (96.4°F).

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL and a low platelet count of 61 K/uL. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, electrolytes, and liver function tests are within normal ranges.

The patient's medical complications include impaired skin integrity, acute thrombocytopenia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine. He presents with weakness and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including septic shock, Takatsubo cardiomyopathy, thrombocytopenia, malignancy, leukopenia, anemia, impaired skin integrity, urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, heart failure (CHF), respiratory failure, and acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, indicating a severe infection that has spread throughout his body.
2. Takatsubo Cardiomyopathy: The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is now 30%, indicating reduced heart function. This condition may be a result of septic shock.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding and bruising.
4. Malignancy: The patient has an unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma and is undergoing chemotherapy with avastin. The cancer may contribute to various complications and overall poor prognosis.
5. Leukopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, which can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of infections.
6. Anemia: The patient is likely experiencing anemia, which can lead to fatigue and shortness of breath.

","The patient is a 41-year-old male with unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine, presenting with weakness and hypotension. He is currently in the ICU due to multiple medical complications.

The patient has impaired skin integrity, thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 97), urinary tract infection (UTI) with E. coli sensitive to cefazolin, bacteremia, acute heart failure (CHF) with a decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 30%, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), cancer (malignant neoplasm) specifically anaplastic astrocytoma, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, aspiration pneumonia, leukopenia with a normal WBC count, anemia likely secondary to chemotherapy, and possibly acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 46 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/73 to 111/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula, temperature within normal range, and a sinus bradycardia rhythm. His fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 1160 mL over the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, troponin T, lactic acid, LDH, and D-dimer. Other lab values such as WBC, Hct,"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with an unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine. He presented with weakness and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including septic shock (due to E. coli infection), heart failure (acute systolic), respiratory failure (acute), cancer (malignant neoplasm), astrocytoma, and acidosis (metabolic). 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobilization.
2. Thrombocytopenia, acute: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The presence of E. coli in the urine indicates a UTI, which can potentially lead to kidney infection or sepsis if not treated appropriately.
4. Bacteremia: The presence of E. coli in the blood indicates bacteremia, which can progress to sepsis if not managed promptly.
5. Heart failure (CHF), acute systolic: The patient's heart function is compromised, leading to fluid accumulation and potential organ dysfunction.
6. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient's respiratory function is impaired, requiring mechanical ventilation support.
7. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), astrocytoma: The underlying malignancy poses"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 41-year-old male with unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine.
- He presented with weakness and hypotension.
- The patient remains afebrile and has been off pressors for over 48 hours.
- He still experiences loose stools, but C. diff tests have been negative twice.
- The patient is being treated empirically with Flagyl.
- His WBC count is within normal range today.
- His platelet count is 97, indicating thrombocytopenia.
- The patient has a history of septic shock, E. coli infection in urine and blood, which was sensitive to cefazolin.
- He has a decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 30% and is suspected to have Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
- The patient may have had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is being treated with captopril.
- He is undergoing chemotherapy with avastin for his malignancy.
- The patient has leukopenia and anemia, which are likely secondary to chemotherapy.
- The patient has impaired skin integrity, urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, acute heart failure (CHF), respiratory failure, and a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm).

Potential Medical Complications:
