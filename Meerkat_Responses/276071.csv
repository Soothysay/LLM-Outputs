   This is a 43 year-old female with a history of bilateral hip dysplasia
   who presents post-op to ICU for pain management after R periacetabular
   osteotomy, hip arthrotomy, and iliac bone graft.
   Plan:
   # Pain management: currently controlled
   -Follow recommendations of Chronic Pain Service---increase ketamine
   drip, increase oxycontin po, continue current dilaudid PCA, continue
   Predecex
   -Plan to d/c Precedex tomorrow with hopes of transferring care to the
   floor
   # Respiratory status: stable, no hypoxia, no apnea
   - currently SpO2 100% on 2L NC; will wean off O2; continue to monitor
   SpO2.
   # Hypotension: persists but stable, likely secondary to high dose pain
   meds.
   -good UOP and mentation; continue to monitor
   -give 500cc boluses of NS to maintain UOP and MAP > 65
   -attempt to titrate down pain medications
   #Anemia: Hct 24; baseline 32 ;likely dilutional
   -no evidence of hematoma on exam
   -will repeat Hct this afternoon, goal Hct > 21
   -will monitor daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female who presents post-operative to the ICU for pain management after undergoing a right periacetabular osteotomy, hip arthrotomy, and iliac bone graft. She has a history of bilateral hip dysplasia. The patient's pain is currently controlled with a combination of PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) and IV boluses of dilaudid. However, she prefers not to be on the basal rate for PCA as it makes her fall asleep and wake up in pain. The orthopedic team has indicated that she can be transferred to the floor if her pain is managed appropriately. The patient also requires 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low (95/47 mmHg), which may be due to high-dose pain medications. Close monitoring of blood pressure and urine output is necessary. Boluses of normal saline (NS) will be given to maintain urine output and mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level is 24%, lower than her baseline of 32%. This is likely due to dilutional effects. The goal Hct level is >21%. Repeating the Hct this afternoon and monitoring it daily is recommended.

3. Respiratory status: The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 43 year-old female with a history of bilateral hip dysplasia
   who is POD 2 for pain management after R periacetabular osteotomy, hip
   arthrotomy, and iliac bone graft.
   Plan:
   # Pain management: follow up with pain service re: adding a basal rate
   on dilaudid PCA while sleeping. Or recommendations for other PRN dosing
   of pain medications.
   - Patient is on max dose of ketamine drip, Oxycontin PO, dilaudid PCA,
   Tylenol, amitryptyline, neurotin
   - precidex has been d/c
 follow up with pain re: whether patient
   may be transferred to the floor.
   # Respiratory status: stable, no hypoxia, no apnea
   - currently SpO2 100% on 2L NC; will wean off O2; continue to monitor
   SpO2.
   # Hypotension: persists but stable, likely secondary to high dose pain
   meds.
   -good UOP and mentation; continue to monitor
   -give 500cc boluses of NS to maintain UOP and MAP > 65
   -attempt to titrate down pain medications
   #Anemia: Hct 24; baseline 32 ;likely dilutional
   -no evidence of hematoma on exam
   -will repeat Hct this afternoon, goal Hct > 21

","The patient is a 43-year-old female who is post-operative day 2 following a hip surgery. She has been experiencing severe pain, which has not been adequately controlled by her scheduled pain medications. She required additional 1 mg boluses of IV Dilaudid every 2 hours during the day and was not on a basal rate of Dilaudid PCA while sleeping. As a result, she wakes up in severe pain. Overnight, she received 1 mg of Dilaudid every 2-4 hours.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/47 mmHg to 107/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula with 4 liters of oxygen.

Her fluid balance shows an intake of 17,333 mL with 644 mL coming from IV fluids, 1,580 mL from PO intake, and 4,153 mL from TF intake. The total output includes 5,715 mL of urine, 125 mL of NG output, and 910 mL of drain output. The calculated fluid balance is positive at 11,618 mL with a negative of 266 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, platelet count of 106 K/uL, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, glucose of 111 mg/dL, and a D-dimer level of 546 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished woman in no acute distress. Her cardiovascular examination is notable for regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, clear to auscultation in all lung fields, and tender to palpation in the right lower quadrant near the surgical site. Her extremities are warm and dry with 2+ peripheral pulses.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pain management: The patient is experiencing severe pain that is not being adequately controlled by her current pain medication regimen. Adjustments may need to be made to optimize her pain management plan.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could be related to the high doses of pain medications she is receiving. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation may be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which is likely due to dilutional effects from fluid administration. Monitoring and addressing this issue will be important to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to tissues.

4. Coagulation: The patient's INR is elevated at 14.1, indicating a potential risk for bleeding. The decision to hold enoxap"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female who is post-operative day 2 (POD 2) after undergoing hip surgery. She has a history of chronic pain and is currently experiencing severe pain, despite being on scheduled pain medications. The patient required additional 1 mg boluses of IV Dilaudid every 2 hours during the day and did not use the basal rate of Dilaudid PCA while asleep. Pain management is a priority, and the pain service needs to be consulted regarding the addition of a basal rate on Dilaudid PCA while the patient is sleeping or recommendations for other PRN dosing of pain medications.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with no hypoxia or apnea, and she is currently on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. The plan is to wean off oxygen and continue monitoring the SpO2 levels.

The patient has persistent hypotension, likely secondary to high-dose pain medications. Good urine output and mentation are maintained, and the goal is to continue monitoring and provide 500cc boluses of normal saline to maintain urine output and mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. An attempt will be made to titrate down pain medications, and two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) will help with hypotension.

The patient has anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 23%, which is lower than the baseline of 32%. The orthopedic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with chronic pain who underwent right hip arthroplasty and required a large amount of pain medication. She was admitted to the ICU for aggressive pain management, including the use of Precedex. The patient's pain is somewhat controlled but requires frequent boluses. Some episodes of hypotension have been observed at night, which resolve when the patient wakes up. The patient has a history of allergies to Levaquin, codeine, and nausea/vomiting. She has received antibiotics, specifically Cefazolin. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/42 mmHg to 108/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on a nasal cannula for respiratory support. Fluid balance shows a total input of 17,333 mL and total output of 5,715 mL. Laboratory results indicate normal values for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, except for low potassium levels. The patient's disposition is planned for transfer to the floor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with chronic pain and a high requirement for pain medication, who underwent right hip arthroplasty. She was admitted to the ICU for aggressive pain management, which included the use of precedex. The patient is currently off precedex and is doing well. Pain service is closely monitoring the patient's pain levels. There are no other acute issues noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pain management: The patient has a large requirement for pain medication due to chronic pain and recent surgery. There is a potential complication of inadequate pain control, which could lead to patient distress and discomfort.
2. Anemia: The patient is experiencing post-operative anemia. If left untreated, this could lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and potentially result in organ dysfunction.
3. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation, likely due to pain medications and immobility. If not managed properly, constipation can lead to bowel obstruction and other complications.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient has undergone surgery and is immobile, there is an increased risk of developing DVT. If not prophylaxed against, DVT could potentially lead to pulmonary embolism, a life-threatening condition.
5. Pressure ulcers: Due to the patient being bedridden, there is a risk of developing pressure ulcers. If not prevented or treated promptly, pressure ulcers can lead to infection and other complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with chronic pain and a recent history of right hip arthroplasty. She was admitted to the ICU for aggressive pain management, which included the use of precedex. The patient is now off precedex and is doing fairly well. The pain service is closely following the patient. There are no other acute issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL, indicating possible post-operative anemia. The plan is to transfuse with packed red blood cells (prbc) as per orthopedic consultation.
2. Constipation: The patient may be at risk for constipation due to pain medication use. An aggressive bowel regimen should be implemented to prevent this.
3. Pain management: The patient requires ongoing pain management support from the pain service.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for DVT prophylaxis. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of DVT is important.
5. Stress ulcers: The patient is on a stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient was in the ICU, there is a risk for VAP. Monitoring for respiratory symptoms and implementing appropriate infection control measures is crucial.
7. Hypotension: The patient has experienced some hypot"
