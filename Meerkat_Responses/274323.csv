","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old woman with advanced Parkinson's disease, scoliosis, arthritis, who presented with fever and falls.
- She was found to be in sepsis with gram-positive cocci in the blood and possible early pneumonia.
- She has been febrile, tachypneic, and tachycardic at admission; fevers still persist.
- Her white blood cell count is 9 and systolic blood pressure varies widely between 100-140s.
- Gram-positive cocci were found in 4/4 bottles on admission culture.
- There is a concern for pneumonia as the source of infection given the lung exam and possible early consolidation on the chest X-ray.
- Additionally, there is concern about a chronic, large cyst on the back associated with a surgical scar that may be infected.
- The patient has been receiving broad antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftazidime), aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, and a CT scan of the back to further assess the cyst and hardware.
- A repeat chest X-ray shows possible interval progression of subtle pneumonia.
- The patient also has elevated creatine kinase levels with large blood on urinalysis without red blood cells, indicating early rhabdomyolysis in the setting of falls.
- Her hyponatremia is suspected to be secondary to hypovolemia and has improved with treatment.
- The patient has a history of anemia, currently"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with advanced Parkinson's disease, scoliosis, arthritis, and multiple medical conditions. She was admitted to the ICU due to MRSA sepsis, likely originating from an infected seroma extending to spinal hardware. The patient underwent a wash-out procedure and is currently on vancomycin. She has a history of allergies to penicillins and sulfur. Her vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure within normal limits. She is tachypneic and appears chronically ill. Physical examination reveals crackles in the right lower lung, some peri-umbilical tenderness, and a chronic rash on her scalp. Neurologically, she is attentive and follows simple commands but is disoriented to time and place. Lab results indicate anemia, low potassium, and slightly elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for MRSA sepsis, which can lead to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed appropriately.
2. Infection Spread: Given the presence of an abscess extending to spinal hardware, there is a risk of infection spreading further and potentially affecting other organs or systems.
3. Anemia: The patient's baseline low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mild disorientation following anesthesia suggests"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with advanced Parkinson's disease, scoliosis, arthritis, who presented with fever and falls. She was found to be in sepsis with gram-positive cocci (GPCs) in the blood and possible early pneumonia. The probable source of infection is a large abscess on her back involving previously implanted hardware. She has been treated with antibiotics, IV fluids, and other supportive measures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia at admission indicate an ongoing infection, which needs to be closely monitored for any deterioration.
2. Early pneumonia: The presence of GPCs in the blood suggests a possible respiratory infection, which may progress to pneumonia if not effectively managed.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The elevated CK level with large blood on UA without RBC indicates early rhabdomyolysis, especially in the setting of falls. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management is necessary.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels suggest possible secondarily caused by hypovolemia. Ongoing assessment and correction of fluid balance are important.
5. Anemia: The patient has a baseline low hemoglobin level, which has further decreased after IVF. Regular monitoring and appropriate management are required.
6. Parkinson's disease: The advanced stage of Parkinson's disease requires ongoing outpatient medication management,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with advanced Parkinson's disease, scoliosis, arthritis, who presented with fever and falls. She was found to be in sepsis with gram-positive cocci in her blood and possible early pneumonia; the probable source of infection is a large abscess on her back involving previously implanted hardware. 

The patient's vital signs have stabilized, but she still has persisting fevers. Her white blood cell count is within normal range, but her blood pressure and urine output are being closely monitored and managed with intravenous fluids as needed. The patient also has elevated creatine kinase levels, suggesting early rhabdomyolysis, possibly due to her falls. Her sodium levels were low, which were treated with intravenous fluids and have improved.

The patient's anemia has slightly improved from 30s to 28 after receiving intravenous fluids. She is not ambulatory, and her falls may be caused by slipping out of chairs. The patient has various other medical conditions, including Parkinson's disease, peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, depression, and osteoporosis. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines (including central venous catheter) are being managed appropriately. She is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, meaning do not resuscitate/do"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with advanced Parkinson's disease, scoliosis, arthritis, and a history of MRSA sepsis. She presents with high-grade bacteremia and a suspected source of infection related to spinal hardware. The patient underwent a washout procedure yesterday and continues to receive vancomycin for sepsis. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 106/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's neurological status is improving, and she is alert and oriented. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and hemoglobin level, as well as elevated creatinine and potassium levels. The patient has a history of anemia, Parkinson's disease, depression, and osteoporosis. She is currently receiving various medications for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endovascular infection: The patient's persistent bacteremia raises concern for an endovascular source of infection, possibly related to the spinal hardware. This could potentially lead to complications such as endocarditis or further spread of infection.
2. Anemia: The patient has a baseline low hemoglobin level and is currently stable at 28. Monitoring the patient's hemoglobin levels and providing appropriate treatment or transfusions if necessary is important.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with advanced Parkinson's disease, scoliosis, arthritis, who presents with MRSA sepsis. She has high-grade bacteremia and a suspected source of infection related to spinal hardware. The patient underwent a washout procedure and is currently on vancomycin. Vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. Fluid balance shows a positive total intake of 2,008 mL and a negative balance of 408 mL in the drains. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals crackles in the right lower lung fields, soft abdomen with bowel sounds, and some peri-umbilical tenderness. Neurologic examination shows mild disorientation. Lab results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, and normal renal function. Blood cultures are positive for MRSA, and urine cultures are negative. Assessment and plan include sepsis from MRSA bacteremia with suspected source of infected seroma extending to spinal hardware, mental status changes possibly related to anesthesia, anemia, Parkinson's disease, peptic ulcer disease, depression, and osteoporosis. ICU care includes nutrition via PO, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. Code status is DNR/DNI. Disposition is ICU overnight."
