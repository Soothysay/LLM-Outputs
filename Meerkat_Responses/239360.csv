","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He presented with influenza-like symptoms for three days and respiratory distress. The patient's respiratory distress is likely secondary to influenza and his underlying asthma. He was intubated due to fatigue and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has renal failure, which is likely secondary to poor oral intake and dehydration. Fluid resuscitation has been provided, and an echocardiogram will be done to evaluate heart function. The patient's sodium levels were initially low but have normalized.

The patient also has metabolic acidosis of unclear etiology, which could be related to renal failure. A toxic screen and laboratory tests have been ordered to further investigate this condition.

The patient is experiencing right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and lipase levels. This could indicate mild pancreatitis or transaminitis. Pain control measures have been implemented, and additional tests such as a CK level, trend of LFTs, and RUQ ultrasound have been ordered.

The patient's diabetes is currently stable, and insulin sliding scale has been initiated. His hypertension is being managed, and antihypertensive medications will be added back as needed. Prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He presents with influenza-like symptoms for three days and respiratory distress. The patient is currently stable on continuous nebs and a facemask but remains in obvious respiratory distress. He has acute pain, renal failure, asthma, and potential hyponatremia. There is also uncertainty regarding the etiology of his right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and lipase levels. The patient's diabetes management appears stable, and he is on glyburide at home occasionally. His blood pressure is currently controlled, but antihypertensives may be added back as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely secondary to influenza and his underlying asthma. Continuous nebulizers and a facemask are currently stabilizing his condition, but if he becomes alert and oriented and his CO2 levels remain stable, intubation may not be necessary. However, if he desats or tires out, intubation should be considered.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is likely due to poor oral intake and dehydration. He received 2 liters of intravenous fluids (IVFs) in the emergency department, but further management should focus on avoiding fluid overload given his respiratory status. Renal dos"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual who presented with acute pain and chronic renal failure. They are currently being treated in the ICU for asthma. The patient experienced shaking chills and sweats throughout the night, which could indicate an infection or inflammatory response. They have a history of allergies to augmentin, tetracycline, adhesive tape, latex, iodine, and wheezing. The patient received a flu swab and is on continuous nebs. Their vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, normal blood pressure, and an increased respiratory rate. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable heart rhythm and fluid balance. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. Physical examination reveals paradoxical chest expansion, crackles and wheezes in the respiratory system, and soft bowel sounds in the abdomen. Neurological assessment is not available due to the patient's inability to respond or move. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased sodium and potassium levels. The patient's blood glucose level is high. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is currently in the ICU.

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, admitted for exacerbation and possible viral infection. He presented with dyspnea and wheezing. Upon admission, he was stable on nasal cannula oxygen with stable ABGs. However, overnight he became hemodynamically unstable, experiencing increasing tachycardia and work of breathing. 

The patient has multiple allergies including Augmentin (oral), Tetracycline, adhesive tape (topical), latex, and iodine. He is currently on several medications including oseltamivir, levofloxacin, heparin (prophylaxis), demerol, solumedrol, amitriptyline, continuous nebs, and insulin sliding scale.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 84 bpm (74-102), blood pressure of 104/63 mmHg (72-87/60-70), respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute (25-37), and oxygen saturation of 99%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals respiratory distress, diffuse wheeze, and use of respiratory muscles. Crackles are heard in the posterior/inferior fields, and there is minimal edema.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 14.3 g/dL, platelet count of 161 K/uL, creatinine of 2.3 mg/dL, sodium of 250 mg/dL, potassium of 19 mEq/L, chloride of 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 4.9 mEq/L, blood glucose of 34 mg/dL, and magnesium of 3.3 mg/dL.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH of 7.28, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 99%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 19 mEq/L.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include exacerbation of asthma leading to respiratory failure, secondary infections due to viral syndrome, acute renal failure (ARF), and stress ulcers. The patient is critically ill and remains in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   51yoM with h/o asthma admitted for exacerbation and possible viral
   infection.
   1.       Asthma: Acutely worsening over past several hours with exam
   indicative of respiratory distress
   - plan intubation given worsening respiratory status
   - Solumedrol 125mg q8h, continuous nebs, can consider magnesium
   - Plan to ventilate with VC, long E time and high inspiratory flow.  RR
   14-15 and monitor for autopeep.
   2.       ID:  Awaiting viral studies, treatment for antibiotics
   - F/u H1N1 testing and DFA.  Send lower respiratory tract sample for
   DFA.
   - Check CK given possible H1N1
   - Add vancomycin while awaiting culture data.
   - Continue levofloxacin and oseltamivir
   3.       Renal:  ARF, improving with fluids: likely hypovolemic.
   Suspect metabolic acidosis from renal failure.  No lactate.
   - check serum osms; repeat lactate, tox screen
   4.       Access:  Place art-line given intubation and need for frequent
   ABGs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Currently NPO, will start tube feeds once intubated
   Glycemic Control:  Sliding scale insulin, monitor FSG with solumedrol.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, was admitted for an exacerbation and possible viral infection. He presented with dyspnea and wheezing. On admission, he was stable on nasal cannula oxygen with stable ABGs. However, overnight, he became hemodynamically stable but developed increasing tachycardia and work of breathing.

24-hour events:
- The patient remained stable overnight, but in the morning, he showed signs of worsening respiratory distress.
- His vital signs included a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 104/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient was tachycardic and had increased work of breathing.
- His physical examination revealed diffuse wheezing, use of respiratory muscles, crackles in the posterior/inferior fields, and abdominal paradox with rounding up during forced exhalation.
- The patient was started on heparin prophylaxis, and antibiotics were initiated due to concerns about a possible secondary infection.
- Laboratory results indicated acute kidney injury (ARF) with improving renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated white blood cell count.
- The patient's chest X-ray showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates.
- The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to the decision of intubation and mechanical ventilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes who presents with influenza-like symptoms for three days and respiratory distress. He was intubated due to respiratory failure and has been experiencing difficulty tolerating ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by acute pain, chronic renal failure, asthma, and hyponatremia. Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, C-reactive protein, and lactate, indicating possible infection or inflammation. The patient's renal function is impaired, as evidenced by decreased urine output and elevated blood urea nitrogen levels. Liver function tests reveal elevated liver enzymes and lipase, suggesting possible liver involvement or pancreatitis. The patient's diabetes is stable, but requires careful monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and difficulty tolerating ventilation pose a significant risk for worsening respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation parameters, and frequent reassessment of the patient's respiratory status are essential.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's decreased urine output, elevated blood urea nitrogen levels, and impaired renal function indicate a high risk of developing AKI. Frequent monitoring of renal function, strict fluid balance, and close attention to medication dosing based on renal function are crucial.

3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count, presence of fever, and positive influenza A antigen suggest an active infection. Frequent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He presented with influenza-like symptoms and respiratory distress. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient also has acute pain, chronic renal failure, asthma, and multiple comorbidities. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.7°F, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 101/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose levels, liver enzymes, and troponin-T. Imaging studies reveal echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration, cholelithiasis, and persistent right hydronephrosis. The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, acute pain, renal failure, asthma, and other comorbidities. The plan includes adjusting ventilation settings, administering antibiotics and antiviral medication, managing fluid resuscitation, evaluating heart function, addressing hyponatremia, correcting acid-base imbalance, managing transaminitis, and monitoring for complications related to diabetes and hypertension."

   - started to tire out this morning, intubated now; will place a-line,
   follow ABGs and continue treatment as below
   - solumedrol 125 mg q8hrs
   - levofloxacin q48 hrs with renal dosing for possible PNA; adding vanco
   for ICU CAP
   - oseltamivir 75 mg [**Hospital1 7**] for high dose renal adjustment
   .
   # ARF: likley secondary to poor PO intake and dehydration. Received 2 L
   IVFs in the ED, but with respiratory status, would like to keep
   relatively dry.  FeNa consistent with prerenal and worsening.  UOP
   response to IVF
   - fluid resuccitate titrate to UOP
   - check CVP
   - echo to evaluate heart function
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 128 on admission, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia
   and is secondary to insensible losses from fevers and poor PO intake.
   Normalized today
   .
   # AG Acidosis: unclear etiology, could be secondary to renal failure.
   Lactate normal, no ketones in urine.
   - tox screen
   - LR instead of NS
   .
   # RUQ pain: unclear etiology, does have elevated LFTs and lipase.  See
   below for discussion.
   - pain control with tylenol or morphine PRN
   .
   # Transaminitis/ elevated lipase: mild, last drink was Wed prior to
   [**Holiday **]; transaminitis could be secondary to etoh vs. fatty
   liver.  Could have mild pancreatitis.  Enzymes not high enough to be
   consistent with shock liver.  Could be from mild rhabdo.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented with influenza-like symptoms for three days and respiratory distress. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute pain, chronic renal failure, asthma, and possible pneumonia. The patient is also hyponatremic, acidic, and experiencing right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain. There is also a mention of transaminitis and elevated lipase levels, suggesting possible liver involvement.

The patient's current treatment plan includes the following:
1. Respiratory Distress: Intubation with noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMBAs) and antibiotic therapy with levofloxacin, solumedrol, and oseltamivir.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Fluid resuscitation with intravenous fluids (IVFs) and monitoring urine output (UOP) response.
3. Hyponatremia: Correction of sodium levels.
4. Acid-Base Imbalance: Correction of acidosis with lactate replacement solution (LR).
5. RUQ Pain: Pain management with Tylenol or morphine as needed.
6. Transaminitis and Elevated Lipase: Monitoring liver function tests (LFTs) and considering an abdominal ultrasound.
7. Diabetes Mellitus:"

   - TTE today, f/u results
   2.  H1N1:
   - Oseltamivir as long as is tolerating tube feeds, will consider
   peramivir if enteral feeds not tolerated
   - d/c other antibiotics if cultures are unrevealing today
   3. Renal: urine sediment, UA, urine lytes suggest pre-renal.
   Hypovolemia/pre-renal versus intrinsic related to H1N1 infection
   - Volume today and f/u UOP and Cr later today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma and H1N1 infection. He was intubated on October 19th for respiratory distress and has been experiencing difficulty ventilating overnight, leading to worsening respiratory acidosis. The patient's allergies include Augmentin, Tetracycline, adhesive tape, latex, iodine, and Demerol. He has been receiving various medications including Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Oseltamivir, fentanyl, propofol, heparin, bronchodilators, and Solumedrol.

Physical examination shows that the patient is heavily sedated, with diffuse wheeze and upper lobe rhonchi. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/64 mmHg to 94/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, troponin-T, and lactate levels. The patient's blood cultures are positive for gram-positive organisms. Imaging studies are pending.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure secondary to asthma exacerbation with worsening respiratory acidosis. The patient's sedation will be increased, and respiratory support measures will"

   Assessment and Plan
   51yoM with asthma exacerbation secondary H1N1
   1.  Respiratory failure secondary to asthma: worsening respiratory
   acidosis secondary to increased dead space and autopeep.
   - Decrease RR once sedated, increase flow time/decrease inspiratory
   time, PEEP 0
   - Solumedrol 125mg q8h
   - Increase sedation
   - Continuous nebs
   - TTE today, f/u results
   2.  H1N1:
   - Oseltamivir as long as is tolerating tube feeds, will consider
   peramivir if enteral feeds not tolerated
   - d/c other antibiotics if cultures are unrevealing today
   3. Renal: urine sediment, UA, urine lytes suggest pre-renal.
   Hypovolemia/pre-renal versus intrinsic related to H1N1 infection
   - Volume today and f/u UOP and Cr later today
   - Suspect metabolic acidosis secondary to renal failure

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma and H1N1 infection who was intubated on 10/19 for respiratory distress. He is currently in the ICU and experiencing difficulty ventilating overnight with worsening respiratory acidosis. The patient has multiple allergies and is on several medications, including sedation, antibiotics, and bronchodilators. His vital signs show a fever, tachycardia, and stable blood pressure. Fluid balance and respiratory support information is provided. The patient's laboratory results indicate potential renal involvement, and imaging studies reveal the presence of influenza and gram-positive organisms in his sputum. The assessment and plan include management of respiratory failure secondary to asthma, treatment for H1N1 infection, and evaluation of renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory failure due to increased dead space and autopeep.
2. Hypovolemia/pre-renal versus intrinsic renal failure related to H1N1 infection.
3. Metabolic acidosis secondary to renal failure.
4. Possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility.
6. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to prolonged ICU stay and sedation.
7. Infection from central line or arterial line.
8. Complications from H1N1 infection such as sepsis or multi"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He presented with symptoms of influenza and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications.

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced low blood pressure, which required fluid resuscitation and the use of pressors. However, after the resuscitation, his pressures improved, and he no longer required pressors.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and was intubated. He continues to have difficulty tolerating the ventilator, and adjustments to the ventilator settings are being made to optimize his respiratory support.

3. Acute Pain: The patient is experiencing acute pain, which may be related to his medical conditions or the invasive procedures and interventions he has undergone.

4. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a pre-existing condition of chronic renal failure (CRF), also known as chronic kidney disease (CKD). His renal function is being closely monitored, and he is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation.

5. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, and this condition may contribute to his respiratory symptoms and the need for mechanical ventilation.

6. Influenza: The patient presented with symptoms consistent with influenza, including respiratory distress. He is being treated with antiviral medications, such as oseltamivir, to manage"

   # Respiratory Distress: Intubated with difficulty tolerating vent last
   night requiring addition of versed and then paralytics. Looks much
   better on paralytics
   - continue paralytics for now but plan to turn off later today to see
   if he has improved, if placed back on, will ween versed
   - continue high dose sedation
   - solumedrol 125 mg q8hrs, continuous high-dose nebs
   -Will d/c antibiotics as no other solid evidence of bacterial
   infections
   - oseltamivir 75 mg [**Hospital1 7**] for high dose renal adjustment

   # ARF: Urine chemistries c/w pre-renal.  Unlikely flu related.  UOP and
   creatinine with good response to IVF
   - Improving now, maintain evolumia today.

   # Hyponatremia: Na 128 on admission, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia
   and is secondary to insensible losses from fevers and poor PO intake.
   Normalized.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with asthma exacerbation secondary to H1N1. The patient required paralysis overnight due to worsening hypoxemia and ventilator dysynchrony. He has multiple allergies, including to augmentin, tetracycline, adhesive tape, latex, iodine, and demerol. His last doses of antibiotics were levofloxacin on 10/20/2144 at 06:00 PM and vancomycin on 10/21/2144 at 07:54 AM. The patient is currently receiving various infusions, including fentanyl, midazolam, propofol, and cisatracurium. He is also receiving other ICU medications, such as famotidine, heparin sodium, albuterol, chlorhexidine, and solumedrol. The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination are detailed in the note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's worsening hypoxemia and inability to increase respiratory rate significantly may lead to further respiratory compromise and potential ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
2. Infection: The patient has tested positive for flu and is awaiting results for H1N1 PCR. This indicates a potential risk for secondary infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Renal function: The patient's current renal function appears to be compromised, with elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes who presented with influenza-like symptoms and respiratory distress. He was intubated due to difficulty tolerating the ventilator and remains on paralytics. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension (not in shock), acute pain, chronic renal failure, asthma, and possible component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating severe respiratory failure. There is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia or other complications related to prolonged intubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sedation and propofol. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient has evidence of pre-renal azotemia, but there may also be some component of ATN. Close monitoring and maintaining euvolemia are essential to prevent further renal damage.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level was initially low, likely due to insensible losses from fevers and poor oral intake. Normalization of sodium levels is necessary to prevent complications such as seizures.
5. Acid-Base Imbalance: The patient had metabolic acidosis, which has resolved with the resolution of acute renal failure. However, ongoing monitoring is required to maintain"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He presented with influenza-like symptoms for three days and respiratory distress. 

The patient was intubated with difficulty and required the addition of versed and paralytics due to acute resistance against the ventilator. He remains off antibiotics. The plan includes minimizing the length of paralytics, continuing high-dose sedation, weaning steroids to 60 prednisone daily, using continuous high-dose albuterol nebs with added ipratroprium, administering oseltamivir for high-dose flu treatment, transitioning to pulmonary tube feeds to decrease RQ, and monitoring for any complications.

The patient experienced transient hypotension requiring mild Neosynepherin due to sedation and propofol. His chronic renal failure (CRF) has been managed with aggressive hydration, which resulted in a resolution of creatinine levels. Urine electrolytes indicate pre-renal azotemia, suggesting some component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

The patient's hyponatremia normalized, resolving the metabolic acidosis. Mild elevations in liver enzymes resolved, likely due to the flu. There were no significant findings on RUQ ultrasound, ruling out acute pancreatitis.

The patient is currently being managed for diabetes mellitus with insulin sliding scale and glargine. Hypotension is being"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with asthma who is currently experiencing an exacerbation secondary to H1N1 infection. He required paralytics overnight after being halted the previous afternoon due to the development of significant autopeep and difficulty ventilating and oxygenating. The patient has allergies to augmentin, tetracycline, adhesive tape, latex, iodine, and short demerol. His last dose of antibiotics was Tamiflu on 10/21/2144 at 8:00 PM. He is currently on midazolam, cisatracurium, hydromorphone, and propofol infusions, as well as famotidine, heparin sodium, and Solumedrol. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. His vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination are also detailed in the progress note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure secondary to asthma exacerbation: The patient's respiratory failure is due to his asthma exacerbation. To manage this, bronchodilators should be administered aggressively, steroids should be decreased, and the rate should be adjusted based on ABG results. Paralytics may be considered for trial removal today.

2. H1N1 infection: The patient has been diagnosed with H1N1 infection. Oseltamivir has been initiated for treatment.

3. Renal function: The"

   51 y/o M with hx of asthma, CKD, DM who presents with influenza like
   symptoms for three days and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Intubated with difficulty tolerating vent last
   night requiring addition of versed and then paralytics. Looks much
   better on paralytics.  He remains off antibiotics.  He has been on
   solumedrol 125 mg q8hrs
   - attempt to minimize length of paralytics
   - continue high dose sedation
   - wean steroids to 60 prednisone daily
   - continuous high-dose alubterol nebs, added ipratroprium
   - oseltamivir 150  mg [**Hospital1 7**] for high dose flu treatment
   - transition to pulmonary tube feeds to decrease RQ
   .
   # Shock: transient hypotension requiring mild Neosynepherin yesterday.
   Likely from sedation and propofol.
   .
   # ARF: Cr resolved to 1.8 with aggressive hydration.  Urine lytes c/w
   pre-renal.  [**Month (only) 51**] have some compenent of ATN.
   - Continue to monitor, maintain euvolemia
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 128 on admission, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia
   and is secondary to insensible losses from fevers and poor PO intake.
   Normalized.
   .
   # AG Acidosis: Resolved with resolution of acute renal failure.
   - LR instead of NS for any fluid rescuscitation
   .
   # Transaminitis/ elevated lipase:  Resolved.  Initially had mild
   elevations, likely from flu.  Last drink was Wed prior to [**Holiday **];
   transaminitis could be secondary to etoh vs. fatty liver.  Could have
   mild pancreatitis.  Enzymes not high enough to be consistent with shock
   liver.  RUQ u/s unrevealing.
   .
   # DM: hyperglycemic with steroids, on glyburide at home occassionally.
   - insulin sliding scale + glargine
   - uptitrate PRN
   .
   # HTN: is hypotensive, with infection, will hold antihypertensives and
   add back on as needed

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He presented with influenza-like symptoms for three days and respiratory distress. The patient was intubated due to difficulty tolerating ventilation, requiring the addition of versed and paralytics. He appears better on paralytics but remains off antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 155/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, and he has received a total of 3,075 mL of fluids with an output of 4,215 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 223 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.0 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.6 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 28 mEq/L, sodium (Na) of 128 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 5.5 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 110 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 30.3%, and glucose of 279 mg/dL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals a pH of 7.31, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 206, and respiratory rate (RR) of 8.6 L/min.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient attempted to discontinue paralytics, resulting in desaturation to the 80s. Paralytics were restarted one hour later.
- The patient's creatine kinase (CK) level has improved from 7000 to 1230.
- Mild hyperkalemia was treated with Kayexalate.
- Steroids were tapered to prednisone 60.
- CVL (cerebroventricular line) was pulled back.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and arterial blood gases (ABG) will be crucial to assess the patient's respiratory function.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may require close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate interventions such as fluid administration or vasopressor therapy.

3. Chronic renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, which may require careful monitoring of renal function and adjustments in fluid and electrolyte management.

4. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, which could be exacerbated by certain medications or respiratory infections. Monitoring of respiratory symptoms and administering bronchodilators as needed will be important.

5. Pain management: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) who has been admitted to the ICU with influenza-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition is complicated by several factors including potential removal of paralytics, shock, acute kidney injury (ARF), hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension (HTN), and feeding intolerance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's ARDS may lead to further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Kidney Injury: The patient's current ARF and history of CKD could progress to chronic kidney disease or require renal replacement therapy.
3. Diabetic Complications: The patient's DM may result in hyperglycemic emergencies like diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's HTN and previous episode of shock may increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
5. Feeding Intolerance: The patient's feeding intolerance could lead to malnutrition and delayed wound healing.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to steroids and influenza infection may increase the risk of secondary infections such as urinary tract infections or bloodstream infections.
7. Sedation and Paralysis Complications: The attempted removal of paralytics and subsequent desaturation"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) who has been admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure due to influenza-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current condition includes hyperglycemia, hypotension (not in shock), respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, asthma, and acute pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening lung function may occur.

2. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has pre-existing CKD, which can lead to complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI) or further deterioration of renal function.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood sugar levels can increase the risk of infections and delay wound healing. Poorly controlled diabetes can also lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).

4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate inadequate perfusion and oxygen delivery to vital organs. This can increase the risk of organ damage and failure.

5. Asthma: The patient's history of asthma increases the risk of exacerbations, especially during respiratory infections or stress.

6. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Although not explicitly mentioned"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure induced by influenza.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hyperglycemia: The patient is experiencing high blood sugar levels, which may be related to his diabetes and steroid use.
- Hypotension: The patient has had transient episodes of low blood pressure, possibly due to sedation and propofol.
- Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to strong respiratory drive caused by paralysis and a low pH level. The plan is to attempt to discontinue paralytics with decreased rate and larger tidal volumes.
- Chronic renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease is mentioned, but there are no specific interventions mentioned for this condition.
- Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, but it does not appear to be actively exacerbating his current condition.
- Influenza: The patient tested positive for influenza A viral antigen, indicating a current influenza infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent this, such as regular lung secretion clearance and appropriate antibiotic therapy if necessary.
2. Deep vein throm"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with asthma exacerbation and respiratory failure due to H1N1 infection. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has allergies to augmentin, tetracycline, adhesive tape, latex, iodine, and demerol. He is receiving multiple medications including insulin, midazolam, cisatracurium, hydromorphone, propofol, haloperidol, and furosemide. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure of 172/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His chest X-ray shows clear lungs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's underlying asthma condition could worsen if not properly managed.
2. H1N1 infection: The patient has persistent positive influenza A, indicating ongoing H1N1 infection. There is a risk of complications associated with influenza, such as pneumonia or secondary bacterial infections.
3. Neurological complications: The patient remains paralyzed and sedated, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers, muscle atrophy, and deep vein thrombosis.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, indicating persistent hypertension. This may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications if not managed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by an asthma exacerbation and H1N1 infection. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He is sedated and paralyzed to facilitate ventilation. The patient's allergies include Augmentin, Tetracycline, adhesive tape, latex, iodine, and Demerol. He has been receiving various medications, including oseltamivir, prednisone, albuterol nebs, haloperidol, furosemide, insulin, midazolam, cisatracurium, hydromorphone, and propofol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's underlying asthma condition can worsen due to inflammation and bronchoconstriction.
2. H1N1 infection: The patient is positive for influenza A, indicating a potential worsening of his respiratory status.
3. Neurological complications: Prolonged paralysis and sedation can lead to muscle weakness, atrophy, and potential pressure ulcers.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has persistent hypertension, which may indicate the need for antihypertensive therapy and monitoring.
5. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure induced by influenza. The patient has been tolerating off paralytics but requires increased sedation. His oxygenation has been worsening, likely due to mild volume overload. The patient is also experiencing hyperglycemia, hypertension, and acute pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's worsening oxygenation and respiratory failure indicate the possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe lung damage and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases the risk of renal failure. In the ICU, various factors such as medication use, fluid balance, and inadequate oxygenation can further compromise kidney function.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's hyperglycemia may progress to DKA, a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketones in the urine, and metabolic acidosis. Prompt management is crucial to prevent complications.
4. Pneumonia: The presence of greenish urine suggests the possibility of a urinary tract infection (UTI), which can sometimes be associated with pneumonia, especially in critically ill patients.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation,"

   asthma
    - Diuresis today, aim TBB negative 1L; lasix 20mg IV
    -  continue nebs/prednisone 50mg
    -  Will attempt to wean fiO2/PEEP today if tolerates
   2. ID: WBC stable, minimal secretions; but changing LLL exam and CXR.
   Send sputum culture today if able.
   - Low threshold to initiate ABX for VAP; other potential sources could
   be sinusitis given drainage.
   - Hold currently, follow response of hypoxemia to diuresis.  If
   unimproved, can consider re-initation of ABX.
   3. Neuro:
    - elevated triglycerides; will decrease propofol, increase midazolam
   if needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma and H1N1 infection. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has been off paralytics since yesterday morning and experienced a transient decrease in blood pressure after the initiation of lisinopril, requiring some fluids for improvement. He also had increasing hypoxemia overnight and some dysynchrony, which improved with diuresis on IV lasix.

The patient has several allergies, including Augmentin (rash), Tetracycline (unknown reaction), adhesive tape WP (rash), latex (rash), iodine (wheezing), and Demerol (hives). The patient is receiving multiple medications, including insulin, midazolam, hydromorphone, propofol, furosemide, heparin sodium, oseltamivir, Zoloft, chlorhexidine, albuterol, and lisinopril.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/67 to 144/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's weight is currently 97.4 kg, and his height is 65 inches. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 3 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented with influenza-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been sedated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show a slight fever, stable blood pressure, and decreased heart rate. His respiratory status has improved, but he still requires supplemental oxygen. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. His kidney function tests reveal a slight decrease in creatinine levels, while his liver function tests are within normal range. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, likely due to steroid treatment and his diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's increased oxygen requirement may indicate a possible infection. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and sputum cultures will help identify any potential development of VAP.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's elevated blood glucose levels and history of DM suggest a risk for DKA, especially considering the steroid treatment. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels and acid-base balance is crucial.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's history of CKD and ongoing fluid management in the ICU may increase the risk of AKI. Close monitoring of kidney function tests and fluid balance is essential.
4. Stress ulcers: P"

   - continuous high-dose alubterol nebs, added ipratroprium
   - oseltamivir 150  mg [**Hospital1 7**] for high dose flu treatment for 10 days
   - transition to pulmonary tube feeds to decrease RQ
   - One dose of methylnaltrexone today to stimulate gut and make sure
   absorbing oseltamivir.
   # ARF: Slightly worse today, likely from ACE added on
   yesterday.
   -Con't to monitor

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM), who presented with influenza-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated on mechanical ventilation. The patient is sedated and not fully awake. His vital signs show a stable blood pressure, but his oxygen saturation is below normal. The patient's lungs are receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated triglycerides, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. His kidney function tests show a decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for low potassium levels. His glucose level is elevated, indicating hyperglycemia.

The patient's ARDS seems to be tolerating off paralytics but requires increased sedation. There is worsening oxygenation likely due to mild volume overload. The plan includes diuresis with the goal of input/output balance, decreasing PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated, continuing high-dose sedation, administering prednisone daily, using high-dose albuterol nebs with ipratropium, and transitioning to pulmonary tube feeds to decrease respiratory quotient.

The patient's acute kidney injury (ARF) is slightly worse today, possibly due to the addition of ACE inhibitor. Monitoring will continue. The patient's diabetes management requires an insulin"

   1.  Respiratory failure: both hypoxemia, possibly component of volume,
   also possible H1N1 persistence, aspiration, or VAP. Secretions are
   clear, non-purulent
   - Plan TBB negative 1L today
   - Taper prednisone to 40mg
   - continue bronchodilators
   - At this time, greater suspicion for aspiration event and no clear
   evidence of infectious etiology; will continue to hold antibiotics but
   have low-threshold to cover for VAP.
   - Likely will need trach when oxygenation improves.
   2.  ID:  H1N1
   - oseltamivir
   3.  Renal:  Cr improving
   - TBB negative
   4.  GI: decreased motility. Started methylnaltrexone yesterday
   - add reglan today
   - bowel regimen
   5.  Neuro:
   - given high triglycerides, attempt to taper propofol today.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Tube feeds pending improved gut motility; if not improving,
   will need TPN.

   Assessment and Plan
   51yoM with asthma exacerbation secondary to H1N1.
   1.  Respiratory failure: both hypoxemia, possibly component of volume,
   also possible H1N1 persistence, aspiration, or VAP. Secretions are
   clear, non-purulent
   - Plan TBB negative 1L today
   - Taper prednisone to 40mg
   - continue bronchodilators
   - At this time, greater suspicion for aspiration event and no clear
   evidence of infectious etiology; will continue to hold antibiotics but
   have low-threshold to cover for VAP.
   - Likely will need trach when oxygenation improves.
   2.  ID:  H1N1
   - oseltamivir
   3.  Renal:  Cr improving
   - TBB negative
   4.  GI: decreased motility. Started methylnaltrexone yesterday
   - add reglan today
   - bowel regimen
   5.  Neuro:
   - given high triglycerides, attempt to taper propofol today.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Tube feeds pending improved gut motility; if not improving,
   will need TPN.

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with asthma exacerbation secondary to H1N1. He is currently in respiratory failure, experiencing hypoxemia and possibly volume overload. There is also a suspicion of aspiration or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs show fever, normal blood pressure, heart rate within normal range, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 95%. 

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15.3 K/uL, elevated AST and ALT levels, elevated lactate levels, and decreased albumin levels. Blood cultures and sputum gram-stain are negative. Chest X-ray shows increasing left-sided opacities. 

The patient's plan includes tapering prednisone to 40mg, continuing bronchodilators, holding antibiotics but having a low threshold to cover for VAP, and considering tracheostomy when oxygenation improves. 

The patient also has other medical conditions such as renal dysfunction, decreased gastrointestinal motility, and neurologic concerns related to high triglycerides. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient requires tube feeds or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to decreased gut motility, insulin drip for glycemic control, and various prophylactic measures including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to influenza-induced ARDS. He has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown some improvement, but still requires high-dose sedation and continuous O2 supplementation. The patient developed a fever and a rash after receiving cefepime and vancomycin, so aztreonam was started instead. His sputum culture showed GPCs and GNRs. He is also experiencing hyperglycemia, hypotension, acute pain, chronic renal failure, asthma, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan includes weaning off propofol, continuing high-dose sedation, reducing PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated, and planning for tracheostomy later this week. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has shown signs of worsening infiltrates and a new fever, which could indicate VAP. This is a potential complication of mechanical ventilation and requires prompt treatment.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and may require further investigation and management.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. This can be exacerbated by stress and the use of steroids. Insulin inf"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) who has been admitted to the ICU for influenza-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has multiple medical complications and is currently receiving treatment for these conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's health progress in the ICU include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's worsening infiltrates and new fever suggest a possible development of VAP. The healthcare team has started the patient on vancomycin and aztreonam for infection control.

2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,835 mL and output of 3,135 mL over the past 24 hours, indicating a negative fluid balance of -1,300 mL. Close monitoring and adjustment of fluid administration may be necessary.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypotension, with a lowest recorded pressure of 101/53 mmHg. The patient is currently being treated for hypotension, but further monitoring and management are required.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, as evidenced by the need for continued high-dose sedation and mechanical ventilation. The healthcare team is working on weaning the patient off the ventilator gradually.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented with respiratory failure secondary to influenza-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently admitted to the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing fever, worsening infiltrates, and an increase in oxygen requirement, suggesting ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, but developed a rash to cefepime. Aztreonam has been started as an alternative antibiotic. The patient's blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's symptoms of fever, worsening infiltrates, and increased oxygen requirement suggest the development of VAP. This condition is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's history of DM and hyperglycemia may increase the risk of DKA, especially if insulin therapy is inadequate or if there is an underlying infection.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's history of CKD and potential use of nephrotoxic medications (e.g., vancomycin) may predispose him to AKI. Monitoring of renal function and careful fluid management are important in preventing this complication.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with an asthma exacerbation secondary to H1N1 infection. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient developed fevers and possible pneumonia, leading to the initiation of antibiotics. However, he developed a drug rash and the antibiotic cefipime was changed to aztreonam. Oxygenation has improved, with a decrease in the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) from 0.6 to 0.5.

The patient also has hypertension, for which clonidine was started. He is unable to provide his medical history as he is sedated. The patient has multiple allergies, including Augmentin (Oral), Tetracycline, Latex, and Demerol (Injection). His last doses of antibiotics were aztreonam, vancomycin, and Tamiflu.

The patient is receiving various medications in the ICU, including insulin, furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), labetalol, and clonidine. Other medications include sertraline, chlorhexidine, albuterol/atrovent, and prednisone.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the ICU with influenza-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current condition includes hypertension (benign), hyperglycemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), chronic renal failure (CRF), and asthma.

The patient has been tolerating being off paralytics without significant dysynchrony. However, his O2 requirement has increased due to worsening infiltrates and new fever, which is likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The arterial line was stopped at 02:43 AM on 10/28 and restarted at 02:20 AM on the same day. The patient's temperature was recorded at 101.7°F. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/54 mmHg to 197/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus, and his weight is currently 97.4 kg.

The patient has received various medications including insulin, hydromorphone, midazolam, propofol, pantoprazole, labetalol, furosemide, haloperidol, and heparin sodium. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell"

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the ICU due to influenza-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has also been diagnosed with a Gram-negative rod (GNR) pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's medical complications include hypertension, hyperglycemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), chronic renal failure (CRF), asthma, and a latex allergy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has shown worsening infiltrates and a new fever, suggesting the possibility of VAP. Appropriate antibiotics have been started, but close monitoring of sputum cultures and clinical response is necessary.
2. Acute respiratory failure: Although the patient's ARDS is improving, there is still a risk of acute respiratory failure due to worsening lung function or other underlying conditions.
3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's chronic renal failure needs ongoing management and monitoring of renal function.
4. Diabetes mellitus (DM): The patient's blood glucose levels should be closely monitored, especially with the use of steroids, as hyperglycemia can occur.
5. Hypertension: Blood pressure control is essential to prevent complications associated with high blood pressure.
6. Asthma exacerbation: Although currently stable, the patient's history of asthma makes him prone to exacerbations,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with asthma exacerbation secondary to H1N1 infection. He is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes allergies to augmentin, tetracycline, adhesive tape, latex, iodine, and meperidine. His last doses of antibiotics were cefipime, aztreonam, vancomycin, and tamiflu on 10/27/2144.

The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, and cultures have shown growth of gram-negative bacteria. He has been stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but required propofol for hypertension and tachycardia, with improvement in mental status. The patient also requires frequent suctioning due to moderate secretions.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.7°C (101.7°F) and current temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate ranging from 80 to 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/54 to 135/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 97.4 kg, and his height is 65 inches. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 5 mmHg, and fluid balance shows a deficit of 1,502 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by ARDS from H1N1 influenza and likely Gram-negative bacterial (GNR) pneumonia. The patient has been extubated and continues to require high levels of oxygen. He has been given a capella device to help clear secretions. Medications include labetalol for hypertension, pantoprazole, propofol, haloperidol, hydralazine, heparin sodium, and furosemide.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's worsening infiltrates and new fever suggest the possibility of VAP. Antibiotics have been started, but the patient may still be at risk for developing or worsening this condition.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level, which may be due to inadequate fluid intake or excessive fluid losses. Adjustments in tube feedings and fluid administration should be made to address this issue.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and medications have been initiated to manage it. Close monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive therapy will be necessary.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's use of insulin and high blood glucose levels warrant consideration of DKA,"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with influenza-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is currently experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been extubated but still requires 60-100% high-flow oxygen due to secretions. He has been given an acapella device for secretion clearance.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/76 mmHg to 166/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on an aerosol-cool face tent with PSV/SBT ventilation mode. His weight is 97.4 kg, and he has a height of 65 inches.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including insulin, pantoprazole, propofol, haloperidol, hydralazine, heparin sodium, furosemide, augmentin, cefipime, aztreonam, vancomycin, tamiflu, and meropenem. His allergies include rash reactions to augmentin, tetracycline, adhesive tape, latex, iodine, and hives from Demerol.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, lactic acid, and troponin-T. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals delirium, occasional soft speech, a systolic murmur, diffuse inspiratory and expiratory rhonchi, soft abdomen with no tenderness, and no edema with 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.

The patient's medical and family history includes asthma, CKD, DM, and ARDS induced by influenza. His current conditions include respiratory failure due to ARDS with VAP, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.

The healthcare team's plans include weaning off oxygen, discontinuing haloperidol, tapering prednisone, continuous high-dose albuterol nebs with added ipratropium, following up with sputum cultures, holding diuresis due to increased creatinine levels, restarting home lisinopril and diltiazem, and providing ICU care including pulmonary nutrition, glycemic control with insulin, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Overall, the patient is stable on a face tent with PSV/SBT ventilation mode, but still requires high-flow oxygen and has ongoing management of various medical complications such as VAP, ARF, DM, and HTN."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma secondary to H1N1. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and has been extubated yesterday. The patient required facemask oxygen and self-discontinued his arterial line. He also had high blood pressure overnight, which was managed with labetalol drip.

The patient has allergies to augmentin, tetracycline, adhesive tape, latex, iodine, and demerol. His last dose of antibiotics was meropenem on 10/29/2144 at 8:00 AM. The patient is currently taking propofol, haloperidol, hydralazine, furosemide, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.6 C (101.4 F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 125/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is awake but disoriented and agitated. His chest is rhonchorous with wheezing, and he has regular rapid respirations. There are no abnormalities in his abdominal or extremity examinations.

The patient's labs show a white blood cell count of 7.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, sodium of 126 mg/dL, potassium of 1.4 mg/dL, glucose of 147 mg/dL, and creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL. His CXR shows perihilar fullness and improving lower left lobe infiltrate.

The patient's assessment and plan include acute respiratory failure/asthma, potential sources of infection such as line-related infection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), renal function with slightly increased creatinine, and hypertension. The plan involves decreasing prednisone dosage, aiming for tidal volume of 500 ml negative, continuing nebs every four hours, and considering inhaled corticosteroids. The patient will continue on meropenem until sensitivities are available and will have his central line removed with peripheral IV placement. Renal function will be maintained by ensuring euvolemia, and hypertension management will be attempted with oral medications if necessary.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure/Asthma: The patient's asthma exacerbation leading to acute respiratory failure may progress and require reintubation or mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient remains febrile with potential sources of infection including line-related infection or VAP. If an infection occurs, it could lead to worsening respiratory status, organ dysfunction, and sepsis.
3. Renal Function: The patient's creatinine level is slightly increased, indicating potential renal impairment. Further deterioration in renal function may require dialysis or other interventions.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may not be adequately controlled with current management, leading to complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or cardiac issues.
5. Encephalopathy: The patient's disorientation and agitation may indicate ongoing encephalopathy. This could be due to various causes including sepsis, hypoxia, or direct viral effects.
6. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance is positive with an intake of 2,409 mL and output of 2,450 mL"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes who was admitted with influenza-associated ARDS and VAP. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with hypertension, hyperglycemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), chronic renal failure, and asthma. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/95 mmHg to 107/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 57 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and various other ICU medications. He is also receiving nutrition through a pulmonary formula and has been weaned off insulin gtt. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, blood glucose, and troponin-T levels. The patient's kidney function is improving, and he has been stable on non-invasive ventilation. The plan includes maintaining euvolemia, weaning off oxygen as tolerated, tapering prednisone, and conducting sputum cultures. The patient will also need a swallow re-evaluation due to coughing on applesauce.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, which is a common complication in mechanically ventilated patients.
2. Delirium: The patient's mental status is described as less delirious, but he still exhibits some signs of confusion or altered mental state.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobile and critically ill, there is a risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobilization and pressure from bedridden positions can lead to the development of pressure ulcers.
5. Catheter-related bloodstream infections: The patient has multiple lines and catheters, increasing the risk of bloodstream infections.
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction.
7. Nosocomial infections: Being in the ICU, the patient is at an increased risk of acquiring new infections, including hospital-acquired pneumonia or urinary tract infections."

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes who presented with influenza-associated ARDS and VAP. He is currently stable on noninvasive ventilation (NC) and is being weaned off oxygen. The patient has hypertension, hyperglycemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), chronic renal failure, and asthma.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of VAP, which is a common complication in patients on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours.

2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Although the patient's respiratory failure is not classified as ARDS, there is still a risk of developing ARDS due to his underlying conditions and previous influenza infection.

3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen due to factors such as dehydration, medication side effects, or other complications.

4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS): Although the patient's diabetes is currently under control, there is still a risk of developing DKA or HHS due to stress, infection, or inadequate blood sugar management.

5. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's history of asthma increases the risk of asthma exacerbations, especially when exposed to triggers or during periods of stress.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma secondary to H1N1 influenza. He is currently being treated in the ICU for respiratory failure and has been extubated. The patient's oxygenation has improved, allowing him to be weaned to 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. He is also showing improved delirium. 

The patient has multiple allergies including augmentin, tetracycline, adhesive tape, latex, iodine, and demerol. He has received various medications including heparin sodium, ipratropium, albuterol, insulin sliding scale, diltiazem, prednisone, acetaminophen, lactulose, PPI, and sertraline.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 135/86 to 150/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's weight is currently 97.4 kg, with a balance of -891 mL in fluids. 

Physical examination reveals wheezing and rhonchi on the left side of the chest, regular heart rhythm, and no edema in the extremities. Laboratory results indicate normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes, but elevated levels of troponin-T and lactic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient was admitted with influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is currently on a face tent to maintain oxygen saturation above 93%.
- Foley catheter was pulled due to incontinence.
- The patient's mood was negative at 3 pm.
- Prednisone was decreased to 10 mg daily.
- Home Advair was restarted.
- Lasix was given intravenously at 5 pm due to persistent oxygen requirement.
- The patient has allergies to augmentin, tetracycline, adhesive tape, iodine, and demerol.
- Review of systems shows fatigue, cough, wheezing, and no fever, chest pain, edema, or orthopnea.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/89 mmHg to 145/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus rhythm.
- The patient's weight is 97.4 kg, and height is 65 inches.
- Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,463 mL and output of 1,310 mL.
- Respiratory support includes high-flow nebulization and a face tent.
- Physical examination reveals wheezing and no murmurs or edema.
- Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, low potassium, and elevated glucose levels.
- Microbiology reports show gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in pairs.
- Assessment and plan include hypertension, hyperglycemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), CKD, DM, and asthma.
- The patient is on a course of meropenem for VAP, maintaining euvolemia, weaning oxygen as tolerated, and tapering prednisone.
- Plans include f/u sputum cultures, continuing insulin sliding scale, uptitration of antihypertensive medication, and potential transfer to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Respiratory failure due to VAP and ARDS.
2. Renal failure exacerbation due to CKD and potential inadequate fluid management.
3. Hyperglycemia due to DM and stress response.
4. Hypertension that may require further management and titration of antihypertensive medication.
5. Asthma exacerbation due to respiratory infections or stress response.

Please note that these potential complications are based on the provided information and a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's medical history, physical examination findings, and laboratory results is necessary for accurate assessment and management."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma, currently admitted to the ICU due to an exacerbation of asthma secondary to H1N1 infection. The patient was initially on mechanical ventilation but has been successfully extubated on October 28th. The patient's condition has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Gram-negative rods (GNRs), for which meropenem was started. The patient is still experiencing tenuous oxygenation but has shown improvement with gentle diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Asthma/Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to H1N1 infection and asthma exacerbation. This was followed by VAP with GNRs. There is also a concern of mild volume overload.

2. Neuro/MS: The patient may be suffering from critical illness myopathy, which is likely exacerbated by the requirement of paralytics and steroids.

3. DM: The patient's diabetes mellitus is well-controlled with insulin subcutaneous (ISS).

4. HTN: The patient's blood pressure is within a good range, and he is on lisinopril and diltiazem.

Possible Medical Complications that can Arise:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of asthma and current condition suggest a higher risk for respiratory complications such as worsening asthma symptoms, recurrent infections, or exacerbation of underlying lung disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of asthma who is currently being treated in the ICU for an exacerbation of asthma caused by H1N1. The patient has shown improvement in his condition, with decreasing reliance on respiratory support and the ability to tolerate a regular diet.

The patient's 24-hour events include increasing hypoxemia, which was initially managed with high-flow oxygen therapy and subsequently weaned down to nasal cannula. The patient also underwent a SLP evaluation and is now able to eat normally. A Foley catheter was inserted and later removed. The patient's dose of prednisone was decreased to 10 mg daily, and Advair was restarted. The patient received lasix, resulting in good urine output.

The patient has allergies to augmentin, tetracycline, adhesive tape, latex, iodine, and Demerol. His last dose of antibiotics was meropenem.

The patient is receiving several medications, including furosemide (lasix), heparin sodium for prophylaxis, sertraline, diltiazem, lisinopril, ipratropium, albuterol, colace, senna, PPI IV, prednisone, Advair, and heparin SC.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/89 mmH"

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with asthma who is currently in the ICU due to an asthma exacerbation complicated by H1N1 infection. The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and previous episodes of hydronephrosis. 

The patient's current condition shows improvement in oxygenation with gentle diuresis. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure due to the combination of H1N1 infection and asthma exacerbation. There is a possibility of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Gram-negative rods (GNRs).

2. Neuro/MS: The patient may be experiencing critical illness myopathy, which is exacerbated by the requirement of paralytics and steroids. Physical therapy and weaning off steroids will be important in managing this condition.

3. Flank pain: The patient complains of new left-sided kidney pain today, along with a history of hydronephrosis. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of flank pain, including checking urine analysis and urine culture, as well as performing a renal ultrasound.

4. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's diabetes is well-controlled on insulin subcutaneous injections (ISS). Monitoring of blood glucose levels will be essential to maintain glycemic control.

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings are within a good range, and he is on lisinopril and"

   [**10-26**]: sputum with rare GNRs, speciation still pending
   Assessment and Plan
   51yoM with asthma secondary to H1N1; complicated by GNR VAP, extubated
   on [**10-28**]; had tenuous oxygenation overnight, now  improved with gentle
   diuresis.
   1. Asthma/respiratory failure: initially respiratory failure [**12-23**] H1N1
   and asthma exaccerbation, then VAP with GNRs and now likely a component
   of mild volume overload
   - continue meropenem for VAP; still awaiting speciation of GNRs from
   sputum on [**10-26**]
   - advair 500/50 [**Hospital1 **]
   - weaned prednisone to 10mg daily
   - bronchodilators
   - continue goal TBB even to slightly negative
   2. Neuro/MS: suspect critical illness myopathy, exacerbated by
   requirement of paralytics and steroids
   - physical therapy
   - OOB
   - weaning steroids: down to 10 mg today
   3. DM: well-controlled on ISS
   4. HTN: BPs in good range
   - continue lisinopril, diltiazem
   5. Flank pain: c/o new L sided
kidney pain today
, + TTP over L flank.
   Has a h/o hydronephrosis.
   - Check UA, urine culture

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of asthma who is currently in the ICU for an asthma exacerbation secondary to H1N1. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications during his stay.

1. The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to the H1N1 infection and an asthma exacerbation. He then developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Gram-negative rods (GNRs) and was successfully extubated on 10/28. The patient had tenuous oxygenation overnight but has improved with gentle diuresis.

2. The patient is suspected to have critical illness myopathy, which is exacerbated by the requirement of paralytics and steroids. Physical therapy is being provided to the patient, and efforts are being made to wean off steroids.

3. The patient's diabetes mellitus (DM) is well-controlled with insulin sliding scale (ISS).

4. The patient's hypertension (HTN) is being managed with lisinopril and diltiazem, and his blood pressures are in a good range.

5. The patient is experiencing new left-sided kidney pain today, and there is a history of hydronephrosis. Further evaluation, including a urinalysis, urine culture, and renal ultrasound, is recommended.

6. The patient's nutrition is being provided through a regular diet, and his glycemic control is being maintained with ISS.

7. The patient has an 18-g"
