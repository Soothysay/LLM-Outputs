","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder and polysubstance abuse presenting with fevers and hypotension after receiving a propofol injection. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely caused by a contaminated propofol vial. The source of infection is polymicrobial organisms found in blood cultures.

The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring continuous intravenous fluids (IVF) and pressors to maintain blood pressure. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover Gram-negative rods (GNR), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Listeria, and Clostridia.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have shown rapid increases, suggesting acute hepatitis. This could be due to shock liver, baseline liver disease, or alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's liver is enlarged, but there is no RUQ tenderness on examination.

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, for which he is being treated with Prozac, Lamictal, Abilify, and Ritalin. His psychiatric medications will be restarted in the morning if he remains stable overnight.

The patient has a remote history of cocaine and heroin abuse and a history of heavy ethanol use. He recently completed detox in late [Month] 2605. His drinking has significantly decreased in the last two months, and there is no history of withdrawal seizures. He should be monitored for signs of ethanol withdrawal, as his"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder and polysubstance abuse. He presented with fevers and hypotension after receiving propofol injection. The patient has been experiencing increased pressor requirements, continued fevers, and increased oxygen requirements. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of fever, hypotension unresponsive to IV fluid resuscitation, and tachycardia, along with elevated lactate levels and bandemia, suggest acute infection. The source of infection is unclear, but self-injecting medication into leg veins could be a potential source. Contaminated propofol may have caused transient bacteremia. The patient's history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) raises concern for bacterial endocarditis, although no murmur was found on examination. Blood and urine cultures are pending.

2. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have rapidly increased, which may be due to shock liver in the setting of significant hypotension. Baseline liver disease and possible alcoholic hepatitis should also be considered given the patient's history of ethanol abuse. No RUQ tenderness was noted on examination, but the liver is enlarged. Further evaluation with Hep serologies, HIV testing, and repeat RUQ ultrasound is recommended.

","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder and polysubstance abuse. He presented with fevers and hypotension after receiving a propofol injection. The patient's condition has been unstable, with increased pressor requirements, continued fevers, and increased oxygen requirement. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, initially with piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriaxone, and later switched to meropenem. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of fever.

Vital signs show the patient to be febrile with a maximum temperature of 102.0°F (38.9°C) and a current temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C). His blood pressure is fluctuating between 66/39 mmHg and 125/79 mmHg. Heart rate is within normal limits, ranging from 72 to 106 beats per minute. Respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient has an elevated white blood cell count of 21.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 150 K/uL. Liver function tests reveal elevated AST and ALT levels, indicating transaminitis. Other lab results show elevated lactate levels and elevated troponin-T, suggesting possible cardiac involvement.

","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder and polysubstance abuse presenting with fevers and hypotension after receiving a propofol injection. He has been diagnosed with acute hepatitis, a small right pleural effusion, and sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, but it could be related to self-injecting medication into the leg veins or contaminated propofol. He requires oxygen support but has no focal lung exam findings. Blood and urine cultures are pending. There is a concern for bacterial endocarditis, especially given his history of intravenous drug use, but no murmur was found on examination. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable on levophed and will be continued on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. Further plans include maintaining urine output, checking random cortisol levels, repeating cultures if spikes, and considering a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out vegetation if positive blood cultures. 

The patient also has transaminitis, likely due to shock liver or baseline liver disease, as well as possible alcoholic hepatitis given his history of ethanol abuse. No RUQ tenderness was noted on examination. It is recommended to trend liver function tests, check Hep serologies and HIV status, and perform a RUQ ultrasound.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse and bipolar disorder. He presented to the hospital with sepsis after self-injecting propofol that he obtained from a friend who works as a vet tech.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C (102°F), blood pressure ranging from 81/39 mmHg to 102/42 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. His mixed venous oxygen saturation is 79-80%. The patient is receiving norepinephrine infusion at a rate of 0.07 mcg/kg/min and has been on various antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and meropenem.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, trace lower extremity edema, and candidiasis. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and abnormal kidney function tests.

The assessment and plan include:
1) Sepsis - bacteremia from injection or possible contaminated propofol. Currently on Levophloxacin, central venous pressure at goal, and will try to lower pressor to goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) 60. Follow-up outside culture data. Check mixed venous oxygen saturation/lactate levels. Continue Vanc/meropenem course pending culture results.
2) Liver function tests - check right upper quadrant ultrasound, hepatic serologies, HIV, and serial exams.
3) Anemia - trend, check iron studies, guaiac.
4) Bipolar disorder - hold psych meds, consider restarting when sepsis resolves.
5) Polysubstance abuse - social work consult follow for signs of withdrawal.
6) Fluid/Electrolyte management - continue diet.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1) Infection: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, and there is a possibility of further infections due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of candidiasis.
2) Liver dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes suggest possible liver damage, which can be caused by various factors such as the infection or previous substance abuse.
3) Renal dysfunction: The abnormal kidney function tests indicate possible kidney impairment, which can be related to sepsis or other underlying conditions.
4) Coagulopathy: The prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) suggest a coagulation disorder, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
5) Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and need for vasopressor support indicate cardiovascular instability, which may require close monitoring and adjustment of treatment.
6) Psychiatric issues: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, and it is mentioned that psychotropic medications will be held during this acute illness. It is important to consider the psychiatric aspect and plan for appropriate management when the patient's condition stabilizes."

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse and bipolar disorder. He presented to the hospital with sepsis after self-injecting propofol obtained from a friend. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, possibly due to contaminated propofol or injection-related infection. He is currently on multiple antibiotics and being treated for sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteria in the blood can lead to various complications such as septic shock, organ failure, and spread of infection to other parts of the body.
2. Sepsis: The patient is already showing signs of sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not properly managed. This can result in organ dysfunction, decreased blood pressure, and impaired tissue perfusion.
3. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated levels of ALT and AST, indicating potential liver damage. This could be due to sepsis or direct toxicity from the propofol injection. Monitoring liver enzymes and considering further investigations like ultrasound and serological tests would be appropriate.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level suggests anemia. It is important to determine the cause, whether it is dilutional anemia due to fluid administration or another underlying cause. Iron studies and a guaiac test should be considered to identify the cause.
5. Bipolar Disorder: The patient's bipolar"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse and bipolar disorder. He was admitted to the ICU with sepsis after self-injecting with propofol that he obtained from a friend who works as a vet tech. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, and Meropenem.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.9°C (102°F)
- Heart rate: 85 bpm (normal range 72-106 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 102/42 mmHg (low), with readings ranging from 81/39 mmHg to 123/79 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (normal range 7-31 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, trace lower extremity edema, and a central line infection (CDI). The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and abnormal kidney function (creatinine).

The assessment and plan include treating the patient's sepsis with continued antibiotic therapy, monitoring liver function tests, addressing anemia, bipolar disorder, polysubstance abuse, and providing nutritional"

   Assessment and Plan
   31 y/o M with PMH of bipolar d/o and polysubstance abuse who presents
   with sepsis after intraveneous propfol injection.
   .
   # Sepsis: Likely source is propofol self injection from non-sterile
   vial.  Polymicrobial organisms in gram stain from OSH blood cultures.
   Cultures here negative to date.  Have curbsided ID, awaiting final
   recs.
   - Cont. prn IVF boluses to maintain UOP> 100cc/hour, CVP 8-12
   - Wean off pressors
   - Cont. broad-spectrum abx coverage with vanc, meropenem per ID
   curbside to cover for GNR, MRSA, Listeria, Clostridia
   - f/u culture data from OSH and here
   - CXR, repeat in am
   - consider TTE to r/o vegetation if persistently positive blood
   cultures
   - Random cortisol WNL
   - Wife to bring in propofol bottle for culture to further confirm
   source
   -re-site line
   # Transaminitis: LFTs rapidly increased from OSH.  Most likely shock
   liver in setting of significant hypotension.  Must also consider
   baseline liver disease  and possible alcoholic hepatitis given h/o EtOH
   abuse.  No RUQ tenderness on exam but liver is enlarged.
   - cont. to trend LFTs
   - check Hep serologies and HIV given h/o IVDU, pending
   # Bipolar disorder: treated with prozac, lamictal, abilify and ritalin.
   - Restart in am if stable overnight
   # Polysubstance abuse: pt. has remote history of cocaine and heroin
   abuse.  Also has a h/o heavy EtOH use, had recent detox in late [**Month (only) 2605**].
   Per pts. wife his drinking is significantly less in the last 2 months.
   No h/o withdrawl seizures.
   - monitor for signs of EtOH withdrawl, last drink ~36 hours PTA and
   ethanol level neg. at OSH
   - SW consult

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a medical history of bipolar disorder and polysubstance abuse. He presents with sepsis after injecting intravenous propofol from a non-sterile vial. Cultures are negative to date. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being closely monitored for any changes in his condition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's injection of propofol from a non-sterile vial has led to sepsis. It is important to continue monitoring his vital signs and providing appropriate antibiotic treatment.
2. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests have rapidly increased, indicating possible shock liver or baseline liver disease. Further evaluation of liver enzymes and serologies should be done to determine the exact cause.
3. Bipolar disorder: The patient is on medication for bipolar disorder, but his mental health status should be regularly assessed and medications adjusted as necessary.
4. Polysubstance abuse: The patient has a history of substance abuse, including cocaine, heroin, and heavy alcohol use. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal and providing appropriate support and counseling is important.
5. Enlarged liver: The patient's liver is enlarged, which may indicate liver disease or alcoholic hepatitis. Further investigation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.
6. Respiratory support: The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, and his ABG results indicate a respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a medical history of bipolar disorder and polysubstance abuse. He presents with sepsis after injecting propofol. The likely source of infection is contaminated propofol. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which will be narrowed down based on culture results. The patient also has a new pleural effusion, which needs to be evaluated further. His liver function tests are abnormal, indicating possible shock liver. The patient's bipolar disorder medications will be restarted once he is stable. He has a history of substance abuse and recent detoxification from alcohol. Ethanol levels were negative at the time of admission. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently on pressors for blood pressure support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a suspected contaminated propofol injection leading to sepsis. It is crucial to continue monitoring his vital signs and respond promptly to any signs of deterioration.
2. Pleural Effusion: The new pleural effusion could be due to empyema or a parapneumonic effusion. A thoracentesis with ultrasound guidance will be performed to evaluate and manage the effusion appropriately.
3. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, indicating possible shock liver. Monitoring liver enzymes and assessing for any signs of liver dysfunction is important.

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder and substance abuse. He presented with sepsis after injecting propofol from a non-sterile vial. Cultures have been negative to date, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started as per ID consultation. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires ongoing IV fluids, weaning off pressors, and monitoring of culture data. A repeat chest X-ray is planned, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) may be considered to rule out vegetation if persistent positive blood cultures occur. The patient's liver function tests have rapidly increased, which could be due to shock liver or potential alcoholic hepatitis. His bipolar disorder medications will be restarted in the morning if stable overnight. The patient has a history of polysubstance abuse, including cocaine, heroin, and heavy alcohol use, with recent detox in late 2005. No history of withdrawal seizures is reported. The patient's wife will be contacted to bring in the propofol bottle for culture confirmation. The patient is currently on heparin sodium prophylaxis and has an 18-gauge line placed on 08/13/2143."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient's history, physical examination, and vital signs are documented. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Ceftriaxone, Meropenem, and Vancomycin. He is also on Heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and his ABG results indicate a respiratory acidosis. The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse macropapular rash and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's chief complaint is sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. If not managed properly, it can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Antibiotic Resistance: The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics. Overuse or inappropriate use of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making it difficult to treat the infection effectively.
3. Drug Allergies: Although the patient has no known drug allergies, there is always a risk of developing allergic reactions to medications. Monitoring for any signs of allergic reactions is important.
4. Thrombocytopen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of resolving sepsis following self-injection with contaminated propofol.
- He is currently in the ICU with ongoing monitoring and treatment.
- The patient has shown improvement in his hemodynamic stability, as he has been off pressors for 18 hours and has good urine output.
- He is still experiencing low-grade fevers and has developed a rash.
- There is a right effusion that evolved after receiving a significant amount of intravenous fluids (IVF).
- Initial blood cultures and the propofol bottle culture are pending.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated liver enzymes.
- His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium.
- The patient's blood cultures and the gram stain of the right effusion fluid will be sent for further analysis.
- The patient's condition is stable, and he is ready for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent infection: Despite the improvement in the patient's condition, he still has persistent low-grade fevers and a rash. These symptoms may indicate an ongoing infection that needs to be investigated and treated promptly.
2. Right effusion: The development of a right effusion could be a sign of a localized infection or inflammation. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Liver enzyme abnormalities: The elevated liver enzymes ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse and bipolar disorder. He presented to the hospital with sepsis after self-injecting propofol that he obtained from a friend who works as a vet tech. The patient had new pleural effusions, and blood cultures were sent. He received multiple antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, meropenem, and vancomycin. The patient was also on heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

Vital signs showed a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), blood pressure ranging from 108/55 mmHg to 132/72 mmHg, heart rate between 85 and 86 bpm, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm was sinus rhythm, and central venous pressure was within normal range. Fluid balance showed an intake of 2,647 mL, output of 1,080 mL, and a negative balance of -473 mL. 

Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds on the right base with bronchial breath sounds, regular rate and rhythm, and trace lower extremity edema. Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, mildly decreased platelet count, and normal liver function tests. Other lab values were within normal range"
