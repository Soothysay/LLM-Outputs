   CXR from today: my read: peri-hilar fullness, bibasilar atelectasis.
   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo M with multiple CAD risk factors admitted for elective cardiac
   cath for symptoms of unstable angina. Transferred to CCU for
   peri-operative delerium.
   .
   # Delerium: Patient exhibited symptoms of delerium yesterday, including
   difficulty concentration, likely multifactorial, in the setting of
   medication effect (likely [**2-19**] benzodiazapines given peri-procedure),
   especially given stage IV chronic kidney disease and decreased
   medication clearance, age, in the setting of procedures, and lack of
   sleep. Neuro exam non-focal, so unlikely patient had thrombo-embolic
   event/CVA. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed (no evidence of
   hypotension or hematocrit drop). Change in mental status too acute to
   be infectious in nature.  Currently patient is sleeping, difficult to
   arouse but does wake up briefly before falling asleep again.
   - NPO for now
   - continue wrist restraints
   - IV zyprexa prn for agitation
   - hold all benzos, anticholinergics
   - no head imaging required at this time
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including HTN,
   HLD, and CKD. 2VD on cardiac cath yesterday, including 3 tight LAD
   lesions and LCx lesions. 2 tight LAD lesions were intervened on, but
   not the third LAD lesion and the LCx lesion.  CK significantly elevated
   this AM, 152 to 860.
   - continue low dose ASA, high dose statin, metoprolol, can d/c plavix
   after a few days
   - d/c integrilin given pt
s stage IV CKD
   - hold off on lisinopril today given acute on chronic renal failure
   - Consider optimize medical treatment by adding imdur if having
   persistent chest pain
   - continue IV cefazolin x3 doses post-cath
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: K was 5.2 on admission, 5.9 this AM.  Not getting
   medications that increase K. ACEI has been held.  Could be secondary to
   chronic kidney disease.  EKG showed no changes.  Patient was given
   insulin, D5, kayexalate PR this AM.
   - continue to trend, get pm lytes
   - monitor glucose with insulin on board in the setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure
   .
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Stage IV CKD, w/ Cre clearance of 23.
   Received pre-cath hydration and IV mucomyst before and after
   catherization, but creatinine still bumped from 2.1 to 2.4, concerning
   for contrast-induced nephropathy complicating CKD.  Expect to see
   worsening renal function in the next 24-48h.
   - renally dose meds
   - get pm lytes
   - monitor for acidosis
   .
   # PUMP: Right heart catherization shows elevated LVEDP, PCWPs, and PA
   pressures.  TTE from [**6-26**] showed LVEF 50-55%, but nuclear stress test
   in [**7-26**] showed LV function slightly decreased with EF of 46% and
   global hypokinesis. Patient received NS and bicarb prior to cath, s/p
   20mg IV lasix in the cath lab post-cath with I/O overall negative by
   midnight per nursing.  CXR consistent with heart failure.
   - no lasix today as pt appears euvolemic, creatinine bumped, and AS
   patients are pre-load dependent
   - continue metoprolol
   - hold off on lisinopril today given acute on chronic renal failure
   - strict I/Os
   - daily weight
   .
   # Moderate AS: Patient with echo finding of aortic valve area of
   1.0cm2. Chest pain is likely from ACS, not from AS.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - hold lisinopril given acute on chronic renal failure
   - Since patient is currently asymptomatic from moderate AS, would hold
   off on Csurg consult
   - avoid nitroglycerin given pre-load dependence from AS
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient had sinus tachycardia on EKG on transfer to CCU,
   likely in setting of delerium, discomfort s/p procedures.  Patient was
   given metoprolol for tachycardia yesterday, he responded well to
   metoprolol.
   - continue metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus: hold all home hypoglycemics while in-house,
   especially in setting of recent contrast load.

","The patient is an 89-year-old male with multiple coronary artery disease risk factors who was admitted for elective cardiac catheterization due to symptoms of unstable angina. He was transferred to the CCU for peri-operative delirium.

During the overnight period, the patient continued to be agitated, but eventually fell asleep at around 4am. He has no known drug allergies and received a last dose of antibiotics on [**2182-1-24**] at 10:00 PM.

The patient's current medications include Eptifibatide (Integrilin) at 1 mcg/kg/min, Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) started on [**2182-1-24**] at 08:00 PM, and Metoprolol started on [**2182-1-25**] at 04:05 AM.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tmax: 37째C (98.6째F), Tcurrent: 37째C (98.6째F), HR: 87 bpm (78-112 bpm), BP: 121/58 mmHg (73-156/86-97 mmHg), RR: 23 breaths per minute (15-31 breaths per minute), SpO2: 91%, and heart rhythm is Sinus Rhythm.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a total in of 1,533 mL, total out of 520 mL, IVF of 1,353 mL, and balance of 1,013 mL. Respiratory support includes an O2 delivery device of nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 91%. The patient's ABG results are pending.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is sleeping and difficult to arouse with sternal rub but did wake up briefly before falling asleep again. The neck is supple with a JVP of 6 cm. The cardiac examination shows a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2. There is a 2/6 systolic murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border. No thrills, lifts, S3, or S4 are present. Lung examination is clear to auscultation bilaterally. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended without hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Peripheral pulses are 2+ bilaterally. Skin examination is unremarkable. Neurologic examination is non-focal.

Laboratory results show WBC count of 9.6, Hct of 30.9, Plt of 247,000/mm3, Cr of 2.1, Glucose of 211 mg/dL, and other labs as listed. The patient's CXR from today shows peri-hilar fullness and bibasilar atelect"

He exhibits symptoms of delirium, including difficulty concentrating, likely in the setting of medication effect (likely benzodiazepines given peri-procedure), especially given his decreased medication clearance. His neuro exam is non-focal, so it is unlikely that he had a thrombo-embolic event or CVA. There is no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed. The change in mental status is too acute to be infectious in nature.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37째C (98.6째F), heart rate of 87 bpm (78-112 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 121/58 mmHg to 156/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute (15-31 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 91% on nasal cannula. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine level, and potassium level. Other lab values are within normal range.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo M with multiple CAD risk factors admitted for elective cardiac
   cath for symptoms of unstable angina. Transferred to CCU for
   peri-operative delerium.
   .
   # Delerium: Patient exhibited symptoms of delerium yesterday, including
   difficulty concentration, likely in the setting of medication effect
   (likely [**2-19**] benzodiazapines given peri-procedure), especially given
   stage IV chronic kidney disease and decreased medication clearance.
   Neuro exam non-focal, so unlikely patient had thrombo-embolic
   event/CVA. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed (no evidence of
   hypotension or hematocrit drop). Change in mental status too acute to
   be infectious in nature.  Currently patient is sleeping, difficult to
   arouse but does wake up briefly before falling asleep again.
   - NPO for now
   - continue wrist restraints
   - IV zyprexa prn for agitation
   - hold all benzos, anticholinergics
   - tylenol standing for pain
   - no head imaging required at this time
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including HTN,
   HLD, and CKD. 2VD on cardiac cath yesterday, including 3 tight LAD
   lesions and LCx lesions. 2 tight LAD lesions were intervened on, but
   not the third LAD lesion and the LCx lesion.  CK significantly elevated
   this AM, 152 to 860.
   - continue full dose ASA, plavix, high dose statin, metoprolol
   - can restart lisinopril today
   - Consider take pt back to cath lab if having persistent chest pain, or
   optimize medical treatment by adding imdur
   - continue IV cefazolin x3 doses post-cath
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: K was 5.2 on admission, 5.9 this AM.  Not getting
   medications that increase K. ACEI has been held.  Could be secondary to
   chronic kidney disease.  EKG showed no changes.  Patient was given
   insulin, D5, kayexalate this AM.
   - continue to trend, get pm lytes
   .
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Stage IV CKD, w/ Cre clearance of 23.
   Received pre-cath hydration and IV mucomyst before and after
   catherization, but creatinine still bumped from 2.1 to 2.4, concerning
   for contrast-induced nephropathy complicating CKD.
   - renally dose meds
   - get pm lytes
   .
   # PUMP: Right heart catherization shows elevated LVEDP, PCWPs, and PA
   pressures.  TTE from [**6-26**] showed LVEF 50-55%, but nuclear stress test
   in [**7-26**] showed LV function slightly decreased with EF of 46% and
   global hypokinesis. Patient received NS and bicarb prior to cath, s/p
   20mg IV lasix in the cath lab post-cath with I/O overall negative by
   midnight per nursing.  Appears euvolemic currently.
   - no lasix today as pt appears euvolemic, creatinine bumped, and AS
   patients are pre-load dependent
   - continue metoprolol
   - restart lisinopril
   - strict I/Os
   - daily weight
   .
   # Moderate AS: Patient with echo finding of aortic valve area of
   1.0cm2. Chest pain is likely from ACS, not from AS.
   - restart lisinopril today
   - Since patient is currently asymptomatic from moderate AS, would hold
   off on Csurg consult
   - avoid nitroglycerin given pre-load dependence from AS
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient had  sinus tachycardia on EKG on transfer to CCU,
   likely in setting of delerium, discomfort s/p procedures.  Patient was
   given metoprolol for tachycardia yesterday, he responded well to
   metoprolol.
   - continue metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus: hold all home hypoglycemics while in-house,
   especially in setting of recent contrast load.
   - RISS

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 89-year-old male with multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors admitted for an elective cardiac catheterization due to symptoms of unstable angina. He was transferred to the CCU for peri-operative delirium. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (stage IV), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 91% on nasal cannula, and temperature within normal range.

Physical examination findings are as follows: general appearance of sleeping and difficult to arouse, supple neck with jugular venous distention of 6 cm, normal cardiac exam with no murmurs, lifts, or thrills, clear lungs, soft abdomen without tenderness, and no peripheral edema or extremity abnormalities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased hematocrit, creatinine, and potassium levels. Electrolyte imbalances are noted, including hyperkalemia and hypomagnesemia. Other lab values such as blood urea nitrogen, glucose, and C-reactive protein are also elevated.

The patient's assessment and plan include several issues. Firstly, delirium is noted, likely due to medication effects, especially considering the patient's stage IV chronic"

The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for potassium, which is slightly elevated.

Assessment and plan include:

1. Delirium: The patient exhibits symptoms of delirium, likely due to medication effect, especially given his stage IV chronic kidney disease and decreased medication clearance. Neurological examination is non-focal, so a thrombo-embolic event or stroke is unlikely."

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo M with multiple CAD risk factors admitted for elective cardiac
   cath for symptoms of unstable angina. Transferred to CCU for
   peri-operative delerium.
   .
   # Delerium: Patient exhibits symptoms of delerium including difficulty
   concentration, likely in the setting of medication effect (likely [**2-19**]
   benzodiazapines given peri-procedure), especially given stage IV
   chronic kidney disease and decreased medication clearance. Neuro exam
   non-focal, so unlikely patient had thrombo-embolic event/CVA. No
   evidence of retroperitoneal bleed (no evidence of hypotension or
   hematocrit drop). Change in mental status too acute to be infectious in
   nature.
   - NPO for now
   - continue wrist restraints
   - IV zyprexa prn for agitation
   - hold all benzos, anticholinergics
   - tylenol standing for pain
   - no head imaging required at this time
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including HTN,
   HLD, and CKD. 2VD on cardiac cath yesterday, including 3 tight LAD
   lesions and LCx lesions. 2 tight LAD lesions were intervened on, but
   not the third LAD lesion and the LCx lesion.  CK significantly elevated
   this AM, 152 to 860.
   - continue full dose ASA, plavix, high dose statin, metoprolol
   - can restart lisinopril today
   - Consider take pt back to cath lab if having persistent chest pain, or
   optimize medical treatment by adding ACEI and imdur
   - continue IV cefazolin x3 doses post-cath
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: K was 5.2 on admission, 5.9 this AM.  Not getting
   medications that increase K. ACEI has been held.  Could be secondary to
   chronic kidney disease.
   - EKG this morning
   - give insulin, D5, kayexalate
   - continue to trend
   .
   # PUMP: Right heart catherization shows elevated LVEDP, PCWPs, and PA
   pressures.  TTE from [**6-26**] showed LVEF 50-55%, but nuclear stress test
   in [**7-26**] showed LV function slightly decreased with EF of 46% and
   global hypokinesis. Patient received NS and bicarb prior to cath, s/p
   20mg IV lasix in the cath lab post-cath with I/O overall negative by
   midnight per nursing.
   - hold nitroglycerin given pre-load dependence from AS
   - continue metoprolol
   - restart lisinopril
   - strict I/Os, keep even today as AS patients are pre-load dependent
   - daily weight
   .
   # Moderate AS: Patient with echo finding of aortic valve area of
   1.0cm2. Chest pain is likely from ACS, not from AS.
   - restart lisinopril today
   - Since patient is currently asymptomatic from moderate AS, would hold
   off on Csurg consult
   - avoid nitroglycerin given pre-load dependence from AS
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient with sinus tachycardia on EKG on transfer to CCU,
   likely in setting of delerium, discomfort s/p procedures.  Patient was
   given metoprolol for tachycardia yesterday.
   - continue metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus: hold all home hypoglycemics while in-house,
   especially in setting of recent contrast load.
   - RISS
   .
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Stage IV CKD, w/ Cre clearance of 23.
   Received pre-cath hydration and IV mucomyst before and after
   catherization.
   - renally dose meds
   - trend Cre daily
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 30.  Currently hct is at baseline
   - trend Hct
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now, will start cardiac healthy, diabetic, renal
   diet once delirium resolves

","The patient is an 89-year-old male with multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors, admitted for elective cardiac catheterization due to symptoms of unstable angina. He was transferred to the CCU for perioperative delirium. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 121/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 91% on nasal cannula. His ABG results show pH 7.17, which indicates acidosis. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a supple neck with jugular venous distention of 8 cm, normal cardiac exam, clear lung fields, soft abdomen with no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness, and no peripheral edema or femoral bruits. His neurologic exam is nonfocal, but he is agitated. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and lactate levels. His potassium level is slightly elevated at 5.3 mEq/L, and his magnesium level is low at 2.1 mg/dL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and glucose levels are also elevated. 

The patient has a history of multiple coronary artery disease risk factors, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He underwent cardiac catheterization yesterday and had two tight lesions in the left anterior descending artery (LAD)"
