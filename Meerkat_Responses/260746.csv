   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10073**] is a 69 yo woman with ESRD/HD secondary to DM and HTN, ? CHF,
   afib, hx of TIA, presented to ED after syncopal episode.  In ED found
   to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic TdP.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Syncope is due to TdP.  QT prolongation and TdP of unclear
   etiology. Could be medication-induced. Unlikely congenital QT given
   patient age and lack of syncope hx prior to 2 wks ago. Currently in NSR
   with runs of v-tach, has hx of a-fib.
   - will hold Celexa and benzodiazepines
   - continue potassium and magnesium repletion to K=4.5-5.0, Mg>2.5
   - consider isoproterenol and temp pacing if bradycardic or TdP recurs
   - will hold coumadin for a-fib due to supratherapeutic INR (4.6)
   - keep on cardiac monitor
   - repeat EKG in AM to monitor prolonged QTc
   .
   # PUMP:  Unclear history of heart failure. Last TTE and TEE done 3 yrs
   ago (unclear whether any valvular disease was present). Hypotension [**2-29**]
   dehydration or overdiuresis during HD is possible (baseline SBP around
   100) c/w sx of lightheadedness.
   - will get TTE this AM
   - hold CCB due to hypotension
   - daily weights, I/O's
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Trop-T elevated at 2.82 this afternoon compared to 0.20
   in the morning. CK also elevated at 561. Enzyme elevations could be due
   to ischemia from torsades vs. ACS. No ST elevation/depressions on EKG.
   Patient denies any chest pain.  Dobutamine stress test in [**2111-7-28**] was
   normal per pt, but coronary status is unknown.
   - continue to cycle CE
   - consider repeat dobutamin stress test vs. left-heart cath if WMA on
   TTE
   - continue ASA 325 mg
   - continue simvastatin 40 mg
   - supratherap INR
   .
   # ESRD: Patient is on M/W/F dialysis via AV graft. Has been oliguric,
   creatinine 5.5, electrolytes stable.
   - will monitor electrolytes, BUN, Cr to trend renal function
   - consult Nephrology for HD today (M/W/F schedule)
   - continue PhosLo and renal vitamins
   .
   # R femoral hematoma
   - will give vitamin K 1g IV
   - recheck PT/INR in AM
   - pressure dressings
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - will check TSH, results pending
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .
   # DM2: not on any insulin or oral hypoglycemics at home.
   Well-controlled, BS<200s at home.
   - sliding-scale insulin for glycemic control

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 10073] is a 69-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN), uncertain coronary artery disease (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and transient ischemic attack (TIA). She presented to the emergency department after experiencing a syncopal episode. In the emergency department, she was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic torsades de pointes (TdP). The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm with runs of ventricular tachycardia and has a history of afib. She is being held on citalopram and benzodiazepines. Her potassium and magnesium levels are being repleted to maintain a range of 4.5-5.0 and >2.5, respectively. Isoproterenol and temporary pacing may be considered if bradycardia or TdP recurs. Coumadin is being held due to supratherapeutic INR (4.6) related to afib. The patient will be kept on a cardiac monitor, and a repeat EKG will be performed in the morning to monitor prolonged QTc.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension, with possible congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and transient ischemic attack. She presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode and was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP). 

The patient's current assessment includes:

1. Rhythm: Syncope is due to TdP. The prolonged QTc and TdP are of unclear etiology, possibly medication-induced. Unlikely congenital QT given the patient's age and lack of prior syncope history. Currently in normal sinus rhythm with runs of ventricular tachycardia, with a history of atrial fibrillation. Hold Celexa and benzodiazepines.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10073**] is a 69 yo woman with ESRD/HD secondary to DM and HTN, ? CHF,
   afib, hx of TIA, presented to ED after syncopal episode.  In ED found
   to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic TdP.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Syncope is due to TdP.  QT prolongation and TdP of unclear
   etiology. Could be medication-induced. Unlikely congenital QT given
   patient age and lack of syncope hx prior to 2 wks ago. Currently in NSR
   with runs of v-tach, has hx of a-fib. Pt w/ two brief episodes of TdP
   that self resolved, overnight.
   - will hold Celexa and benzodiazepines
   - continue potassium and magnesium repletion to K=4.5-5.0, Mg>2.5
   - consider isoproterenol and temp pacing if bradycardic or TdP recurs
   - will hold coumadin for a-fib due to supratherapeutic INR (4.6)
   - keep on cardiac monitor
   - repeat EKG in AM to monitor prolonged QTc
   .
   # PUMP:  Unclear history of heart failure. Last TTE and TEE done 3 yrs
   ago (unclear whether any valvular disease was present). Hypotension [**2-29**]
   dehydration or overdiuresis during HD is possible (baseline SBP around
   100) c/w sx of lightheadedness.
   - will get TTE this AM
   - hold CCB due to hypotension
   - daily weights, I/O's
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Trop-T elevated at 2.82 this afternoon compared to 0.20
   in the morning. CK also elevated at 561. Enzyme elevations could be due
   to ischemia from torsades vs. ACS. No ST elevation/depressions on EKG.
   Patient denies any chest pain.  Dobutamine stress test in [**2111-7-28**] was
   normal per pt, but coronary status is unknown.
   - continue to cycle CE (Peak Trop is 4.5, Peak CK 1044)
   - Pt likely to go for cath on Monday
   - continue ASA 325 mg
   - continue simvastatin 40 mg
   - supratherap INR
   .
   # ESRD: Patient is on M/W/F dialysis via AV graft. Has been oliguric,
   creatinine 5.5, electrolytes stable.
   - will monitor electrolytes, BUN, Cr to trend renal function
   - consult Nephrology for HD today (M/W/F schedule)
   - continue PhosLo and renal vitamins
   .
   # R femoral hematoma
   - will give vitamin K 1g IV
   - recheck PT/INR in AM
   - pressure dressings
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - TSH 1.0
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .
   # DM2: not on any insulin or oral hypoglycemics at home.
   Well-controlled, BS<200s at home.
   - sliding-scale insulin for glycemic control
   .
   FEN: renal, cardiac prudent, diabetic diet. NPO p MN for TTE
   - will replete K+ PRN
   - also will replete Mg+ as above
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's, R femoral line, AV graft in L arm
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherap INR
   -Pain management not necessary currently

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and possible congestive heart failure (CHF). She presented to the emergency department after a syncopal episode and was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP). The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm but has a history of atrial fibrillation. She also has a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), and her renal function is stable on maintenance hemodialysis.

Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) characteristics. There are elevated cardiac enzymes (Trop-T, CK) and extensive anterior, septal, and apical akinesis on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) with episodes of TdP.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She is on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week via an arteriovenous graft.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism with a TSH level of 1.0.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is currently without complaints and denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or groin pain. The patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%. There was extensive anterior, septal, and apical akinesis, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and mild mitral regurgitation. Additionally, the patient had moderate aortic stenosis, mild-moderate aortic regurgitation, and increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The patient also had a right femoral line hematoma but it has stopped bleeding after receiving vitamin K. The plan is to implant an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) once the international normalized ratio (INR) normalizes.

The patient experienced desats to the high 80s on room air overnight and had brief episodes of torsades de pointes, which self-resolved. The patient also reported back and shoulder pain, and an electrocardiogram (EKG) was obtained, showing signs of resolving myocardial infarction (MI). Cardiology was notified, and the plan is for the patient to undergo a non-emergent cardiac catheterization on Monday.

 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, NON-SUSTAINED (NSVT)
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10073**] is a 69 yo woman with ESRD/HD secondary to DM and HTN, ? CHF,
   afib, hx of TIA, presented to ED after syncopal episode.  In ED found
   to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic TdP.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Syncope is due to TdP.  QT prolongation and TdP of unclear
   etiology. Could be medication-induced. Unlikely congenital QT given
   patient age and lack of syncope hx prior to 2 wks ago. Currently in NSR
   with runs of v-tach, has hx of a-fib. Pt w/ two brief episodes of TdP
   that self resolved, overnight.
   - will hold Celexa and benzodiazepines
   - continue potassium and magnesium repletion to K=4.5-5.0, Mg>2.5
   - consider isoproterenol and temp pacing if bradycardic or TdP recurs
   - will hold coumadin for a-fib due to supratherapeutic INR (4.6)
   - keep on cardiac monitor
   - repeat EKG in AM to monitor prolonged QTc
   - ICD placement after left heart cath on Monday, [**2112-10-17**]
   .
   # PUMP:  Unclear history of heart failure. Last TTE and TEE done 3 yrs
   ago (unclear whether any valvular disease was present). Hypotension [**2-29**]
   dehydration or overdiuresis during HD is possible (baseline SBP around
   100) c/w sx of lightheadedness.
   - hold CCB due to hypotension
   - daily weights, I/O's
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Trop-T elevated at 2.82 this afternoon compared to 0.20
   in the morning. CK also elevated at 561. Enzyme elevations could be due
   to ischemia from torsades vs. ACS. No ST elevation/depressions on EKG.
   Patient denies any chest pain.  Dobutamine stress test in [**2111-7-28**] was
   normal per pt, but coronary status is unknown.
   - continue to cycle CE (Peak Trop is 4.5, Peak CK 1044)
   - Pt likely to go for cath on Monday
   - continue ASA 325 mg
   - continue simvastatin 40 mg
   - supratherap INR
   - repeat ECG if shoulder pain recurs
   .
   # ESRD: Patient is on M/W/F dialysis via AV graft. Has been oliguric,
   creatinine 5.5, electrolytes stable.
   - will monitor electrolytes, BUN, Cr to trend renal function
   - consult Nephrology for HD today (M/W/F schedule)
   - continue PhosLo and renal vitamins
   .
   # R femoral hematoma
   - will give vitamin K 1g IV
   - recheck PT/INR in AM
   - pressure dressings
   - will remove fem line today
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - TSH 1.0
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .
   # DM2: not on any insulin or oral hypoglycemics at home.
   Well-controlled, BS<200s at home.
   - sliding-scale insulin for glycemic control
   .
   FEN: renal, cardiac prudent, diabetic diet. NPO p MN for TTE
   - will replete K+ PRN
   - also will replete Mg+ as above
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's, R femoral line, AV graft in L arm
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherap INR
   -Pain management not necessary currently
   -Bowel regimen with docusate/senna

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN), as well as other comorbidities such as myocardial infarction (MI), atrial fibrillation (afib), transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hypothyroidism.

The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) after experiencing a syncopal episode. In the ED, she was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic torsades de pointes (TdP). She has also had two brief episodes of TdP that self-resolved overnight. The cause of the QT prolongation and TdP is unclear, but it could be medication-induced. The patient's current rhythm is normal sinus rhythm (NSR) with runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT), and she has a history of afib.

The plan for the patient includes holding citalopram (Celexa) and benzodiazepines, continuing potassium and magnesium repletion, considering isoproterenol and temporary pacing if bradycardic or TdP recurs, holding warfarin (Coumadin) for afib due to supratherapeutic INR, keeping her on a cardiac monitor, repeating an EKG in the morning to monitor prolonged QTc, and placing an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and unclear history of congestive heart failure (CHF). She presented to the emergency department after experiencing a syncopal episode and was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP). She also has a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and transient ischemic attack (TIA).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Myocardial Infarction, Acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes (Trop-T and CK) indicating possible myocardial injury. Further evaluation with coronary catheterization is planned.
2. Renal Failure, End Stage (ESRD): The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week via an arteriovenous graft. Her renal function is stable, but electrolyte imbalances need to be monitored.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia, Non-Sustained (NSVT): The patient has had episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Continuous cardiac monitoring is recommended, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement is planned.
4. Prolonged QT Interval: The patient's QT interval is prolonged, and she has experienced episodes of TdP. Medications that prolong the QT interval should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and unclear history of congestive heart failure (CHF). She presented to the emergency department after experiencing a syncopal episode and was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP). She also has a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and transient ischemic attack (TIA). The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm but has had runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Myocardial Infarction, Acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): The patient's elevated troponin T levels suggest ongoing myocardial ischemia. She is likely to undergo coronary catheterization on Monday.
2. Renal Failure, End Stage (ESRD): The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) three times a week via an arteriovenous graft. Her creatinine level is 5.5, and electrolytes are stable. Nephrology consultation is planned for dialysis scheduling.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia, Non-Sustained (NSVT): The patient has had episodes of NSVT, which may be related to her underlying cardiac conditions.
4. QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes: The patient's QT interval is prolonged"

 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, NON-SUSTAINED (NSVT)
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10073**] is a 69 yo woman with ESRD/HD secondary to DM and HTN, ? CHF,
   afib, hx of TIA, presented to ED after syncopal episode.  In ED found
   to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic TdP.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Syncope is due to TdP.  QT prolongation and TdP of unclear
   etiology. Could be medication-induced. Unlikely congenital QT given
   patient age and lack of syncope hx prior to 2 wks ago. Currently in NSR
   with runs of v-tach, has hx of a-fib. Pt w/ two brief episodes of TdP
   that self resolved, overnight.
   - will hold Celexa and benzodiazepines
   - continue potassium and magnesium repletion to K=4.5-5.0, Mg>2.5
   - consider isoproterenol and temp pacing if bradycardic or TdP recurs
   - will hold coumadin for a-fib due to supratherapeutic INR (4.6)
   - keep on cardiac monitor
   - repeat EKG in AM to monitor prolonged QTc
   - ICD placement after left heart cath on Monday, [**2112-10-17**]
   .
   # PUMP:  Unclear history of heart failure. Had TEE done 3 yrs ago
   (results unclear). [**Name2 (NI) **] [**2112-10-14**] showed LVEF 20%. Extensive anterior,
   septal, and apical akinesis with moderate-to-severe tricuspid
   regurgitation and at least mild mitral regurgitation; moderate aortic
   stenosis; mild-moderate aortic regurg; elevated left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).  Hypotension [**2-29**] dehydration or
   overdiuresis during HD is possible (baseline SBP around 100) c/w sx of
   lightheadedness.
   - hold CCB due to hypotension
   - daily weights, I/O's
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Trop-T elevated at 2.82 this afternoon compared to 0.20
   in the morning. CK also elevated at 561. Enzyme elevations could be due
   to ischemia from torsades vs. ACS. No ST elevation/depressions on EKG.
   Patient denies any chest pain.  Dobutamine stress test in [**2111-7-28**] was
   normal per pt, but coronary status is unknown.
   - continue to cycle CE (Peak Trop is 4.5, Peak CK 1044)
   - Pt likely to go for cath on Monday
   - continue ASA 325 mg
   - continue Plavix 75 mg
   - continue simvastatin 40 mg
   - supratherap INR
   - repeat ECG if shoulder pain recurs
   .
   # ESRD: Patient is on M/W/F dialysis via AV graft. Has been oliguric,
   creatinine 5.5, electrolytes stable.
   - will monitor electrolytes, BUN, Cr to trend renal function
   - consult Nephrology for HD today (M/W/F schedule)
   - continue PhosLo and renal vitamins
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting: has been ongoing issue at home. Could be [**2-29**] GERD
   vs. diabetic gastroparesis
   - Continue Zofran prn for nausea
   - Consider PPI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - TSH 1.0
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .
   # DM2: not on any insulin or oral hypoglycemics at home.
   Well-controlled, BS<200s at home.
   - sliding-scale insulin for glycemic control
   .
   FEN: renal, cardiac prudent, diabetic diet. NPO p MN for [**Month/Day (2) **]
   - will replete K+ PRN
   - also will replete Mg+ as above

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10073**] is a 69 yo woman with ESRD/HD secondary to DM and HTN, ? CHF,
   afib, hx of TIA, presented to ED after syncopal episode.  In ED found
   to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic TdP.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Syncope is due to TdP.  QT prolongation and TdP of unclear
   etiology. Could be medication-induced. Unlikely congenital QT given
   patient age and lack of syncope hx prior to 2 wks ago. Currently in NSR
   with runs of v-tach, has hx of a-fib. Pt w/ two brief episodes of TdP
   that self resolved, overnight.
   - will hold Celexa and benzodiazepines
   - continue potassium and magnesium repletion to K=4.5-5.0, Mg>2.5
   - consider isoproterenol and temp pacing if bradycardic or TdP recurs
   - will hold coumadin for a-fib due to supratherapeutic INR (4.6)
   - keep on cardiac monitor
   - repeat EKG in AM to monitor prolonged QTc
   - ICD placement after left heart cath on Monday, [**2112-10-17**]
   .
   # PUMP:  Unclear history of heart failure. Last TTE and TEE done 3 yrs
   ago (unclear whether any valvular disease was present). Hypotension [**2-29**]
   dehydration or overdiuresis during HD is possible (baseline SBP around
   100) c/w sx of lightheadedness.
   - hold CCB due to hypotension
   - daily weights, I/O's
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Trop-T elevated at 2.82 this afternoon compared to 0.20
   in the morning. CK also elevated at 561. Enzyme elevations could be due
   to ischemia from torsades vs. ACS. No ST elevation/depressions on EKG.
   Patient denies any chest pain.  Dobutamine stress test in [**2111-7-28**] was
   normal per pt, but coronary status is unknown.
   - continue to cycle CE (Peak Trop is 4.5, Peak CK 1044)
   - Pt likely to go for cath on Monday
   - continue ASA 325 mg
   - continue simvastatin 40 mg
   - supratherap INR
   - repeat ECG if shoulder pain recurs
   .
   # ESRD: Patient is on M/W/F dialysis via AV graft. Has been oliguric,
   creatinine 5.5, electrolytes stable.
   - will monitor electrolytes, BUN, Cr to trend renal function
   - consult Nephrology for HD today (M/W/F schedule)
   - continue PhosLo and renal vitamins
   .
   # R femoral hematoma
   - will give vitamin K 1g IV
   - recheck PT/INR in AM
   - pressure dressings
   - will remove fem line today
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - TSH 1.0
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .
   # DM2: not on any insulin or oral hypoglycemics at home.
   Well-controlled, BS<200s at home.
   - sliding-scale insulin for glycemic control
   .
   FEN: renal, cardiac prudent, diabetic diet. NPO p MN for TTE
   - will replete K+ PRN
   - also will replete Mg+ as above
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's, R femoral line, AV graft in L arm
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with supratherap INR
   -Pain management not necessary currently
   -Bowel regimen with docusate/senna

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and other comorbidities. She presented to the emergency department with a syncopal episode and was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic torsades de pointes (TdP). The patient's rhythm has now returned to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) with occasional runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT), and she has a history of atrial fibrillation (afib).

The patient's current medications include citalopram (Celexa), benzodiazepines, potassium and magnesium supplements, isoproterenol, temporary pacing, warfarin (Coumadin), cardiac monitor, and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. She also has a history of myocardial infarction (MI), but the exact type (STEMI, NSTEMI, unstable angina) is not specified. The patient's troponin T levels are elevated, indicating ongoing ischemia or reinfarction.

The patient's renal function is compromised, as evidenced by her elevated creatinine levels and requirement for hemodialysis (HD) three times a week via an arteriovenous (AV) graft. Her electrolytes are relatively stable, but she is oliguric.

The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus type"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10073**] is a 69 yo woman with ESRD/HD secondary to DM and HTN, CHF,
   afib, hx of TIA, presented to ED after syncopal episode.  In ED found
   to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic TdP.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Syncope is due to TdP.  QT prolongation and TdP of unclear
   etiology. Could be medication-induced. Unlikely congenital QT given
   patient age and lack of syncope hx prior to 2 wks ago. Currently in
   NSR, has hx of a-fib. Pt w/ two brief episodes of TdP that self
   resolved, overnight [**2022-10-13**].
   - will hold Celexa and refrain from benzodiazepines
   - continue potassium and magnesium repletion to K=4.5-5.0, Mg>2.5
   - consider isoproterenol and temp pacing if bradycardic or TdP recurs
   - keep on cardiac monitor
   - repeat EKG daily  to monitor prolonged QTc
   - ICD placement poss. Tues. [**10-18**] or Wed. [**10-19**].
   .
   # PUMP:  Unclear history of heart failure. Had TEE done 3 yrs ago
   (results unclear). [**Name2 (NI) **] [**2112-10-14**] showed LVEF 20%. Extensive anterior,
   septal, and apical akinesis with moderate-to-severe tricuspid
   regurgitation and at least mild mitral regurgitation; moderate aortic
   stenosis; mild-moderate aortic regurg; elevated left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).  Hypotension [**2-29**] dehydration or
   overdiuresis during HD is possible (baseline SBP around 100) c/w sx of
   lightheadedness.
   - hold CCB due to hypotension
   - no ACE-I due to ESRD
   - daily weights, I/O's
   .
   # CORONARIES: CE elevated - Peak Trop is 4.5, Peak CK 1044, MB 50 from
   [**10-14**] PM. Enzyme elevations could be due to ischemia from torsades vs.
   ACS. No ST elevation/depressions on EKG but anterior-septal Q
s c/w
   akinesis on echo. Patient denies any chest pain.  Dobutamine stress
   test in [**2111-7-28**] was normal per pt, but coronary status is unknown.
   - will d/c heparin gtt (started [**10-14**]) since >48 hrs, patient in NSR
   - consider holding off cardiac cath until tomorrow [**2-29**] elevated INR
   (2.0)
   - continue ASA 325 mg
   - continue Plavix 75 mg
   - continue simvastatin 40 mg
   - repeat ECG if shoulder pain recurs
   .
   # ESRD: Patient is on M/W/F dialysis via AV graft. Has been oliguric,
   creatinine 5.5, electrolytes stable.
   - will monitor electrolytes, BUN, Cr to trend renal function
   - will receive HD today (M/W/F schedule) prior to cath
   - continue PhosLo and renal vitamins
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting: has been ongoing issue at home. Could be [**2-29**] GERD
   vs. diabetic gastroparesis
   - will hold off Zofran, H2RA, or Reglan for now due to concern for QT
   prolongation
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - TSH 1.0
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .
   # DM2: not on any insulin or oral hypoglycemics at home.
   Well-controlled, BS<200s at home.
   - sliding-scale insulin for glycemic control
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HTN). She presented to the emergency department after experiencing a syncopal episode and was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP). She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her cardiac and renal conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Torsades de pointes (TdP): The patient has a history of TdP, which is a life-threatening arrhythmia characterized by an abnormal heart rhythm that can lead to sudden cardiac arrest. Close monitoring of the EKG and cardiac rhythm is necessary to detect any recurrence of TdP.

2. Prolonged QT interval: The patient's QTc interval is significantly prolonged, which increases the risk of developing TdP or other serious arrhythmias. Monitoring the QT interval and avoiding medications that can further prolong it is essential.

3. Cardiac catheterization: The patient is planned for cardiac catheterization to evaluate the coronary arteries. This procedure carries a risk of complications such as bleeding, infection, or contrast-induced nephropathy.

4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient has ESRD requiring hemodialysis three times a week. CKD increases the risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalances"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10073**] is a 69 yo woman with ESRD/HD secondary to DM and HTN, CHF,
   afib, hx of TIA, presented to ED after syncopal episode.  In ED found
   to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic TdP.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Syncope is due to TdP.  QT prolongation and TdP of unclear
   etiology. Could be medication-induced. Unlikely congenital QT given
   patient age and lack of syncope hx prior to 2 wks ago. Currently in NSR
   with runs of v-tach, has hx of a-fib. Pt w/ two brief episodes of TdP
   that self resolved, overnight [**2022-10-13**].
   - will hold Celexa and refrain from benzodiazepines
   - continue potassium and magnesium repletion to K=4.5-5.0, Mg>2.5
   - consider isoproterenol and temp pacing if bradycardic or TdP recurs
   - will hold coumadin for a-fib due to supratherapeutic INR (4.6)
   - keep on cardiac monitor
   - repeat EKG daily  to monitor prolonged QTc
   - ICD placement poss. Tues. [**10-18**] or Wed. [**10-19**].
   .
   # PUMP:  Unclear history of heart failure. Had TEE done 3 yrs ago
   (results unclear). [**Name2 (NI) **] [**2112-10-14**] showed LVEF 20%. Extensive anterior,
   septal, and apical akinesis with moderate-to-severe tricuspid
   regurgitation and at least mild mitral regurgitation; moderate aortic
   stenosis; mild-moderate aortic regurg; elevated left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).  Hypotension [**2-29**] dehydration or
   overdiuresis during HD is possible (baseline SBP around 100) c/w sx of
   lightheadedness.
   - hold CCB due to hypotension
   - no ACE-I due to ESRD
   - daily weights, I/O's
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Trop-T elevated at 2.82 this afternoon compared to 0.20
   in the morning. CK also elevated at 561. Enzyme elevations could be due
   to ischemia from torsades vs. ACS. No ST elevation/depressions on EKG.
   Patient denies any chest pain.  Dobutamine stress test in [**2111-7-28**] was
   normal per pt, but coronary status is unknown.
   - Peak Trop is 4.5, Peak CK 1044, MB 50 from [**10-14**] PM
   - cardiac cath today after HD
   - continue ASA 325 mg
   - continue Plavix 75 mg
   - continue simvastatin 40 mg
   - repeat ECG if shoulder pain recurs
   .
   # ESRD: Patient is on M/W/F dialysis via AV graft. Has been oliguric,
   creatinine 5.5, electrolytes stable.
   - will monitor electrolytes, BUN, Cr to trend renal function
   - will receive HD today (M/W/F schedule) prior to cath
   - continue PhosLo and renal vitamins
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting: has been ongoing issue at home. Could be [**2-29**] GERD
   vs. diabetic gastroparesis
   - will hold off Zofran, H2RA, or Reglan for now due to concern for QT
   prolongation
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - TSH 1.0
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .
   # DM2: not on any insulin or oral hypoglycemics at home.
   Well-controlled, BS<200s at home.
   - sliding-scale insulin for glycemic control
   .
   FEN:
   - NPO for cath. Resume renal, cardiac prudent, diabetic diet p cath.
   - will replete K+ PRN
   - also will replete Mg+ as above
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's, AV graft in L arm
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx
 on heparin drip
   -Pain management not necessary currently
   -Bowel regimen with docusate/senna

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), and syncopal episode. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to prolonged QTc interval and episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP). She is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) but has a history of ventricular tachycardia (v-tach) and afib. The patient's QT prolongation and TdP are of unclear etiology but may be medication-induced. She has been started on potassium and magnesium repletion and is being monitored closely for any recurrence of TdP. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement is planned for Tuesday or Wednesday.

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), with elevated cardiac enzymes consistent with myocardial ischemia or infarction. She underwent a dobutamine stress test which was normal, but her coronary status is unknown. Heparin has been held due to supratherapeutic INR, and the decision for cardiac catheterization will be made after further evaluation.

The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an elevated creatinine level of 5.5 and is on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) three times a week via an arteriovenous (AV) graft. She is olig"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and transient ischemic attack (TIA). She presented to the emergency department after experiencing a syncopal episode. The patient was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP), which resolved spontaneously overnight. She also has a history of afib. 

The patient's current medications include citalopram (Celexa) for depression, benzodiazepines for anxiety, potassium and magnesium repletion, isoproterenol, and temporary pacing if bradycardic or TdP recurs. She is also on cardiac monitoring, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement is being considered for Wednesday. 

The patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on 10/14, which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%. There was extensive anterior, septal, and apical akinesis with moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation and at least mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate aortic stenosis, mild-moderate aortic regurgitation, and elevated left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP > 18mmHg) were noted. Hypotension, dehydration, or overdiuresis during hemodialysis (HD) is possible, as her baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) is around 100. Pulmonary edema was clinically and on chest X-ray on 10/13. 

The patient's coronary status is uncertain, with elevated cardiac enzymes (Peak Troponin-T 4.5, Peak CK 1044, MB 50) from 10/14 PM. Enzyme elevations could be due to ischemia from torsades or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). No ST elevation/depressions on EKG, but anterior-septal Q waves were consistent with akinesis on echo. The patient denies any chest pain, and a dobutamine stress test on 7/28/11 was normal. However, her coronary status remains unknown. 

A cardiac catheterization is planned today, and she will continue to take aspirin 325 mg, Plavix 75 mg, and simvastatin 40 mg. 

The patient is on maintenance dialysis via an arteriovenous graft on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. She has been oliguric, with a creatinine level of 5.5, and her electrolytes are stable. 

Potential medical complications:
1. QT prolongation: The patient has a history of prolonged QTc with episodes of TdP. Medications such as citalopram and benzodiaz"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10073**] is a 69 yo woman with ESRD/HD secondary to DM and HTN, CHF,
   afib, hx of TIA, presented to ED after syncopal episode.  In ED found
   to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic TdP.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Syncope is due to TdP.  QT prolongation and TdP of unclear
   etiology. Could be medication-induced. Unlikely congenital QT given
   patient age and lack of syncope hx prior to 2 wks ago. Currently in
   NSR, has hx of a-fib. Pt w/ two brief episodes of TdP that self
   resolved, overnight [**2022-10-13**].
   - will hold Celexa and refrain from benzodiazepines
   - continue potassium and magnesium repletion to K=4.5-5.0, Mg>2.5
   - consider isoproterenol and temp pacing if bradycardic or TdP recurs
   - keep on cardiac monitor
   - repeat EKG daily  to monitor prolonged QTc
   - ICD placement poss. Tues. [**10-18**] or Wed. [**10-19**].
   .
   # PUMP:  Unclear history of heart failure. Had TEE done 3 yrs ago
   (results unclear). [**Name2 (NI) **] [**2112-10-14**] showed LVEF 20%. Extensive anterior,
   septal, and apical akinesis with moderate-to-severe tricuspid
   regurgitation and at least mild mitral regurgitation; moderate aortic
   stenosis; mild-moderate aortic regurg; elevated left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).  Hypotension [**2-29**] dehydration or
   overdiuresis during HD is possible (baseline SBP around 100) c/w sx of
   lightheadedness.
   - hold CCB due to hypotension
   - no ACE-I due to ESRD
   - daily weights, I/O's
   .
   # CORONARIES: CE elevated - Peak Trop is 4.5, Peak CK 1044, MB 50 from
   [**10-14**] PM. Enzyme elevations could be due to ischemia from torsades vs.
   ACS. No ST elevation/depressions on EKG but anterior-septal Q
s c/w
   akinesis on echo. Patient denies any chest pain.  Dobutamine stress
   test in [**2111-7-28**] was normal per pt, but coronary status is unknown.
   - will d/c heparin gtt (started [**10-14**]) since >48 hrs, patient in NSR
   - consider holding off cardiac cath until tomorrow [**2-29**] elevated INR
   (2.0)
   - continue ASA 325 mg
   - continue Plavix 75 mg
   - continue simvastatin 40 mg
   - repeat ECG if shoulder pain recurs
   .
   # ESRD: Patient is on M/W/F dialysis via AV graft. Has been oliguric,
   creatinine 5.5, electrolytes stable.
   - will monitor electrolytes, BUN, Cr to trend renal function
   - will receive HD today (M/W/F schedule) prior to cath
   - continue PhosLo and renal vitamins
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting: has been ongoing issue at home. Could be [**2-29**] GERD
   vs. diabetic gastroparesis
   - will hold off Zofran, H2RA, or Reglan for now due to concern for QT
   prolongation
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - TSH 1.0
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .
   # DM2: not on any insulin or oral hypoglycemics at home.
   Well-controlled, BS<200s at home.
   - sliding-scale insulin for glycemic control
   .
   FEN:
   - NPO for cath. Resume renal, cardiac prudent, diabetic diet if no cath
   today.
   - will replete K+ PRN
   - also will replete Mg+ as above

The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with prolonged QTc and episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP).

The patient has a history of heart failure, but it is unclear due to the unclear results of a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) done three years ago.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), and syncope. The patient presented to the emergency department after experiencing a syncopal episode and was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic torsades de pointes (TdP). ECG changes and troponin elevation were noted, which raised concerns for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus ischemia from torsades. 

The patient's current plan includes holding Celexa and refraining from benzodiazepines, continuing potassium and magnesium repletion, considering isoproterenol and temporary pacing if bradycardic or TdP recurs, keeping on cardiac monitor, repeating EKG daily to monitor prolonged QTc, and possibly placing an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) on Wednesday. 

In addition, the patient has a history of ESRD on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) via an arteriovenous graft, oliguric, creatinine 5.5, electrolytes stable. The plan is to continue HD on Wednesdays, monitor electrolytes, BUN, Cr to trend renal function, and receive HD tomorrow. 

Other notable findings include nausea/vomiting, likely due to gastroesophage"

","The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), transient ischemic attack (TIA), and syncope. She presented to the emergency department after experiencing a syncopal episode. Upon further evaluation, she was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP). The ECG changes and troponin elevation raised concerns for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus ischemia from torsades. 

The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) but has a history of afib. She had two brief episodes of TdP that resolved on their own overnight. To manage this, it is recommended to hold Celexa and refrain from benzodiazepines. Potassium and magnesium repletion should be continued to maintain levels between 4.5-5.0 and >2.5, respectively. If bradycardic or TdP recurs, isoproterenol and temporary pacing may be considered. Continuous cardiac monitoring is advised, and a repeat EKG should be performed daily to monitor prolonged QTc. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement is planned for Wednesday. 

The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 20% according to the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed on October 14th. The TTE showed extensive anterior, septal, and apical akinesis with moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation and at least mild mitral regurgitation. There is also moderate aortic stenosis, mild-moderate aortic regurgitation, and elevated left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP >18mmHg). Hypotension, dehydration, or overdiuresis during hemodialysis (HD) is a possibility, especially since the baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) is around 100. Pulmonary edema was clinically observed and seen on chest X-ray on October 13th. 

To manage these findings, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) should be held due to hypotension. ACE inhibitors should be avoided due to ESRD. Daily weights and intake/output measurements should be recorded. 

Regarding the coronary arteries, elevated cardiac enzymes (peak troponin of 4.5, peak CK of 1044, MB of 50) from October 14th suggest ischemia from torsades or ACS. Although the patient denies any chest pain, no ST elevation/depressions were observed on the EKG, but anterior-septal Q waves were seen on the echo. A dobutamine stress test performed on July 28th was normal, but the coronary status remains unknown. 

A plan for cardiac catheterization today has been made to further assess the coronary arteries"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10073**] is a 69 yo woman with ESRD/HD secondary to DM and HTN, CHF,
   afib, hx of TIA, presented to ED after syncopal episode.  In ED found
   to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic TdP.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Syncope is due to TdP. QT prolongation and TdP of unclear
   etiology. Could be medication-induced. Unlikely congenital QT given
   patient age and lack of syncope hx prior to 2 wks ago. Currently in
   NSR, has hx of a-fib. Pt w/ two brief episodes of TdP that self
   resolved, overnight [**2022-10-13**].
   - will hold Celexa and refrain from benzodiazepines
   - continue potassium and magnesium repletion prn to K=4.5-5.0, Mg>2.5
   - consider isoproterenol and temp pacing if bradycardic or TdP recurs
   - keep on cardiac monitor
   - repeat EKG daily  to monitor prolonged QTc (620->537->488)
   - ICD placement possibly Wed. [**10-19**].
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE [**2112-10-14**] showed LVEF 20%. Extensive anterior, septal, and
   apical akinesis with moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation and at
   least mild mitral regurgitation; moderate aortic stenosis;
   mild-moderate aortic regurg; elevated left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg).  Hypotension [**2-29**] dehydration or overdiuresis during HD
   is possible (baseline SBP around 100). Pulmonary edema clinically and
   on CXR on [**10-13**].
   - hold CCB due to hypotension
   - no ACE-I due to ESRD
   - daily weights, I/O's
   .
   # CORONARIES: CE elevated - Peak Trop is 4.5, Peak CK 1044, MB 50 from
   [**10-14**] PM. Enzyme elevations could be due to ischemia from torsades vs.
   ACS. No ST elevation/depressions on EKG but anterior-septal Q
s c/w
   akinesis on echo. Patient denies any chest pain.  Dobutamine stress
   test in [**2111-7-28**] was normal per pt, but coronary status is unknown.
   - plan for cardiac cath today [**10-18**]
   - continue ASA 325 mg
   - continue Plavix 75 mg
   - continue simvastatin 40 mg
   .
   # ESRD: Patient is on M/W/F dialysis via AV graft. Has been oliguric,
   creatinine 5.5, electrolytes stable.
   - will monitor electrolytes, BUN, Cr to trend renal function
   - will receive HD Wed. [**10-19**] (M/W/F schedule)
   - continue PhosLo and renal vitamins
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting: intermittent, has been ongoing issue at home. Could
   be [**2-29**] GERD vs. diabetic gastroparesis. Increased cough with meals is
   c/w GERD.
   - will hold off Zofran, H2RA, or Reglan for now due to concern for QT
   prolongation
   .
   # Back pain: likely positional vs. diaphragmatic irritation. Does not
   appear to be anginal (occurs only with cough, non-episodic).
   - will f/u EKG from this morning
   - incentive spirometer and OOB ambulation for atelectasis prevention
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - TSH 1.0
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .
   # DM2: not on any insulin or oral hypoglycemics at home.
   Well-controlled, BS<200s at home.
   - sliding-scale insulin for glycemic control
   .
   FEN:
   - NPO for cath. Resume renal, cardiac prudent, diabetic diet p cath
   today.
   - will replete K+ PRN
   - also will replete Mg+ as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA). She presented to the emergency department (ED) after experiencing a syncopal episode. In the ED, she was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP). She also had elevated troponin levels, indicating possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or ischemia from torsades.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed 90% mid-left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis with drug-eluting stent (DES) placement and 50% proximal right coronary artery (RCA) lesion. Verapamil was started at a low dose but held due to dialysis. She is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) but has a history of afib. The patient's QT prolongation and TdP are of unclear etiology. It is unlikely to be purely medication-induced, given that citalopram has been discontinued for several days. Unlikely congenital QT syndrome due to the patient's age, lack of syncope history, and normal QT prior to two weeks ago.

The patient has a baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) around 100 mmHg, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and transient ischemic attack (TIA). She presented to the emergency department after experiencing a syncopal episode. The patient has had prolonged QTc intervals with episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP), elevated troponin levels, and changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG) that are concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or ischemia from torsades. She underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2112-10-18**], which showed 90% mid-left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis with drug-eluting stent placement, as well as a 50% proximal right coronary artery (RCA) lesion.

Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged QTc interval with episodes of TdP: This can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias and syncope.
2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or ischemia from torsades: The patient's elevated troponin levels, ECG changes, and symptoms suggest possible ACS or ischemic heart disease.
3. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF, which may contribute to her current symptoms and condition.
4. ESRD: The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week via an arterioven"

","Summary:
Ms. [Last Name] is a 69-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), transient ischemic attack (TIA), presenting to the emergency department (ED) after a syncopal episode. She was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP). The ECG changes and troponin elevation while in the critical care unit (CCU) were concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus ischemia from torsades. A cardiac catheterization was planned.

Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged QTc with TdP: Ms. [Last Name] has a prolonged QTc interval with episodes of TdP, which can lead to syncope or sudden cardiac death. She is currently in normal sinus rhythm but has a history of afib. The cause of the prolonged QTc is unclear, as it is unlikely to be purely medication-induced given that citalopram has been discontinued for several days. It is also unlikely to be congenital QT syndrome due to the patient's age and lack of syncope history. She will continue to hold Celexa, and potassium and magnesium repletion will be done as needed to maintain a potassium level of 4.5-5.0 and magnesium level greater than 2"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10073**] is a 69 yo woman with ESRD/HD secondary to DM and HTN, CHF,
   afib, hx of TIA, presented to ED after syncopal episode.  In ED found
   to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic TdP.   ECG changes
   and troponin elevation while in CCU concerning for ACS versus ischemia
   from torsades.  Plan for Cath today.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Syncope is due to TdP. QT prolongation and TdP of unclear
   etiology. Could be medication-induced. Unlikely congenital QT given
   patient age and lack of syncope hx prior to 2 wks ago. Currently in
   NSR, has hx of a-fib. Pt w/ two brief episodes of TdP that self
   resolved, overnight [**2022-10-13**].
   - will hold Celexa and refrain from benzodiazepines
   - continue potassium and magnesium repletion prn to K=4.5-5.0, Mg>2.5
   - consider isoproterenol and temp pacing if bradycardic or TdP recurs
   - keep on cardiac monitor
   - repeat EKG daily  to monitor prolonged QTc (620->537->488)
   - ICD placement possibly Wed. [**10-19**].
   - plan to start coumadin post-ICD placement tomorrow
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE [**2112-10-14**] showed LVEF 20%. Extensive anterior, septal, and
   apical akinesis with moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation and at
   least mild mitral regurgitation; moderate aortic stenosis;
   mild-moderate aortic regurg; elevated left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg).  Hypotension [**2-29**] dehydration or overdiuresis during HD
   is possible (baseline SBP around 100). Pulmonary edema clinically and
   on CXR on [**10-13**].
   - hold CCB due to hypotension
   - no ACE-I due to ESRD
   - daily weights, I/O's
   .
   # CORONARIES: CE elevated - Peak Trop is 4.5, Peak CK 1044, MB 50 from
   [**10-14**] PM. Enzyme elevations could be due to ischemia from torsades vs.
   ACS. No ST elevation/depressions on EKG but anterior-septal Q
s c/w
   akinesis on echo. Patient denies any chest pain.  Dobutamine stress
   test in [**2111-7-28**] was normal per pt, but coronary status is unknown.
   - plan for cardiac cath today [**10-18**]
   - continue ASA 325 mg
   - continue Plavix 75 mg
   - continue simvastatin 40 mg
   .
   # ESRD: Patient is on M/W/F dialysis via AV graft. Has been oliguric,
   creatinine 5.5, electrolytes stable.
   - will monitor electrolytes, BUN, Cr to trend renal function
   - will receive HD Wed. [**10-19**] (M/W/F schedule)
   - continue PhosLo and renal vitamins
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting: intermittent, has been ongoing issue at home. Could
   be [**2-29**] GERD vs. diabetic gastroparesis. Increased cough with meals is
   c/w GERD.
   - will hold off Zofran, H2RA, or Reglan for now due to concern for QT
   prolongation
   .
   # Back pain: likely positional vs. diaphragmatic irritation. Does not
   appear to be anginal (occurs only with cough, non-episodic).
   - will f/u EKG from this morning
   - incentive spirometer and OOB ambulation for atelectasis prevention
   - continue acetaminophen prn for pain
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - TSH 1.0
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .
   # DM2: not on any insulin or oral hypoglycemics at home.
   Well-controlled, BS<200s at home.
   - sliding-scale insulin for glycemic control
   .

She presented to the emergency department after experiencing a syncopal episode. In the critical care unit (CCU), she was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP). There was also evidence of elevated troponin levels, suggesting acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or ischemia from torsades.

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization today, which revealed a 90% mid-left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis with drug-eluting stent (DES) placement. Additionally, there was a 50% proximal right coronary artery (RCA) lesion. Verapamil was added to her medication regimen, and post-cath check was unremarkable. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) was found to be 20% on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), indicating reduced left ventricular function.

The patient's rhythm is currently sinus rhythm (SR), but she has a history of afib. She had two brief episodes of TdP that self-resolved overnight. To prevent further episodes, she will be held off on citalopram (Celexa) and benzodiazep"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and transient ischemic attack (TIA). She presented to the emergency department after experiencing a syncopal episode. In the critical care unit (CCU), she was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP). ECG changes and troponin elevation indicated possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or ischemia from torsades. A cardiac catheterization was performed, revealing 90% mid-left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis with drug-eluting stent (DES) placement and 50% proximal right coronary artery (RCA) lesion. The patient was started on verapamil 40 mg orally every 8 hours, and her potassium and magnesium levels were repleted. She also has a history of prolonged QTc, which is unlikely to be purely medication-induced or congenital. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but has a history of afib. She experienced two brief episodes of TdP that self-resolved after hemodialysis on October 14th. The plan includes continuing to hold Celexa, monitoring the patient's cardiac rhythm, repeating EKG daily to monitor prolonged QTc, considering isoproterenol and temporary pacing if br"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10073**] is a 69 yo woman with ESRD/HD secondary to DM and HTN, CHF,
   afib, hx of TIA, presented to ED after syncopal episode.  In ED found
   to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic TdP.   ECG changes
   and troponin elevation while in CCU concerning for ACS versus ischemia
   from torsades.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Syncope is due to TdP. QT prolongation and TdP of unclear
   etiology. Unlikely to be purely medication-induced, given that
   citalopram has been d/c
ed for several days. Unlikely congenital QT
   syndrome given patient age and lack of syncope hx and normal QT prior
   to 2 wks ago. Currently in NSR, has hx of a-fib. Pt w/ two brief
   episodes of TdP that self resolved, during HD on [**10-14**].
   - will discontinue Celexa on discharge
   - continue potassium and magnesium repletion prn to K=4.5-5.0, Mg>2.5
   - consider isoproterenol and temp pacing if bradycardic or TdP recurs
   - keep on cardiac monitor
   - repeat EKG daily  to monitor prolonged QTc (620->537->488->469ms)
   - Per EP, not candidate for ICD placement
   - will restart warfarin today
   - consider starting mexiletine 200 mg q8h (f/u with EP regarding dose)
   - consider switching to verapamil ER 120 mg qdaily
   - f/u with EP regarding recs regarding outpatient monitoring
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE [**2112-10-14**] showed LVEF 20%. Extensive anterior, septal, and
   apical akinesis with moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation and at
   least mild mitral regurgitation; moderate aortic stenosis;
   mild-moderate aortic regurg; elevated left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg).  Hypotension [**2-29**] dehydration or overdiuresis during HD
   is possible (baseline SBP around 100). Pulmonary edema clinically and
   on CXR on [**10-13**].
   - continue verapamil (started [**10-18**])
   - no ACE-I due to ESRD
   - daily weights, I/O's
   .
   # CORONARIES: CE elevated - Peak Trop is 4.5, Peak CK 1044, MB 50 from
   [**10-14**] PM. Enzyme elevations could be due to ischemia from torsades vs.
   ACS. No ST elevation/depressions on EKG but anterior-septal Q
s c/w
   akinesis on echo. Patient denies any chest pain.  Dobutamine stress
   test in [**2111-7-28**] was normal per pt. Cath [**10-18**] showed 80% LAD lesion p
   1^st septal, D1 60%, mid-RCA 50%. DES placed in LAD.
   - continue ASA 325 mg
   - continue Plavix 75 mg
   - continue simvastatin 40 mg
   .
   # ESRD: Patient is on M/W/F dialysis via AV graft. Has been oliguric,
   creatinine 5.5, electrolytes stable.
   - continue to monitor electrolytes, BUN, Cr to trend renal function
   - will receive HD tomorrow at regular outpatient HD center (M/W/F
   schedule)
   - continue PhosLo and renal vitamins
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting: intermittent, has been ongoing issue at home. Could
   be [**2-29**] GERD vs. diabetic gastroparesis. Increased cough with meals is
   c/w GERD.
   - will hold off Zofran, H2RA, or Reglan for now due to concern for QT
   prolongation
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - TSH 1.0
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .
   # DM2: not on any insulin or oral hypoglycemics at home.
   Well-controlled, BS<200s at home.
   - sliding-scale insulin for glycemic control

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10073**], a 69-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and transient ischemic attack (TIA), presented to the emergency department after experiencing a syncopal episode. She was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP). ECG changes and troponin elevation while in the critical care unit (CCU) raised concerns for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus ischemia from torsades.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged QTc and TdP: The patient's prolonged QTc interval and episodes of TdP indicate an increased risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. It is important to monitor her cardiac rhythm and continue potassium and magnesium repletion to maintain normal levels. Discontinuing citalopram, which can cause QT prolongation, may also be necessary.

2. CHF: The patient's history of CHF is evident from the findings on the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), showing a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, extensive anterior, septal, and apical akinesis, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and mild mitral regurgitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10073**] is a 69 yo woman with ESRD/HD secondary to DM and HTN, CHF,
   afib, hx of TIA, presented to ED after syncopal episode.  In ED found
   to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic TdP.   ECG changes
   and troponin elevation while in CCU concerning for ACS versus ischemia
   from torsades.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Syncope is due to TdP. QT prolongation and TdP of unclear
   etiology. Unlikely to be purely medication-induced, given that
   citalopram has been d/c
ed for several days. Unlikely congenital QT
   syndrome given patient age and lack of syncope hx and normal QT prior
   to 2 wks ago. Currently in NSR, has hx of a-fib. Pt w/ two brief
   episodes of TdP that self resolved, during HD on [**10-14**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), transient ischemic attack (TIA), presenting to the emergency department (ED) after a syncopal episode. She was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP). ECG changes and troponin elevation while in the critical care unit (CCU) were concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus ischemia from torsades. The patient has a history of afib and two brief episodes of TdP during hemodialysis (HD) on [**10-14**]. She was discharged from the hospital on [**10-18**] with a plan to restart warfarin today, consider starting mexiletine, and follow up with an electrophysiologist (EP) regarding recommendations for outpatient monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged QTc and episodes of TdP: The patient has a history of TdP, which can be life-threatening due to the risk of sudden cardiac arrest. Continuous cardiac monitoring should be continued to promptly identify any recurrence of TdP.
2. Hypotension: The patient's baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) is around 100, and hypotension can be"
