","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease post right lower extremity bypass grafting, and wound dehiscence. She was discharged from the vascular service to rehab but presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, tachypnea, and hypotension, leading to intubation.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including altered mental status likely due to a combination of metabolic encephalopathy, sundowning, sepsis, and possible leptomeningeal metastasis from her lung cancer. Respiratory failure is also present, with desaturation episodes while intubated. The differential diagnosis for desaturation includes adenosine, pleural effusions, mass, possible pulmonary embolism, and possible infection such as empyema or pneumonia. Empiric antibiotic therapy has been started, but will be continued until sputum cultures are negative.

New onset atrial fibrillation is likely secondary to pulmonary pathology, with a mass and effusion present for a while. An additional pulmonary process, such as pulmonary embolism, is suspected. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin has been initiated, and a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) is awaiting final read.

Hypotension is attributed to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, elevated lactate, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and previous right lower extremity bypass grafting and wound dehiscence. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including respiratory failure, infection, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, leukocytosis, and lung cancer recurrence.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for ongoing respiratory failure, which may require further intervention such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis with a left shift, indicating a possible infection. Empiric antibiotics have been started, but additional diagnostic tests like blood and urine cultures are needed to identify the causative organism.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation, which may be due to pulmonary pathology. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin has been initiated, and further evaluation with a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) is planned.
4. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, possibly due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, elevated lactate levels, and underlying tumor burden. Intravenous fluids and pressors may be required to"

   Assessment and Plan
   69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD s/p RLE bypass
   grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from vascular
   service to rehab presented with afib with RVR, tachypnea, hypotension;
   now intubated.
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, sepsis, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   - treat potential infections
   - correct hypernatremia
   - wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Respiratory failure: Currently intubated [**1-15**] desaturation and a/w
   protection. Ddx for desaturation include adenosine, pleural effusions,
   mass, possible PE, possible infection (?empyema, less likely PNA)
   - wean vent and SBT if tolerates; RISBI 70
   - sputum cx and bcx
   - empiric vanco and pip-tazo, although infection appears less likely.
   Given overall burden of disease will continue abx until cx negative.
   - heparin gtt for ?PE; f/u final CTA read
   - consider thoracentesis in a.m. with pleural fluid studies
   # New onset atrial fibrillation: Etiology includes pulmonary pathology.
   Mass and effusion have been present for a while and would not explain a
   fib unless an additional pulmonary process was present, i.e. PE.
   - awaiting CTA final read
   - anticoagulate with heparin gtt until CTA negative
   - full echo in a.m.
   # Hypotension: afib with RVR, elevated lactate/WBCs but this likely
   represents underlying tumor burden and the effect of HypoTN
   - IVF and pressor as needed to keep MAP > 60; will wean today
   - monitor urine output
   - treat afib with RVR
   # Leukocytosis: with left shift but stable.
   - f/u blood and urine cx
   - continue empiric vanco and pip-tazo for now
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.
   - goal of care discussion
   - if desired, will proceed with CT guided biopsy and thoracentesis
   - oncology consult
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass and wound infection.
   # DM2:
   - insulin s.s.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - hold citalopram while intubated
   # Hypothyrodism:
   - continue levothyroxine
   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 69F DM, lung ca s/p RLLectomy, PVD c
   complicated RLE BPG c/b infection p/w AF c RVR, hyptension, respiratory
   failure after one day at rehab. Patient developed AF c RVR during
   recent hospitalization, rx metoprolol; recurrent episode yesterday.
   Confused and hypotensive in NSR in ED after adenosine, developed
   recurrent RVR to 170, intubated. Eval notable for B effusions (L>R),
   lung / liver mass. Ecoh (bedside) s effusion or RV strain. Rx o/n with
   levophed and 4L NS.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.4 BP 100/50 HR 78 RR with sat 99 on VAC 500x14
   0.5 5 RSBI 70 TBB +4L/24 UOP 40cc/h. Frail woman, mild distress on vent
   c c/o abd pain. Coarse [**Month (only) 453**] BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. Stasis changes,
   cool digits esp LUE. Labs notable for WBC 17K, HCT 29, K+ 4.1, Cr 1.0,
   lactate 1.2.
   Agree with plan to manage respiratory failure with wean of vent to PSV
   [**11-17**] now with SBT this PM. Unclear the degree to which large L effusion
   is contributing to resp failure
 for now will continue to treat
   possible PE and PNA while attempting to wean vent. Will continue
   antibiotics for component of nosocomial pneumonia, check sputum and d/c
   at 48h if cx if negative. For recent onset of AF, continue heparin,
   check echo for ? effusion and LUE usg for ?clot, and start digoxin with
   close monitoring of creatinine. Troponin up in the setting of
   increased, will cycle and f/u EKG. Will try to start low dose BBL as
   able based on BP. Will monitor LFT abnormalities. Will attempt PICC and
   d/c fem line. Will d/w family and primary oncolgist re prognosis and

   Assessment and Plan
   69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD s/p RLE bypass
   grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from vascular
   service to rehab presented with afib with RVR, tachypnea, hypotension;
   intubated for hypoxia and airway protection.
   # Respiratory failure: Currently intubated [**1-15**] desaturation and a/w
   protection.  Attempted to extubate her on [**5-4**] but failed spontaneous
   breathing trial secondary to tachypnea.  Empirically treating for
   pneumonia but awaiting negative cultures x 48 hours.  Left pleural
   effusion also contributing to respiratory failure.  Chest CTA shows
   likely chronic thrombosis in right middle lobe pulmonary artery.
   - wean vent and SBT if tolerates
   - sputum cx and bcx
   - empiric vanco and pip-tazo, although infection appears less likely.
   Given overall burden of disease will continue abx until cx negative for
   48 hours.
   - heparin gtt for ?PE; f/u final CTA read
   - consider thoracentesis with pleural fluid studies
   # Hypotension: afib with RVR, elevated lactate/WBCs initially but this
   likely represents underlying tumor burden and the effect of HypoTN.
   Baseline SBP in 90s per report.  UOP > 50 cc/hr.
   - continue to monitor urine output
   # Systolic heart failure/atrial fibrillation:  ECHO shows severe RV
   dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**],
   and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).  Atrial size not commented on in recent
   ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].  Heart failure likely secondary to (1)
   ischemic heart disease given severe vascular disease and (2) chronic
   PEs with RV strain.  No evidence of acute, hemodynamically significant
   PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation likely secondary to structural heart
   disease and lung cancer.  Also had trop leak likely secondary to demand
   in the setting of RVR.
   - cont digoxin
   - heparin gtt for atrial fib
   - may benefit from ACEi for afterload reduction
   - likely preload dependent given RV failure
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, sepsis, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   - treat potential infections
   - correct hypernatremia
   - wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Pulse previously not doplerable,
   thought to represent traumatic arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial
   line attempt.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - vascular reccs
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient

The patient's respiratory status is a concern as she has failed extubation attempts due to tachypnea and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She also has a left pleural effusion contributing to respiratory failure, and a chest CTA shows chronic thrombosis in the right middle lobe pulmonary artery. The plan is to wean off the ventilator if she tolerates spontaneous breathing trials and to obtain sputum cultures.

Her hypotension is likely related to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, underlying tumor burden, and the effect of hypoTN. Her baseline systolic blood pressure is in the 90s, and she has good urine output.

The patient has systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. An echocardiogram shows severe right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis, as well as a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. The heart failure is likely secondary to ischemic heart disease and chronic pulmonary emboli. The atrial fibrillation is likely secondary to"

1. Chief Complaint: The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note.
2. 24-hour Events:
   - UE U/S negative for DVT: The ultrasound of the upper extremities was performed to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
   - Left arterial pulse undetectable on doppler. Vasc eval, likely traumatic arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt and to continue heparin gtt.: The left arterial pulse was not detected, suggesting a possible arterial thrombus due to an arterial line attempt. Heparin infusion is being continued to prevent further clotting.
   - Bedside TTE in ED read as global RV hypokinesis: The bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed in the emergency department showed reduced movement of the right ventricle (RV) globally.
   - D/w outpatient oncologist: The patient's outpatient oncologist was consulted regarding further evaluation and management.
   - Hypotensive with MAP high 50s improved to MAP 60s with 250 cc IVF bolus and transient phenylephrine: The patient was initially hypotensive with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 50s. She responded well to a 250 cc intravenous fluid (IVF) bolus and"

   Assessment and Plan
   69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD s/p RLE bypass
   grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from vascular
   service to rehab presented with afib with RVR, tachypnea, hypotension;
   intubated for hypoxia and airway protection.
   # Respiratory failure: Currently intubated [**1-15**] desaturation and a/w
   protection.  Attempted to extubate her on [**5-4**] but failed spontaneous
   breathing trial secondary to tachypnea.  Empirically treating for
   pneumonia but awaiting negative cultures x 48 hours.  Left pleural
   effusion also contributing to respiratory failure.  Chest CTA shows

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and previous right lower extremity bypass grafting. She presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, tachypnea, and hypotension. She was intubated for hypoxia and airway protection. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, systolic heart failure/atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, left radial artery insufficiency, right subclavian artery thrombosis, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, depression, and hypothyroidism. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Hypotension: The patient has ongoing hypotension, which may be due to her underlying medical conditions, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, sepsis, and malignancy. There is a risk of organ hypoperfusion and further deterioration in her condition.
3. Systolic heart failure/atrial fibrillation: The patient has severe right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis, along with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. There is a risk of worsening heart failure symptoms and potential cardiac arrhythm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and previous right lower extremity bypass grafting and wound dehiscence. She presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, tachypnea, hypotension, and was intubated for hypoxia and airway protection.

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, systolic heart failure/atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, left radial artery insufficiency, right subclavian artery thrombosis, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, depression, and hypothyroidism.

The patient is currently receiving various treatments and interventions for her conditions, including antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, cardiac medications such as digoxin and heparin, nutrition support through a feeding tube, and insulin for diabetes management. She is also being monitored closely for potential infections and complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, with ongoing hypoxia and the need for mechanical ventilation. She has a history of chronic thrombosis in the right middle lobe pulmonary artery and pleural effusion, which contribute to her respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, requiring vasopressor support. Her hypotension may be"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS two days ago.  Left pleural
   effusion, moderate in size on admission CT likely contributing. Less
   likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Could also be
   component of splinting leading to increased WOB given tumor invasion
   into chest wall.
   - Discontinue antibiotics as patient has been afebrile and culture
   negative, although given leukocytosis will watch fever curve and
   hemodynamics and restart if necessary.
   - Discuss with IP regarding diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation until therapeutic thoracentesis.
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR. Less likely to
   be SIRS physiology, although patient does have persistently elevated
   leukocytosis.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue to monitor urine output
   # Systolic heart failure/atrial fibrillation:  ED bedside TTE shows
   severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF of 30%, down from 55% in
   [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).  Atrial size not commented
   on in recent ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].  Heart failure likely
   secondary to (1) ischemic heart disease given severe vascular disease
   and (2) chronic PE with RV strain.  No evidence of acute,
   hemodynamically significant PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation likely
   secondary to structural heart disease and lung cancer.  Also had trop
   leak likely secondary to demand in the setting of RVR. Appreciate cards
   recs, restarted midodrine and florinef yesterday.
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   - Follow-up cards recs if any.
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - Family meeting today to discuss goals of care
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.
   - Vascular reccs
   # DM2:
   - ISS, hold oral hypoglycemics

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and previous right lower extremity bypass grafting. She was admitted to the hospital with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, tachypnea, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent reintubation due to failed extubation. 

She has a left pleural effusion, which is moderate in size and may contribute to her respiratory failure. Other potential etiologies include chronic segmental pulmonary embolism or tumor invasion into the chest wall. The patient's leukocytosis suggests a possible infection, but since she is afebrile and culture-negative, antibiotics have been discontinued. 

The patient's hypotension is at baseline, with a systolic blood pressure ranging from 80-90 mmHg. This could be related to her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response or could indicate sepsis-induced hypotension. 

Her echocardiogram showed severe right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. This indicates systolic heart failure, likely secondary to ischemic heart disease and chronic pulmonary embolism with right ventricular strain. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, likely secondary to structural heart disease and lung cancer. 

The patient's altered mental status is unclear in etiology, with recent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. On admission, the patient was found to be hypotensive and tachycardic with elevated cardiac enzymes. A diagnosis of myocardial infarction was made, and the patient was started on appropriate antibiotic therapy.

24-hour events include blood cultures being drawn from the right radial and left femoral veins, as well as a urine culture. The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, and vancomycin.

Infusions include midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, and heparin sodium. Other medications include lansoprazole and various ICU medications.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the presence of shortness of breath and chest pain. Flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate ranging from 76-99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 73-115 mmHg, respiratory rate at 12-18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension of unclear
   etiology two days ago.  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology.
   Less likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Could also
   be component of splinting leading to increased WOB given tumor invasion
   into chest wall.  Culture negative since readmission, although WBC
   trending up.
   - Check RSBI, would consider SBT if appropriate.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics given leukocytosis
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care and options including
   thoracentesis.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR. Less likely to
   be SIRS physiology, although patient does have persistently elevated
   leukocytosis.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue to monitor urine output
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Atrial size not commented on in recent ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].
   Heart failure likely secondary to (1) ischemic heart disease given
   severe vascular disease and (2) chronic PE with RV strain.  No evidence
   of acute, hemodynamically significant PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation
   likely secondary to structural heart disease and lung cancer.  Also had
   trop leak likely secondary to demand in the setting of RVR. Appreciate
   cards recs, restarted midodrine and florinef yesterday.
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   - Follow-up cards recs if any.
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - Family meeting today to discuss goals of care
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.
   - Vascular reccs
   # DM2:
   - ISS, hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - Hold citalopram while intubated
   # Hypothyrodism:
   - Continue levothyroxine

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, lung cancer status post right lower lobe resection, peripheral vascular disease with complicated right lower extremity below-knee peripheral arterial disease, and chronic kidney disease. The patient presented to the emergency department with acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and subsequent intubation. 

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors. She had a previous non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction earlier during this admission, which was thought to be demand ischemia. Cardiology was consulted regarding the potential cardiac role in her decompensation and reintubation. Additionally, the patient has peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia and a left pleural effusion that is moderate in size but is not believed to be significant in relation to her respiratory failure. 

The patient's lung cancer has recurred, with suspected spread to the chest wall and liver. She also has new-onset atrial fibrillation, for which she is being continued on heparin and digoxin. The patient requires pressors since her extubation attempt and is suspected to have pneumonia, for which empirical antibiotics have been started pending culture data guidance.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure of 83/51 mmHg, respiratory rate"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension of unclear
   etiology two days ago.  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology.
   Less likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Could also
   be component of splinting leading to increased WOB given tumor invasion
   into chest wall.  Culture negative since readmission, although WBC
   trending up.
   - Check RSBI, would consider SBT if appropriate.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics given leukocytosis
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care and options including
   thoracentesis.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR. Less likely to
   be SIRS physiology, although patient does have persistently elevated
   leukocytosis.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue to monitor urine output
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Atrial size not commented on in recent ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].
   Heart failure likely secondary to (1) ischemic heart disease given
   severe vascular disease and (2) chronic PE with RV strain.  No evidence
   of acute, hemodynamically significant PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation
   likely secondary to structural heart disease and lung cancer.  Also had
   trop leak likely secondary to demand in the setting of RVR. Appreciate
   cards recs, restarted midodrine and florinef yesterday.
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   - Follow-up cards recs if any.
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral

","Summary:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation (afib), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous right lower extremity (RLE) bypass grafting and wound dehiscence. She was discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from the vascular service to rehab but was readmitted due to afib with rapid ventricular response (RVR), tachypnea, hypotension, and respiratory failure with a failed extubation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been reintubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a left pleural effusion, which could contribute to restrictive physiology. Other possible contributing etiologies include chronic segmental pulmonary embolism (PE) or tumor invasion into the chest wall. The patient's white blood cell count is trending up, suggesting an infection. Further assessment of the respiratory status is necessary, and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) may be considered if appropriate. Empiric antibiotics should be continued.

2. Hypotension: The patient has baseline hypotension with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 80-90s. This could be related to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). Less likely causes include se"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension of unclear
   etiology two days ago.  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology.
   Less likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Could also
   be component of splinting leading to increased WOB given tumor invasion
   into chest wall.  Culture negative since readmission, although WBC
   trending up.
   - Check RSBI, would consider SBT if appropriate.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics given leukocytosis
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care and options including
   thoracentesis.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR. Less likely to
   be SIRS physiology, although patient does have persistently elevated
   leukocytosis.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue to monitor urine output
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Atrial size not commented on in recent ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].
   Heart failure likely secondary to (1) ischemic heart disease given
   severe vascular disease and (2) chronic PE with RV strain.  No evidence
   of acute, hemodynamically significant PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation
   likely secondary to structural heart disease and lung cancer.  Also had
   trop leak likely secondary to demand in the setting of RVR. Appreciate
   cards recs, restarted midodrine and florinef yesterday.
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   - Follow-up cards recs if any.
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - Family meeting today to discuss goals of care
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.
   - Vascular reccs
   # DM2:
   - ISS, hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - Hold citalopram while intubated
   # Hypothyrodism:
   - Continue levothyroxine
   FEN: TF, replete electrolytes
   PPx: Heparin SQ
   Access: PIVs, femoral CVL

","Summary:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation (afib), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post right lower extremity (RLE) bypass grafting and wound dehiscence. She was discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from the vascular service to rehab and was readmitted with afib with rapid ventricular response (RVR), tachypnea, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent failed extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been reintubated due to respiratory failure. The possible contributing factors include a left pleural effusion, chronic segmental pulmonary embolism (PE), and tumor invasion into the chest wall leading to increased work of breathing (WOB). Continuous mechanical ventilation is being provided.

2. Hypotension: The patient has baseline hypotension with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ranging from 80-90 mmHg. This could be related to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) or other underlying causes. Antibiotics have been started empirically due to leukocytosis, and cultures are pending. Monitoring urine output and adjusting antimicrobials based on culture data are recommended.

3. Cardiac issues: The patient's echoc"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension of unclear
   etiology on [**5-5**].  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on admission
   CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology. Less likely
   contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Could also be component
   of splinting leading to increased WOB given tumor invasion into chest
   wall.  Culture negative since readmission, although WBC trending up.
   Family refusing thoracentesis.  Concern that patient will fail
   extubation again so will need to clarify goals of care.
   - family meeting prior to extubation
   - Check RSBI, would consider SBT if appropriate pending family meeting.
   - Continue empiric vanc/ceftaz (started [**5-4**], today is day 5) given
   hypotension though low BP likely more related to atypical hemodynamics
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR.  Has
   paradoxical hemodynamics with blood pressure improving after intubation
   on [**5-5**].  Cards consulted and recommended restarting midodrine and
   florinef for adrenal insufficiency.   Switched from levophed to neo on
   [**5-7**] because of tachycardia.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - cards reccs
   - continue midodrine and florinef
   - wean neo as tolerated
   - Continue to monitor urine output
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Atrial size not commented on in recent ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].
   Heart failure likely secondary to (1) ischemic heart disease given
   severe vascular disease and (2) chronic PE with RV strain.  No evidence
   of acute, hemodynamically significant PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation
   likely secondary to structural heart disease and lung cancer.  Also had
   trop leak likely secondary to demand in the setting of RVR. Appreciate
   cards recs, restarted midodrine and florinef on [**5-7**].
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   - Follow-up cards recs
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.

   Imaging: TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
   right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.

   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension due to
   unclear physiology on [**5-5**].  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology.
   Less likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Repeat  TTE
   now with improved cardiac function (both LV and RV).  Lung CA invasion
   into chest wall also likely contributing to splinting and increased WOB
   when not on full assist control ventilation with sedation.  Patient now
   febrile to 100.6 overnight with most recent sputum culture with 4+ GNR
   with speciation pending.  Patient continues to defer thoracentesis, and
   unclear if she would benefit given that her oxygenation has not been an
   issue.  During SBT yesterday, periods of apnea may suggest high
   pre-test probability for extubation failure.
   - Family meeting today to discuss critical illness and readdress goals
   of care.
   - Continue sedation boluses. RSBI >100 today, so will defer SBT.  Can
   trial T piece trial today.
   - Continue empiric vanc/ceftaz (day [**5-21**]) for nosocomial pneumonia.
   - Follow-up culture data.
   # Fever: Concerning for infectious process, although leukocytosis
   trending down. Sputum gram stain with 4+ GNR, and patient also has
   femoral CVL.
   - Continue antimicrobials as above
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Consider pulling femoral CVL and re-siting.

   Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular function.  Afib likely
   secondary to impaired respiratory mechanics secondary to moderate

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and previous right lower extremity bypass grafting with wound dehiscence. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, hypotension, and tachypnea. The patient's current condition includes AMS (altered mental status), afib with RVR (atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response), fever, hypotension, and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture showed 4+ GNR (Gram-negative rods), indicating a possible hospital-acquired infection. This could lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis.

2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has been on pressors and requires ongoing hemodynamic support, which may suggest adrenal insufficiency as a contributing factor to her hypotension.

3. Right ventricular dysfunction: The patient's initial bedside TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) showed severe RV (right ventricular) dilation and hypokinesis, suggesting right heart strain or failure. This could be due to pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung cancer or acute processes such as pulmonary embolism.

4. Left pleural effusion: The patient has a moderate-sized left pleural effusion, which could contribute to restrictive"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension due to
   unclear physiology on [**5-5**].  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology.
   Less likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Repeat  TTE
   now with improved cardiac function (both LV and RV).  Lung CA invasion
   into chest wall also likely contributing to splinting and increased WOB
   when not on full assist control ventilation with sedation.  Patient now
   febrile to 100.6 overnight with most recent sputum culture with 4+ GNR
   with speciation pending.  Patient continues to defer thoracentesis, and
   unclear if she would benefit given that her oxygenation has not been an
   issue.  During SBT yesterday, periods of apnea may suggest high
   pre-test probability for extubation failure.
   - Family meeting today to discuss critical illness and readdress goals
   of care.
   - Continue sedation boluses. RSBI >100 today, so will defer SBT.  Can
   trial T piece trial today.
   - Continue empiric vanc/ceftaz (day [**5-21**]) for nosocomial pneumonia.
   - Follow-up culture data.
   # Fever: Concerning for infectious process, although leukocytosis
   trending down. Sputum gram stain with 4+ GNR, and patient also has
   femoral CVL.
   - Continue antimicrobials as above
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Consider pulling femoral CVL and re-siting.
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR.  Has
   paradoxical hemodynamics with blood pressure improving after intubation
   on [**5-5**].  Cards consulted and recommended restarting midodrine and
   florinef for adrenal insufficiency.   Switched from levophed to neo on
   [**5-7**] because of tachycardia.  Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   function.  Patient with continued pressor requirement.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - cards recs if any
   - continue midodrine and florinef
   - wean neo as tolerated with goal MAP>65
   - Continue to monitor urine output, goal UOP >30 cc/hr
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular function.  Afib likely
   secondary to impaired respiratory mechanics secondary to moderate
   pleural effusion and recurrent lung CA and less likely structural heart
   disease given improved surface echocardiogram.
   - Follow-up Cards recs if any
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and previous right lower extremity bypass grafting and wound dehiscence. She was discharged from the vascular service to rehabilitation but was readmitted due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, tachypnea, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient's course has been complicated by failed extubation, left pleural effusion, and infection.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fever, hypotension, and altered mental status. She is on mechanical ventilation and has an arterial line, multi-lumen central venous catheter, and peripheral intravenous lines. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 98/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her labs show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.3 K/uL and an elevated lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L.

The patient's imaging shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function, mild right ventricular dilation with mild global free wall hypokinesis, trace aortic regurgitation, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation."

   Imaging: TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
   right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension due to
   unclear physiology on [**5-5**].  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology.
   Less likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Repeat  TTE
   now with improved cardiac function (both LV and RV).  Lung CA invasion
   into chest wall also likely contributing to splinting and increased WOB
   when not on full assist control ventilation with sedation.  Patient now
   febrile to 100.6 overnight with most recent sputum culture with 4+ GNR
   with speciation pending.  Patient continues to defer thoracentesis, and
   unclear if she would benefit given that her oxygenation has not been an
   issue.  During SBT yesterday, periods of apnea may suggest high
   pre-test probability for extubation failure.
   - Family meeting today to discuss critical illness and readdress goals
   of care.
   - Continue sedation boluses. RSBI >100 today.   Can attempt PSV trial
   today, although unlikely to be successful.
   - Continue empiric vanc/ceftaz (day 6) for nosocomial pneumonia.
   - Follow-up culture data.
   # Fever: Concerning for infectious process, although leukocytosis
   trending down. Sputum gram stain with 4+ GNR, and patient also has
   femoral CVL.
   - Continue antimicrobials as above
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Consider pulling femoral CVL and re-siting after family meeting if
   plan to pursue further aggressive care.
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR.  Has
   paradoxical hemodynamics with blood pressure improving after intubation
   on [**5-5**].  Cards consulted and recommended restarting midodrine and
   florinef for adrenal insufficiency.   Switched from levophed to neo on
   [**5-7**] because of tachycardia.  Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   function.  Patient with continued pressor requirement.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - cards recs if any
   - continue midodrine and florinef
   - wean neo as tolerated with goal MAP>65
   - Continue to monitor urine output, goal UOP >30 cc/hr
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular function.  Afib likely
   secondary to impaired respiratory mechanics secondary to moderate
   pleural effusion and recurrent lung CA and less likely structural heart
   disease given improved surface echocardiogram.
   - Follow-up Cards recs if any
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension due to
   unclear physiology on [**5-5**].  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing to restrictive physiology. Less likely
   contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Repeat  TTE now with
   improved cardiac function (both LV and RV).  Lung CA invasion into
   chest wall also likely contributing to splinting and increased WOB when
   not on full assist control ventilation with sedation.  Patient now
   febrile to 100.6 overnight with most recent sputum culture with 4+ GNR
   with speciation pending.  Patient continues to defer thoracentesis, and
   unclear if she would benefit given that her oxygenation has not been an
   issue.  During SBT yesterday, periods of apnea may suggest high
   pre-test probability for extubation failure.  In discussion with
   patient
s daughter yesterday, she is accepting of terminal nature of
   patient
s illness and is agreeable to transition to comfort care as
   patient had previously expressed desire to not be prolonged vent
   dependent.  In discussion with patient
s sister/HCP, she was not ready
   to transition patient to CMO and wanted to think about it overnight.
   She does state that she understands the critical nature of the
   patient
s illness and low likelihood of successful extubation.
   - Family meeting today with daughter and sister to readdress goals of
   care
   - Continue vent support
   - Continue vanco and ceftaz (day [**6-20**]) for empiric coverage of HAP.
   - Follow-up culture data.
    # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR.  Has
   paradoxical hemodynamics with blood pressure improving after intubation
   on [**5-5**].  Cards consulted and recommended restarting midodrine and
   florinef for adrenal insufficiency.   Switched from levophed to neo on
   [**5-7**] because of tachycardia.  Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   function.  Patient with continued pressor requirement.
   - continue midodrine and florinef
   - wean neo as tolerated with goal MAP>65
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular function.  Afib likely
   secondary to impaired respiratory mechanics secondary to moderate
   pleural effusion and recurrent lung CA and less likely structural heart
   disease given improved surface echocardiogram.
   - Follow-up Cards recs if any
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - Family meeting today to discuss goals of care
   - Will update outpatient oncologist today.
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.
   - Vascular reccs
   # DM2:
   - ISS, hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - Hold citalopram while intubated

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and previous right lower extremity bypass grafting. She was admitted to the vascular service and later readmitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, hypotension, and tachypnea. The patient's condition has been complicated by failed extubation, left pleural effusion, and chronic segmental pulmonary embolism. She is currently febrile and has a positive sputum culture for gram-negative rods. The patient's oxygenation has not been an issue, and she has been on mechanical ventilation with sedation. Her daughter is agreeable to transition to comfort care, while her aunt wants to think about it overnight. The patient's goals of care need to be readdressed, and a family meeting will be held today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors such as left pleural effusion, chronic segmental PE, lung cancer invasion into the chest wall, and impaired respiratory mechanics. The patient continues to require ventilator support and may benefit from thoracentesis to relieve the pleural effusion.
2. Hypotension: The patient has baseline hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 80-90s. The initial hypotension may be related to atrial fibrillation with rapid"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension due to
   unclear physiology on [**5-5**].  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing to restrictive physiology. Less likely
   contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Repeat  TTE now with
   improved cardiac function (both LV and RV).  Lung CA invasion into
   chest wall also likely contributing to splinting and increased WOB when
   not on full assist control ventilation with sedation.  During SBT two
   days ago, periods of apnea may suggest high pre-test probability for
   extubation failure.  In discussion with patient
s daughter yesterday,
   she is accepting of terminal nature of patient
s illness and is
   agreeable to transition to comfort care as patient had previously
   expressed desire to not be prolonged vent dependent.  In discussion
   with patient
s sister/HCP, she was not ready to transition patient to
   [**Month/Year (2) 115**] and wanted to think about it overnight. This AM, patient
   sister/HCP agrees to [**Name (NI) 115**] code status and terminal extubation.
   - Morphine gtt and ativan prn
   - Plan for extubation later today
   - Per discussion with family, will continue neo for now.
   - Hold all other meds except for comfort.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and previous right lower extremity bypass grafting. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, hypotension, and tachypnea. The patient has been reintubated multiple times due to failed extubation attempts and has a moderate-sized left pleural effusion. There are also concerns about chronic segmental pulmonary embolism and lung cancer invasion into the chest wall contributing to respiratory issues. The patient's daughter is agreeable to transition to comfort care as the patient had previously expressed a desire not to be prolonged vent-dependent. The patient's sister/HCP initially wanted to think about it overnight but eventually agreed to transition the patient to comfort care with code status of DNR and terminal extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying lung cancer and previous failed extubation attempts.
2. Pleural effusion: The moderate-sized left pleural effusion can contribute to restrictive physiology and further respiratory compromise.
3. Chronic segmental pulmonary embolism: This could be a less likely contributing etiology to the patient's respiratory issues.
4. Lung cancer invasion into the chest wall: The invasion may lead to splinting and increased work of breathing when not on full assist control ventilation with sedation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and previous right lower extremity bypass grafting. She was discharged from the vascular service to rehabilitation and readmitted with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, tachypnea, hypotension, and respiratory failure. Her condition has been complicated by a failed extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to hypotension and tachypnea.
2. Possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged invasive ventilation.
3. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and peripheral vascular disease.
4. Wound dehiscence at the site of previous bypass grafting.
5. Complications related to diabetes mellitus type 2, such as hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.
6. Potential cardiac complications due to atrial fibrillation and previous bypass grafting, including arrhythmias or heart failure."

","Summary:
- The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and previous right lower extremity bypass grafting. She was discharged from vascular service to rehab but was readmitted due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, tachypnea, hypotension, and respiratory failure. Her current condition is complicated by failed extubation.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 39/27 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85%.
- The patient is on comfort measures only (CMO) and has been extubated. She is receiving morphine sulfate and lorazepam for comfort.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances.
- The patient has undergone multiple procedures and interventions, including invasive ventilation, arterial line placement, and administration of antibiotics.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and failed extubation, she may be at risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and previous antibiotic use indicate a possible"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 69-year-old woman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and previous radial artery bypass grafting, was admitted to the ICU due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, tachypnea, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition is comfort measures only, with morphine and lorazepam being administered as needed for comfort.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with respiratory failure, which is a critical condition that requires immediate medical attention. It can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in organ damage or failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This condition may compromise tissue perfusion and lead to organ dysfunction or failure if not promptly addressed.

3. Infection: The presence of elevated white blood cell count (WBC) suggests a potential infection. Monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent its progression and associated complications.

4. Coagulation Abnormalities: The prolonged prothrombin time (PT), elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and increased international normalized ratio (INR) indicate coagulation abnormalities. These abnormalities may increase the risk of bleeding complications.

5. Kidney Dysfunction: The elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels suggest kidney dysfunction"
