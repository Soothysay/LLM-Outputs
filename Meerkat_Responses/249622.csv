   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo f with hx of COPD, CAD, and PVD. Pt was admitted [**2102-6-29**] for
   initiation of chemotherapy for SCLC.  Treatment was complicated by
   tachycardia, hypoxia, altered mental status, febrile neutropenia, and
   paraneoplastic syndrome.  Pt was admitted to ICU yesterday for
   progressive hypoxia and altered mental status.
   #.  Hypoxia - Differential includes infectious (fevers), pulmonary
   hemorrhage secondary to malignancy, PE (although is on fondaparinux),
   transfusion associated acute lung injury, increased tumor
   burden/shunting from tumor in lungs, or volume overload (patient
   received fluids and blood products).  Cardiac ischemia is also
   possibility, given history of chronic stable angina, although patient
   had been ruled out for MI on [**7-10**].  COPD also less likely given no
   evidence of obstruction on exam.
   # Hypotension: persists (70/40) despite IVF boluses; pain medications
   may be contributing.  Will continue IVF boluses prn; will hold pain
   medication while sedated.
   # Sinus tachycardia - Unclear aetiology.  Fevers and anemia are high on
   the differential.  PE is also possibility.  Dehydration/hypovolemia
   other possibility.
   # Fevers - ? pneumonia vs. secondary to malignancy.  Other possible
   sources include Port, urine, skin.
   # Acute renal failure
 Initially appeared pre-renal secondary to
   increased insensible losses, now nearly anuric in face of increased
   IVF.
   # Pancytopenia - Likely chemotherapy related.  Supportive care, and
   transfusion as needed, when able.
   # Aspiration risk - Nectar thickened liquids, aspiration precautions.
   # CAD/PVD - Continue atorvastatin, Imdur.  Aspirin and clopidogrel had
   been held for Port placement.
   # Anemia - consider transfusion when patient's oxygenation and
   temperature permits.
   # Pain control - continue oxycodone SR and IR, gabapentin,
   acetaminophen
   # Lower extremity weakness/upper extremity dysmetria - thought
   secondary to paraneoplastic process, responds somewhat to IVIG.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, and PVD. She was admitted for initiation of chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Her treatment was complicated by tachycardia, hypoxia, altered mental status, febrile neutropenia, and paraneoplastic syndrome. She is currently in the ICU for progressive hypoxia and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's differential includes infectious causes, pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to malignancy, pulmonary embolism (PE), transfusion-associated acute lung injury, increased tumor burden/shunting from tumor in lungs, or volume overload.
2. Hypotension: The patient persists with low blood pressure despite intravenous fluid boluses, and pain medications may be contributing. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
3. Sinus tachycardia: The etiology of the patient's elevated heart rate is unclear and could be due to various factors such as fevers, anemia, PE, dehydration, or hypovolemia.
4. Fevers: The cause of the patient's fever is uncertain and could be due to pneumonia or secondary to malignancy. Other possible sources include the Port, urine, or skin.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient initially appeared to have pre-renal acute kidney injury secondary to increased insensible losses, but is now nearly anuric"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, and PVD. She was admitted for initiation of chemotherapy for SCLC. Treatment was complicated by tachycardia, hypoxia, altered mental status, febrile neutropenia, and paraneoplastic syndrome. The patient was admitted to the ICU yesterday for progressive hypoxia and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, hypotension, sinus tachycardia, fevers, acute renal failure, pancytopenia, aspiration risk, CAD/PVD, anemia, pain control, lower extremity weakness/upper extremity dysmetria, and lower extremity edema.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Infectious complications: The patient has fevers and pneumonia, which may indicate an ongoing infection. There is also a risk of further infections due to her immunocompromised state from chemotherapy.

2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and is currently experiencing hypotension, which could be related to cardiac issues. The ECHO report shows mild symmetric LVH and trivial aortic regurgitation, suggesting some cardiac abnormalities.

3. Respiratory complications: The patient has hypoxia and pneumonia, indicating respiratory distress. There is also a possibility of pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to malignancy or transfusion-associated acute lung injury"

   Assessment and Plan
   #.  Hypoxia - Differential includes infectious (fevers), pulmonary
   hemorrhage secondary to malignancy, PE (although is on fondaparinux),
   transfusion associated acute lung injury, increased tumor
   burden/shunting from tumor in lungs, or volume overload (patient
   received fluids and blood products).  Cardiac ischemia is also
   possibility, given history of chronic stable angina, although patient
   had been ruled out for MI on [**7-10**].  COPD also less likely given no
   evidence of obstruction on exam.
   - CTA chest to further characterize pulmonary infiltrates and assess
   for PE, before attempting diuresis.
   - Defer broadening antibiotic coverage for now, given unclear whether
   this is trul infectious.
   - Per Oncology team, can discuss with patient and family re:
   transitioning patient to CMO if no improvement.
   - continue Albuterol/ipratropium
   - Await echocardiogram to assess LV function.
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia - Unclear aetiology.  Fevers and anemia are high on
   the differential.  PE is also possibility.  Dehydration/hypovolemia
   other possibility.
   - Monitor response with IV fluids or PRBCs if patient can tolerate.
   .
   # Fevers - ? pneumonia vs. secondary to malignancy.  Other possible
   sources include Port, urine, skin.
   - F/U blood cultures, fever curve, and WBC count
   - Complete cefepime ([**7-5**]), vancomycin ([**7-3**]), metronidazole ([**7-8**]) for
   14 day course
   .
   # Acute renal failure - Likely pre-renal secondary to increased
   insensible losses.
   - Send urine electrolytes and eosinophils
   - Defer fluids for now, given pulmonary issues
   - Monitor changes in GFR
   - renally dose vancomycin/cefepime
   - Hold lisinopril, avoid nephrotoxins.
   .
   # Anemia - consider transfusion when patient's oxygenation and
   temperature permits.
   # Pain control - continue oxycodone SR and IR, gabapentin,
   acetaminophen
   # Lower extremity weakness/upper extremity dysmetria - thought
   secondary to paraneoplastic process, responds somewhat to IVIG.
   - Will readdress with outpatient neurologist and consider MRI once
   respiratory issues stabilized.
   # Pancytopenia - Likely chemotherapy related.  Supportive care, and
   transfusion as needed, when able.
   # Aspiration risk - Nectar thickened liquids, aspiration precautions.
   # CAD/PVD - Continue atorvastatin, Imdur.  Aspirin and clopidogrel had
   been held for Port placement.
   - Will restart ASA, Plavix

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxia. The patient has a history of chronic stable angina and presents with chest pain that resolved after administration of nitroglycerine. The patient also experienced pain in the lower jaw and back teeth, which resolved within 90 seconds. Neurology consult was requested for evaluation of possible [**Location (un) 2533**] [**Location (un) 3792**] Syndrome. The patient has low urine output and received a 500cc bolus x 3. The patient's allergies include penicillins, hives; Demerol (Injection) (Meperidine Hcl), hives; iodine, itching; latex, itching; and Betadine (Topical) (Povidone-Iodine), unknown. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on [**2102-7-14**] 10:15 AM and Cefepime on [**2102-7-14**] 08:28 PM. The patient is on multiple infusions including ICU medications and other medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

   Assessment and Plan
   HYPOTENSION -- probable related to narcotics administration.  Also
   consider sepsis, hypovolemia (although evidence for pulmonary edema).
   Plan iv fluid bolus, but limited by respiratory status.
   RENAL FAILURE -- Probable ATN.  Doubt hypovolemia.  Poor prognosis if
   no resolution of acute renal failure.
   SMALL CELL CA -- widely metastatic.  Rapidly progressive.  Palliative.
   DNR/DNI -- focus care on comfort as per discussion with family.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer, widely metastatic, and currently admitted to the ICU for hypotension. The patient's chief complaint is chest pain, which was resolved with nitroglycerine administration. The patient also experienced episodes of jaw pain overnight, which resolved spontaneously. 

The patient is non-communicative this morning but appears comfortable. He had an episode of hypotension during rounds, coinciding with the administration of narcotics. The patient has reduced urine output and is anuric this morning. The primary goal of care is comfort, as discussed with the family members.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, hives; Demerol (meperidine HCl), hives; iodine, itching; latex, itching; and Betadine (topical), unknown. The last dose of antibiotics was cefepime on 07/15/2102 at 08:00 AM and vancomycin on 07/15/2102 at 08:30 AM.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of morphine sulfate and other ICU medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, and PVD. She was admitted for initiation of chemotherapy for SCLC but experienced complications such as tachycardia, hypoxia, altered mental status, febrile neutropenia, and paraneoplastic syndrome. She was admitted to the ICU due to progressive hypoxia and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by the cessation of urine output, hypotension, and coughing with upper airway secretions. The family has expressed interest in hospice care, and the patient has been made comfort measures only (CMO) by the family. She is currently on morphine and ativan as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and altered mental status may indicate respiratory distress or failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is crucial.
2. Urine output failure: The patient's recent cessation of urine output should be closely monitored. This could indicate kidney dysfunction or acute kidney injury.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension needs to be managed appropriately to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.
4. Secretions and aspiration risk: The patient's coughing with upper airway secretions suggests a risk of aspiration. Measures should be taken to minimize this risk, such as maintaining a proper head position during feeding and using a thin consistency diet.

   tachycardia, hypoxia, altered mental status, febrile neutropenia, and
   paraneoplastic syndrome.  Pt was admitted to ICU yesterday for
   progressive hypoxia and altered mental status.
   #.  Hypoxia - Differential includes infectious (fevers), pulmonary
   hemorrhage secondary to malignancy, PE (although is on fondaparinux),
   transfusion associated acute lung injury, increased tumor
   burden/shunting from tumor in lungs, or volume overload (patient
   received fluids and blood products).  Cardiac ischemia is also
   possibility, given history of chronic stable angina, although patient
   had been ruled out for MI on [**7-10**].  COPD also less likely given no
   evidence of obstruction on exam.
   # Hypotension: persists (70/40) despite IVF boluses; pain medications
   may be contributing.  Will continue IVF boluses prn; will hold pain
   medication while sedated.
   # Sinus tachycardia - Unclear aetiology.  Fevers and anemia are high on
   the differential.  PE is also possibility.  Dehydration/hypovolemia
   other possibility.
   # Fevers - ? pneumonia vs. secondary to malignancy.  Other possible
   sources include Port, urine, skin.
   # Acute renal failure
 Initially appeared pre-renal secondary to
   increased insensible losses, now nearly anuric in face of increased
   IVF.
   # Pancytopenia - Likely chemotherapy related.  Supportive care, and
   transfusion as needed, when able.
   # Aspiration risk - Nectar thickened liquids, aspiration precautions.
   # CAD/PVD - Continue atorvastatin, Imdur.  Aspirin and clopidogrel had
   been held for Port placement.
   # Anemia - consider transfusion when patient's oxygenation and
   temperature permits.
   # Pain control - continue oxycodone SR and IR, gabapentin,
   acetaminophen
   # Lower extremity weakness/upper extremity dysmetria - thought
   secondary to paraneoplastic process, responds somewhat to IVIG.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of small cell carcinoma, who is currently in the ICU. He is experiencing hypoxemia due to pulmonary edema and aspiration, pneumonia attributed to aspiration, and oliguric renal failure. The patient's prognosis is guarded. The family desires to move him to home hospice if possible.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is stable with supplemental oxygen, but monitoring and maintaining SaO2 levels above 90% are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Pneumonia: The aspiration has led to pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of infection.
3. Renal failure: Oliguric renal failure indicates decreased urine output, and the rising creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. Proper management of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is essential to prevent further deterioration.
4. Small cell carcinoma: The advanced stage of small cell carcinoma indicates a poor prognosis, and palliative care should be considered to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
5. Aspiration: Since the patient has aspirated, there is a risk of recurrent aspiration events, which can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential infections.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory status, renal function, and cancer symptoms to provide comfort and support during the end-of-life journey."
