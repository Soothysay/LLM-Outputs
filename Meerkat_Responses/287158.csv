","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a chief complaint of melena (black, tarry stools) and anemia. He has a history of hypertension, myocardial infarction, and Parkinson's disease. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fatigue without dyspnea or chest pain. His hemoglobin level is measured at 19, indicating anemia, and his coagulation profile is normal. He has received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is being treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/60-85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue and melena. The physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show a normal coagulation profile, anemia, and an electrocardiogram showing left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI), and he is expected to remain in the ICU.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and Parkinson's disease who presented with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The source of the bleed is likely to be an upper GI source, as indicated by melena and a BUN/Cr ratio greater than 30. The patient's initial hemoglobin concentration (HCT) was 19, but it has improved to 23.4 after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 115/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient has a left bundle branch block (LBBB) on cardiac monitoring. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 531 mL and a total output of 150 mL since midnight, resulting in a positive balance of 381 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids at a rate of 62 mL/hr. 

The patient's physical examination reveals pallor but no other significant abnormalities. The patient's neurologic assessment is grossly intact, and he is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 15.4 K/uL, slightly low platelet count of 297 K"

   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency
 Unknown baseline.  Etiologies
   include pre-renal and chronic CKI due to HTN.  Likely pre-renal due to
   decrease in creatinine this AM.
   - continue to trend creatinine after blood products

   Agree with above excellent MS4 note. Mr. [**Known lastname 11390**] continues to be
   hemodynamically stable although he has had 2 episodes of melena since
   admission. HCT has not yet bumped appropriately but transfusions still
   on going. Plan to check serial HCTs today and transfuse to goal >25.
   Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] and holding ASA. Access is adequate with 2 18 gauge
   PIVs. Endoscopy plan per GI, if upper/lower tomorrow will give clears

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), Parkinson's disease, who was admitted for an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He presented with melena and a BUN/Cr > 30, indicating a likely upper GI source. The patient had a hemoglobin concentration (HCT) of 19 on admission and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight, with plans to give a third unit this morning. His hemodynamic parameters are stable, and he is currently being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed - The patient may continue to experience bleeding from the upper GI tract due to various etiologies such as NSAID-induced gastritis, slow-bleeding ulcers, arteriovenous malformations, varices, etc. Close monitoring and further evaluation through endoscopy are necessary to identify the source and determine appropriate treatment.

2. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency - The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated BUN and creatinine levels. The etiology of this condition includes pre-renal and chronic kidney injury due to hypertension. Monitoring trends in creatinine levels is important to assess the effectiveness of treatment and prevent further deterioration of renal function.

3. Parkinson's disease - The patient's Parkinson's disease requires continuation of his outpatient regimen of Sinemet 50/200. It is essential to maintain"

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB):
   Continued to pass melena/maroon stools overnight.  Remains
   hemodynamically stable. Continue PPI, active type and screen, transfuse
   to Hct ~25.  Plan for EGD/colonoscopy tomorrow, needs golytely prep.
   Keep NPO except for clears.  IV maintenance fluids.   Given very low
   hct and inappropriate bump to first two units will continue to monitor
   in ICU.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Secondary to UGIB and relative
   intravascular depletion.  Improved Cr to 1.4 with blood products and IV
   NS overnight.  Good urine output.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Elevated WBC without left shift, doubt infection as he
   doesn't appear toxic.  Has chronically elevated WBC - need to follow up
   with PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] crackles at right base, clear partially with deep
   breathing, may be atelectasis albeit will check CXR given transfusions
   - ?CHF vs. inflitrate in setting of leukocytosis.  Check UA.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly gentleman presenting with melena, or black, tarry stools, and a low hematocrit level of 19. He has been experiencing fatigue and anemia. The patient received a blood transfusion overnight and is currently receiving intravenous fluids. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/41 mmHg to 162/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient has a history of sulfa allergy and is currently taking various medications in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's melena suggests ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding. If not controlled, this could lead to further blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates impaired renal function. The ongoing blood loss and intravascular depletion can worsen renal function and potentially lead to acute kidney injury.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection or inflammation. However, the lack of other symptoms suggests that this might be a chronic elevation, and further investigation is needed.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and antihypertensive medications have been withheld due to the gastrointestinal bleed. Close"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and Parkinson's disease. He presents with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely of an upper GI source, indicated by melena and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine ratio greater than 30. The patient has received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently stable. The etiology of the upper GI bleed could include NSAID-induced gastritis, slow-bleeding ulcers, arteriovenous malformations, varices, etc.

The patient also has acute on chronic renal insufficiency with an unknown baseline. Possible etiologies include pre-renal and chronic kidney injury due to HTN. The patient's creatinine levels have decreased this morning, suggesting a likely pre-renal cause.

The patient has Parkinson's disease and will continue with his outpatient regimen of Sinemet 50/200 and Mirapex 0.125mg PO TID.

Additionally, the patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and CAD, with a past myocardial infarction (MI) while taking [Last Name (un) 11385]. Aspirin has been held due to the GI bleed.

The patient also has benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and urinary retention, for which he will continue with his outpatient regimen of Tol"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 year-old gentleman with CAD, HTN, Parkinson's who presents w/ GI
   bleed, likely of lower GI source given results on RBC tagged scan
   patient currently guardedly stable
   .
   1. GI bleed- lower source given negative EGD and scan possible
   etiologies include, arteriovenous malformations, diverticulosis, colon
   CA, hemerrhoids, etc.
   -- Active T&S
   -- Transfuse PRBCs for HCT <25
 given 4 units yesterday, 7 total
   -- Check q4h HCT
   -- Plan for C-scope today pending GI recs
   -- Continue pantoprazole IV BID
   -- hold ASA
   -- F/U GI recs
   -- F/U surgery recs
   -- Notify surgery if he becomes unstable
   -- Central line for more access?
   2. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency
 Unknown baseline.  Etiologies
   include pre-renal and chronic CKI due to HTN.  Likely pre-renal due to
   decrease in creatinine this AM.
   - continue to trend creatinine after blood products
   - H/H increased, BUN/Cr stable
 continue to monitor, likely back to
   baseline or close to baseline
   3. Leukocytosis
 unknown etiology
 baseline supposedly high
   -- Continue to monitor and trend
   -- afebrile, monitor for signs and symptoms of infection
   3. Parkinson's disease- continue outpatient regimen
   - Sinemet 50/200
   - Mirapex
 0.125mg PO TID
   .
   4. CHF/CAD s/p MI - According to the patient, past MI was in the
   setting of taking [**Last Name (un) 11385**].
   - Hold Aspirin due to GI bleed
   5. BPH and urinary retention - Continue outpatient regimen

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of CAD, HTN, and Parkinson's disease. He presented with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely from a lower GI source, as indicated by a negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and red blood cell (RBC) scan. The patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently guardedly stable. Further investigations are planned to identify the source of the GI bleed, including a colonoscopy (C-scope). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 63 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 136/57 to 169/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 inspiratory minutes (ins/min), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has a left bundle branch block (LBBB) on electrocardiogram (EKG). Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,395 mL and output of 2,040 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 20.6 thousand/mm³, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 12.1 g/dL, and acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. The patient's medication regimen includes pantoprazole, f"

   -- Continue pantoprazole IV BID
   -- hold ASA
   -- F/U GI recs
   -- F/U surgery recs
   -- Notify surgery if he becomes unstable
   -- Central line for more access?
   2. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency
 Unknown baseline.  Etiologies
   include pre-renal and chronic CKI due to HTN.  Likely pre-renal due to
   decrease in creatinine this AM.
   - continue to trend creatinine after blood products
   - H/H increased, BUN/Cr stable
 continue to monitor, likely back to
   baseline or close to baseline
   3. Leukocytosis
 unknown etiology
 baseline supposedly high
   -- Continue to monitor and trend
   -- afebrile, monitor for signs and symptoms of infection
   3. Parkinson's disease- continue outpatient regimen
   - Sinemet 50/200
   - Mirapex
 0.125mg PO TID

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and Parkinson's disease. He presents with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely from a lower GI source, as indicated by negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and red blood cell (RBC) tagged scan results.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. GI bleed: The patient has a lower GI bleed, and further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause. Possible etiologies include arteriovenous malformations, diverticulosis, colon cancer, hemorrhoids, etc. The patient is currently being monitored closely, and plans are in place for a colonoscopy and possible surgery depending on the situation.

2. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline renal function is unknown, but there is evidence of acute renal insufficiency. The etiology could be pre-renal or chronic kidney injury due to hypertension. Close monitoring of the patient's creatinine levels is necessary, and appropriate measures should be taken based on the trends.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, but the exact etiology is unknown. It could be due to infection or another underlying cause. The patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection, and the leukocytosis should be trended"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by hematemesis, bloody bruit over the abdomen, and passing red blood/maroon stools. The patient has received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and continues to show evidence of active bleeding. A massive hemorrhage transfusion protocol has been initiated, and the patient is receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, which is likely due to stress from the acute gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but they are being closely monitored in the ICU.

1. Hypovolemic shock: Due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, there is a risk of significant blood loss leading to hypovolemic shock.
2. Coagulopathy: Prolonged and excessive bleeding can lead to coagulopathy, which is characterized by impaired blood clotting mechanisms.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to critical illness and ongoing transfusions increases the risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bloodstream infections.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, as AKI can occur due to hypoperfusion, volume depletion, or the effects of certain medications.
5. Liver dysfunction: Prolonged hypotension and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and Parkinson's disease. The patient presents with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely of lower GI source, as indicated by negative upper endoscopy (EGD) and tagged scan results. The patient is currently guardedly stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. GI bleed: The patient has received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 1 unit of platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Active monitoring of hemoglobin/hematocrit (H/H) levels is planned, with plans for a colonoscopy today pending gastrointestinal recommendations. Pantoprazole IV will continue to be administered twice daily, and aspirin will be held. If the patient becomes unstable, surgery will be notified.

2. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient has an unknown baseline renal function, and potential etiologies include pre-renal and chronic kidney injury due to HTN. The BUN/Cr ratio has been stable, indicating improvement, but close monitoring is recommended.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, but the etiology is unknown. Baseline levels reportedly in the teens. Continued monitoring is advised, and there is no indication for culture or work-up at this time.

   89 year-old gentleman with CAD, HTN, Parkinson's who presents w/ GI
   bleed, likely of lower GI source given results on RBC tagged scan
   patient currently guardedly stable
   .
   1. GI bleed- lower source given negative EGD and scan possible
   etiologies include, arteriovenous malformations, diverticulosis, colon
   CA, hemerrhoids, etc.
   -- Active T&S
   -- Transfuse PRBCs for HCT <25
 has received a total of 7 units PRBC
   also received 1unit plts and 1 unit ffp
   -- Check HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   -- Plan for C-scope today pending GI recs
   -- Continue pantoprazole IV BID
   -- hold ASA
   -- F/U GI recs
   -- Notify surgery if he becomes unstable
   2. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency
 Unknown baseline.  Etiologies
   include pre-renal and chronic CKI due to HTN.  Likely pre-renal
   component because of interval improvement. BUN decreased further today.
   - H/H increased, BUN/Cr stable
 continue to monitor, likely back to
   baseline or close to baseline
   3. Leukocytosis
 unknown etiology
 baseline reportedly in the teens
   -- Continue to monitor and trend
 decreasing
 No indication for
   culture or work-up

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and Parkinson's disease who presented with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely of lower GI source. He has received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 1 unit of platelets, and 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). His hemoglobin concentration (HCT) peaked at 34 last night and is now 30.8. The patient is currently guardedly stable.

Potential medical complications:
1. GI bleed - lower source: The patient has a negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and scan, suggesting possible etiologies such as arteriovenous malformations, diverticulosis, colon cancer, hemorrhoids, etc. Active bleeding and transfusion requirements should be closely monitored.
2. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient has an unknown baseline renal function, with possible pre-renal and chronic kidney injury due to HTN. The BUN/Cr ratio is stable, indicating improvement. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to an infection or another underlying cause. Monitoring and trending the white blood cell count is essential. There is no indication for culture or work-up at this time.
4. Parkinson's disease"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and Parkinson's disease who presented with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The source of the bleed is likely from a lower GI source, as indicated by the negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and tagged scan. The patient has received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 1 unit of platelets, and 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). His hemoglobin concentration has improved from 30.8% to 32.1%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature within normal range. The patient is currently guardedly stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient is at risk of further bleeding due to the suspected lower GI source. Monitoring for signs of active bleeding and ongoing blood product transfusion may be necessary.
2. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to pre-renal causes such as dehydration from the GI bleed. Close monitoring of renal parameters and fluid balance is essential.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to infection or stress response"

","The patient in the ICU has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) secondary to diverticulosis. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have remained stable, and they are not experiencing any pain or nausea. The patient is now stable enough for transfer to the medical floor. It is recommended to discontinue the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and continue holding aspirin.

Additionally, the patient has renal insufficiency, which is currently stable. The patient experienced hypoglycemia overnight and required dextrose 50% to correct it. Since the patient is now taking clear liquids, they should advance their diet as tolerated and follow finger sticks to monitor blood glucose levels.

The patient also has Parkinson's disease and should continue with their current regimen.

In terms of ICU care, nutrition is being provided, and glycemic control is being monitored. The patient has an 20-gauge line placed. Prophylaxis measures include boots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and they are being prepared for transfer to the medical floor."
