","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, recent discharge for viral myocarditis, and coffee ground emesis at home. He has been diagnosed with GI bleed, colitis, and possible aspiration pneumonia based on chest CT. His Hct is 26 and he is currently being transfused. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but he is experiencing worsening oxygen needs. He has allergies to penicillins and is on multiple medications including pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, levofloxacin, vancomycin, and flagyl. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, mild respiratory distress, and crackles in the chest. His lab results indicate anemia, leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and impaired kidney function. Imaging shows multilobar pneumonia throughout the right lung and old surgical clips.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's worsening oxygen needs and crackles in the chest suggest the possibility of aspiration pneumonia, which is a serious condition that can occur when foreign material enters the lungs.
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's critical condition, history of GI bleed, and presence of fever, there is a potential risk of sepsis, which is a life-threatening infection that can lead to organ failure.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: With a history of Hepatitis C and possible cirrhosis, the patient may be at risk for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions. The patient's gastrointestinal endoscopy showed signs of gastritis, which is inflammation of the stomach lining. The patient is currently on proton pump inhibitors (PPI) to manage this condition.

The patient also underwent an echocardiogram, which revealed several cardiac abnormalities. These include a moderately dilated left atrium and right atrium, normal left ventricular wall thickness, normal left ventricular cavity size, hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction of 70-80%), no ventricular septal defect, mildly dilated ascending aorta, mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets, no valvular aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, structurally normal mitral valve with trivial mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. These findings suggest the presence of some cardiac issues that require further evaluation and management.

Additionally, the patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension, acute viral hepatitis, hypoxemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, depression, seizure, coronary artery disease, acute myocarditis, alcohol abuse, and anxiety.

The patient's vital signs indicate a stable condition with a slightly elevated heart rate range of 96 bpm. Blood pressure is within normal limits, respiratory rate is within the normal range, and oxygen saturation is at 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,143 mL and output of 1,245 mL, with a positive balance of 1,898 mL.

Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels slightly below the normal range, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver enzyme levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medication regimen includes pantoprazole (Protonix), morphine sulfate, and various antibiotics.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple medical conditions requiring ongoing monitoring and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 y/o M w/ hep C recently admitted for NSTEMI/myocarditis
   who now represents with coffee ground emesis.
   .
   # GI Bleed: Certainly possible gastritis, some concern for variceal
   bleeding given h/o liver disease.  Possibly ulcer disease, AVM or other
   upper GI source.  New finding of colitis on colonoscopy not likely
   source for bleed but may explain guaiac positive stool.
   - PPI ggt, avoid NSAID's
   - q6H HCt overnight
   - type and cross 2 units
   - large bore IV's
   - d/w GI regarding plans for scope
   .
   # Hypoxemia/Pneumonia: Recently hospitalized, fever, WBC count, and CT
   findings of infiltrate.  Likely [**2-25**] to aspiration of gastric contents.
   Could be sequelae of initial viral infection vs. true bacterial
   infection vs. pneumonitis.  Would also consider pulmonary vasculitis
   given renal involvement as well.
   - culture with sputum, blood,
   - cover with vanco/levo/flagyl empirically for now and peel off when
   possible
   - rule out with viral panel for influenza.
   - Wean from NRB as tolerated with venti mask.
   - Check ABG
   .
   # Tachycardia: volume depletion from bleeding vs. sepsis.  Low
   suspicion for etoh withdrawal as patient emphatically denies etoh
   abuse.  Does take benzo's as outpatient so would worry about benzo
   withdrawal.  Would consider tamponade given h/o myo-pericarditis.
   - IVF's
   - Transfuse PRN for Hct < 27
   - Ativan PRN for anxiety
   - Check pulsus given h/o myopericarditis
   .
   # Myo-pericarditis: Troponin trending down and CK flat.
   - Trend enzymes,
   - Echo for effusion and to r/o tamponade as cause for tachycardia.
   # Colitis: Ischemic vs. inflammatory
   - Check stool studies
   - Check C. Diff
   - Cover with meropenem +flagyl and d/w ID whether flagyl has any added
   benefit in spectrum.  Would also discuss whether he needs scope.
   .
   # Hepatitis: Await EGD to evaluate for varices.  consider viral load.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, recently admitted for NSTEMI/myocarditis. He now presents with coffee ground emesis, suggesting a possible gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. There are concerns for variceal bleeding due to his history of liver disease, as well as the possibility of an ulcer, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), or other upper GI source. The patient has been diagnosed with gastritis based on an upper GI scope. He also has hypoxemia and pneumonia, likely due to aspiration of gastric contents or bacterial infection. The patient is experiencing tachycardia, which could be caused by volume depletion from bleeding or sepsis. There is also a concern for tamponade given his history of myo-pericarditis. The patient has colitis, possibly ischemic or inflammatory in nature. He has hepatitis, and his blood pressure is being monitored for hypertension. The patient requires prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and his nutritional needs are being met. 

Potential medical complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient's coffee ground emesis suggests a possible GI bleed. This could lead to hypotension, shock, and organ failure if not managed promptly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and CT findings indicate pneumonia. If left untreated, it can progress to severe respiratory distress and systemic infection.

   - GI scoped: Impression: Erythema, congestion and friability in the
   antrum compatible with gastritis
   [**Doctor First Name 1862**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear
   Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
   Recommendations: No active bleeding seen, no varices.
   Continue PPI twice daily.
   Continue to monitor Hct and transfuse to Hct>26.
   - spoke to ID, on vanc/[**Last Name (un) **], no flagyl or levo
   - midnight Hct stable after transfusion
   - echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic
   function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). There is no ventricular septal
   defect. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic
   stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high
   cardiac output. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
   effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   - no significant hx of cirrhosis

   ground emesis and asp pna vs. HAP.
   .
   # GI Bleed: Certainly possible gastritis, some concern for variceal
   bleeding given h/o liver disease.  Possibly ulcer disease, AVM or other
   upper GI source.  New finding of colitis on colonoscopy not likely
   source for bleed but may explain guaiac positive stool. Patient was
   initially placed on PPI ggt and was scoped by GI. Patient was
   transfused total of 2u PRBC, Hct stable. GI recs to place on PPI [**Hospital1 **],
   avoid NSAID's, saw [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1862**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear.

   # Hypoxemia/Pneumonia: Recently hospitalized, fever, WBC count, and CT
   findings of infiltrate.  Likely [**2-25**] to aspiration of gastric contents.
   Could be sequelae of initial viral infection vs. true bacterial
   infection vs. pneumonitis.  Would also consider pulmonary vasculitis
   given renal involvement as well. Patient currently on vanc/meropenem.
   History is more consistent with HAP vs  asp pna than CAP. Responding
   well to current abx, O2 req weaned from ventimask to NC 2L sats 95%.
   - f/u cultures sputum, blood
   - will treat with vanc/meropenem for 14 day course given severe hap
   pna.
   - if respikes, can cover for atypicals with azithromycin vs. levo
   - rule out with viral panel for influenza, until then cont droplet
   precautions
   - continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   # Tachycardia: resolved, volume depletion from bleeding vs. sepsis.
   Low suspicion for etoh withdrawal as patient emphatically denies etoh
   abuse.  Does take benzo's as outpatient so would worry about benzo
   withdrawal.  Would consider tamponade given h/o myo-pericarditis.
   .
   # Myo-pericarditis: Troponin trending down and CK flat.  Echo, no
   evidence of effusion or tamponade.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) after taking high-dose ibuprofen for a new diagnosis of myopericarditis. The patient had coffee ground emesis and aspirated gastric contents, leading to aspiration pneumonia (ASP). He was initially placed on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and underwent an upper gastrointestinal (GI) scope. The patient received a total of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has a stable hematocrit (Hct). The GI recommendations include continuing PPI therapy, avoiding nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and addressing the tear seen during the scope. The patient's recent hospitalization, fever, white blood cell count, and computed tomography (CT) findings of an infiltrate suggest aspiration of gastric contents. This could be sequelae of an initial viral infection, a true bacterial infection, or pneumonitis. The patient is currently on vancomycin and meropenem. The history is more consistent with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) rather than aspiration pneumonia (ASP), and the patient is responding well to the current antibiotic therapy. Oxygen requirements have been weaned from a ventilator mask to a nasal cannula with oxygen saturation (O2 sat) at 95%. Sputum and blood cultures are being followed up, and the patient will continue to be treated with vancomycin and mer"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a middle-aged male admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of shortness of breath and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has a history of ethanol abuse, hepatitis, hypertension, myositis, pulmonary hypertension, and alcohol abuse. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding. 

On examination, the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 138/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation in the assist-control mode (RA). The physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, normal heart sounds, and normal peripheral pulses. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to patient's unresponsiveness.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 14.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, platelet count of 217 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.75 ng/mL, and elevated levels of ALT and AST. Imaging shows stable right infiltrates on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleed with blood loss anemia, hypertension, colitis (awaiting Clostridium difficile testing), myositis (improving with enzymes),"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath (SOB) and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which revealed gastritis and a Mallory-Weiss tear. The patient also had an echocardiogram showing hyperdynamic left ventricle and pulmonary artery hypertension. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole infusion and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/79 mmHg to 142/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is alert and oriented, with crackles in the right lung. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated troponin T, and altered liver function tests. The patient has a history of hepatitis, ethanol abuse, hypertension, colitis, myocarditis, alcohol abuse, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient is being weaned off respiratory support and is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of SOB and crackles in the right lung may indicate pneumonia. Monitoring for worsening respiratory symptoms and considering appropriate antibiotic treatment is important.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The EGD findings of gastritis and a Mallory-"

   This is a 51 y/o M w/ hep C who presented with UGIB after 3d of high
   dose ibuprofen for new dx of myopericarditis manifested by coffee
   ground emesis and asp pna vs. HAP.
   .
   # GI Bleed: Certainly possible gastritis, some concern for variceal
   bleeding given h/o liver disease.  Possibly ulcer disease, AVM or other
   upper GI source.  New finding of colitis on colonoscopy not likely
   source for bleed but may explain guaiac positive stool. Patient was
   initially placed on PPI ggt and was scoped by GI. Patient was
   transfused total of 2u PRBC, Hct stable. GI recs to place on PPI [**Hospital1 **],
   avoid NSAID's, saw [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1862**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -2  large bore IV's
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Initial Abd/Pelvis CT concerning for ?ischemic
   colitis but f/u CTA did not reveal ischemic colitis.  Abdominal pain
   likely related GI bleed -> gastritis, MW tear, PUD and colitis.  Could
   also be [**2-25**] R-sided PNA.
   - continue to follow serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Hypoxemia/Pneumonia: Recently hospitalized, fever, WBC count, and CT
   findings of infiltrate.  Likely [**2-25**] to aspiration of gastric contents.
   Could be sequelae of initial viral infection vs. true bacterial
   infection vs. pneumonitis.  Would also consider pulmonary vasculitis
   given renal involvement as well. Patient currently on vanc/meropenem.
   History is more consistent with HAP vs  asp pna than CAP. Responding
   well to current abx, O2 req weaned from ventimask to NC 2L sats 95%.
   - f/u cultures sputum, blood -> NGTD
   - will treat with levaquin for 5-day course for CAP
   - rule out with viral panel for influenza, until then cont droplet
   precautions
   - continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   # Tachycardia: resolved, volume depletion from bleeding vs. sepsis.
   Low suspicion for etoh withdrawal as patient emphatically denies etoh
   abuse.  Does take benzo's as outpatient so would worry about benzo
   withdrawal.  Would consider tamponade given h/o myo-pericarditis.
   .
   # Myo-pericarditis: Troponin trending down and CK flat.  Echo, no
   evidence of effusion or tamponade.
   # Colitis: Ischemic vs. inflammatory, treatment covered with anaerobic
   coverage of 14d course of meropenem for HAP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) after taking high doses of ibuprofen for new-onset myopericarditis. The patient had coffee ground emesis and was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia versus hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). 

The patient was initially placed on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and underwent an upper gastrointestinal (GI) scope. He received a total of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and his hemoglobin concentration (Hct) remained stable. The patient was advised to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and to continue PPI therapy. 

The patient also presented with abdominal pain, which was initially concerning for ischemic colitis but subsequent computed tomography angiography (CTA) did not reveal any signs of ischemic colitis. The abdominal pain is likely related to the GI bleed, causing gastritis, a Mallory-Weiss tear, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and colitis. 

Additionally, the patient had hypoxemia and pneumonia, which may have been caused by aspiration of gastric contents. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and meropenem. His oxygen requirement has been weaned from a ventimask to a nasal cannula with oxygen saturation (O2 sat) at 95%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities including pulmonary hypertension, hepatitis, hypertension, depression, seizure disorder, coronary artery disease, myocarditis, alcohol abuse, and anxiety. The patient presented to the hospital with diffuse abdominal pain and was found to have signs of ischemic colitis on CT scan. The patient's lactate levels have been normal since admission. The patient's air in the portal system has resolved on repeat CT angiography, indicating possible improvement in colitis. Antibiotic therapy has been changed to vancomycin and levofoxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and flagyl has been added for colitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119-147/60-93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving pantoprazole infusion and morphine sulfate as needed for pain. The patient's fluid balance is positive due to ongoing IV fluids. The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, slightly low hematocrit, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's ABG reveals a slightly alkalotic pH, elevated bicarbonate, normal oxygen saturation, and slightly decreased partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The patient's chest X-ray shows"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 y/o M w/ hep C who presented with UGIB after 3d of high
   dose ibuprofen for new dx of myopericarditis manifested by coffee
   ground emesis and asp pna vs. HAP.
   .
   # GI Bleed: Certainly possible gastritis, some concern for variceal
   bleeding given h/o liver disease.  Possibly ulcer disease, AVM or other
   upper GI source.  New finding of colitis on colonoscopy not likely
   source for bleed but may explain guaiac positive stool. Patient was
   initially placed on PPI ggt and was scoped by GI. Patient was
   transfused total of 2u PRBC, Hct stable. GI recs to place on PPI [**Hospital1 **],
   avoid NSAID's, saw [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1862**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear.
   - HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -2  large bore IV's
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Initial Abd/Pelvis CT concerning for ?ischemic
   colitis but f/u CTA did not reveal ischemic colitis.  Abdominal pain
   likely related GI bleed -> gastritis, MW tear, PUD and colitis.  Could
   also be [**2-25**] R-sided PNA.
   - continue to follow serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Hypoxemia/Pneumonia: Recently hospitalized, fever, WBC count, and CT
   findings of infiltrate.  Likely [**2-25**] to aspiration of gastric contents.
   Could be sequelae of initial viral infection vs. true bacterial
   infection vs. pneumonitis.  Would also consider pulmonary vasculitis
   given renal involvement as well. Patient currently on vanc/meropenem.
   History is more consistent with HAP vs  asp pna than CAP. Responding
   well to current abx, O2 req weaned from ventimask to NC 2L sats 95%.
   - f/u cultures sputum, blood
   - will treat with vanc/meropenem for 14 day course given severe HAP
   pna.
   - if respikes, can cover for atypicals with azithromycin vs. levo
   - rule out with viral panel for influenza, until then cont droplet
   precautions
   - continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   # Tachycardia: resolved, volume depletion from bleeding vs. sepsis.
   Low suspicion for etoh withdrawal as patient emphatically denies etoh
   abuse.  Does take benzo's as outpatient so would worry about benzo
   withdrawal.  Would consider tamponade given h/o myo-pericarditis.
   .
   # Myo-pericarditis: Troponin trending down and CK flat.  Echo, no
   evidence of effusion or tamponade.
   # Colitis: Ischemic vs. inflammatory, treatment covered with anaerobic
   coverage of 14d course of meropenem for HAP.
   - Check stool studies
   - Check C. Diff
   .
   # Hepatitis: Await EGD to evaluate for varices.  consider viral load.
   .
   # HTN: Hold outpatient medications.
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   - for Na 147, given D5W 500cc bolus
   .
   # Prophylaxis: no SQH given GIB, pneumoboots and ambulation
   .
   # Access: peripherals

   # Code: full

   # Disposition: HCT stable, O2 requirement weaned, stable for floor

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) after taking high-dose ibuprofen for new-onset myopericarditis. The patient has been experiencing diffuse abdominal pain, and recent investigations have shown signs of ischemic colitis on CT scan, although this finding was not confirmed on repeat CT angiography (CTA). The patient's lactate levels have been normal since admission.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.8°C (100.1°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate (HR) of 81 bpm with a range of 81-95 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 147/89 mmHg with a range of 102-151/60-93 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 26 breaths per minute with a range of 14-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient has been receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion at a rate of 8 mg/hour, along with other ICU medications including morphine sulfate. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the diffuse abdominal pain.
