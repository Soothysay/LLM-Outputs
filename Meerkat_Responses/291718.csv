   24 Hour Events:
   Had episode of nausea/vomiting and diarrhea. Zofran given with
   resolution of symptoms. C.Diff sent, and has come back negative. Stool
   guiaic negative.
   Also had episode of SBP 190-210s/100-115 overnight. C/o headache.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year-old female with a history of ESRD on HD and PD, hypertension
   who presents with uncontrolled hypertension and gram negative
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Gram negative bacteremia - Possible sources include dialysis
   catheter, peritoneal cathetheter, or other intra-abdominal source.
   Peritoneal fluid negative for infection. Breast tenderness is chronic
   and likely related to venous clots.  No evidence of abscess on
   ultrasound, so unlikely to be source of infection given chronicity.
   - Gentamicin 60mg IV x 1 given, double coverage with ciprofloxacin 400
   q24 until gram negatives speciated
   - F/u on repeat blood cultures from today
   - CIS
   - Per renal, will check Gent level after HD. If </=1.3, will re-dose
   Gent 60mg IV x 1.
   - Also, renal recs advise keeping HD catheter in, as pt with limited
   availability for alternate HD access. Will consider removing if not
   other source found for bacteremia, and symptoms persist.
    .
   #Breast pain: Breast tenderness is chronic and likely related to venous
   clots.  No evidence of abscess on ultrasound, so unlikely to be source
   of infection given chronicity. Pt had recent breats u/s which showed
   only breast edema. Pt would prefer not to have mammogram, due to pain
   of test.
   - Will have breast surgery consulted
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   #Chest pain: episode of chest pain this morning substernal pressure,
   but no signs MI on EKG. Pain improved mildly with NG. Also increases
   with inspiration, which is more consistent with a pleuritic etiology.
   - Will repeat EKG this afternoon.
   - Follow serial CE
   - Follow up on CXR this a.m.
   - Morphine prn pain.
   .
   # Hypertension
 Per pt, baseline at home is 120/80.  However, only
   missed 4 days of low-dose atenolol, and now BP elevated in 170s, and
   episode of BP in 200s last pm.
   - Continue home Atenolol 12.5 daily and  titrate Captopril up
   (currently 6.25mg TID) as tolerated.
   .
   # ESRD
 Pt on HD Mon/Fri and  regular PD.  Receiving HD today per
   renal.
   - Continue lanthanum, sevelamer, Iron, vitamin D, cinacalcet
   - 2-3kg to removed via HD today, as PD has been ineffective
   - Renal to stop by today with TPA for PD tubing to remove any potential
   clots
   .
   # Psych
 Stable.
   - Continue citalopram
   .
   # Chronic Pain
 Controlled.
   - Continue gabapentin
   .
   # FEN:  Renal diet
   .
   # Access: HD catheter, PD tubing, and 2 peripheral  IV
   .
   # PPx:  Came in on Warfarin. Heparing gtt started today to prevent
   further IJ thromboses, given extensive hx of similar clots.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), as well as hypertension. She presented with uncontrolled hypertension and gram-negative bacteremia. The potential sources of infection include the dialysis catheter, peritoneal catheter, or other intra-abdominal sources. Peritoneal fluid was negative for infection. The patient also experienced breast tenderness, which is likely related to venous clots, and chest pain with a substernal pressure but no signs of myocardial infarction on EKG.

Medical Complications:
1. Gram-negative bacteremia: The patient has an infection caused by gram-negative bacteria, possibly from the dialysis catheter, peritoneal catheter, or another intra-abdominal source. Antibiotics were administered, and blood cultures are pending.
2. Breast pain: The patient's breast tenderness is likely due to venous clots. No evidence of abscess was found on ultrasound, making it unlikely to be the source of infection.
3. Chest pain: The patient experienced substernal chest pressure that improved mildly with nitroglycerin. It is more consistent with a pleuritic etiology rather than a myocardial infarction. Further evaluation is needed.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with fatigue and had episodes of nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and high blood pressure. The patient's symptoms resolved with the administration of Zofran, and C. diff was sent for testing. The patient's blood pressure was managed with Hydralazine and later with Captopril. The patient underwent peritoneal dialysis, and effluent was sent for cell count and culture. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/91 to 133/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, glucose levels, prolonged PT/PTT/INR, slightly elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, high LDH, normal calcium and magnesium levels, and normal phosphate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated temperature, white blood cell count, and the presence of diarrhea raise concerns about the possibility of an infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
2. Hypotension: The patient's initial blood pressure readings were significantly high, and it was necessary to administer Hydralazine and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), hypertension, and recent episodes of nausea/vomiting and diarrhea. She presented with uncontrolled hypertension and gram-negative bacteremia. The possible sources of bacteremia include the dialysis catheter, peritoneal catheter, or other intra-abdominal sources. Breast tenderness is chronic and likely related to venous clots. Surveillance cultures from dialysis catheter and peripheral blood cultures were ordered. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is receiving appropriate medications for her conditions, including antibiotics for gram-negative bacteremia, antihypertensives, and medications for ESRD, psych issues, and chronic pain. The patient's code status is full code, and she is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has gram-negative bacteremia, which can potentially lead to sepsis if not properly managed. Close monitoring of vital signs and regular assessment of infection parameters are essential.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated despite medication adjustments. Regular monitoring and appropriate antihypertensive therapy are necessary to prevent complications associated with uncontrolled hypertension, such as stroke or cardiac events.
3. Dialysis Catheter Complications: The patient's dialysis catheter could potentially become a source of infection or"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple health concerns, including bacteremia, fever, hypertension, chronic renal failure, and potential chest pain. They experienced episodes of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, elevated blood pressure with headache, and substernal chest pain. The patient has been undergoing dialysis and receiving various medications. Their vital signs have been monitored, showing fluctuations in temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Laboratory results indicate abnormal levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes. Imaging tests reveal cardiomegaly on a chest X-ray and a normal sinus rhythm on an electrocardiogram. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of their vital signs, electrolyte levels, and potential complications such as vascular infection, ischemia, and thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Vascular source of infection: Given the positive blood cultures, there is a major concern for a vascular source of infection, possibly the dialysis catheter. This could lead to further systemic infection and complications.
2. Ischemic chest pain: The patient's chest pain this morning is worrisome for ischemia, despite a normal electrocardiogram. This could potentially lead to a myocardial infarction or other cardiac complications.
3. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of vascular thrombosis, which increases the risk of blood clot formation and potential"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year-old female with a history of ESRD on HD and PD, hypertension
   who presents with uncontrolled hypertension and gram negative
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Gram negative bacteremia - Possible sources include dialysis
   catheter, peritoneal cathetheter, or other intra-abdominal source.
   Peritoneal fluid negative for infection. Breast tenderness is chronic
   and likely related to venous clots.  No evidence of abscess on
   ultrasound, so unlikely to be source of infection given chronicity. No
   signs of pulmonary infection clinically.
   - Gentamicin 60mg IV x 1 given ([**6-22**]), double coverage with
   ciprofloxacin 400 q24 ([**6-22**]) until gram negatives speciated. One set of
   cultures show pansensitive.
   - F/u on repeat blood cultures from today
   - CIS
   - Gent level after HD was 2.4. If as >1.3, will hold off on re-dosing
   Gent 60mg IV.
   - Will have HD catheter replaced over wire tomorrow by IR
    .
   #Breast pain: Breast tenderness is chronic and likely related to venous
   clots.  No evidence of abscess on ultrasound, so unlikely to be source
   of infection given chronicity. Pt had recent breast u/s which showed
   only breast edema. Pt would prefer not to have mammogram, due to pain
   of test.
   - Pending breast surgery consult
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   #Chest pain: episode of chest pain [**6-23**], substernal pressure, but no
   signs MI on EKG. Pain improved mildly with NG. Also increases with
   inspiration, which is more consistent with a pleuritic etiology. Chest
   pain continued overnight to today, described now more like heartburn.
   Improves after Maalox Repeat EKG this a.m. showed no change.  [**Month (only) 60**] be GI
   related.
   - Will repeat EKG as necessary
   - Follow-up on final set of CE
s this a.m.
   - Follow up on CXR this a.m.
   - Will start PPI daily (hx of PPI use, but d/c
ed in distant for
   unclear reasons)
   - Maalox also for PRN heartburn
   .
   # Hypertension
 Per pt, baseline at home is 120/80.  However, only
   missed 4 days of low-dose atenolol, and BP early in stay  elevated in
   170s, and episode of BP in 200s in p.m. [**6-22**]. BP improved after HD and
   regular dosing of BP meds.
   - Continue home Atenolol 12.5 daily and Captopril 6.25 tid, titrate up
   as necessary.
   .
   # ESRD
 Pt on HD Mon/Fri and  regular PD.  Received HD 7/30 per renal
   as pt unable to do regular PD while line clotted.
   - Continue lanthanum, sevelamer, Iron, vitamin D, cinacalcet
   - 2-3kg to removed via HD yesterday, as PD has been ineffective
   - Renal to stop by today with TPA for PD tubing to remove any potential
   clots
   .
   # Psych
 Stable.
   - Continue citalopram
   .
   # Chronic Pain
 Controlled.
   - Continue gabapentin
   .
   # FEN:  Renal diet
   .
   # Access: HD catheter, PD tubing, and 2 peripheral  IV
s (right hand
   PIV removed, new PIV placed in left hand)
   .
   # PPx:  Came in on Warfarin.
   - Heparin gtt started [**6-23**] to prevent further IJ thromboses, given
   extensive hx of similar clots. Will adjust as necessary to maintain
   therapeutic levels. Transition to Warfarin if no HD catheter removal
   anticipated prior to discharge.
   - PPI daily.
   - Pneumoboots
   .
   # Code:  Full code
   .
   # Dispo:  will likely call out to floor today, as symptoms much
   improved and pt hemodynamically stable on current antibiotic regimen.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), as well as hypertension. She presents with uncontrolled hypertension and gram-negative bacteremia. The possible sources of infection include the dialysis catheter, peritoneal catheter, or other intra-abdominal sources. Peritoneal fluid is negative for infection, and there is no evidence of abscess on ultrasound. The patient's breast tenderness is chronic and likely related to venous clots. There are no signs of pulmonary infection clinically. 

The patient's chest pain is described as substernal pressure and heartburn-like symptoms, which improve with Maalox. The EKGs show no changes. The patient's hypertension is controlled with atenolol and captopril. The patient is on regular HD and PD but received an additional HD yesterday due to ineffective PD. The renal team will stop by today with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for PD tubing to remove any potential clots.

Psychologically, the patient is stable, and she continues on citalopram. Her chronic pain is controlled with gabapentin. The patient follows a renal diet and has access to HD catheter, PD tubing, and peripheral IV lines. She was previously on warfarin but is now on heparin gtt to prevent further inferior vena c"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year-old female with a history of ESRD on HD and PD, hypertension
   who presents with uncontrolled hypertension and gram negative
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Gram negative bacteremia - Possible sources include dialysis
   catheter, peritoneal cathetheter, or other intra-abdominal source.
   Peritoneal fluid negative for infection. Breast tenderness is chronic
   and likely related to venous clots.  No evidence of abscess on
   ultrasound, so unlikely to be source of infection given chronicity.
   - Gentamicin 60mg IV x 1 given ([**6-22**]), double coverage with
   ciprofloxacin 400 q24 ([**6-22**]) until gram negatives speciated
   - F/u on repeat blood cultures from today
   - CIS
   - Gent level after HD was 2.4. If as >1.3, will hold off on re-dosing
   Gent 60mg IV.
   - Also, renal recs advise keeping HD catheter in, as pt with limited
   availability for alternate HD access. Will consider removing if not
   other source found for bacteremia, and symptoms persist.
    .
   #Breast pain: Breast tenderness is chronic and likely related to venous
   clots.  No evidence of abscess on ultrasound, so unlikely to be source
   of infection given chronicity. Pt had recent breats u/s which showed
   only breast edema. Pt would prefer not to have mammogram, due to pain
   of test.
   - Pending breast surgery consult
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   #Chest pain: episode of chest pain [**6-23**], substernal pressure, but no
   signs MI on EKG. Pain improved mildly with NG. Also increases with
   inspiration, which is more consistent with a pleuritic etiology. Chest
   pain continued overnight to today, described now more like heartburn.
   Improves after Maalox Repeat EKG this a.m. showed no change.  [**Month (only) 60**] be GI
   related.
   - Will repeat EKG as necessary
   - Follow-up on final set of CE
s this a.m.
   - Follow up on CXR this a.m.
   - Maalox for possible heartburn-type pain
   .
   # Hypertension
 Per pt, baseline at home is 120/80.  However, only
   missed 4 days of low-dose atenolol, and now BP elevated in 170s, and
   episode of BP in 200s in p.m. [**6-22**]. BP improved over yesterday after HD
   and regular dosing of BP meds.
   - Continue home Atenolol 12.5 daily and Captopril 6.25 tid, titrate up
   as necessary.
   .
   # ESRD
 Pt on HD Mon/Fri and  regular PD.  Received HD 7/30 per renal
   as pt unable to do regular PD while line clotted.
   - Continue lanthanum, sevelamer, Iron, vitamin D, cinacalcet
   - 2-3kg to removed via HD yesterday, as PD has been ineffective
   - Renal to stop by today with TPA for PD tubing to remove any potential
   clots
   .
   # Psych
 Stable.
   - Continue citalopram
   .
   # Chronic Pain
 Controlled.
   - Continue gabapentin
   .
   # FEN:  Renal diet
   .
   # Access: HD catheter, PD tubing, and 2 peripheral  IV
   .
   # PPx:  Came in on Warfarin. Heparing gtt started [**6-23**] to prevent
   further IJ thromboses, given extensive hx of similar clots. Will adjust
   as necessary to maintain therapeutic levels. ?Transition to Warfarin if
   no HD catheter removal anticipated prior to discharge.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), hypertension, and bacteremia.
- She complains of fatigue, right shoulder pain, chest pain described as heartburn or gas, left shoulder pain, and right hand edema and pain at the site of IV.
- Vital signs are stable, with blood pressure in the 140s and temperature within normal range.
- Blood cultures were obtained and EKGs were performed, showing no change from yesterday.
- The patient is tolerating oral intake and has been receiving additional HD yesterday.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the mentioned complaints.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, potassium, and lactate dehydrogenase levels.
- The assessment includes uncontrolled hypertension, gram-negative bacteremia, breast tenderness, chest pain, and ESRD.
- Plan includes continuing antibiotics, monitoring repeat blood cultures, considering breast surgery consult, repeating EKGs as necessary, following up on chest X-ray, and administering Maalox for possible heartburn-type pain.
- Hypertension management involves continuing home atenolol and captopril, with titration as needed.
- ESRD management includes continuing regular PD and HD, with removal of clotted PD line.
- Psychologically, the patient remains stable.
- Chronic pain is controlled.
- Renal diet and access management are also addressed.
- Anticoagulation therapy with heparin is initiated due to extensive history of similar clots, and consideration for transitioning to warfarin is discussed.
- Code status is set to full code, and the patient is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gram-negative bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with gram-negative bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not promptly treated.
2. Uncontrolled hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication, increasing the risk of complications such as stroke, heart attack, and kidney damage.
3. Breast tenderness and potential venous clots: The patient's breast tenderness may be related to venous clots, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if they dislodge and travel to the lungs.
4. Chest pain and potential gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's chest pain could be related to gastrointestinal issues, but further evaluation is needed to rule out any cardiac causes.
5. ESRD and complications related to dialysis: The patient's end-stage renal disease increases the risk of complications associated with dialysis, including infection, bleeding, and vascular access problems.
6. Anticoagulation therapy: The initiation of heparin therapy carries its own risks, including bleeding complications, especially in a patient with ESRD.
7. Potential need for surgical intervention: The patient may require a breast surgery consult to address the tenderness and potential clots, which could involve additional surgical risks.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details or tests may be necessary to fully assess the patient's condition and potential complications."

   home, not with better bp control and doing well. recurrent chest pain
   not cardiac, responding to maalox.
   -continue gentamicin for presumed line infection; stop cirpo (will
   speak with ID/Renal whether there is any benefit to double-cover)
   -defer to renal whether line needs to be changed; may need to speak
   with ED
   -continue atenolol and caproptil for bp control
   -pd catheter needs to be declotted by tpa
   -continue heparin gtt for clots
   -restart ppi for presumed gerd, to be further evaluate as outpt; maaloz
