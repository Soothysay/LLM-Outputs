","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with hepatic and renal failure. The patient has known spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is a type of intra-abdominal infection. There have been unsuccessful attempts at performing diagnostic paracentesis three times. The patient also has worsening abdominal discomfort, tachypnea, hepatic failure, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Systemic or intra-abdominal infection: The patient has known SBP, and there is concern for a systemic infection or resistant SBP due to worsening abdominal discomfort. The patient requires broadened antibiotic coverage, including Zosyn and [Doctor Last Name].

2. Bleeding or perforation: The patient underwent a third unsuccessful attempt at diagnostic paracentesis, resulting in 5 cc of bright red blood. A stat abdominal CT is needed to rule out bleeding or perforation.

3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has tachypnea, and a V/Q scan was negative for PE. However, given the new right middle lobe infiltrates, there is concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

4. Hepatic failure: The patient has moderate pulmonary hypertension on TTE and a MELD score of 41, indicating severe liver disease. The most likely cause of hepatic failure is alcoholic hepatitis, and further work-up is pending.

5. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): Given the low urine Na and poor response to intravenous fluids, HRS is suspected. Treatment includes daily albumin, octreotide SC, and midodrine.

6. Anemia: The patient has stable hemoglobin levels, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of anemia.

7. Alcoholism: The patient has a history of alcoholism, but currently shows no signs of withdrawal. Continued folate, thiamine, and multivitamin supplementation is recommended.

8. GERD: The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy should be continued.

9. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient requires close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance, including renal diet and hypokalemia management.

10. Procedural considerations: The patient requires pneumoboots for procedures, and type and screen should be active due to the possibility of transfusion.

11. Communication and disposition: The patient's husband should be informed of any acute changes, and the patient is being transferred to the ICU for overnight care."

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with hepatic and renal failure. She has worsening abdominal discomfort, suspected systemic or intra-abdominal infection such as resistant spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Diagnostic tap attempts have been unsuccessful, and there is concern for bleeding or perforation. An abdominal CT scan is planned to rule out these complications and evaluate for infection. Blood cultures, urine culture, and a diagnostic tap after the CT scan will be done to assess the progression of SBP.

The patient also has tachypnea, which was initially thought to be compensatory for metabolic acidosis and a distended abdomen. However, new right middle lobe infiltrates are concerning for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). A V/Q scan and lower extremity Doppler were negative for pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, respectively. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

Hepatic failure is present, with a MELD score of 41, likely due to alcoholic hepatitis. Steroids have been stopped due to a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). Pyridoxine has been started for alcoholic treatment, and lactulose will be given prn for goal 2-4 bowel movements. Rifaximin and treatment for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) with daily albumin, octreotide, and midodrine are ongoing.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with hepatic and renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they show signs of tachycardia and potential metabolic acidosis. The patient has worsening abdominal discomfort, likely due to systemic infection or intra-abdominal infection such as resistant spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Diagnostic taps have been attempted without success, and a third tap resulted in bright red blood. An abdominal CT scan is planned to rule out bleeding or perforation. Blood cultures and a urine culture have also been ordered to evaluate for infection. Broadened antibiotic coverage has been initiated.

The patient also has tachypnea, which was initially suspected to be due to a possible pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, a V/Q scan and LENI test were negative for PE and DVT. The patient may be compensating for metabolic acidosis and a distended abdomen. New right middle lobe infiltrates raise concerns for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Moderate pulmonary hypertension was demonstrated on a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on [**2155-11-17**].

The patient has hepatic failure with a MELD score of 41, most likely caused by alcoholic hepatitis. Steroids were previously administered but were stopped due to a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). Pyridox"

   53 year old female with hx of alcoholism presents with hepatic and

   .
   # Worsening abdominal discomfort:  Concern for systemic infection or
   intra-abdominal infection such as resistant SBP. Attempted diagnositic
   tap X 3 without success, 3rd tap 5 cc bright red blood per floor team.
   On imaging the patient has a bilateral pneumonia which may have pleural
   involvement, which may be the etiology of her abdominal pain (referred
   pain). Currently we are treating for both SBP and PNA. CT A/P showed
   multifocal pneumonia and ascites, no evidence of intraabdominal
   bleeding.
   - continue treatment for SBP per liver recs
   - f/u blood and urine culture
   - ? need for diagnostic tap (it may not tell us anything new at this
   point, also currently covered on broad-spec abx)
   - continue vanco, zosyn

   # Multilobar PNA: Tachypnea on admission. [**2155-11-17**] V/Q scan negative
   for PE. LENI negative for DVT.  Patient is most likely compensating for
   metabolic acidosis and distended abdomen.  On imaging patient has
   multifocal pneumonia (? Aspiration) which may also be part of the
   process causing tachypnea. Covering with broad spectrum antibiotics.
   -continue abx
   -f/u cultures
   -ABG if begins to decompensate
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Most likely cause is alcoholic hepatitis given the
   report of negative etiologies from OSH. Currently has pending hepatic
   work-up pending, labs that have returned include:
   CEA 5.8, AFP 1.8, Hep B negative, AMA/[**Doctor First Name **] negative, Hep C negative,
   ceruloplasmin negative, Ca [**65**]-9 elevated
   Ferritin significantly elevated at 1446, Iron 48, TIBC 47. AFP 1.8.
   Liver is continuing to follow, and feels her prognosis is getting worse
   secondary to worsening SBP. Will continue midodrine, octreotide,
   lactulose. At this point it is unclear if a diagnostic tap will help
   given she is on broad spectrum antibiotics and we have a good source of
   infection that could cause.
   - Pyridoxine 25 mg PO DAILY [**2155-11-18**] for alcoholic treatment

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with hx of alcoholism presents with hepatic and
   renal failure.
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Most likely cause is alcoholic hepatitis given the
   report of negative etiologies from OSH. Currently has pending hepatic
   work-up pending, labs that have returned include:
   CEA 5.8, AFP 1.8, Hep B negative, AMA/[**Doctor First Name **] negative, Hep C negative,
   ceruloplasmin negative, Ca [**65**]-9 elevated
   Ferritin significantly elevated at 1446, Iron 48, TIBC 47. AFP 1.8.
   Liver is continuing to follow, and feels her prognosis is getting worse
   secondary to worsening SBP. Will continue midodrine, octreotide,
   lactulose.
   - Pyridoxine 25 mg PO DAILY [**2155-11-18**] for alcoholic treatment
   - expanded SBP coverage to vanc and zosyn
   - lactulose tid for goal [**2-4**] BM, continue rifaximin
   - Treat HRS with daily albumin, octreotide SC and midodrine
   - f/u pending labs and cultures
   - will d/w liver/kidney about renal status and need for pentoxilfylline
   .
   # Multilobar PNA: Tachypnea on admission. [**2155-11-17**] V/Q scan negative
   for PE. LENI negative for DVT.  Patient is most likely compensating for
   metabolic acidosis and distended abdomen.  On imaging patient has
   multifocal pneumonia (? Aspiration) which may also be part of the
   process causing tachypnea. Covering with broad spectrum antibiotics.
   -continue abx
   -f/u cultures
   -ABG if begins to decompensate
   .
   # Worsening abdominal discomfort:  Concern for systemic infection or
   intra-abdominal infection such as resistant SBP. Attempted diagnositic
   tap X 3 without success, 3rd tap 5 cc bright red blood per floor team.
   On imaging the patient has a bilateral pneumonia which may have pleural
   involvement, which may be the etiology of her abdominal pain (referred
   pain). Currently we are treating for both SBP and PNA. CT A/P showed
   multifocal pneumonia and ascites, no evidence of intraabdominal
   bleeding on CT.  [**Month (only) 51**] perform additional paracentesis to assess fluid.
   - continue treatment for SBP per liver recs
   - f/u blood and urine culture
 currently negative
   - continue vanco, zosyn
   -may perform additional tap [**11-20**]
 diagnostic and therapeutic

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with hepatic and renal failure. She has been diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, as indicated by negative etiologies from OSH and elevated levels of liver enzymes. The patient's prognosis is worsening due to worsening spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She is currently receiving treatment with midodrine, octreotide, lactulose, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient also has multilobar pneumonia, which may be aspiration-related, and is being treated with antibiotics. Additionally, she has worsening abdominal discomfort, which could be due to systemic infection or intra-abdominal infection such as resistant SBP. Diagnostic tapping has been attempted three times without success, and the third tap showed bright red blood. Imaging shows bilateral pneumonia and ascites, but no evidence of intra-abdominal bleeding.

The patient exhibits signs of hepatic encephalopathy, evidenced by waxing and waning levels of consciousness. She is being treated with lactulose to manage this condition.

The patient's renal function is impaired, and there is a possibility of hepatorenal syndrome. She is receiving albumin, octreotide, and midodrine for treatment.

The patient has anemia, but it does not appear to be actively bleeding. She is on multivitamins, pyridoxine, and has received a total of 120 meq of K.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver function is severely compromised, leading to hepatic encephalopathy and potential progression to liver cirrhosis or liver failure.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, which may progress to acute renal failure (ARF) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
3. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient's worsening SBP increases the risk of sepsis and systemic infection.
4. Multilobar Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen and lead to respiratory failure, especially considering her compromised lung function due to alcoholism.
5. Abdominal Complications: The patient's abdominal discomfort could indicate intra-abdominal infection or bleeding, which may require surgical intervention.
6. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status may continue to deteriorate due to hepatic encephalopathy and other factors.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further complications.
8. Alcoholism: The patient's history of alcoholism increases the risk of further organ damage and complications.

Overall, the patient is facing multiple complex medical complications that require close monitoring and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with hx of alcoholism presents with hepatic and
   renal failure.
   .
   # Worsening abdominal discomfort:  Concern for systemic infection or
   intra-abdominal infection such as resistant SBP. Attempted diagnositic
   tap X 3 without success, 3rd tap 5 cc bright red blood per floor team.
   On imaging the patient has a bilateral pneumonia which may have pleural
   involvement, which may be the etiology of her abdominal pain (referred
   pain). Currently we are treating for both SBP and PNA. CT A/P showed
   multifocal pneumonia and ascites, no evidence of intraabdominal
   bleeding.
   - continue treatment for SBP per liver recs
   - f/u blood and urine culture
   - ? need for diagnostic tap (it may not tell us anything new at this
   point, also currently covered on broad-spec abx)
   - continue vanco, zosyn
   .
   # Multilobar PNA: Tachypnea on admission. [**2155-11-17**] V/Q scan negative
   for PE. LENI negative for DVT.  Patient is most likely compensating for
   metabolic acidosis and distended abdomen.  On imaging patient has
   multifocal pneumonia (? Aspiration) which may also be part of the
   process causing tachypnea. Covering with broad spectrum antibiotics.
   -continue abx
   -f/u cultures
   -ABG if begins to decompensate
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Most likely cause is alcoholic hepatitis given the
   report of negative etiologies from OSH. Currently has pending hepatic
   work-up pending, labs that have returned include:
   CEA 5.8, AFP 1.8, Hep B negative, AMA/[**Doctor First Name **] negative, Hep C negative,
   ceruloplasmin negative, Ca [**65**]-9 elevated
   Ferritin significantly elevated at 1446, Iron 48, TIBC 47. AFP 1.8.
   Liver is continuing to follow, and feels her prognosis is getting worse
   secondary to worsening SBP. Will continue midodrine, octreotide,
   lactulose. At this point it is unclear if a diagnostic tap will help
   given she is on broad spectrum antibiotics and we have a good source of
   infection that could cause.
   - Pyridoxine 25 mg PO DAILY [**2155-11-18**] for alcoholic treatment
   - Expand SBP coverage to vanc and zosyn
   - lactulose tid for goal [**2-4**] BM, continue rifaximin
   - Treat HRS with daily albumin, octreotide SC and midodrine
   - f/u pending labs and cultures
   .
   # ARF: Given low urine Na and poor response to IVF, most likely
   hepatorenal syndrome.
   -Continue 1g/kg albumin daily, Octreotide SC and Midodrine
   -monitor UOP, Cr
   .
   # Anemia: Stable 24-26. Stool brown, guaiac negative. Patient has had
   no prior scopes to document varices.  It does not appear that she is
   actively bleeding at this point.
   - active type and screen
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Alcoholism: No signs of withdrawal. On multivitamins, pyridoxine.
   -Con't Folate, thiamine, MVI
   .
   # GERD: Con't PPI
   .
   # FEN: renal diet, hypoK this am - has received total of 120 meq of K.
   .
   # PPx: pneumoboots for now pending procedures.
   .
   # Access: PIV

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with hepatic and renal failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including worsening abdominal discomfort, multilobar pneumonia, hepatic failure, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition are:
1. Systemic infection or intra-abdominal infection such as resistant spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
2. Hepatic encephalopathy due to hepatic failure.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) secondary to hepatic failure.
4. Malnutrition due to impaired nutritional intake.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and risk factors.
6. Stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding due to increased gastric acid production.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
8. Respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to severe respiratory failure.
9. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to underlying chronic liver disease.
10. Cirrhosis-related complications such as portal hypertension and esophageal varices.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms to prevent further deterioration and manage these potential complications effectively."

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. However, the note does mention several significant events that occurred over the past 24 hours.

The patient has no known drug allergies and has received antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), on different dates.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (94 bpm) and low oxygen saturation (94%). Blood pressure is within normal range. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,131 mL and output of 1,494 mL since midnight, indicating a positive fluid balance of 637 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and has an ABG result of ///17/. This suggests some respiratory acidosis, but further analysis is needed to determine the severity and underlying cause.

The patient's physical examination is incomplete as peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments, and other body systems were not assessed.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, low total CO2, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab values show abnormalities in liver function tests, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase.

The patient's assessment includes pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, altered mental status, respiratory acidosis, fulminant hepatic failure, acute renal failure, and acute"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with hx of alcoholism presents with hepatic and
   renal failure.
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Most likely cause is alcoholic hepatitis given the
   report of negative etiologies from OSH. Currently has pending hepatic
   work-up pending, labs that have returned include:
   CEA 5.8, AFP 1.8, Hep B negative, AMA/[**Doctor First Name **] negative, Hep C negative,
   ceruloplasmin negative, Ca [**65**]-9 elevated
   Ferritin significantly elevated at 1446, Iron 48, TIBC 47. AFP 1.8.
   Liver is continuing to follow, and feels her prognosis is getting worse
   secondary to worsening SBP. Will continue midodrine, octreotide,
   lactulose, pentoxilfylline
   - Pyridoxine 25 mg PO DAILY [**2155-11-18**] for alcoholic treatment
   - expanded SBP coverage to vanc and zosyn
   - lactulose tid for goal [**2-4**] BM, continue rifaximin
   - Treat HRS with daily albumin, octreotide SC, midodrine, and
   pentoxifylline
   - cont following labs and cultures
   .
   # PNA: Tachypnea on admission. [**2155-11-17**] V/Q scan negative for PE. LENI
   negative for DVT.  Patient is most likely compensating for metabolic
   acidosis and distended abdomen.  On imaging patient has multifocal
   pneumonia (? Aspiration) which may also be part of the process causing
   tachypnea.  Aslo with waxing [**Doctor Last Name 533**] periods of consciousness.  Sputum

   to increase free water boluses via NGT, pt auto
d NGT, switched to
   D5W.
   - will check PM lytes, adjust IVF
   .
   # Abdominal discomfort:  Concern for systemic infection or
   intra-abdominal infection such as resistant SBP. Attempted diagnositic
   tap X 3 without success, 3rd tap 5 cc bright red blood per floor team.
   On imaging the patient has a bilateral pneumonia which may have pleural
   involvement, which may be the etiology of her abdominal pain (referred
   pain). Currently we are treating for both SBP and PNA. CT A/P showed
   multifocal pneumonia and ascites, no evidence of intraabdominal
   bleeding on CT.  IR to attempt additional paracentesis to assess fluid,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with hepatic and renal failure. She has been diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, hepatic encephalopathy, pneumonia, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and she has hypernatremia, anemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient may experience worsening confusion, altered mental status, and possible coma due to the buildup of toxins in the brain caused by liver dysfunction.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.
3. Renal failure: The patient's kidneys may continue to deteriorate, leading to further fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and potentially requiring dialysis.
4. Infections: The patient is at risk for various infections, including pneumonia, SBP, and catheter-related bloodstream infections, due to compromised immune function and prolonged ICU stay.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can worsen if not managed properly.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's ability to receive adequate nutrition through enteral feeding may be compromised due to her altered mental status and potential intolerance"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with hx of alcoholism presents with hepatic and
   renal failure.
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Most likely cause is alcoholic hepatitis given the
   report of negative etiologies from OSH. Currently has pending hepatic
   work-up pending, labs that have returned include:
   CEA 5.8, AFP 1.8, Hep B negative, AMA/[**Doctor First Name **] negative, Hep C negative,
   ceruloplasmin negative, Ca [**65**]-9 elevated
   Ferritin significantly elevated at 1446, Iron 48, TIBC 47. AFP 1.8.
   Liver is continuing to follow, and feels her prognosis is getting worse
   secondary to worsening SBP. Will continue midodrine, octreotide,
   lactulose.
   - Pyridoxine 25 mg PO DAILY [**2155-11-18**] for alcoholic treatment
   - expanded SBP coverage to vanc and zosyn
   - lactulose tid for goal [**2-4**] BM, continue rifaximin
   - Treat HRS with daily albumin, octreotide SC and midodrine
   - f/u pending labs and cultures
   - will d/w liver/kidney about renal status and need for pentoxilfylline
   .
   # Multilobar PNA: Tachypnea on admission. [**2155-11-17**] V/Q scan negative
   for PE. LENI negative for DVT.  Patient is most likely compensating for
   metabolic acidosis and distended abdomen.  On imaging patient has
   multifocal pneumonia (? Aspiration) which may also be part of the
   process causing tachypnea. Covering with broad spectrum antibiotics.
   -continue abx
   -f/u cultures
   -ABG if begins to decompensate
   .
   # Worsening abdominal discomfort:  Concern for systemic infection or
   intra-abdominal infection such as resistant SBP. Attempted diagnositic
   tap X 3 without success, 3rd tap 5 cc bright red blood per floor team.
   On imaging the patient has a bilateral pneumonia which may have pleural
   involvement, which may be the etiology of her abdominal pain (referred
   pain). Currently we are treating for both SBP and PNA. CT A/P showed
   multifocal pneumonia and ascites, no evidence of intraabdominal
   bleeding on CT.  [**Month (only) 51**] perform additional paracentesis to assess fluid.
   - continue treatment for SBP per liver recs
   - f/u blood and urine culture
 currently negative
   - continue vanco, zosyn
   -may perform additional tap [**11-20**]
 diagnostic and therapeutic

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with hepatic and renal failure. She has multiple medical complications, including hypernatremia, pneumonia, altered mental status, respiratory acidosis, fulminant hepatic failure, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently being treated for systemic infection, intra-abdominal infection such as resistant spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and multi-lobar pneumonia. She is also receiving treatment for hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, and alcoholism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and neurological symptoms.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multi-lobar pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of secondary infections.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is compromised due to hepatic encephalopathy, which can result in confusion, disorientation, and impaired decision-making abilities.
4. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient's respiratory system is unable to eliminate enough carbon dioxide, leading to acidosis. This can cause respiratory distress and complications.
5. Fulminant Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver function has deteriorated rapidly, resulting in liver failure. This can lead to severe complications such as bleeding, jaundice, and hepatic encephalopathy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with hepatic and renal failure. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic failure: The patient has signs of worsening liver function, indicated by elevated liver enzymes, low albumin levels, and coagulopathy. This could lead to further deterioration in liver function and potential development of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy.

2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level and low urine output. This could progress to acute renal failure, which may require dialysis.

3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient has an increased white blood cell count in the ascites fluid, suggesting SBP. If left untreated, this can lead to sepsis and potentially death.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which may be due to aspiration. This can worsen respiratory status and increase the risk of sepsis.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are increasing, indicating a risk of hypernatremia. This condition can cause neurological symptoms and should be corrected promptly.

6. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): Given the patient's low urine sodium and poor response to intravenous fluids, there is a concern for HRS. This syndrome can lead to worsening renal function and is often associated with"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with hx of alcoholism presents with hepatic and
   renal failure.
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Most likely cause is alcoholic hepatitis given the
   report of negative etiologies from OSH. Currently has pending hepatic
   work-up pending, labs that have returned include:
   CEA 5.8, AFP 1.8, Hep B negative, AMA/[**Doctor First Name **] negative, Hep C negative,
   ceruloplasmin negative, Ca [**65**]-9 elevated
   Ferritin significantly elevated at 1446, Iron 48, TIBC 47. AFP 1.8.
   Liver is continuing to follow, and feels her prognosis is getting worse
   secondary to worsening SBP. Will continue midodrine, octreotide,
   lactulose, pentoxilfylline

   # PNA: Tachypnea on admission. [**2155-11-17**] V/Q scan negative for PE. LENI
   negative for DVT.  Patient is most likely compensating for metabolic
   acidosis and distended abdomen.  On imaging patient has multifocal
   pneumonia (? Aspiration) which may also be part of the process causing
   tachypnea.  Aslo with waxing [**Doctor Last Name 533**] periods of consciousness.  Sputum

   to increase free water boluses via NGT, pt auto
d NGT, switched to
   D5W.
   - will check PM lytes, adjust IVF
   .
   # Abdominal discomfort:  Concern for systemic infection or
   intra-abdominal infection such as resistant SBP. Attempted diagnositic
   tap X 3 without success, 3rd tap 5 cc bright red blood per floor team.
   On imaging the patient has a bilateral pneumonia which may have pleural
   involvement, which may be the etiology of her abdominal pain (referred
   pain). Currently we are treating for both SBP and PNA. CT A/P showed
   multifocal pneumonia and ascites, no evidence of intraabdominal
   bleeding on CT.  IR to attempt additional paracentesis to assess fluid,
   if unable hepatology is available for addt

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with hepatic and renal failure. She has been diagnosed with several medical complications including hepatic failure, suspected alcoholic hepatitis, pneumonia, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hypernatremia, altered mental status, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and potential liver-related complications such as hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and hepatomegaly.

The patient underwent diagnostic paracentesis which revealed fluid with a significant amount of white blood cells, indicating potential infection. She also had an invasive ventilation procedure initiated due to concerns about continuing aspiration. The patient was intubated to protect her airway and sedated with propofol and versed.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), pantoprazole (Protonix), lorazepam (Ativan), midodrine, octreotide, lactulose, pentoxifylline, pyridoxine, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. She is also receiving tube feeds with hypoK this morning.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.4°C
- Heart rate: 117 bpm
- Blood pressure: 135/57 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition appears to be complex and critical. The note indicates multiple medical complications that have arisen. Here are the summarized information and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- The patient underwent a diagnostic paracentesis due to fluid accumulation in the abdomen.
- The patient's condition worsened, leading to invasive ventilation support.
- The patient is experiencing hypernatremia (high sodium levels) and acidosis.
- There is evidence of pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, altered mental status, hepatic failure, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: High sodium levels in the body can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and neurological symptoms.
2. Acidosis: Respiratory acidosis occurs when there is an excess of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream due to inadequate breathing or lung function. This can result in decreased oxygen levels and organ dysfunction.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: Poor skin condition may indicate pressure ulcers, infections, or poor tissue perfusion.
4. Ineffective Coping: This refers to the patient's inability to deal with stressors effectively, which could be related to their mental status changes or overall health condition.
5. Altered Mental Status: Changes in mental status, such as confusion or disorientation, may be a result of various factors, including infections, organ dysfunction, or medication effects.
6. Hepatic Failure: Fulminant hepatic failure indicates"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with hx of alcoholism presents with hepatic and
   renal failure.
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Most likely cause is alcoholic hepatitis given the
   report of negative etiologies from OSH. Currently has pending hepatic
   work-up pending, labs that have returned include:
   CEA 5.8, AFP 1.8, Hep B negative, AMA/[**Doctor First Name **] negative, Hep C negative,
   ceruloplasmin negative, Ca [**65**]-9 elevated
   Ferritin significantly elevated at 1446, Iron 48, TIBC 47. AFP 1.8.
   Liver is continuing to follow, and feels her prognosis is getting worse
   secondary to worsening SBP. Will continue midodrine, octreotide,
   lactulose, d/c
ing pentoxilfylline.  Tbili is improving
   - Pyridoxine 25 mg PO DAILY [**2155-11-18**] for alcoholic treatment
   - lactulose tid for goal [**2-4**] BM, continue rifaximin
   - Treat HRS with daily albumin, octreotide SC, midodrine
   - cont following labs and cultures
   .
   # PNA: Tachypnea on admission. [**2155-11-17**] V/Q scan negative for PE. LENI
   negative for DVT.  Patient is most likely compensating for metabolic
   acidosis and distended abdomen.  On imaging patient has multifocal
   pneumonia (? Aspiration) which may also be part of the process causing
   tachypnea.  Also with waxing [**Doctor Last Name 533**] periods of consciousness.  Sputum
   growing oropharyngeal flora. Covering with broad spectrum antibiotics.
   Intubated [**11-21**] and showed large amount of aspirate surrounding vocal
   cords
   -continue abx
   -f/u cultures
   -intubated

   # Peritonitis: tx
d for SBP, now concern for bowel injury s/p multiple
   attempts at paracentesis 2 days ago.  IR performed additional
   paracentesis [**11-21**] to assess fluid.
   - CT scan negative for blood or loculations, but IR paracentesis shows
   high WBC count
   - expanded suspected peritonitis coverage to vanc, zosyn, and adding
   flagyl for broader anaerobic coverage
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 slowly increasing Na over the past week.  Attempted
   to increase free water boluses via NGT, pt auto
d NGT, switched to
   D5W.
   - will check PM lytes, decreased D5W, start free water boluses per OGT
   .
   #Mental Status
 pt with evidence of waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] levels of
   consciousness with clear confusion in presence of liver failure
   suggestive of encephalopathy
   -lactulose TID
   -propofol/ativan prn for sedation, sensitivity to dosing for decreased
   renal fxn

   syndrome with worsening Cr this AM
   -Continue 50g [**Hospital1 7**] albumin daily, Octreotide SC and Midodrine
   -monitor UOP, Cr
   .
   # Anemia: Stable 24-26. Stool brown, guaiac negative. Patient has had
   no prior scopes to document varices.  It does not appear that she is
   actively bleeding at this point.
   - repeat type and screen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with hepatic and renal failure. She has been diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), pneumonia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has undergone multiple attempts at paracentesis for SBP and an additional paracentesis was performed by interventional radiology (IR) to assess fluid. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and she is showing signs of confusion. Her sodium levels are elevated, and she is experiencing worsening renal function. The patient is also anemic, but not actively bleeding. She has no signs of alcohol withdrawal. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy caused by liver failure. This condition can lead to confusion, disorientation, and changes in consciousness.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has developed SBP, which is a bacterial infection of the ascitic fluid in the abdomen. If not treated promptly, it can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pneumonia, which may be aspiration-related. This can progress to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
4. Acute Renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with hx of alcoholism presents with hepatic and
   renal failure.
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Most likely cause is alcoholic hepatitis given the
   report of negative etiologies from OSH. Currently has pending hepatic
   work-up pending, labs that have returned include:
   CEA 5.8, AFP 1.8, Hep B negative, AMA/[**Doctor First Name **] negative, Hep C negative,
   ceruloplasmin negative, Ca [**65**]-9 elevated to > 400
   Ferritin significantly elevated at 1446, Iron 48, TIBC 47. AFP 1.8.
   Liver is continuing to follow, and feels her prognosis is getting worse
   secondary to worsening SBP. Will continue midodrine, octreotide,
   lactulose, d/c

   # PNA: Tachypnea on admission. [**2155-11-17**] V/Q scan negative for PE. LENI
   negative for DVT.  Patient is most likely compensating for metabolic
   acidosis and distended abdomen.  On imaging patient has multifocal
   pneumonia (? Aspiration) which may also be part of the process causing
   tachypnea.  Also with waxing [**Doctor Last Name 533**] periods of consciousness.  Sputum

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with hepatic and renal failure. She is currently intubated and sedated, showing large amounts of aspirate surrounding the vocal cords. The patient has multifocal pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. She also has worsening spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and bowel injury from multiple attempts at paracentesis. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, with waxing and waning levels of consciousness. She has hypernatremia, anemia, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient has signs of alcoholic hepatitis, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. There are negative etiologies for other causes of liver disease.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as evidenced by poor urine output and rising creatinine levels. Hepatorenal syndrome is a possibility due to the presence of liver failure.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the sputum culture results are pending.
4. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has worsening SBP, which is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis. There is concern for bowel injury from the multiple attempts at paracentesis.
5. Bowel Injury: The patient has evidence of bowel"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with hx of alcoholism presents with hepatic and
   renal failure.
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Most likely cause is alcoholic hepatitis given the
   report of negative etiologies from OSH. Currently has pending hepatic
   work-up pending, labs that have returned include:
   CEA 5.8, AFP 1.8, Hep B negative, AMA/[**Doctor First Name **] negative, Hep C negative,
   ceruloplasmin negative, Ca [**65**]-9 elevated
   Ferritin significantly elevated at 1446, Iron 48, TIBC 47. AFP 1.8.
   Liver is continuing to follow, and feels her prognosis is getting worse
   secondary to worsening SBP. Will continue midodrine, octreotide,
   lactulose, d/c
ing pentoxilfylline.  Tbili is improving
   - Pyridoxine 25 mg PO DAILY [**2155-11-18**] for alcoholic treatment
   - lactulose tid for goal [**2-4**] BM, continue rifaximin
   - Treat HRS with daily albumin, octreotide SC, midodrine
   - cont following labs and cultures
   .
   # PNA: Tachypnea on admission. [**2155-11-17**] V/Q scan negative for PE. LENI
   negative for DVT.  Patient is most likely compensating for metabolic
   acidosis and distended abdomen.  On imaging patient has multifocal
   pneumonia (? Aspiration) which may also be part of the process causing
   tachypnea.  Also with waxing [**Doctor Last Name 533**] periods of consciousness.  Sputum
   growing oropharyngeal flora. Covering with broad spectrum antibiotics.
   Intubated [**11-21**] and showed large amount of aspirate surrounding vocal
   cords
   -continue abx
   -f/u cultures
   -intubated
   .
   # Peritonitis: tx
d for SBP, now concern for bowel injury s/p multiple
   attempts at paracentesis 2 days ago.  IR performed additional
   paracentesis [**11-21**] to assess fluid.
   - CT scan negative for blood or loculations, but IR paracentesis shows
   high WBC count
   - expanded suspected peritonitis coverage to vanc, zosyn, and adding
   flagyl for broader anaerobic coverage
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 slowly increasing Na over the past week.  Attempted
   to increase free water boluses via NGT, pt auto
d NGT, switched to
   D5W.
   - will check PM lytes, decreased D5W, start free water boluses per OGT
   .
   #Mental Status
 pt with evidence of waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] levels of
   consciousness with clear confusion in presence of liver failure
   suggestive of encephalopathy
   -lactulose TID
   -propofol/ativan prn for sedation, sensitivity to dosing for decreased
   renal fxn
   .
   # ARF: Given low urine Na and poor response to IVF.  Hepatorenal
   syndrome with worsening Cr this AM
   -Continue 50g [**Hospital1 7**] albumin daily, Octreotide SC and Midodrine
   -monitor UOP, Cr
   .
   # Anemia: Stable 24-26. Stool brown, guaiac negative. Patient has had
   no prior scopes to document varices.  It does not appear that she is
   actively bleeding at this point.
   - repeat type and screen
   .
   # Alcoholism: No signs of withdrawal. On multivitamins, pyridoxine.  No
   acute issues.
   -Con't Folate, thiamine, MVI

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with hepatic and renal failure. She has been diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, as negative etiologies have been reported from OSH. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and her prognosis is worsening due to worsening spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She is currently receiving midodrine, octreotide, and lactulose for hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). 

The patient also has pneumonia, which may be aspiration-related, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. She has undergone multiple attempts at paracentesis for SBP, and an additional paracentesis was performed by interventional radiology (IR) to assess fluid. 

The patient's mental status is fluctuating, indicating possible hepatic encephalopathy. She is receiving lactulose and propofol/ativan for sedation, taking into consideration her decreased renal function. 

The patient is also experiencing hypernatremia, which is slowly increasing sodium levels over the past week. She has been given D5W to increase free water intake, and her sodium levels will be closely monitored. 

Other conditions include anemia, alcoholism, GERD, and malnutrition. The patient's anemia is stable, but further investigation is needed. No signs of alcohol withdrawal are present. The patient is on multivitamins and pyrid"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with hx of alcoholism presents with hepatic and
   renal failure.
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Most likely cause is alcoholic hepatitis given the
   report of negative etiologies from OSH. Currently has pending hepatic
   work-up pending, labs that have returned include:
   CEA 5.8, AFP 1.8, Hep B negative, AMA/[**Doctor First Name **] negative, Hep C negative,
   ceruloplasmin negative, Ca [**65**]-9 elevated to > 400
   Ferritin significantly elevated at 1446, Iron 48, TIBC 47. AFP 1.8.
   Liver is continuing to follow, and feels her prognosis is getting worse
   secondary to worsening SBP. Will continue midodrine, octreotide,
   lactulose, d/c
ing pentoxilfylline.  Tbili is improving
   - Pyridoxine 25 mg PO DAILY [**2155-11-18**] for alcoholic treatment
   - lactulose tid for goal [**2-4**] BM, continue rifaximin
   - Treat HRS with daily, octreotide SC, midodrine. Will ask GI
   regaurding length of albumin therapy
   - cont following labs and cultures
   -still with significant leak from previous para sites, pressure
   dressing
   .
   # PNA: Tachypnea on admission. [**2155-11-17**] V/Q scan negative for PE. LENI
   negative for DVT.  Patient is most likely compensating for metabolic
   acidosis and distended abdomen.  On imaging patient has multifocal
   pneumonia (? Aspiration) which may also be part of the process causing
   tachypnea.  Also with waxing [**Doctor Last Name 533**] periods of consciousness prior to
   intubation. Sputum growing oropharyngeal flora. Covering with broad
   spectrum antibiotics.  Intubated [**11-21**] and showed large amount of
   aspirate surrounding vocal cords. Intubated for free no longer able to
   clear secretions.
   -continue abx, vanc and zosyn
   -f/u cultures
   -check ABG this am.
   .
   # Peritonitis: tx
d for SBP, now concern for bowel injury s/p multiple
   attempts at paracentesis 2 days ago.  IR performed additional
   paracentesis [**11-21**] to assess fluid. Appears increasingly distended
   - CT scan negative for blood or loculations, but IR paracentesis shows
   high WBC count. Removed only 320 cc fluid
   - expanded suspected peritonitis coverage to vanc, zosyn, and adding
   flagyl for broader anaerobic coverage, caspo for fungal coverage
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 slowly increasing Na over the past week.  Continue
   free water boluses via NGT
   .
   #Mental Status
 pt with evidence of waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] levels of
   consciousness with clear confusion in presence of liver failure
   suggestive of encephalopathy. Since intubated and sedated.
   -lactulose TID
   -propofol/ativan prn for sedation, sensitivity to dosing for decreased
   renal fxn
   .
   # ARF: Given low urine Na and poor response to IVF.  Hepatorenal
   syndrome with fluctuating Cr
   -Continue Octreotide SC and Midodrine . Will ask GI about continuing
   alb dose
   -monitor UOP, Cr
   .
   # Anemia: Had been Stable 24-26. Stool brown, guaiac negative. Patient
   has had no prior scopes to document varices.  It does not appear that
   she is actively bleeding at this point.  Had HCT of 17.5 this am, on
   repeat 23
   -          Pm HCT
   -          Guaiac stools
   .
   # Alcoholism: No signs of withdrawal. On multivitamins, pyridoxine.  No
   acute issues.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient presents with multiple complex medical conditions. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic failure: The patient has a history of alcoholism and is showing signs of alcoholic hepatitis. There is also evidence of worsening hepatic encephalopathy.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by fluctuating creatinine levels and low urine output.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration, and is experiencing acute respiratory failure.

4. Peritonitis: The patient has suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which has been treated, but there are concerns about bowel injury from multiple attempts at paracentesis.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are increasing, indicating hypernatremia.

6. Mental status changes: The patient exhibits waxing levels of consciousness and confusion, suggesting hepatic encephalopathy.

7. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level, but it is not clear if this is due to bleeding or another cause.

8. Alcoholism: The patient has a history of alcoholism, but there are no signs of withdrawal at present.

9. GERD: The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for which pantoprazole is prescribed.

10. FEN: The patient's tube feeds are being held due to high residuals, indicating malabsorption or intolerance"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with hepatic and renal failure. She has been admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including pneumonia, suspected bowel injury, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hypernatremia, altered mental status, respiratory acidosis, and acute kidney injury. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, and she is currently on multiple medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver function is impaired, leading to hepatic failure. This can result in liver-related complications such as coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and portal hypertension.
2. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which may be due to hepatorenal syndrome. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as well as the need for dialysis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly secondary to pneumonia or aspiration. This may require mechanical ventilation support.
4. SBP: The patient has developed SBP, a serious infection within the abdominal cavity. If left untreated, it can lead to sepsis and multiple organ failure.
5. Bowel Injury: There is a concern for bowel injury due to multiple attempts at paracentesis. This can result in peritonitis and sepsis.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with hx of alcoholism presents with hepatic and
   renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Tachypnea on admission. [**2155-11-17**] V/Q scan
   negative for PE. LENI negative for DVT.  Patient is most likely
   compensating for metabolic acidosis and distended abdomen.  On imaging
   patient has multifocal pneumonia (? Aspiration) which may also be part
   of the process causing tachypnea.  Also with waxing [**Doctor Last Name 533**] periods of
   consciousness prior to intubation. Sputum growing oropharyngeal flora.
   Covering with broad spectrum antibiotics.  Intubated [**11-21**] and showed
   large amount of aspirate surrounding vocal cords. Intubated b/c unable
   to clear secretions.
   -continue abx, vanc and zosyn in tx for PNA
   -f/u cultures
   -check ABGs in AM
   .
   # Infectious w/u: tx
d for SBP, now concern for bowel injury s/p
   multiple attempts at paracentesis 2 days ago, also with multifocal
   PNA.  IR performed additional paracentesis [**11-21**] to assess fluid.
   Appears increasingly distended with fluid wave.  CXR with min
   improvement.
   - CT scan negative for blood or loculations, but IR paracentesis shows
   high WBC count. Removed only 320 cc fluid
   - expanded suspected peritonitis coverage to vanc, zosyn, and adding
   flagyl for broader anaerobic coverage, caspo for fungal coverage
   - abx appropriately covering PNA
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Most likely cause is alcoholic hepatitis given the
   report of negative etiologies from OSH. Currently has pending hepatic
   work-up pending, labs that have returned include:
   CEA 5.8, AFP 1.8, Hep B negative, AMA/[**Doctor First Name **] negative, Hep C negative,
   ceruloplasmin negative, Ca [**65**]-9 elevated to > 400
   Ferritin significantly elevated at 1446, Iron 48, TIBC 47. AFP 1.8.
   Liver is continuing to follow, and feels her prognosis is getting worse
   secondary to worsening SBP. Will continue midodrine, octreotide,
   lactulose, d/c
ing pentoxilfylline.  Tbili is improving
   - Pyridoxine 25 mg PO DAILY [**2155-11-18**] for alcoholic treatment

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism. She presents with hepatic and renal failure, respiratory failure, and multiple comorbidities. The patient is intubated due to large amounts of aspirate surrounding the vocal cords and inability to clear secretions. She has multifocal pneumonia, suspected bowel injury, and worsening spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient also has hepatic failure, likely caused by alcoholic hepatitis. She is experiencing hypernatremia, altered mental status, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has multiple infections including pneumonia, SBP, and possibly hepatic encephalopathy. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered to cover for oropharyngeal flora, gram-negative bacteria, and anaerobes. There is also concern for fungal infection, hence the use of caspofungin.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient exhibits waxing and waning levels of consciousness and clear confusion in the presence of liver failure, which suggests hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose is being used to reduce ammonia levels.

3. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient has low urine output and poor response to intravenous fluids, suggesting HRS. Octreotide and midodrine are being used to treat HRS.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with hepatic and renal failure. She has been intubated due to respiratory failure, which is likely compensating for metabolic acidosis and a distended abdomen. She also has multifocal pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration, and is being covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, suggesting encephalopathy, and she is receiving lactulose for this condition. She has hepatorenal syndrome with fluctuating creatinine levels and is being treated with octreotide and midodrine. The patient has anemia but is not actively bleeding, and her alcoholism is being managed with multivitamins and pyridoxine. Other issues include hypernatremia, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, altered mental status, acidosis, respiratory failure, hepatic failure, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's fluctuating mental status suggests encephalopathy, which can cause confusion, altered consciousness, and other neurological symptoms.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's renal function is worsening despite improvement in liver function, indicating the possibility of hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of pneumonia, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and ineffective coping. He has been admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and fulminant hepatic failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 22 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. He is also receiving continuous infusion of propofol.

Vital signs show a heart rate of 109 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 98/52 to 72/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's temperature is within normal limits at 37.6°C.

Fluid balance reveals an intake of 3,408 mL, including 961 mL of total fluid, 577 mL of tube feeding, 1,927 mL of intravenous fluids, and 454 mL of blood products. Output consists of 1,400 mL of urine, 600 mL of nasogastric aspirate, and 550 mL of stool. The overall fluid balance is positive at 2,008 mL.

   imaging patient has multifocal pneumonia which may also be part of the
   process causing tachypnea. Sputum samples have only shown oropharyngeal
   flora. Covering with broad spectrum antibiotics for possible
   aspiration.  Intubated [**11-21**] and had large amount of aspirate
   surrounding vocal cords, continued to have large amount of secretions
   which prevented extubation. She is currently doing much better on
   minimal pressure support. However given her worsening clinical status
   we may not be able to extubate at this time. Family meeting regarding
   goals of care will guide our decision-making at this point in regards

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with hepatic and renal failure. She is intubated for worsening mental status and respiratory failure, possibly secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including hepatic failure, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy indicate significant liver dysfunction. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's deteriorating renal function suggests acute kidney injury. This may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately. Complications may include hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, fluid overload, and uremia.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and requirement for mechanical ventilation indicate severe respiratory compromise. Complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia, barotrauma, and ventilator-induced lung injury.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's acid-base imbalance is likely secondary to renal failure. Complications may include hypotension, cardiovascular instability, and decreased tissue perfusion.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels can lead to neurological complications, including seizures and altered mental status.
6. Ineffective coping: The patient's altered mental"

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with hepatic and renal failure. The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including respiratory failure, infectious workup for suspected sepsis and bowel injury, hepatic failure, renal failure, hypernatremia, mental status changes, anemia, alcoholism, GERD, and altered nutrition.

The patient's respiratory failure is indicated by tachypnea on admission, a negative V/Q scan for pulmonary embolism, and multifocal pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. She has been intubated due to the inability to clear secretions and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The infectious workup includes suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), multifocal pneumonia, and potential bowel injury from multiple attempts at paracentesis. The patient is receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage for these conditions.

Hepatic failure is likely caused by alcoholic hepatitis, as other etiologies have been ruled out. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, but she is experiencing worsening renal function.

Renal failure is indicated by low urine output and poor response to intravenous fluids. Hepatorenal syndrome is suspected, and the patient is being treated with midodrine and octreotide for this condition.

Hypernatremia is present, and the patient is receiving free water boluses via nasogastric tube to address this electrolyte imbalance.

Mental status changes, suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy, are evident with waxing and waning levels of consciousness. Lactulose is being administered to manage this condition.

Anemia is present, but it does not appear to be actively bleeding. The patient has received a blood transfusion to increase her hemoglobin concentration.

Alcoholism is part of the patient's history, but no acute issues related to withdrawal or other complications are currently present.

GERD is being managed with proton pump inhibitors.

Nutrition alterations, such as hypernatremia and impaired skin integrity, are also noted in the patient's progress note."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. Since admission, the patient has shown several medical complications. These include hypernatremia (high sodium levels), impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, altered mental status (not delirium), respiratory acidosis, fulminant hepatic failure, acute renal failure (acute kidney injury), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and altered nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels indicate an imbalance in fluid and electrolytes. This condition can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and neurological dysfunction.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, which increases the risk of infections and poor wound healing.
3. Ineffective coping: The patient's inability to cope effectively may be due to factors such as altered mental status or underlying psychological stress. This can affect the patient's overall well-being and recovery.
4. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient is experiencing changes in mental status, including confusion or disorientation. It is important to identify the cause of these changes and provide appropriate interventions.
5. Respiratory acidosis: The patient's respiratory system is producing excess carbon dioxide, leading to a decrease in blood pH. This condition can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
6. Fulminant hepatic failure: The patient's liver is not functioning properly, resulting in severe impairment of liver function. This can lead to complications such as bleeding, jaundice, and liver inflammation.
7. Acute renal failure (acute kidney injury): The patient's kidneys are not functioning adequately, leading to a buildup of waste products and electrolyte imbalances. This can result in fluid overload, electrolyte disturbances, and acid-base imbalance.
8. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty in breathing, which may be due to lung infection, fluid accumulation, or other respiratory issues. Prompt intervention is necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
9. Altered nutrition: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, which can further contribute to poor healing, weakened immune system, and overall poor health outcomes.

It is important to closely monitor and manage these medical complications to improve the patient's chances of recovery."

   # Respiratory Failure: Tachypnea on admission. [**2155-11-17**] V/Q scan
   negative for PE. LENI negative for DVT.  Patient is most likely
   compensating for metabolic acidosis and distended abdomen.  On imaging
   patient has multifocal pneumonia (? Aspiration) which may also be part
   of the process causing tachypnea.  Also with waxing [**Doctor Last Name 533**] periods of
   consciousness prior to intubation. Sputum growing oropharyngeal flora.
   Covering with broad spectrum antibiotics.  Intubated [**11-21**] and showed
   large amount of aspirate surrounding vocal cords. Intubated b/c unable
   to clear secretions.

   multiple attempts at paracentesis 2 days ago, also with multifocal
   PNA.  IR performed additional paracentesis [**11-21**] to assess fluid.
   Appears increasingly distended with fluid wave.  CXR with min
   improvement.
   - CT scan negative for blood or loculations, but IR paracentesis shows
   high WBC count. Removed only 320 cc fluid
   - expanded suspected peritonitis coverage to vanc, zosyn, and adding
   flagyl for broader anaerobic coverage, caspo for fungal coverage
   - abx appropriately covering PNA

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with hepatic and renal failure. She has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, infection, hepatic failure, renal failure, hypernatremia, mental status changes, anemia, and alcoholism.

The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, hypotension, decreased urine output, and has been receiving various antibiotics for suspected infections. She is currently intubated due to aspiration and inability to clear secretions.

The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, suspected bowel injury, and suspected peritonitis. She has hepatic failure, likely caused by alcoholic hepatitis, and renal function is worsening despite treatment.

The patient also has mental status changes consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She has fluctuating creatinine levels, indicating possible hepatorenal syndrome. Additionally, she has anemia and hypernatremia.

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infections, including coverage for fungal and anaerobic organisms. She is also receiving medications for hepatic failure, including lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy and albumin, octreotide, and midodrine for hepatorenal syndrome.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include worsening respiratory failure, further decline in renal function, development of septic shock, progression of hepatic failure, worsening mental status, and complications related to hypernatremia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with hepatic and renal failure. She is currently in the ICU due to various medical complications. Here are the summarized information and potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had tachypnea on admission, which may be due to compensating for metabolic acidosis and a distended abdomen. Imaging showed multifocal pneumonia, possibly aspiration pneumonia, leading to respiratory failure. She was intubated because she couldn't clear secretions.

2. Infectious Workup: The patient had suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and additional paracentesis was performed to assess fluid. The CT scan showed no blood or loculations, but the IR paracentesis revealed a high white blood cell count. The patient's antibiotic coverage was expanded to cover for broader anaerobic coverage, fungal coverage, and multifocal pneumonia.

3. Hepatic Failure: The most likely cause of hepatic failure is alcoholic hepatitis. The patient has negative etiologies for other causes of liver disease, and her liver function tests (LFTs) are improving. Treatment includes midodrine, octreotide, lactulose, and d/c pentoxifylline.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, likely due to hepatorenal syndrome. She is being treated with daily albumin, octreotide subcutaneously, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with hx of alcoholism presents with hepatic and
   renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Tachypnea on admission. [**2155-11-17**] V/Q scan
   negative for PE. LENI negative for DVT.  Intubated for worsening mental
   status. She is also compensating for worsening metabolic acidosis.  On
   imaging patient has multifocal pneumonia which may also be part of the
   process causing tachypnea. Sputum samples have only shown oropharyngeal
   flora. Covering with broad spectrum antibiotics for possible
   aspiration.  Intubated [**11-21**] and had large amount of aspirate
   surrounding vocal cords, continued to have large amount of secretions
   which prevented extubation. She is currently doing much better on
   minimal pressure support. However given her worsening clinical status
   we may not be able to extubate at this time. Family meeting regarding
   goals of care will guide our decision-making at this point in regards
   to her extubation and treatment.
   -continue abx, vanc and zosyn in tx for PNA
   -f/u cultures
   -continue PS
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Most likely cause is alcoholic hepatitis. Currently
   has pending hepatic work-up pending, labs that have returned include:
   CEA 5.8, AFP 1.8, Hep B negative, AMA/[**Doctor First Name **] negative, Hep C negative,
   ceruloplasmin negative, Ca [**65**]-9 elevated to > 400 Ferritin
   significantly elevated at 1446, Iron 48, TIBC 47. AFP 1.8. Will
   continue midodrine, octreotide, lactulose.  While her liver function
   has been stable over the last several days, her renal function is
   rapidly deteriorating, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   - continue daily albumin, octreotide SC, midodrine
   - lactulose tid for goal [**2-4**] BM, continue rifaximin
   - pyridoxine 25 mg daily
   - cont following labs and cultures
   -liver recs if any
   .
   # ARF: Renal function has been worsening over the last couple of days,
   likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. Lasix initially then pressors
   have not improved her urine outcome. At this point it is unlikely that
   she is a HD candidate. This is also likely the reason for her
   hyperphosphatemia, for which she is receiving phos binders. At this
   time, we will continue midodrine and octreotide, treat with IV
   hydration and continue pressors. Her goals of care should be discussed
   at this point.
   -phos binders
   -monitor K and electrolytes this PM
   -continue pressors for now
   -monitor UOP
   -Ulytes, eos to r/o other etiologies of renal insufficiency
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: AG 16, likely secondary to renal failure. Will
   continue to treat as above w/D5W, no indication for bicarb at this time
   given her hypernatremia.

   # Anemia: Had been Stable 24-26. Stool brown, guaiac negative. Patient
   has had no prior scopes to document varices.  It does not appear that
   she is actively bleeding at this point.  Transfused 2 units PRBCs for

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with hepatic and renal failure. The patient's condition is summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has tachypnea on admission and multifocal pneumonia. She was intubated due to worsening mental status and large amount of aspirate surrounding vocal cords. She is currently on minimal pressure support and may not be extubated at this time.

2. Hepatic Failure: The most likely cause is alcoholic hepatitis. The patient has elevated levels of ferritin, AFP, and Ca-9, and negative results for Hep B, AMA, Hep C, and ceruloplasmin. She is being treated with midodrine, octreotide, lactulose, and rifaximin.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is worsening, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. She has hyperphosphatemia and is receiving phos binders. The patient is also on midodrine and octreotide, IV hydration, and pressors.

4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an AG of 16, likely secondary to renal failure. She is being treated with D5W to correct hypernatremia.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with hx of alcoholism presents with hepatic and
   renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Tachypnea on admission. [**2155-11-17**] V/Q scan
   negative for PE. LENI negative for DVT.  Intubated on [**11-21**] for
   worsening mental status, underlying multifocal pneumonia and tachypnea,
   with large amt of aspirate surrounding vocal cords. She has worsening
   metabolic acidosis which is playing a role in her ventilation, as is
   apparent on her ABGs.  Sputum samples have only shown oropharyngeal
   flora. She is currently doing much better on minimal pressure support.
   However given her worsening clinical status extubation may not be an
   option. A family meeting regarding goals of care will guide our
   decision-making at this point.
   -continue current antibiotics for PNA
   -continue wean down PS with goal of improving ventilation not
   extubation at this time
   -suction as needed for secretions
   -monitor ABGs with any vent changes
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Most likely cause is alcoholic hepatitis. Receiving
   midodrine, octreotide, lactulose.  Given her inability to tolerate PO
   and worsening renal failure, some of her medication, such as octreotide
   and lactulose, will be discontinued.
   - continue daily albumin
   -continue multivitamins (switch to IV if possible)
   -liver recs if any
   .
   # ARF: Renal function has been worsening over several days, likely
   secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. Lasix initially then pressors have
   not improved her urine outcome, and hemodialysis is not an option that
   will improve her outcome in the long-term. We have been repleting her
   electrolytes with care given her failing renal clearance.  As above,
   her goals of care should be discussed to guide our management.
   -monitor K and electrolytes this PM
   -continue pressors for now
   -monitor UOP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to renal failure. Will continue to
   treat w/D5W, no indication for bicarb at this time given her
   hypernatremia.
   .
   #Mental Status
 pt with evidence of waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] levels of
   consciousness with clear confusion in presence of liver failure
   suggestive of encephalopathy. Since intubated and sedated. With
   decreases in sedation, she is increasingly confused and agitated. She
   is not tolerating lactulose po at this time.
   -propofol/fentanyl prn for sedation, sensitivity to dosing for
   decreased renal fxn
   .
   # Anemia: Had been Stable 24-26. Stool brown, guaiac negative. Patient
   has had no prior scopes to document varices.  It does not appear that
   she is actively bleeding at this point.
   -follow CBC qd
   .
   # GERD: Con't PPI
   .
   # FEN: holding TF b/c of residuals, will d/c PO medications and try to
   switch to IV all necessary treatments, replete lytes prn with caution
   .
   # PPx: pneumoboots
   .
   # Access: PICC
   .
   # Code: Full- family meeting to discuss goals of care

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism who presents with hepatic and renal failure. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with tachypnea and required intubation due to worsening mental status, underlying multifocal pneumonia, and tachypnea. She is currently on minimal pressure support and may not be extubated due to worsening clinical status.

2. Hepatic Failure: The patient is likely experiencing alcoholic hepatitis, and medications such as midodrine, octreotide, and lactulose are being administered. However, given her inability to tolerate PO and worsening renal failure, some medications will be discontinued.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has been worsening over several days, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. Lasix and pressors have not improved her urine outcome, and hemodialysis is not considered an option that will improve her long-term outcome.

4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has secondary metabolic acidosis due to renal failure. Treatment involves administering D5W, and there is no indication for bicarbonate at this time due to hypernatremia.

5. Mental Status: The patient exhibits waxing and waning levels of consciousness with clear confusion in the presence of liver failure, suggestive of encephalopathy. She is increasingly confused and agitated when sedation is decreased.

6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, and there are no signs of active bleeding. A follow-up CBC is recommended.

7. GERD: The patient has a history of GERD, and PPI therapy is continued.

8. FEN: The patient's tube feeding is being held due to residuals, and oral medications will be discontinued in favor of IV administration.

9. PPx: The patient is receiving pneumoboots as part of their care.

10. Access: The patient has a PICC line in place for access.

Potential complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure, progression of hepatic failure leading to hepatic encephalopathy, further deterioration of renal function, worsening metabolic acidosis, development of new infections, and potential bleeding due to coagulopathy."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year old female with hx of alcoholism presents with hepatic and
   renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Tachypnea on admission. [**2155-11-17**] V/Q scan
   negative for PE. LENI negative for DVT.  Intubated on [**11-21**] for
   worsening mental status, underlying multifocal pneumonia and tachypnea,
   with large amt of aspirate surrounding vocal cords. She has worsening
   metabolic acidosis which is playing a role in her ventilation, as is
   apparent on her ABGs.  Sputum samples have only shown oropharyngeal
   flora. She is currently doing much better on minimal pressure support.
   However given her worsening clinical status extubation may not be an
   option. A family meeting regarding goals of care will guide our
   decision-making at this point.
   -continue current antibiotics for PNA
   -continue wean down PS with goal of improving ventilation not
   extubation at this time
   -suction as needed for secretions
   -monitor ABGs with any vent changes
   .
   # Hepatic failure: Most likely cause is alcoholic hepatitis. Receiving
   midodrine, octreotide, lactulose.  Given her inability to tolerate PO
   and worsening renal failure, some of her medication, such as octreotide
   and lactulose, will be discontinued.
   - continue daily albumin
   -continue multivitamins (switch to IV if possible)
   -liver recs if any
   .
   # ARF: Renal function has been worsening over several days, likely
   secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. Lasix initially then pressors have
   not improved her urine outcome, and hemodialysis is not an option that
   will improve her outcome in the long-term. We have been repleting her
   electrolytes with care given her failing renal clearance.  As above,
   her goals of care should be discussed to guide our management.
   -monitor K and electrolytes this PM
   -continue pressors for now
   -monitor UOP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to renal failure. Will continue to
   treat w/D5W, no indication for bicarb at this time given her
   hypernatremia.
   .
   #Mental Status
 pt with evidence of waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] levels of
   consciousness with clear confusion in presence of liver failure
   suggestive of encephalopathy. Since intubated and sedated. With
   decreases in sedation, she is increasingly confused and agitated. She
   is not tolerating lactulose po at this time.
   -propofol/fentanyl prn for sedation, sensitivity to dosing for
   decreased renal fxn
   .
   # Anemia: Had been Stable 24-26. Stool brown, guaiac negative. Patient
   has had no prior scopes to document varices.  It does not appear that
   she is actively bleeding at this point.
   -follow CBC qd
   .
   # GERD: Con't PPI
   .
   # FEN: holding TF b/c of residuals, will d/c PO medications and try to
   switch to IV all necessary treatments, replete lytes prn with caution
   .
   # PPx: pneumoboots
   .
   # Access: PICC
   .
   # Code: Full- family meeting to discuss goals of care

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with hepatic and renal failure. She has been intubated due to worsening mental status, underlying multifocal pneumonia, and tachypnea. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation support, and there have been concerns regarding potential complications such as respiratory failure, hepatic failure, renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and mental status changes.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial tachypnea and worsening mental status indicate a risk for respiratory failure. She has been intubated and placed on minimal pressure support, but her underlying multifocal pneumonia and aspiration may pose challenges in weaning her off the ventilator.

2. Hepatic Failure: The patient's history of alcoholism suggests alcoholic hepatitis as the most likely cause of her hepatic failure. She is receiving midodrine, octreotide, and lactulose for management, but her inability to tolerate PO and worsening renal failure may necessitate discontinuation of certain medications.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has been progressively worsening, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. Lasix and pressors have not improved her urine output, and hemodialysis is not considered beneficial for her long-term outcome.

4. Metabolic Acidosis: Secondary to renal failure, the patient is experiencing metabolic acidosis. Treatment with"
