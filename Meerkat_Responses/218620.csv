   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Assessment: This is a 79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP,
   atrial fibrillation, h/o duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with
   leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b
   c.diff who developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning
   for free air and is now s/p right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Currently has leukocytosis, hypotensive, tachycardia.  Has
   many likely sources such as c.diff, blood (PICC in place), urine, PNA,
   but now with bowel perforation s/p colectommy and also with potentially
   a duodenoal perforation
   - Central venous line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 12-15
   - LR boluses to keep CVP up, also to improve UOP
   - cipro, flagyl IV.  also vanco IV for MRSA cellulitis.  Cannot do PO
   vanco right now given surgery and concern for duodenal perforation
   - blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - repeat CXR
   - norepinephrine for goal MAP>60.  will also add vasopressin to help
   decrease norepinephrine dose which will only worsen tachycardia
   - serial abdominal exam; low threshold to d/w surgery for repeat look
   in abdomen if necessary
   - consider removal of PICC in AM
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   CXR with significant pulm edema and Right pleural effusion. ? left
   pleural effusion.  Likely partly secondary to pulmonary edema in the
   setting of RVR and significant MR.  Also, could be developing ARDS in
   the setting of perforated bowel.
   - currently not using ARDSnet settings
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: creatinine up to 1.4, but currently anuric post operatively.
   Likely mostly pre-renal.  [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN secondary to hypotension.
   - IVFs to keep CVP>15
   - monitor lytes
   - urine lytes if cr continues to go up
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - cannot give PO vanco for now; cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: day #2 after dacogen completed.  Likely counts
   will begin to drop further in the next few days
   - tx to keep HCT>30 for now
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - hold off on esmolol or dilt gtt as these can both cause hypotension
   - try vasopressive for BP and decrease norepinephrine as tolerated
   - consider dig loading
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above
   - replete lytes PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [3-21] with a CT scan showing free air, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy procedure. 

Since admission, the patient has been experiencing sepsis with organ dysfunction. He has leukocytosis, hypotension, tachycardia, and multiple potential sources of infection including C. difficile, blood (PICC line), urine, pneumonia, and bowel perforation post-colectomy. The patient is also suffering from respiratory failure with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusion. 

Other medical conditions include acute kidney injury (post-operative anuria), likely pre-renal in origin, and leukemia cutis/AML (treated with chemotherapy). The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

Plan:
1. Sepsis: Central venous line, IV fluids, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, vancomycin, blood/urine/sputum cultures, repeat chest X-ray, norepinephrine for MAP >60, vasopressin to decrease norepine"

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   Assessment: This is a 79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP,
   atrial fibrillation, h/o duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with
   leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b
   c.diff who developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning
   for free air and is now s/p right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Currently has leukocytosis, hypotensive on 2 pressors,
   tachycardia.  Has many likely sources such as c.diff, blood (PICC in
   place), urine, PNA, but now with bowel perforation s/p colectomy and
   also with potentially a duodenoal perforation. Has been anuric with
   just 20 cc since arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] from OR. Overnight [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal
   from 30-38 . Thus, no need for steroids at this time.
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 12-15
   - LR boluses to keep CVP up
   - Per ID, Abx changed to Vanco IV and PR, [**Last Name (un) **], flagyl, fluc
   - blood cultures (as yet unable to get sputum and urine cx)
   - rpt CT this am
   -F/u surgery recs- possibly back to OR today
   - norepinephrine and vasopressin for goal MAP>60. Have not yet needed
   3^rd pressor but would choose neo

   -Albumin 25gm per surgery today for volume
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   CXR with significant pulm edema and Right pleural effusion. ? left
   pleural effusion.  Likely partly secondary to pulmonary edema in the
   setting of RVR and significant MR.  Also, could be developing ARDS in
   the setting of perforated bowel.
   -          currently not using ARDSnet settings
   -          consider Chest tube PRN
   -          Bronch today
   -          Push in ETT 2 cm today
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: creatinine up to 1.4, but currently anuric post operatively.
   Likely mostly pre-renal.  [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN secondary to hypotension.
   Also pressors likely contributing to poor kidney perfusion
   - IVFs to keep CVP>15
   - monitor lytes
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - cont with IV flagyl, PR Vanco for now
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: day #3 after dacogen completed.  Likely counts
   will begin to drop further in the next few days
   - tx to keep HCT>30 for now
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted today do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt. Dig 0.125 given overnight (low dose given ARF) with little
   help.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and previous duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**], which was concerning for free air. He underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. 

The patient is currently experiencing sepsis, likely due to bowel perforation caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff). He is on two pressors to maintain blood pressure and has concerns for a second bowel perforation discovered on a scan after surgery. His lactate level is elevated at 4.5. Other potential sources of infection include line infections. 

The patient also has respiratory failure with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure and volume overload on chest X-ray. He requires ARDSnet, advanced endotracheal tube placement, and consideration for right-sided CT to improve ventilation. 

The patient's creatinine continues to rise, and he is becoming anuric. Renal dose medications should be adjusted, and IV fluids should be kept to maintain CVP > 15. 

The patient still has C. diff, which could have caused the perforated colon. Treatment with IV flagyl is recommended. 

The patient's AML/leukemia cutis is now"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with a CT scan showing free air, indicating a possible bowel perforation. He underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient's current assessment and plan include several potential complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to bowel perforation caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff). He is already on two pressors and has concerns for a second bowel perforation discovered on scan after surgery. His lactate level is elevated at 4.5, indicating tissue hypoperfusion.

2. Bowel perforation: The patient had surgery for a bowel perforation but now there are concerns for a second perforation. Additionally, bloody fluid is being suctioned from the endotracheal tube.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. His chest X-ray shows volume overload, and he requires advanced respiratory support.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of hospital-acquired c. diff and now presents with acute abdominal pain, which is concerning for a possible bowel perforation. The patient is also on pressors and has a high lactate level, indicating possible sepsis due to multiple sources including line infection.

2. Bowel perforation: The patient underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy due to concerns for free air on CT scan. However, a second bowel perforation was discovered post-surgery. This poses a significant risk for further complications such as peritonitis and sepsis.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, as evidenced by the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is also evidence of volume overload on the chest X-ray.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating a decline in kidney function. The patient is becoming anuric (not producing urine), which is concerning for potential kidney failure.

5. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has a history of C. diff and is currently being treated with IV flagyl. It is possible that the C. diff infection contributed to the bowel perforation.

6. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/"

   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and anastomosis of leak.
   # Sepsis
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c. diff.  On 2
   pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Lactate rising.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - IV flagyl/PR vanc and IVIG for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors/IVF to maintain MAP > 55
   - blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.  Also with bloody fluid being
   suctioned from ET tube this am
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - ARDSnet
   - Consider R CT to improve ventilation if necessary.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine continues to rise.  Becoming anuric.  Potassium
   rising.
   - IVFs to keep CVP>15
   - Renally dose meds
   - Repeat lytes after surgery and consider HD/ CVVH in next 24 hrs.
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl / PR vanc / IVIG
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: day #3 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. During his hospital course, he developed acute abdominal pain, which led to a CT scan showing free air and subsequent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy surgery. He then underwent a second surgery with abscess drainage and repair of an anastomotic leak. The patient's current condition is critical, and he is experiencing sepsis most likely due to bowel perforation caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff). He is on two pressors and has had two surgeries. His lactate levels are rising. The treatment plan includes antibiotics for sepsis and C. diff, as well as IV immunoglobulin (IVIG). Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been ordered, and the patient's fever curve is being followed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already showing signs of sepsis, likely due to the bowel perforation caused by C. diff. Close monitoring of vital signs, lactate levels, and response to antibiotics is crucial.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly exacerbated by volume overload seen on the chest X"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] and had a CT scan showing free air, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Subsequently, he underwent a second surgery with abscess drainage and anastomosis of a leak.

The patient's current assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis most likely due to bowel perforation caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff). He is already on two pressors (vasopressin and norepinephrine) and has had surgeries. His lactate levels are rising.

2. Bowel perforation: The patient's bowel perforation is attributed to surgery, as mentioned earlier. The bloody fluid being suctioned from the endotracheal tube this morning may indicate ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. His chest X-ray shows volume overload, and a chest CT reveals complete collapse of the right lung due to bronchial obstruction, necessitating tube placement and suctioning of the"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial
   fibrillation, h/o duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia
   cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff
   who developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free
   air and is now s/p right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
 Likely source of infection is bowel perforation though
   differential also include c. diff, line infection, and pna.  Has
   required levophed and vasopressin, though levophed was been weaned down
   marginally over the course of day on [**3-22**].    Currently has
   leukocytosis, hypotensive on 2 pressors, tachycardia.  Patient is s/p
   colectomy and re-operation on [**3-22**] because of persistent duodenoal
   perforation.  Also had abscess drainage during procedure.
   - blood and LR to goal CVP >= 15 given PEEP of 12
   - consider albumin after blood for intravascular volume expansion b/c
   patient volume overloaded
   - norepinephrine and vasopressin for goal MAP>60
   - Per ID, Abx changed to Vanco IV and PR, [**Last Name (un) **], flagyl, fluc
   - f/u culture data
   - Hct q6hrs
   -bladder pressures Q 4hrs per surgery recs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilatory settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords)
   - continue current vent settings.  Will not attempt to weane patient
   for now
   # Coagulopathy:  Patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia,
   elevated FDPs, and active bleeding from JP drains in abdomen.
   Fibrinogen remains normal, however, so patient does not strictly meet
   parameters for DIC.  Will empirically treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - s/p vitamin K on [**2157-3-23**]
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**] but urine output increasing as of
   [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for worsening kidney function nad possible
   need for dialysis but appears to be improving.  Likely experienced ATN
   from hypoperfusion in setting of sepsis.
   - renal consult
   - IVFs to keep CVP>15
   - monitor lytes
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - cont with IV flagyl, PR Vanco for now
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  day #4 after dacogen completed.  Likely counts
   will begin to drop further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>30 for now
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above
   - replete lytes PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and MRSA cellulitis. He developed acute abdominal pain and was found to have free air on CT, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient is currently in septic shock, likely due to bowel perforation, and has undergone multiple surgeries including colectomy and abscess drainage. He also has respiratory failure with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure and pulmonary edema. The patient has coagulopathy with elevated PT/PTT and thrombocytopenia, but does not strictly meet the criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He is at high risk for DIC and is being empirically treated. The patient's kidney function was initially oliguric but is improving. He has Clostridium difficile infection, AML/leukemia cutis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and is on full code status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection. If not properly managed, it can lead to multiple organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic/h"

   -antibiotic cocktail now meropenem, IV and PR vanc (c. diff), flagyl,
   fluconazole.
   -bronchoscopy in a.m. b/c of concern for right lobar collapse.  No
   mucous plug seen on bronch but ETT tube was actually at level of vocal
   chords and right lung inflated better after tube advanced.
   -Had abdominal CT that showed extravasation of contrast in duodenum.
   Taken by surgery again to OR where an abscess was found and drained in
   the lesser sac and JP drains were placed around site of duodenal perf.
   The perf was not repaired because they were ""unable to mobilize the
   duodenum"" in a way that allowed for repair.  OR blood loss ~ 700cc and
   recieved 1u PRBC in OR and second unit on floor in evening.  Also got
   two bags of platelets for count of 42 and 2u FFP per surgery reccs.
   -around 2 a.m., got 2 more units of FFP, plt, blood for hct of 22
   -got CXR in evening per surgery's reccs. showed improved aeration of R
   lung.
   -BMT: patient is day 7 decitabine and counts should fall this week
   -cards: continue supportive care and tx'ing underlying sepsis
   -renal consulted in evening b/c oliguric during day but UOP picked up
   in evening so didn't do anything; will come by again on [**3-23**] to
   re-assess.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a duodenal ulcer who was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] and had a CT scan showing free air, indicating a possible bowel perforation. The patient underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues including sepsis, respiratory failure, coagulopathy/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, acute kidney injury (AKI), and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple likely sources of infection including C. diff, blood (PICC line), urine, and pneumonia. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing both hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure. This is likely secondary to pulmonary edema and a right pleural effusion. The patient may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Coagulopathy/DIC: The patient has an elevated PT/INR and PTT, indicating a coagulopathy. This could be due to se"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLP), atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcers who underwent surgery. The patient was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. During his hospital course, he developed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and acute abdominal pain with a CT scan showing free air, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He then presented with a second perforation and underwent repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak.

The patient is currently experiencing sepsis/hypotension most likely due to the bowel perforation and C. diff infection. He is on two pressors, has had two surgeries, and his lactate levels are trending down after the second surgery. There is serosanguinous fluid coming out of the abdominal drains.

The patient also has respiratory failure with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, volume overload on chest X-ray, and a chest CT showing complete collapse of the right lung with bronchoscopy, tube placement, and suctioning of the right mainstem. A loculated pleural effusion on the right side has been identified.

Additionally, the patient is likely experiencing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with additional hits to plate"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLP), atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. The patient was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cellulitis. During his hospital course, he developed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with a CT scan showing free air, indicating a bowel perforation. He underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, then found to have a second perforation and subsequently underwent repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications:
1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient is most likely suffering from sepsis due to bowel perforation on [**3-7**] complicated by C. diff. He is on two pressors and has undergone surgery twice. His condition improved after the second surgery, as indicated by a decreasing lactate level. However, he now shows signs of falling hematocrit (Hct) and serosanguinous fluid coming from the abdominal drains.

Plan:
- Continue vancomycin and meropenem for sepsis.
- Administer IV flagyl and IV immunoglobulin (IVIG"

   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
   # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - Consider adding caspo
 will d/w ID
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 55
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed. LR for now as pressor need continues to drop.
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to platelets from
   chemo.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted for leukemia cutis/AML and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT findings of free air, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Subsequently, he was found to have a second perforation and underwent repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient's sepsis is most likely due to bowel perforation complicated by Clostridium difficile infection. He is currently on two pressors and has had two surgeries. His condition improved after the second surgery, but his hemoglobin level is falling, and serosanguinous fluid is coming out of the abdominal drains. The plan includes continuing antibiotics for sepsis, considering adding caspofungin, administering IV flagyl for C. diff, and following up with cultures.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has volume overload on CXR and a chest CT showing complete collapse of the right lung after bronchoscopic intervention with tube placement. There is also a loculated pleural effusion on the right side. The plan involves weaning FiO2 as tolerated on assisted"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
 Likely source of infection is bowel perforation though
   differential also include c. diff, line infection, and pna.  Has
   required levophed and vasopressin, though levophed was been weaned down
   marginally over the course of day on [**3-22**].    Currently has
   leukocytosis, hypotensive on 2 pressors, tachycardia.  Patient is s/p
   colectomy and re-operation on [**3-22**] because of persistent duodenoal
   perforation.  Also had abscess drainage during procedure.
   - blood and LR to goal CVP >= 15 given PEEP of 12
   - consider albumin after blood for intravascular volume expansion b/c
   patient volume overloaded
   - norepinephrine and vasopressin for goal MAP>60
   - Per ID, Abx changed to Vanco IV and PR, [**Last Name (un) **], flagyl, fluc
   - f/u culture data
   - Hct q6hrs
   -bladder pressures Q 4hrs per surgery recs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilatory settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords)
   - continue current vent settings.  Will not attempt to weane patient
   for now
   # Coagulopathy:  Patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia,
   elevated FDPs, and active bleeding from JP drains in abdomen.
   Fibrinogen remains normal, however, so patient does not strictly meet
   parameters for DIC.  Will empirically treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - s/p vitamin K on [**2157-3-23**]
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**] but urine output increasing as of
   [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for worsening kidney function nad possible
   need for dialysis but appears to be improving.  Likely experienced ATN
   from hypoperfusion in setting of sepsis.
   - renal consult
   - IVFs to keep CVP>15
   - monitor lytes
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - cont with IV flagyl, PR Vanco for now
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  day #4 after dacogen completed.  Likely counts
   will begin to drop further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>30 for now
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. During his hospital course, he developed Clostridium difficile infection (c.diff) and subsequently underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy due to acute abdominal pain and CT findings concerning for free air.

The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely secondary to bowel perforation. He requires two vasopressors, norepinephrine and vasopressin, although norepinephrine has been weaned down. The patient also has leukocytosis, hypotension, and tachycardia. He underwent colectomy and re-operation on [**3-22**] due to persistent duodenal perforation and abscess drainage during the procedure.

Other medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, coagulopathy, acute kidney injury (ATN), and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's respiratory status is currently stable on mechanical ventilation with concerns for potential development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to perforated bowel. He has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia, elevated fibrin degradation products (FDPs), and active bleeding from the jejunostomy (JP) drains, indicating a"

   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - IVFs to keep CVP>14
   - monitor lytes
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - cont with IV flagyl, PR Vanco for now
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  day #5 after dacogen completed.  Likely counts
   will begin to drop further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery, though oncology
   prefers transfusion for Hct>27
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and previous duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and hospital course complicated by Clostridium difficile (c.diff). The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air, indicating a bowel perforation. He subsequently underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient's current condition is described as septic shock, likely due to the bowel perforation. He requires two pressors, levophed and vasopressin, although levophed has been weaned down. The patient also has leukocytosis, hypotension, and tachycardia.

Additionally, the patient has respiratory failure with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis. He has pulmonary edema and pleural effusions on chest X-ray, and there is a concern for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the perforated bowel. The patient is currently on stable ventilator settings.

Furthermore, the patient has a coagulopathy with elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia, elevated fibrin degradation products (FDPs), and active bleeding from the jejunostomy (JP) drains"

   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
   # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - Consider adding caspo
 will d/w ID
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 60
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50). LR/albumin for now as
   pressor need continues to drop.
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   - Correct alkalosis
   - Bronch with airway inspection today
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from
   chemo.  Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
 not tolerating PR vanc
   - No IVIG at this time.
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Now in NSR after surgery.
   - Replete lytes

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. He developed acute abdominal pain and underwent two surgeries, including a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, as well as repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient is on two pressors and has a history of bowel perforation, which is likely causing the sepsis. After the second surgery, his lactate levels are trending down, but he is still septic with serosanguinous fluid coming out of the abdominal drains.
   - Treatment plan: Continue vanc/meropenem for sepsis, consider adding caspofungin, IV flagyl for Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), follow fever curve, and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
   - Monitoring: Follow blood/urine/sputum cultures, PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50), and LR/albumin for now as pressor need continues to drop.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure with volume overload on chest X-ray. A chest"

   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
   # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - Consider adding caspo
 will d/w ID
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 60
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50). LR/albumin for now as
   pressor need continues to drop.
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   - Correct alkalosis
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from
   chemo.  Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] and had a CT scan showing free air, indicating a possible bowel perforation. He underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, and then underwent a repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak.

The patient is currently on two pressors (vasopressin and norepinephrine) and has been improved after the second surgery, with a decreasing trend in lactate levels. However, the patient's hemoglobin (Hct) is falling, and serosanguinous fluid is coming out of the abdominal drains.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information are:

1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient's condition is likely due to bowel perforation and Clostridium difficile (c. diff) infection. The patient is already on vancomycin and meropenem for sepsis, and consideration should be given to adding caspofungin. IV flagyl is being administered for c. diff, and cultures should be followed up.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic/hypox"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and previous duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with a CT scan showing free air, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He then had a second surgery due to bowel perforation and abscess drainage with drains placed in the leak.

The patient is currently on two pressors (vasopressin and norepinephrine) for sepsis and hypotension. He has improved after the second surgery, with his lactate levels trending down. However, he now has a falling hematocrit (Hct) and serosanguinous fluid coming from the abdominal drains. He is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem for sepsis, and consideration is being given to adding caspofungin.

The patient also has respiratory failure with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, as evidenced by volume overload on chest X-ray. He underwent bronchoscopic intervention, tube placement, and suctioning of the right mainstem. A chest CT showed complete collapse of the right lung and loculated pleural effusion on the right side. The plan is to wean FiO2 as tolerated."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
   # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - Consider adding caspo
 will d/w ID
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 60
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50). LR/albumin for now as
   pressor need continues to drop.
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   - Correct alkalosis
   - Bronch with airway inspection today
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from
   chemo.  Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
 not tolerating PR vanc
   - No IVIG at this time.
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Now in NSR after surgery.
   - Replete lytes
   - If persisent arrhythmias, consider change pressors
   #Somnolence: Sedation off, will follow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and hospital-acquired C. difficile infection. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [date] with a CT scan showing free air, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He is currently in the ICU with multiple complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to a suspected bowel perforation, which could be the source of infection. Other potential sources include C. difficile, line infection, and pneumonia. The patient has been on vasopressors and has required surgical intervention.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing both hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to sepsis. The CXR shows pulmonary edema and pleural effusions, indicating respiratory distress. There is a possibility of developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to the perforated bowel.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia, elevated fibrin degradation products (FDPs), and active bleeding from the Jackson-Pratt (JP) drains in the abdomen. Although the patient does not strictly meet"

During his hospital course, he developed Clostridium difficile infection (c.diff) and now presents with acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**], which is concerning for free air and has undergone right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient likely has septic shock due to a likely source of infection being bowel perforation. The differential also includes c.diff, line infection, and pneumonia. He has required vasopressor support, specifically levophed and vasopressin, though levophed has been weaned down over the course of the day on [**3-22**].

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing both hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis. His chest X-ray shows pulmonary edema and pleural effusions, and there could be a possibility of developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in the setting of perforated bowel. He is currently on stable ventilator settings.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated Proth"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
    # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.( nearly 1.7L)
   - Vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 60 (off vasopressin, still on levo)
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50). LR/albumin for now as
   pressor need continues to drop.
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   #Somnolence: Likely [**3-7**] toxic-metabolic encelopathy.  Sedation off,
   will follow.  Too unstable to transport to head CT and low suspicion
   for focal intracranial process.
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from
   chemo.  Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
 not tolerating PR vanc
   - No IVIG at this time.
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Now in NSR after surgery.
   - Replete lytes
   - If persisent arrhythmias, consider change pressors
   Other issues per Resident note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**], which led to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy due to a suspected bowel perforation caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff). He underwent a second surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak. The patient has been on two pressors and has had multiple surgeries. His condition improved after the second surgery, with a decreasing lactate level. However, he now presents with falling hematocrit (Hct) and serosanguinous fluid from the abdominal drains. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient is most likely experiencing sepsis due to bowel perforation and C. diff. He is on two pressors to maintain his blood pressure and has had surgeries. His lactate level is improving, indicating better perfusion.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to volume overload on chest imaging. He also has a loculated pleural effusion on the right side. The plan is to wean FiO2 as tolerated and consider bronchoscopy for fixed and suction"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
    # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - Consider adding caspo
 will d/w ID
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 60
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50). LR/albumin for now as
   pressor need continues to drop.
   # Respiratory Failure: hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   - Correct alkalosis
   - Bronch with airway inspection today
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from
   chemo.  Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - IV flagyl
 not tolerating PR vanc
   - No IVIG at this time.
   # AML/Leukemia cutis: Day #4 after dacogen completed.
   - Follow counts
   - BMT following
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Now in NSR after surgery.
   - Replete lytes
   - If persisent arrhythmias, consider change pressors
   #Somnolence: Sedation off, will follow.

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery.
- He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis.
- The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**], which led to a CT scan showing free air and subsequent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy surgery.
- He then had a second surgery for abscess drainage with drains placed in the leak.
- The patient is currently on two pressors for sepsis/hypotension, likely due to bowel perforation caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff). His lactate levels are improving after the second surgery.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is falling, and there is serosanguinous fluid coming out of the abdominal drains.
- He is receiving vancomycin and meropenem for sepsis, and consideration is being given to adding caspofungin.
- The patient also has respiratory failure with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure and volume overload on chest X-ray.
- A chest CT revealed a complete collapse of the right lung, and the patient underwent bronchoscopic intervention with tube placement and suctioning of the right mainstem.
- The patient has a loculated pleural effusion on the right side."

   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Then found to have second perf and
   now s/p repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in
   leak.
    # Sepsis/hypotension
 Most likely due to bowel perforation [**3-7**] c.
   diff.  On 2 pressors.  S/p surgery x2.  Improved after second surgery
   with lactate trending down.  Now with falling Hct and serosangunous
   fluid coming out of abdominal drains.
   - Vanc/meropenem for sepsis
   - IV flagyl  for c. diff
   - F/U cultures
   - Pressors to maintain MAP > 60 (off vasopressin, still on levo)
   - F/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   - Follow fever curve
   - PRBC/plts as needed (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50). LR/albumin for now as
   pressor need continues to drop.

   Volume overload on CXR.  Chest CT with complete collapse of right lung
   s/p bronch with tube placement fixed and suctioning of R mainstem.
   Loculated pleural effusion on R.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated on AC
   #Somnolence: Likely [**3-7**] toxic-metabolic encelopathy.  Sedation off,
   will follow.  Too unstable to transport to head CT and low suspicion
   for focal intracranial process.
   #Coagulopathy: Likely [**3-7**] DIC with additional hit to bone marrow from
   chemo.  Bloody output from surgical drains.
   - Follow DIC labs q6h
   - Plts, FFP, cryoprecipitate prn
   #Bowel perforation: s/p surgery as above.
   - Surgery following
   - Serial Hcts.
   - Follow bladder pressures
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Creatinine/potassium stabilized.  UOP improving.
   - Follow UOP/electrolytes
   - Hold on CVVHD for now
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery.
- He was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML and left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and developed acute abdominal pain with CT findings concerning for free air. He underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy, followed by repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak.
- The patient has had multiple surgeries, sepsis, hypotension, respiratory failure, somnolence, coagulopathy, bowel perforation, and C. difficile infection.
- Current assessment includes sepsis/hypotension, respiratory failure, somnolence, coagulopathy, bowel perforation, and other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient is on two pressors and has a history of bowel perforation due to C. difficile. There is a risk of ongoing sepsis and hypotension.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure and volume overload on CXR. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient likely has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with additional bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
 Likely source of infection is bowel perforation though
   differential also include c. diff, line infection, and pna.  Has
   required levophed and vasopressin, though levophed was been weaned down
   marginally over the course of day on [**3-22**].    Currently has
   leukocytosis, hypotensive on 2 pressors, tachycardia.  Patient is s/p
   colectomy and re-operation on [**3-22**] because of persistent duodenoal
   perforation.  Also had abscess drainage during procedure and JPs placed
   in lesser sac (JP2 is most superficial in the lesser sac, JP1 is
   intermediate, and JP3 is deepest).  Weaned off vasopressin on [**2157-3-24**].
   - blood, platelets, albumin 25% (25g), and LR to goal CVP >= 14 given
   PEEP of 12
   - consider albumin after blood for intravascular volume expansion b/c
   patient volume overloaded
   - norepinephrine for goal MAP>60 but will attempt to wean
   - Per ID, Abx changed to Vanco IV and PR, [**Last Name (un) **], flagyl, fluc
   - f/u culture data
   - Hct q8hrs
   - bladder pressures Q 4hrs per surgery recs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.
   - continue current vent settings; will not attempt to wean today
   - s/p bronch on [**2157-3-24**] with results as described above
   # Coagulopathy:  Patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia,
   elevated FDPs, and active bleeding from JP drains in abdomen.
   Fibrinogen remains normal, however, so patient does not strictly meet
   parameters for DIC.  Will empirically treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q8hr
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - IVFs to keep CVP>14
   - monitor lytes
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable (Increasing dose to
   q12h from q24h)
   # C.diff: as above; possibly cause of perforated colon.
   - cont with IV flagyl, PR Vanco for now
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  day #5 after dacogen completed.  Likely counts
   will begin to drop further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left axillary a-line.  left PICC

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [3-21] with a CT scan concerning for free air, indicating a possible bowel perforation. He underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely due to bowel perforation. He required levophed and vasopressin, though levophed was weaned down over the course of the day on [3-22]. The patient also had an abscess drainage during surgery and jugular venous punctures (JP) placed in the lesser sac. He was weaned off vasopressin on [2157-3-24].

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.4°F (39.1°C), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 92/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His physical examination shows crackles in the chest and trace edema in both lower extremities.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.3 K/uL, hyponatremia with sodium levels at 136 mg/d"

   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
 Likely source of infection is bowel perforation though
   differential also include c. diff, line infection, and pna.  Has
   required levophed and vasopressin, though vasopressin now off (as of
   [**3-24**]) and levophed being weaned.    Currently has leukocytosis,
   hypotensive on pressors, tachycardia.  Patient is s/p colectomy and
   re-operation on [**3-22**] because of persistent duodenoal perforation.  Also
   had abscess drainage during procedure and JPs placed in lesser sac (JP2
   is most superficial in the lesser sac, JP1 is intermediate, and JP3 is
   deepest).
   - blood, platelets, albumin 25% (25g), and LR to goal CVP >= 14 given
   PEEP of 12
   - consider albumin after blood for intravascular volume expansion b/c

   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.

   # Coagulopathy:  Patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia,
   elevated FDPs, and active bleeding from JP drains in abdomen.
   Fibrinogen remains normal, however, so patient does not strictly meet
   parameters for DIC.  Will empirically treat for DIC because high risk.

   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - IVFs to keep CVP>14
   - monitor lytes
   - dose vanco by level until creatinine is stable (Increasing dose to

   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT showing free air, indicating a possible bowel perforation. He underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to a likely source of infection being the bowel perforation. He required levophed and vasopressin, but vasopressin has been discontinued. Currently, he is hypotensive on pressors and tachycardic.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has both hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis. His chest X-ray shows pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. He could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated bowel. He is currently on stable ventilator settings.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia, elevated FDPs, and active bleeding from JP drains in the abdomen. Although he does not strictly meet the parameters for DIC, he will be empirically treated for it due to high risk.

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. During his hospital course, he developed acute abdominal pain on [3-21] with a CT scan showing free air, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He then underwent repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in a leak. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and has been experiencing fever. His vital signs are as follows: temperature of 102.4°F, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 112/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He has a history of Clostridium difficile infection, and his current medications include norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and various antibiotics. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. He has multiple comorbidities and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:

   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
Presumed secondary to duodenal perforation with abscess
   though also in the context of active C diff infection.  Despite
   persistent fevers, patient has done well as we have continued to wean
   pressors and he has become more responsive.   Still concern for
   remaining closed space infection.
   -wean off norepinephrine as tolerated (MAP>60)
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   -rescan Monday or Tuesday (d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and ID) for remaining fluid
   collections
   #S/P surgery: Patient has large post-operative wound with some oozing
   of blood.  This is concerning in the context of anemia and
   thrombocytopenia due to continued blood loss, sepsis, marrow
   suppression from chemo or other etiology.
   -Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   -Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
    # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.
   - continue current vent settings; will not attempt to wean today
   - s/p bronch on [**2157-3-24**] with results as described above
   - daily ABGs
   #Coagulation:
   meet parameters for DIC.  Will empirically treat for DIC because high
   risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q8hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - IVFs to keep CVP>14
   - monitor lytes
   - Vanco trough tomorrow AM to confirm appropriate dosing (today
s level
   encouraging)
    # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
    # AML/Leukemia cutis:  day #5 after dacogen completed.  Likely counts
   will begin to drop further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
    # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
    # Access: RIJ, left axillary a-line.  left PICC
   -left axillary A-line is pulling out and hard to keep clean, will

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer who was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and c.diff infection. He developed acute abdominal pain on 3/21 with a CT scan showing free air, indicating a perforated gastric ulcer. The patient underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He is now in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient has persistent fevers and is presumed to have septic shock secondary to duodenal perforation with abscess, possibly complicated by active C. diff infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and a planned rescan on Monday or Tuesday will be done to assess remaining fluid collections.

2. Post-operative wound with oozing of blood: The patient has a large post-operative wound with some oozing of blood, which is concerning in the context of anemia and thrombocytopenia due to continued blood loss, sepsis, and marrow suppression from chemotherapy or other etiology. Efforts are being made to keep Hct >25 and Plt >50.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing both hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis. A chest X-ray shows pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. ARDS is also"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, history of duodenal ulcer surgery, leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and MRSA cellulitis. He was admitted for c.difficile, acute abdominal pain, and subsequent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Impaired skin integrity
2. Sepsis with organ dysfunction
3. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), other
4. Respiratory failure (hypercarbic/hypoxemic)
5. Acute kidney injury (ATN)
6. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
7. Clostridium difficile infection
8. Acute myeloid leukemia/leukemia cutis
9. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of acute kidney injury, development of further coagulopathy, worsening sepsis, complications related to c.difficile infection, and potential relapse or progression of leukemia.

The patient's current treatment plan includes aggressive fluid resuscitation with blood products and albumin to maintain adequate intravascular volume expansion. Vasopressors are being used to maintain adequate blood pressure. Antibiotic therapy has been adjusted based on culture data. Supportive care measures such"

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. During his hospital course, he developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with a CT scan showing free air, indicating a possible bowel perforation. He underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy but was found to have a second perforation and subsequently underwent repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient requires continuous pressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 despite making progress in weaning. This is most likely due to bowel perforation caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Empiric sepsis treatment with vancomycin and meropenem should be continued, tailoring the regimen as culture data becomes available. Additionally, continuous IV flagyl should be administered for C. diff.

2. AML/Leukemia cutis: Follow the patient's blood counts, and provide packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and platelets as needed. The hematocrit (Hct) goal should be 25, and the platelet goal should be 50. Low-molecular"

   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock
Presumed secondary to duodenal perforation with abscess
   though also in the context of active C diff infection.  Despite
   persistent fevers, patient has done well as we have continued to wean
   pressors and he has become more responsive.   Still concern for
   remaining closed space infection.
   -wean off norepinephrine as tolerated (MAP>60)
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   -rescan Monday or Tuesday (d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and ID) for remaining fluid
   collections
   #S/P surgery: Patient has large post-operative wound with some oozing
   of blood.  This is concerning in the context of anemia and
   thrombocytopenia due to continued blood loss, sepsis, marrow
   suppression from chemo or other etiology.
   -Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   -Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.
   - continue current vent settings; will not attempt to wean today
   - s/p bronch on [**2157-3-24**] with results as described above
   - daily ABGs
   #Coagulation:  meet parameters for DIC.  Will empirically treat for DIC
   because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q8hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - IVFs to keep CVP>14
   - monitor lytes
   - Vanco trough tomorrow AM to confirm appropriate dosing (today

   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLP), atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted to the ICU with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and a hospital course complicated by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**], and a CT scan showed free air, indicating a possible perforation. He subsequently underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient's 24-hour events include the placement and removal of an arterial line, fever, and changes in his medical treatment plan. His allergies include penicillins, and he has received various antibiotics over the past few days.

His vital signs show a temperature of 101.7°F, heart rate of 129 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 124/73 mmHg to 97/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows an input of 3,528 mL and output of 4,210 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 682 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and previous duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and subsequently developed Clostridium difficile infection (c.diff). The patient also underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy due to acute abdominal pain and CT findings concerning for free air.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
- The arterial line was started and stopped within a short period of time.
- He has a fever of 101.7°F.
- Pressors are stable, and consideration is being given to the use of Lasix to manage fluid balance.
- A radial arterial line was placed, and the axillary arterial line was discontinued.
- HIT antibodies were sent for testing.
- Bone marrow transplant recommendations include avoiding Neupogen use and discussing the possibility of using IVIG.
- Allergies include penicillins, resulting in hives.
- Medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications.
- The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 129 bpm, blood pressure of 124/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient's weight has decreased from 128.2 kg"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on 3/21 with CT findings concerning for free air, leading to right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He then underwent repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak.

The patient's current conditions include sepsis/hypotension, acute respiratory failure, somnolence, coagulopathy, bowel perforation post-surgery, Clostridium difficile infection, acute tubular necrosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and other issues as noted by the resident.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis due to bowel perforation caused by Clostridium difficile infection. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and antibiotic regimen is essential. Prompt intervention with intravenous fluids and vasopressors may be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to volume overload on chest X-ray. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters, such as oxygen saturation and end-tidal CO2 levels, is crucial. Weaning of FiO2"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLP), atrial fibrillation (AF), and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. During his hospital course, he developed acute abdominal pain and underwent multiple surgeries for complications such as bowel perforation, abscess drainage, and ileostomy.

The patient currently presents with several significant medical complications:

1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient continues to require vasopressors for blood pressure support. He likely has sepsis due to bowel perforation caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Empiric antibiotics (vanc/meropenem) are being administered, and the regimen will be tailored as culture data becomes available. Continuous IV flagyl is also being given for C. diff.

2. AML/Leukemia cutis: The patient's blood counts are being monitored, and he is receiving packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and platelets as needed to maintain a target hematocrit (Hct) of 25 and platelet count of 50. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is planned following the current treatment.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. During his hospital course, he developed acute abdominal pain and underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy due to a bowel perforation caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff). He then required repeat surgery for an abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:
1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient is septic and hypotensive, most likely due to bowel perforation secondary to C. diff. He is currently on pressors and receiving antibiotics tailored to the culture data.
2. AML/Leukemia cutis: The patient has AML with leukemia cutis. Further management includes following the blood counts and providing packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and platelets as needed to maintain a target hematocrit (Hct) of 25% and platelet count (Plt) of 50,000/mL. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) will be considered following the counts.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. He requires careful monitoring and management of"

   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
    # Septic shock
Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc..  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  .
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   -ID would like to rescan for persistent collection but surgery would
   prefer to postpone given no planned further intervention at this time
   and low suspicion for colleciton
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   -No further attempts to diurese today
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
    # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - continue current vent settings; will not attempt to wean today
   - daily ABGs
   -recheck CXR this PM given poor quality film this AM
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
    # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
    # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Will decrease vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough today
   appropriate at 20, will continue dosing and recheck evel in AM)
    # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
    # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
    # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left radial a-line.  left PICC

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [3-21] and had a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a history of leukemia cutis/AML and MRSA cellulitis, which can increase the risk of impaired skin integrity.
2. Sepsis: The patient has developed septic shock, likely due to a presumed duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents. He has persistent fevers with a wide differential including infection, tumor, etc.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing both hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis. He has pulmonary edema and pleural effusions on CXR, and there is a possibility of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the setting of perforated bowel.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient meets parameters for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) based on elevated fibrin degradation products (FDP) but is not clinically in DIC. He will be empirically treated for DIC due to high"

 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
    # Septic shock
Presumed secondary to duodenal perforation with
   abscess though also in the context of active C diff infection.  Despite
   persistent fevers, patient has done well as we have continued to wean
   pressors and he has become more responsive.   Still concern for
   remaining closed space infection.  Weaned off norepinephrine since
   [**2157-3-27**].
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   -rescan Monday or Tuesday (d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and ID) for remaining fluid
   collections
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume in
   conjunction with lasix gtt to decrease anasarca
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
    # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.
   - continue current vent settings; will not attempt to wean today
   - s/p bronch on [**2157-3-24**] with results as described above
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
    # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
    # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Will decrease vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM
    # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
    # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
    # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and c. difficile infection. The patient subsequently developed acute abdominal pain and underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient's current medical issues include septic shock, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), Clostridium difficile infection, AML/leukemia cutis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and sacral deep tissue injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued septic shock: The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. If not properly managed, there is a risk of further deterioration in organ function or development of septic shock.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing both hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure. If the respiratory support is inadequate or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure and potential need for more advanced respiratory support.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient is at risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to the presence of elevated fibrin degradation products."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT findings concerning for free air, and subsequently underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He then experienced a second perforation and underwent repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak.

The patient's current conditions include sepsis/hypotension, AML/leukemia cutis, respiratory failure, somnolence, coagulopathy, bowel perforation, Clostridium difficile infection, acute tubular necrosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and other issues noted in the resident's progress note.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis due to bowel perforation caused by Clostridium difficile infection. He is currently on pressors and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. AML/leukemia cutis: The patient has leukemia cutis associated with AML. Monitoring of blood counts and platelet levels is necessary. Blood transfusions and bone marrow transplantation may be required.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hyper"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer who was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and c.diff. He developed acute abdominal pain on 3/21 with CT findings concerning for free air, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Subsequently, he underwent repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak. The patient is currently critically ill with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient has sepsis likely due to bowel perforation caused by Clostridium difficile infection. He requires continued empiric antibiotic coverage tailored to culture data and IV metronidazole for c.diff.
2. AML/Leukemia Cutis: The patient's leukemia cutis/AML needs to be monitored with regular blood counts, and he may require platelet and red blood cell transfusions as needed. Bone marrow transplantation may be considered following further evaluation.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure with volume overload on chest X-ray. Lasix infusion and albumin are being given to manage fluid balance. FiO2 should be weaned as tolerated, but the patient is not ready for pressure support ventilation (PSV) yet due to chest wall ed"

He later required repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a Vt of 550 mL, RR of 20, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and an RSBI of 100. His SpO2 is 100%. He is receiving multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem, and fluconazole for empiric sepsis, as well as IV flagyl for Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient is on pressors and has been hypotensive overnight. He is being aggressively diuresed.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure and is volume overloaded on the chest X-ray. Lasix gtt has been started per surgery, but the patient became hypotensive in that setting. FiO2 will be weaned as tolerated on AC, but the patient is not ready for PS yet until chest wall edema/anasarca starts to lift.

3. AML/leukemia cutis: The patient's blood counts need to be followed, and PRBCs and plates as needed should be administered (Hct goal 25, Plt goal 50). Bone marrow transplantation will be considered following.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has presumed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with additional hits to the bone marrow from chemotherapy. Bloody output from surgical drains is present. DIC labs/HIT should be followed, and FFP, cryoprecipitate, and platelets should be administered as needed.

5. Bowel perforation: The patient underwent surgery for bowel perforation, and surgery will be considered following. Serial hcts and follow-up of bladder pressures are necessary.

6. C. difficile: The patient has an ongoing C. difficile infection, which may have caused the perforated colon. IV flagyl should be continued.

7. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's renal function is improving, and medications have been adjusted for the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

8. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient was tachycardic on arrival but is now in normal sinus rhythm after surgery. Replete electrolytes should be maintained, and if persistent arrhythmias occur, a change in pressors may be considered.

The patient's critical illness requires careful monitoring and management of these potential complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a previous duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. During his hospital course, he developed acute abdominal pain and underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy due to free air found on CT. He then had a second perforation and underwent repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drain placement in the leak.

The patient's current medical complications include sepsis/hypotension, acute respiratory failure with volume overload, somnolence, coagulopathy, bowel perforation, Clostridium difficile infection, acute tubular necrosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and other issues noted by the ICU resident.

The patient is critically ill and requires ongoing management for these complications. The assessment and plan include various interventions such as tailoring antibiotic regimen based on culture data, continuing IV flagyl for C. difficile, monitoring and transfusing as needed for AML/leukemia cutis, weaning FiO2 in respiratory failure, managing coagulopathy, following up on DIC labs/HIT, addressing bowel perforation, managing C. difficile infection, adjusting medications for acute tubular necrosis, and managing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer who was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. He developed acute abdominal pain on 3/21 with a CT scan showing evidence of free air, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Subsequently, he underwent repeat surgery with abscess drainage and drains placed in the leak.

The patient's current condition includes sepsis/hypotension, respiratory failure, AML/leukemia cutis, somnolence, coagulopathy, bowel perforation post-surgery, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and other issues noted in the resident's progress note.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient is on pressors overnight in the setting of aggressive diuresis. Continuous vancomycin, meropenem, and fluconazole are being administered empirically for sepsis. The regimen will be tailored based on culture data. IV flagyl is also being given for C. diff.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. Volume overload is evident on the chest X-ray"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
    # Septic shock
Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as needed.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now given likelihood of
   counts dropping soon
   - CT abdomen/pelvis today to r/o abscess
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - No further attempts to diurese today
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - continue current vent settings but decrease FiO2 given PaO2 of 170
   today
   - will place pigtail catheter in left chest given increasing pleural
   effusions and ?parapneumonic effusion
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Will decrease vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough today
   appropriate at 20, will continue dosing and recheck level in AM)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left radial a-line.  left PICC

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
    # Septic shock
Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc..  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  .
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   -ID would like to rescan for persistent collection but surgery would
   prefer to postpone given no planned further intervention at this time
   and low suspicion for colleciton
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   -No further attempts to diurese today
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - continue current vent settings; will not attempt to wean today
   - daily ABGs
   -recheck CXR this PM given poor quality film this AM
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Will decrease vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough today
   appropriate at 20, will continue dosing and recheck evel in AM)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left radial a-line.  left PICC

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. During his hospital course, he developed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, acute abdominal pain, and free air on CT scan, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient is now in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

24-hour events include blood cultures showing fungal infection, bronchoscopy to address right lobar collapse, fever, transfusion of platelets and red blood cells, and discussion about overall goals of care with the medical team.

The patient has ongoing septic shock with presumed duodenal perforation as the source of infection. He continues to have fevers, and there is a wide differential including infection, tumor, etc. The trend is towards improvement, but the inability to diurese and the need for pressors overnight is concerning. The patient will be weaned off pressors and repleted with blood products and albumin as needed.

Other issues include respiratory failure with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis. The patient has pulmonary edema and pleural effusions on chest X-ray, which could be developing into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
    # Septic shock
Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as needed.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now given likelihood of
   counts dropping soon
   - CT abdomen/pelvis today to r/o abscess
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - No further attempts to diurese today
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - continue current vent settings but decrease FiO2 given PaO2 of 170
   today
   - will place pigtail catheter in left chest given increasing pleural
   effusions and ?parapneumonic effusion
   - daily ABGs
   -recheck CXR this PM given poor quality film this AM
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Will decrease vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough today
   appropriate at 20, will continue dosing and recheck evel in AM)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left radial a-line.  left PICC

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history including hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLP), atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. The patient was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and a hospital course complicated by Clostridium difficile (c.diff) infection. 

The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**], which led to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. Since then, the patient has been experiencing septic shock presumed to be due to a persistent duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents. The patient has been febrile with wide differentials including infection, tumor, etc. The patient's respiratory status has been compromised, leading to hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis. There are also signs of pulmonary edema and pleural effusions on chest X-ray, and the possibility of developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to the perforated bowel is being considered. 

The patient's coagulation profile shows elevated FDP, indicating a potential disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), although it is not clinically evident. The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to hypoperfusion during sepsis, and there are concerns about acute tub"

He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. During his hospital course, he developed c.difficile, acute abdominal pain, and free air on CT, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has persistent duodenal perforation, which could be the source of continued infection. He is experiencing fevers, indicating ongoing sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered to cover for various potential pathogens.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing both hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to sepsis. He has pulmonary edema and pleural effusions on chest X-ray, and there is a concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to the perforated bowel.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient meets the criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) based on elevated fibrin degradation products, although he does not exhibit clinical signs of DIC. Empirical treatment for DIC is being provided due to his high risk.

4. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient has muddy brown casts in his urine"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as needed.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   fluconazole)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now given likelihood of
   counts dropping soon
   - CT abdomen/pelvis today to r/o abscess
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - No further attempts to diurese today
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q8hrs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - continue current vent settings but decrease FiO2 given PaO2 of 170
   today
   - will place pigtail catheter in left chest given increasing pleural
   effusions and ?parapneumonic effusion
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Will decrease vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough today
   appropriate at 20, will continue dosing and recheck level in AM)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT recs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left radial a-line.  left PICC
   # Comm: Wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4140**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and previous duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. During his hospital course, he developed Clostridium difficile infection and now presents with acute abdominal pain. A CT scan revealed free air and he underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient continues to have fevers, and his condition is complicated by septic shock, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), C. difficile infection, AML, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and sacral deep tissue injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is at risk for continued infection due to persistent duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid status, and blood cultures is necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has both hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea. Daily ABGs and pulmonary support should be continued.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient meets parameters for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) but does not exhibit clinical signs. Empirical treatment for DIC is recommended due to high"

   Assessment and Plan
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumed source of continued infection is persistent
   duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient is
   continuing to have fevers with wide differential including  infection,
   tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement though inability to
   diurese and need for pressors overnight is discouraging.  Will attempt
   to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodental perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin d1=[**3-22**], meropenem d1=[**3-22**],
   metronidazole d1=[**3-21**], fluconazole d1=[**3-21**])
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin but will continue for now per surgery given
   likelihood of counts dropping soon
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - lasix gtt with pressors
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
   - If fevers do not resolve, consider evaluation for drug fever
could
   hold vancomycin
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Currently on stable ventilator settings.  S/p bronch on [**3-22**]
   for right lobar collapse but no mucous plug seen; aeration improved
   after advancement of ETT 2 cm (was at level of vocal chords).  S/p
   bronch on [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again
   absent.  Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.  Have
   attempted to wean to PS *2 but patient has not been able to tolerate
   due to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
   - bronch today given aspiration event on [**3-30**] and surgery request for
   bronch
   - pigtail catheter to be placed in left chest per IP
   - send pleural fluid for gm stain and cx
   - attempt PS trial after sitting patient up in bed to reduce PEEP
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above.
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Cont vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough appears to be
   stable at 20)
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**])
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.  Likely counts will begin to drop
   further in the next few days per oncology.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K
   - BMT reccs
   - family meeting today to discuss prognosis of AML given limited
   chemotherapy regimen
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
    # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN
   # Access: RIJ, left radial a-line.  left PICC

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer status post surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and hospital course complicated by Clostridium difficile infection. 

The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [3-21] with a CT scan showing free air, indicating a perforation. He subsequently underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He is currently experiencing septic shock, presumed to be due to the persistent duodenal perforation and extravasation of gastric contents. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 34/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 51 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 348 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 26.0%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals general appearance of being overweight/obese, eyes/conjunctiva as pinpoint (PERRL), normocephalic endotracheal tube, and nasogastric (NG) tube. His cardiovascular assessment shows normal heart sounds (S1 and S2), peripheral pulses, and no signs of peripheral edema. His respiratory assessment indicates clear breath sounds with diminished breath sounds at the left base. 

Abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, ostomy present, and multiple Jackson-Pratt (JP) drains. Extremity examination shows edema of both lower extremities, rated as 3+ edema bilaterally. Neurologic assessment reveals the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, responding to verbal stimuli, and showing purposeful movements. 

Laboratory results show leukocyte count (WBC) of 8.2 thousand/mm3, hematocrit (Hct) of 26.4%, platelet count (Plt) of 52 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) of 1.1 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 29 mmol/L, glucose level of 127 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 1.1 mmol/L. The patient's blood cultures are positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 

The patient's assessment includes impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, cancer (malignant neoplasm), respiratory failure, coagulopathy, hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), Clostridium difficile infection, acute myeloid leukemia/leukemia cutis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response"

   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient
   is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.
   -Continue broad spectrum abx (vancomycin d1=[**3-22**], meropenem d1=[**3-22**],
   metronidazole d1=[**3-21**], fluconazole d1=[**3-21**])

   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement yesterday and patient did well on PS trial.  S/p bronch on
   [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.
   Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.
   - IP to drain right side effusion today, will send for studies, CXR
   afterward and attempt [**6-7**] trial if tolerates

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and previous duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and subsequently developed acute abdominal pain on [3-21] with a CT scan showing free air, indicating a perforation. The patient underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He is now in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock due to continued infection and persistent duodenal perforation with extravasation of gastric contents. He has fevers with a wide differential including infection, tumor, etc.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing both hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis. This could be due to pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in the setting of perforated bowel.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient meets parameters for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) based on elevated fibrin degradation products but does not have clinical signs of DIC. However, he is being treated empirically for DIC due to high risk.
4. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient has muddy brown casts in his urine"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and previous duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**], which led to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has wounds and dressings with serosanguinous drainage, indicating possible impaired skin integrity.
2. Sepsis, Severe (With Organ Dysfunction): The patient is likely experiencing sepsis due to continued infection and persistent duodenal perforation with extravasation of gastric contents. His fevers and wide differential, including infection, tumor, etc., suggest an ongoing infection.
3. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm), Other: The patient has a history of leukemia cutis/AML, which may contribute to his overall clinical condition.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis. His CXR shows pulmonary edema and pleural effusions, indicating potential respiratory distress.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure and abdominal perfusion issues. They have been admitted to the ICU and require multiple interventions and medications to manage their conditions. The patient underwent a thoracentesis procedure and had an arterial line placed, which later became non-functional. They were weaned off assisted ventilation but required it again due to hypoxemia and hypercarbia. The patient also required platelets and received various antibiotics for their condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is currently compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not properly managed.
2. Septic shock: Given the presence of sepsis and organ dysfunction, the patient is at risk of developing septic shock, which can lead to circulatory collapse and multiple organ failure.
3. Volume overload: The patient's total body volume is overloaded, which may result in fluid accumulation and increased pressure on the heart and lungs.
4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient requires additional support to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60, indicating potential hemodynamic instability.
5. Cancer progression: The patient has a history of cancer, and it is essential to monitor for any progression or complications related to the malignancy.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and central venous"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure and abdominal perfusion issues. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation, and on vasopressor support. The patient underwent a thoracentesis and arterial line placement, but the arterial line stopped functioning. They were weaned from mechanical ventilation but required assistance overnight due to hypoxemia and hypercarbia. The patient also needed platelets transfused. They have allergies to penicillins and have received various antibiotics and other medications. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/52 to 117/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. They are in atrial fibrillation and have a significant weight loss since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 5,303 mL and output of 6,548 mL, with negative balances in urine, NG, and drains. 

Respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, CMV/assist ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory system resistance (RSBI) of 84, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 20 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 15 cmH2O. Blood gases show a pH of 7.31, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of"

   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
    # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of gastric contents.  Patient
   is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.

   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
   - If fevers do not resolve, consider evaluation for drug fever
could
   hold vancomycin
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Also, could be developing ARDS in the setting of perforated
   bowel.   Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement yesterday and patient did well on PS trial.  S/p bronch on
   [**3-23**] for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.
   Bronched again today w/o clear plugging or collapse.
   - IP to drain right side effusion today, will send for studies, CXR
   afterward and attempt [**6-7**] trial if tolerates
   - daily ABGs
   # Coagulopathy:  meets parameters for DIC based on elevated FDP but not
   clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse bleeding.  Will empirically
   treat for DIC because high risk.

   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   - Cont vanc to 750mg q12h and check trough in AM (trough appears to be

   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stabilizing to 80-100 now.
   - hold nodal agents for now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and previous duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and c.diff. The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with a CT scan showing free air, indicating a possible duodenal perforation. He subsequently underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
- Impaired skin integrity: The patient has areas of impaired skin integrity, likely due to the MRSA infection and c.diff.
- Sepsis: The patient is experiencing septic shock, likely secondary to the duodenal perforation with extravasation of gastric contents. He has ongoing fevers and a wide differential diagnosis, including infection, tumor, etc.
- Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing both hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to sepsis and a perforated bowel. There is also evidence of pulmonary edema and pleural effusions on the chest X-ray.
- Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated FDP level, suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), although he does not exhibit clinical signs of DIC. He is being empirically treated for DIC due to the high risk.
- Hemicolectomy and duodenal perfor"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**4-1**]
   -Received two units of platelets in the morning for drainage of right
   sided pleural effusion (had thoracentesis to remove 1.2 L fluid)
   -Had diffuse oozing of blood from colostomy site and some IV sites
   prior to platelets and resolved somewhat, Hct checked from drain and
   was <2%
   -A-line d/c'd as not working
   -Had right sided thoracentesis with 1.2 L of fluid removed (unable to
   place drain because collection too posterior)
   -Got one packet of platelets in PM for plt 29, deferred blood given
   overall goal to get patient negative
   -Weaned from [**11-12**] to [**11-7**] in AM and did well till late afternoon
   -Had blood gas in PM that showed increasing hypoxia and more
   concerningly hypercarbia, then began to have smaller tidal volumes and
   signs of tiring so put back on AC, got tachycardic briefly w/ increased
   ectopy but then settled down again

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLP), atrial fibrillation, and a past surgical history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), left thigh methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cellulitis, and hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile (c.diff). The patient developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with a CT scan showing free air, leading to a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

24-hour Events:
- Received two units of platelets in the morning for drainage of right-sided pleural effusion (thoracentesis removed 1.2 L fluid). Prior to platelets, there was diffuse oozing of blood from the colostomy site and some IV sites, which somewhat resolved. Hematocrit (Hct) checked from drain was <2%.
- A-line disconnected as it was not working.
- Thoracentesis with 1.2 L of fluid removed (unable to place drain because collection too posterior).
- Got one packet of platelets in the evening for Plt 29, deferred blood given overall goal to get the patient negative.
- Weaned from [**11-12**] to [**11-7**] in the morning and did well until late afternoon"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff who developed acute
   abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free air and is now s/p
   right hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents.
   Patient is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.   In contact with surgery (pager [**Numeric Identifier 4453**]).
   - Continue broad spectrum abx meropenem d1=[**3-22**] (day 13), metronidazole
   d1=[**3-21**] (day 14), fluconazole d1=[**3-21**] (day 14)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin- done
   - albumin and blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - restart lasix gtt
   - titrate levo PRN
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
   # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement and on right side after thoracentesis.  S/p bronch on [**3-23**]
   for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.  Bronched
   again [**4-1**] w/o clear plugging or collapse.   Extubated successfully on
   [**4-2**].
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   - consider prn nebs, though does not carry a diagnosis of COPD
   # Coagulopathy:  On [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admission  met parameters for DIC based on
   elevated FDP but not clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse
   bleeding.
   - continue blood, FFP, blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
   # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above. Collaborating with surgical team
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.
   - f/u renal reccs
   - monitor lytes
   # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**]; day 14)
   - surgery following
   # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p dacogen.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K (transfuse this AM)
   - BMT reccs
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stable over last several days.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
   # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. During his hospital course, he developed Clostridium difficile infection and underwent a right hemicolectomy due to acute abdominal pain with a CT scan showing free air. The patient is now extubated and receiving supplemental oxygen.

Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is presumed to have septic shock due to continued infection and persistent duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents. He has had fevers with a wide differential including infection, tumor, etc.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required mechanical ventilation but is now extubated. He experienced hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis. A chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain placement and on the right side after thoracentesis was observed. The patient underwent bronchoscopy for decreased right lung size but mucous plug was absent. Another bronchoscopy was performed without clear plugging or collapse.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient had elevated FDP levels but did not meet clinical criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)."

","Summary:
The patient has a history of perforated abdomen and is currently in the ICU. They are extubated and receiving low-dose norepinephrine. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, and they have been successfully extubated. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation, hemodynamic instability due to fluid overload, coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia, abdominal perforation with ongoing management of the open abdomen, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience respiratory failure if they are unable to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters, such as oxygen saturation (SpO2) and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), is necessary. If the patient's respiratory status worsens, reintubation may be required.

2. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's intravascular volume is overloaded, leading to hypotension and the need for vasopressor support. Monitoring of blood pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), and urine output is important. Adjustments in fluid management and vasopressor therapy should be made accordingly.

3. Coagulopathy and Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a coagulopathic state with thrombocytopenia. Platelet transfusion should be given as needed for procedures or active bleeding. Regular monitoring of coagulation"

   well on lasix drip but this requires vasopressor support to
   accomplaish. Will try back on PSV today- did get fatigued overnight so
   may need PSV by day and AC by night . This is difficult situation as
   goal is extubation as soon as possible but plan for no re intubation
   shudl he fail and family hopeful to have some meaningful time to speak
   with him on goals oif at all possible post extubation

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of perforated abdomen. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including cancer, sepsis with organ dysfunction, and respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 62-95/54-79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and nutrition support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of atrial fibrillation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which may require tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation.
2. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, and there is evidence of intravascular volume overload. This can lead to complications such as acute heart failure or pulmonary edema.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathic state indicated by low platelet count and prolonged clotting times. This increases the risk of bleeding, especially during invasive procedures.
4. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to sepsis. There is a risk of antibiotic resistance or adverse drug reactions.

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of a perforated abdomen. The patient has been in the ICU and is currently experiencing several medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was successfully extubated last night, but there is a concern about re-intubation as per family wishes.
2. Hemodynamics: The patient's intravascular volume is low, but overall body volume is overloaded. The patient is receiving norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60, while also trying to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): The patient has coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. Platelet transfusion is only being given as needed for procedures or active bleeding.
4. Abdominal Perforation: The patient still has an open abdomen and no plans for intervention have been discussed. Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 4443] was consulted on rounds this morning.
5. Other issues: These include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis (DVT and stress ulcer), communication with the family, code status (DNR), and disposition in the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
- Heart rate: 111 bpm (with a range of 95-119 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 95"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and a previous duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**]. He underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient continues to have fevers with a wide differential including infection, tumor, etc. His respiratory status has improved post-extubation, and he is maintaining adequate urine output. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and other ICU medications as per the plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to persistent infection and duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis, which has improved after pleural drain placement and thoracentesis.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient had signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) initially but is no longer exhibiting clinical signs of DIC on labs.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient experienced acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with muddy brown casts in urine, likely due to hypoperfusion during septic shock.
5. Clostridium difficile (C. diff"

   who developed acute abdominal pain on [**3-21**] with CT concerning for free

   24 Hour Events:
   - continued to do well from a respiratory perspective post extubation
   - restarted lasix gtt, had good UOP
   - continued low dose levophed
   - increased frequency of fentanyl boluses to q1hr prn b/c of pain
   Plan:  continue diuresis with lasix gtt and levophed, continue
   antibiotics, two possible trajectories include (1) continue supportive
   care, e.g. antibx, diuresis, attempt to weane pressors, surgery does
   not plan to take patient back to OR, versus (2) onc thinks prognosis
   from AML is poor, therefore family may consider CMO.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLP), atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. The patient developed acute abdominal pain and underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy due to concerns for free air on CT scan. He also had an episode of Clostridium difficile (c.diff) infection. The patient experienced septic shock, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's current plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, blood product transfusions, diuresis, and titrating pressor support as needed. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of multiple infections, including MRSA cellulitis, c.diff, and possible ongoing infection related to the duodenal perforation. This increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient had hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation. There is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if the patient develops another lung infection or if there is a deterioration in lung function"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff now s/p right
   hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents.
   Patient is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.   In contact with surgery (pager [**Numeric Identifier 4453**]).
   - Continue broad spectrum abx meropenem d1=[**3-22**] (day 14), metronidazole
   d1=[**3-21**] (day 15), fluconazole d1=[**3-21**] (day 15)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin- done
   - blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - d/c'ed lasix gtt, pt diuresing well w/o lasix
   - titrate levo PRN
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50 per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
    # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement and on right side after thoracentesis.  S/p bronch on [**3-23**]
   for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.  Bronched
   again [**4-1**] w/o clear plugging or collapse.   Extubated successfully on
   [**4-2**].
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   - consider prn nebs, though does not carry a diagnosis of COPD
   # Coagulopathy:  On [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admission  met parameters for DIC based on
   elevated FDP but not clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse
   bleeding.  No longer has evidence of DIC on labs.
   - continue blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
    # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above. Collaborating with surgical team
    # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.  Now resolved.
   - monitor lytes
    # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**]; day 15)
   - surgery following
    # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p decitabine 5day palliative induction
   therapy.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K (transfuse this AM)
   - BMT reccs
    # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stable over last several days.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVFs as above; TPN
   - replete lytes PRN

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLP), atrial fibrillation, and a past history of duodenal ulcers that have undergone surgery. The patient was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and a hospital course complicated by Clostridium difficile (c.diff) infection. The patient recently underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications, including septic shock due to continued infection and persistent duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents. The patient also has respiratory failure, both hypercarbic and hypoxemic, in the setting of sepsis. There is pulmonary edema and pleural effusions on chest X-ray, which improved after pleural drain placement and thoracentesis. The patient was successfully extubated on [**4-2**].

The patient also has a coagulopathy, which was initially suspected to be disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) but is now resolved. The patient's kidney function initially worsened, leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), but has since improved. The patient has a diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection and is being treated with IV flagyl.

   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff now s/p right
   hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents.
   Patient is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.   In contact with surgery (pager [**Numeric Identifier 4453**]).
   - Continue broad spectrum abx meropenem d1=[**3-22**] (day 14), metronidazole
   d1=[**3-21**] (day 15), fluconazole d1=[**3-21**] (day 15)

   - titrate levo PRN
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50 per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
    # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement and on right side after thoracentesis.  S/p bronch on [**3-23**]
   for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.  Bronched
   again [**4-1**] w/o clear plugging or collapse.   Extubated successfully on
   [**4-2**].
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   - consider prn nebs, though does not carry a diagnosis of COPD
   # Coagulopathy:  On [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admission  met parameters for DIC based on
   elevated FDP but not clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse
   bleeding.  No longer has evidence of DIC on labs.
   - continue blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
    # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above. Collaborating with surgical team
    # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.  Now resolved.
   - monitor lytes
    # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**]; day 15)
   - surgery following
    # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p decitabine 5day palliative induction
   therapy.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K (transfuse this AM)
   - BMT reccs
    # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stable over last several days.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and left thigh MRSA cellulitis. During his hospital course, he developed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and subsequently underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. The patient's current condition is septic shock, likely due to continued infection and persistent duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents. He has also had a sacral deep tissue injury and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly managed.

2. Duodenal Perforation: The patient has a persistent duodenal perforation from a previous duodenal ulcer surgery. This can lead to further complications such as abscess formation, peritonitis, or sepsis if not addressed properly.

3. C. difficile Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. It can lead to complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and sepsis if left untreated.

4. AML/Leukemia Cutis: The patient has leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is a type of blood cancer. It can spread to the skin and other organs, leading to various complications depending on the extent of the disease progression.

5. MRSA Cellulitis: The patient initially presented with left thigh MRSA cellulitis, which is a bacterial skin infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. If not properly managed, it can lead to worsening infection, sepsis, or the development of resistant strains of bacteria.

6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heart rhythm. It can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure if not managed appropriately.

7. Sacral Deep Tissue Injury: The patient has a sacral deep tissue injury, which can lead to complications such as infection, non-healing wounds, or pressure ulcers if not managed properly.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current condition pose several potential medical complications that require close monitoring and appropriate management."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of HTN, HLP, atrial fibrillation, h/o
   duodenal ulcer s/p surgery admitted with leukemia cutis/AML, left thigh
   MRSA cellulitis with hospital course c/b c.diff now s/p right
   hemicolectomy and ileostomy
   # Septic shock: Presumably due to continued infection and persistent
   duodenal perforation with extravasation of intestinal contents.
   Patient is continuing to have fevers with wide differential including
   infection, tumor, etc.  Overall trend is toward improvement.  We will
   attempt to wean pressors and replete with blood products +/- albumin as
   needed.  CT on [**2157-3-30**] showed persistent duodetal perforation but no
   clear evidence of abscess.   In contact with surgery (pager [**Numeric Identifier 4453**]).
   - Continue broad spectrum abx meropenem d1=[**3-22**] (day 14), metronidazole
   d1=[**3-21**] (day 15), fluconazole d1=[**3-21**] (day 15)
   - ID reccs d/c vancomycin- done
   - blood products as needed for intravascular volume
   - d/c'ed lasix gtt, pt diuresing well w/o lasix
   - titrate levo PRN
   - Keep Hct>25, Plt.>50 per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   - Hct, Plt, Coags q12hrs
    # Respiratory Failure: both hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of sepsis.  CXR with pulmonary edema and pleural
   effusions.  Improved aeration of the left lung after pleural drain
   placement and on right side after thoracentesis.  S/p bronch on [**3-23**]
   for decreased right lung size but mucous plug again absent.  Bronched
   again [**4-1**] w/o clear plugging or collapse.   Extubated successfully on
   [**4-2**].
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   - consider prn nebs, though does not carry a diagnosis of COPD
   # Coagulopathy:  On [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admission  met parameters for DIC based on
   elevated FDP but not clinically in DIC given absence of diffuse
   bleeding.  No longer has evidence of DIC on labs.
   - continue blood transfusions as needed
   - coags, hct, and platlets q12hr with goal INR<=1.6
   - s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 2 on [**2157-3-23**]
    # Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation:  Sepsis management as above,
   transfusion parameters as above. Collaborating with surgical team
    # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  ATN with muddy brown casts in urine.  Was oliguric on [**2157-3-22**]
   but urine output increasing as of [**2157-3-23**].  Concern initially for
   worsening kidney function and possible need for dialysis but UOP
   improving.  Likely experienced ATN from hypoperfusion in setting of
   sepsis.  Now resolved.
   - monitor lytes
    # C.diff: Diagnosed in setting of abdominal pain and relatively soon
   interval development of septic picture.
   - cont with IV flagyl (d1=[**3-21**]; day 15)
   - surgery following
    # AML/Leukemia cutis:  S/p decitabine 5day palliative induction
   therapy.
   - tx to keep HCT>25 based on consultation with surgery
   - tx to keep plts >50K (transfuse this AM)
   - BMT reccs
    # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on arrival, very tachycardic to
   130-150s.  Likely all response to being septic and post operatively.
   Norepinephrine also likely culprit.  Cards consulted and do not think
   TEE followed by cardioversion indicated at this time. If becomes
   acutely unstable, consider emergent cardioversion without TEE followed
   by amio gtt.  HR stable over last several days.
   - hold nodal agents for now
   - no amio for now- not anticoagulated so concern for embolic even if
   spontaneously converts
    # Sacral deep tissue injury:  Wound nurses following.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and had a hospital course complicated by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. 

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
- Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate is 108 beats per minute, blood pressure is 89/60 mmHg (75/33-120/65), respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%. The patient has atrial fibrillation.
- General appearance: The patient is not in acute distress.
- Eyes/conjunctiva: Extremities: Peripheral vascular: Skin: Neurologic: Follows simple commands, responds to movement, tone not assessed.
- Labs/radiology: The patient has elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelets, and lactic acid levels. There are also abnormal results for electrolytes, kidney function tests, liver function tests, and coagulation profile.
- Assessment and plan: The patient has multiple medical complications including septic shock, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), Clostridium difficile infection, acute myeloid leukemia/leukemia cutis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and sacral deep tissue injury. The patient's current management includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, blood product transfusions, and close monitoring of vital signs, electrolytes, coagulation parameters, and organ function. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening septic shock, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, kidney injury, C. difficile infection recurrence, leukemia progression, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and wound infection or dehiscence at the surgical site."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and previous duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), left thigh methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cellulitis, and c.diff infection. The patient has undergone a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy.

The patient's current condition includes septic shock, coagulopathy, hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation, resolved c.diff infection, AML/leukemia cutis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and sacral deep tissue injury. The family wants to take the patient home for the remaining time he has left, and the plan is to coordinate with hospice.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's persistent infection and duodenal perforation may lead to septic shock, which is already being managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics and blood product transfusions.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient had elevated FDP levels suggestive of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) but has since resolved. However, ongoing coagulopathy may still be a concern and needs to be monitored.

3. Hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation: The patient's recent surgery and duodenal perfor"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLP), atrial fibrillation, and a history of duodenal ulcer surgery. He was admitted with leukemia cutis/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), left thigh MRSA cellulitis, and c.diff infection. The patient underwent a right hemicolectomy and ileostomy. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 76/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 10 cmH2O.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 44 K/uL, sodium of 143 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride of 110 mEq/L, magnesium of 2.1 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 158 mg/dL. The results also indicate an elevated lactic acid level of 1.7 mmol/L and a decreased albumin level of 2.5 g/dL. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, eyes/conjunctiva showing eyes moving in all directions (EMI), and peripheral vascular pulses present but not assessed. The patient's extremities are edematous in both arms, and the skin is not assessed. Neurologically, the patient follows simple commands and responds appropriately.

The patient's medical conditions include septic shock, coagulopathy, hemicolectomy and duodenal perforation, C.diff infection, AML/leukemia cutis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and sacral deep tissue injury.

The plan of care includes setting up home with hospice, weaning off pressors, repleting with blood products, monitoring intravascular volume, discontinuing lasix, off levo, and maintaining hemoglobin concentration above 25% and platelet count above 50 K/uL. The patient's family wants to take him home for the remaining time he has left, and the plan is for a bereavement counselor to coordinate with hospice.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Continued septic shock due to ongoing infection and persistent duodenal perforation.
2. Bleeding due to coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia.
3. Kidney injury due to hypotension and decreased renal perfusion.
4. Malnutrition due to ileostomy and inability to tolerate oral intake.
5. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
6. Deep vein thrombosis due to immobility and central venous catheters.
7. Pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and decreased tissue perfusion.
8. Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.

These potential complications should be closely monitored and managed accordingly to ensure the patient's comfort and quality of life during the remaining time he has left."
