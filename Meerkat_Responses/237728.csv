","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous RCA stent, bioprosthetic AVR, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted for ischemic toes and had a hospital course complicated by a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, which is believed to be caused by prolonged QT syndrome secondary to ciprofloxacin use. The patient underwent angioplasty for peripheral arterial disease and had femoral lines placed. He has been on invasive ventilation and multi-lumen femoral line. The patient's current vital signs are stable, but he has a prolonged QT interval on telemetry. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels. He has positive urine cultures for Citrobacter and Coag positive staph, and blood cultures are pending. The patient's gangrenous wound requires coverage for Citrobacter and Coag positive staph. He also has acute on chronic renal failure, which is improving since angioplasty, and he has been weaned off some medications. The patient's anemia is stable but low, and his diabetes is being managed with oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin. The patient's access includes PIVs and a discontinued left femoral line. His code status is full code. 

Potential Medical Complications:

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted for ischemic toes and underwent angiography. The patient experienced a ventricular fibrillation arrest on the floor, which is believed to be related to prolonged QT syndrome precipitated by ciprofloxacin. He was resuscitated and brought to the ICU for close monitoring.

On admission, the patient had an elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL and a hematocrit of 27.0%. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 107/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 487 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen of 50%.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild conjunctival pallor, a flat jugular venous pressure, and a regular heart rhythm with a 2-3 systolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border. His chest is clear to auscultation, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AFib), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post left angioplasty, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). He was admitted for ischemic toes and had a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest on the floor, which was thought to be due to prolonged QTc syndrome with prolonging medications. The patient was intubated during the code and successfully extubated. He has a gangrenous wound with positive cultures for Citrobacter and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and he is allergic to cephalosporins. His acute on chronic renal failure is improving, and he has anemia. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, multi-lumen femoral line, and various IV medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): Given the patient's history of VF arrest and prolonged QTc, there is a risk of recurrent VT. The patient is currently bradycardic with prolonged PR and QT intervals, and further ectopy may require stabilization with lidocaine. An electrophysiology (EP) study may be considered to determine the etiology of VF and potentially ablate any scar-related VT.

2. Stroke: Although the patient's last ech"

   positive staph.  Avoiding quinolones for QT prolongation.  Has h/o
   allergy to cephalosporins.
   - Cover broadly with Vanco/[**Last Name (un) 350**] for wound infection ([**Last Name (un) 46**] to both, coag
   pos staph [**Last Name (un) 46**] pending).
   - Follow wound and blood cultures
   - Will continue to follow with vascular surgery.

   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Improving.  Baseline creatinine 1.5,
   has been improving since angio.
   - Follow closely in setting of recent angio as well as arrest.
   -  Renally dose all meds

   # PVD: as per vascular team.  Plan was for repeat angiography, however
   likely on hold for now.  When he does go for procedure will need IVF,

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted for ischemic toes and had a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest on the floor. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving invasive ventilation. He has a prolonged QT interval on telemetry and is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Fibrillation: The patient experienced a VF arrest, which could potentially recur if not properly managed.
2. Prolonged QT Interval: The patient has a prolonged QT interval, which may lead to torsades de pointes, a type of ventricular tachycardia that can degenerate into VF.
3. Ischemic Gangrenous Toes: The patient has ischemic gangrenous toes, which can progress to tissue necrosis and potentially require amputation.
4. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by Citrobacter, which may worsen if not appropriately treated.
5. Wound Infection: The patient has a wound infection caused by Citrobacter and coag positive staph, requiring proper antibiotic coverage.
6. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is improving but needs close monitoring, especially in the setting of recent angiography.
7. Peripheral Vascular"
