","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer who presented with oral candidiasis, hypotension, and respiratory distress. He meets the criteria for sepsis and is most likely experiencing pulmonary infection as the source. The patient is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and peripheral pressors. His condition is unstable, and further evaluation is needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic infection, including leukopenia, tachycardia, and hypotension. Immediate treatment with antibiotics is necessary to address the potential sepsis.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level was around 0.8, but it has now increased to 1.8. This indicates a decline in kidney function. The patient appears dry on examination, suggesting dehydration, which could contribute to pre-renal azotemia. IV fluid resuscitation and dopamine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 should be continued.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient is hyponatremic, likely due to hypovolemic hyponatremia associated with ARF and septic shock. IV fluid resuscitation and rechecking sodium levels are necessary.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient is hyperkalemic, which is common in acute renal failure. Kayexelate has been"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer who presents with oral candidiasis, hypotension, and respiratory distress. He is experiencing hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely volume overload with non-cardiogenic edema. The patient also has sepsis, meeting SIRS criteria with leukopenia, tachypnea, and tachycardia. The most likely source of infection is pulmonary, although there is no distinct infiltrate on the portable film. The patient has acute renal failure, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and leukopenia. He has metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma and is currently being evaluated for end-of-life care. The patient's pain control will be increased, and he will continue on his outpatient regimen as tolerated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and inadequate oxygenation may lead to further deterioration in his respiratory function, potentially resulting in respiratory arrest or failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's infection and systemic inflammatory response may progress, leading to organ dysfunction and failure. This could involve multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) or septic shock.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's declining renal function could worsen, resulting in further fluid and electrolyte imbalances, accumulation of waste products, and potential renal replacement therapy requirements.
4. Hyponatremia:"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo M with metastatic prostate ca s/p first treatment of chemotherapy
   on [**7-25**] who presents with oral candidiasis, hypotension and respiratory
   distress.
   # Sepsis: Meets SIRS criteria w/ leukopenia, RR, and HR. Most likely
   source is pulmonary, though no distinct infiltrate on portable film in
   ED.  UA negative and blood cultures sent in ED. Patient currently
   interested in temporizing measures such as fluid resuscitation,
   antibiotics and peripheral pressors.
   - PA/Lat in am to further evaluate for infiltrate if tolerates,
   otherwise will plan for portable given instability
   - Pan culture - follow up ua/ucx and send bcx
   - Sputum culture if possible, though given oropharyngeal pain, patient
   will not likely be able to expectorate
   - Continue broad spectrum abx: vanc/cefepime/levoflox/fluconazole
   - Continue peripheral dopa for now given likelihood of septic shock,
   will need to re-evaluate with patient in am if unable to wean as we are
   limitied by inability to volume resuscitate given O2 requirement
   - Attempt to maintain MAP>65 via non-invasive measurement
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine around 0.8, now 1.8.
   Patient appears dry on exam and also hyponatremic and hypotensive, so
   this is likley [**3-10**] poor perfusion/pre-renal azotemia.
   - Continue IVF resuscitation as tolerated, though need to hold for now
   as patietn rec'd 5L of NS in ED
   - Continue dopamine to maintain MAPs as above
   - Check urine lytes/FeNa
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia given ARF and septic
   picture.
   - Check urine lytes, osms, FeNa as above
   - IVF resuscitation as above
   - Recheck Na now to ensure we are going in the right direction
   # Hyperkalemia: Likely in the setting of acute renal failure. Receiving
   kayexelate in the ED.  No peaked Ts or other ECG abnormalities
   - Continue to follow, recheck post-kayexelate
   - Trend ECGs prn
   # Leukopenia: Recent chemotherapy on [**7-25**].  Also likely component of
   marrow suppression in the setting of critical illness.  Platelets are,
   however, elevated, though this is most likely as an acute phase
   reactant.
   - Continue to trend
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - Discuss with onc in am
   - Tx w/ broad spectrum abx as above
   # Metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma: Apparently rapidly progressive. ?
   new nodules on CXR. During most recent admission, patient was being
   evaluated by hospice for end of life care.  Now s/p taxotere on [**7-25**].
   - Contact patient's Onc fellow in am to ensure she is aware that
   patient was re-admitted
   - Pain control, continue outpatient regimen as tolerated (oxycontin and
   dilaudid)
   - Further treatment as per outpatient oncologist
   - Palliative care re-consult in am
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer who presented with oral candidiasis, hypotension, and respiratory distress. He meets the criteria for sepsis, with likely pulmonary source. The patient is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and peripheral pressors. He also has acute renal failure, likely pre-renal azotemia due to poor perfusion. Other issues include hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, leukopenia, and metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further deterioration due to sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has significantly declined, leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances. This can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and even coma if not corrected appropriately.
4. Hyperkalemia: Elevated potassium levels can cause cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. Immediate treatment is required to prevent life-threatening complications.
5. Leukopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count increases the risk of infections, particularly in the setting of sepsis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has been receiving various medications, including dopamine, heparin sodium, and multiple antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 95/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on aerosol-cool delivery device. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 7,059 mL total in, 1,979 mL IV fluid, and 1,655 mL blood products out. The patient's ABG results indicate hypoxemia (partial pressure of oxygen: 17 mmHg).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low at 95/48 mmHg, indicating hypotension. This may be due to septic shock or other underlying causes. Close monitoring of fluid administration and vasopressor support is necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and ensure adequate oxygenation to prevent worsening of the infection.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant amount of fluid intake, which may lead to fluid overload. Monitoring fluid status and adjusting fluid administration accordingly"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have a history of anxiety, dysphagia, pneumonia (community-acquired), acute and chronic pain, hypotension, and poor dentition. The patient is currently receiving dopamine infusion at 7 mcg/kg/min and has several IV lines. They are also on various medications including heparin for prophylaxis, fluconazole, levofloxacin, cefepime, and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated respiratory rate. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's blood cultures grew gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection leading to sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output may indicate AKI.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. It is important to monitor for worsening respiratory symptoms and consider appropriate antibiotic therapy.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and hypotension increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophyl"

   61 yo M with metastatic prostate ca s/p taxotere treatment on [**7-25**] who
   presents with oral candidiasis, hypotension and respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely volume overload
   at this point w/ non cardiogenic edema.  Is currently 6L positive on
   I/O.  Options are limited as borderline blood pressures this is not
   without risk for hemodynamic compromise.  Pt [**Name (NI) **]
   # Sepsis: Meets SIRS criteria w/ leukopenia, RR, and HR. Most likely
   source is pulmonary, though no distinct infiltrate on portable film in
   ED.  UA negative and blood cultures sent in ED. Patient currently
   interested in temporizing measures such as fluid resuscitation (s/p 5L
   ED), antibiotics and peripheral pressors.
   - Follow up ua/ucx and send bcx
   - Sputum culture if possible, though given oropharyngeal pain, patient
   will not likely be able to expectorate
   - Continue broad spectrum abx: vanc/cefepime/levoflox/fluconazole
   - Continue peripheral dopa for now given likelihood of septic shock.
   Pt requiring increasing dopa to maintain goal map >65
   - Attempt to maintain MAP>65 via non-invasive measurement
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine around 0.8, now 1.1.
   Patient appears dry on exam and also hyponatremic and hypotensive, so
   this is likley [**3-10**] poor perfusion/pre-renal azotemia.
   - Continue dopamine to maintain MAPs above 65
   -FeUr 25% indicating pre-renal.  Given hypotension and use of Dopa
   kidneys hypoperfused.  Unable to correct given competing needs of BP
   and oxygenation.
   # Hyponatremia: improving.  Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia given ARF
   and septic picture.
   - Continues to improve.  However unable to give volume given
   respiratory status
   # Hyperkalemia: resolved.  Likely in the setting of acute renal
   failure. Receiving kayexelate in the ED.  No peaked Ts or other ECG
   abnormalities
   - Trend ECGs prn
   # Leukopenia: resolved.  Recent chemotherapy on [**7-25**].  Also likely
   component of marrow suppression in the setting of critical illness.
   Platelets are, however, elevated, though this is most likely as an
   acute phase reactant.
   - Most resent CBC likely lab error, however given global picture will
   not redraw at present as this will not guide management.
   - Discuss with onc in am
   - Tx w/ broad spectrum abx as above
   # Metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma: Apparently rapidly progressive.
   During most recent admission, patient was being evaluated by hospice
   for end of life care.  Now s/p taxotere on [**7-25**].
   - Pain control, continue outpatient regimen as tolerated (oxycontin and
   dilaudid)
   - Further treatment as per outpatient oncologist
   - Palliative care re-consult in am
   # Pain control
 will increase IV morphine, may be CMO soon.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet as tolerated.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: peripherals - 2 large bore in place

   # Code: DNR/I, confirmed with patient ; will need to readdress goals of
   care as patient was on hospice care prior to this ICU admission

   # Communication: Patient and mother, [**Name (NI) 7354**]

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer who presents with oral candidiasis, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient has been treated with taxotere and is currently experiencing hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to volume overload and non-cardiogenic edema. The patient's blood pressure is borderline, and there is a risk of hemodynamic compromise.

The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, with leukopenia, tachypnea, and tachycardia. The most likely source of infection is pulmonary, although no distinct infiltrate was observed on the portable film in the emergency department. The patient's urine analysis is negative, and blood cultures have been sent.

The patient is interested in temporizing measures such as fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and peripheral pressors. It is recommended to follow up with urine analysis, cultures, and sputum culture. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanc/cefepime/levoflox/fluconazole) should be continued, along with peripheral dopamine to maintain a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

The patient requires careful monitoring of urine output, non-invasive measurement of MAP, and close observation for any signs of worsening respiratory status.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing acute renal failure, with a baseline creatinine level around 0.8 and now 1.1. The patient appears dry on examination,"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo M with metastatic prostate ca s/p taxotere treatment on [**7-25**] who
   presents with oral candidiasis, hypotension and respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely volume overload
   at this point w/ non cardiogenic edema.  Is currently 5L positive on
   I/O.  Start lasix gtt and small bolus. Options are limited as
   borderline blood pressures this is not without risk for hemodynamic
   compromise.
   # Sepsis: Meets SIRS criteria w/ leukopenia, RR, and HR. Most likely
   source is pulmonary, though no distinct infiltrate on portable film in
   ED.  UA negative and blood cultures sent in ED. Patient currently
   interested in temporizing measures such as fluid resuscitation (s/p 5L
   ED), antibiotics and peripheral pressors.
   - PA/Lat in am to further evaluate for infiltrate if tolerates,
   otherwise will plan for portable given instability
   - Pan culture - follow up ua/ucx and send bcx
   - Sputum culture if possible, though given oropharyngeal pain, patient
   will not likely be able to expectorate
   - Continue broad spectrum abx: vanc/cefepime/levoflox/fluconazole
   - Continue peripheral dopa for now given likelihood of septic shock,
   will need to re-evaluate with patient in am if unable to wean as we are
   limitied by inability to volume resuscitate given O2 requirement
   - Attempt to maintain MAP>65 via non-invasive measurement
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine around 0.8, now 1.1.
   Patient appears dry on exam and also hyponatremic and hypotensive, so
   this is likley [**3-10**] poor perfusion/pre-renal azotemia.
   - Continue IVF resuscitation as tolerated, though need to hold for now
   as patietn rec'd 5L of NS in ED
   - Continue dopamine to maintain MAPs as above
   - Check urine lytes/FeNa
   # Hyponatremia: improving.  Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia given ARF
   and septic picture.
   - Check urine lytes, osms, FeNa as above
   - IVF resuscitation as above
   - Recheck Na now to ensure we are going in the right direction
   # Hyperkalemia: resolved.  Likely in the setting of acute renal
   failure. Receiving kayexelate in the ED.  No peaked Ts or other ECG
   abnormalities
   - Continue to follow, recheck post-kayexelate
   - Trend ECGs prn
   # Leukopenia: resolved.  Recent chemotherapy on [**7-25**].  Also likely
   component of marrow suppression in the setting of critical illness.
   Platelets are, however, elevated, though this is most likely as an
   acute phase reactant.
   - Continue to trend
   - No longer neutropenic
   - Discuss with onc in am
   - Tx w/ broad spectrum abx as above
   # Metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma: Apparently rapidly progressive. ?
   new nodules on CXR. During most recent admission, patient was being
   evaluated by hospice for end of life care.  Now s/p taxotere on [**7-25**].
   - Contact patient's Onc fellow in am to ensure she is aware that
   patient was re-admitted
   - Pain control, continue outpatient regimen as tolerated (oxycontin and
   dilaudid)
   - Further treatment as per outpatient oncologist
   - Palliative care re-consult in am
   # Pain control
 will increase IV dilaudid, may be CMO soon.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: peripherals - 2 large bore in place
   .
   # Code: DNR/I, confirmed with patient ; will need to readdress goals of
   care as patient was on hospice care prior to this ICU admission
   .
   # Communication: Patient and mother, [**Name (NI) 7354**]
   .
   # Disposition: ICU for now

","The patient is a critically ill male with respiratory failure and hypotension. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 bpm, low blood pressure at 104/63 mmHg, increased respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on high-flow nasal cannula. 

The patient has diffuse inspiratory rales and expiratory wheeze on chest examination, indicating possible pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He also has 2+ edema on extremities, suggesting volume overload or heart failure.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, elevated lactate level at 40 mg/dL, and elevated troponin I at 28.7%. These findings may indicate sepsis or acute myocardial infarction. Other lab abnormalities include thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's medical history includes anxiety, dysphagia, pneumonia, pain control (acute and chronic pain), and hypotension that is not in shock. 

The patient is receiving multiple medications including dopamine, furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), morphine sulfate, and various antibiotics."

   # Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely volume overload
   at this point w/ non cardiogenic edema.  Is currently 6L positive on
   I/O.  Options are limited as borderline blood pressures this is not
   without risk for hemodynamic compromise.  Pt [**Name (NI) **]
   # Sepsis: Meets SIRS criteria w/ leukopenia, RR, and HR. Most likely
   source is pulmonary, though no distinct infiltrate on portable film in
   ED.  UA negative and blood cultures sent in ED. Patient currently
   interested in temporizing measures such as fluid resuscitation (s/p 5L
   ED), antibiotics and peripheral pressors.
   - Follow up ua/ucx and send bcx
   - Continue broad spectrum abx: vanc/cefepime/levoflox/fluconazole
   - Continue peripheral dopa for now given likelihood of septic shock.
   Pt requiring increasing dopa to maintain goal map >65
   - Attempt to maintain MAP>65 via non-invasive measurement
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine around 0.8.  Patient wet on
   exam so this is likley [**3-10**] poor perfusion/pre-renal azotemia.
   - Continue dopamine to maintain MAPs above 65
   - Not drawing labs currently for patient comfort so unable to determine
   trend.
   # Hyponatremia: improving.  Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia given ARF
   and septic picture.
   - Not drawing labs for patient comfort.  However unable to give volume
   given respiratory status
   # Hyperkalemia: resolved.  Likely in the setting of acute renal
   failure. Receiving kayexelate in the ED.  No peaked Ts or other ECG
   abnormalities
   - Not drawing labs so unable to evaluate.
   # Leukopenia:  Recent chemotherapy on [**7-25**].  Also likely component of
   marrow suppression in the setting of critical illness.  Platelets are,
   however, elevated, though this is most likely as an acute phase
   reactant.
   - Most resent CBC likely lab error, however given global picture will
   not redraw at present as this will not guide management.
   # Metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma: Apparently rapidly progressive.
   During most recent admission, patient was being evaluated by hospice
   for end of life care.  Now s/p taxotere on [**7-25**].

   Plan for today is to address goals of care.  Mr. [**Known lastname 7368**] was placed
   on peripheral dopa to give him an opportunity to complete some legal
   paperwork which was of great importance to him.  He completed the
   paperwork with his lawyer yesterday and has had declining mental status
   since that time.  His mental status waxes and wanes at times he is
   unresponsive and at other times is able to answer yes/no questions.  At
   the time of his last discharge Mr. [**Known lastname 7368**] left the hospital with the
   intention of entering hospice care in light of his metastatic prostate
   cancer.  At present he has been requiring escalating doses of morphine
   for comfort due to air hunger.  Spoke to patient
s mother this morning
   who was apprised of his status and declining mental status.  She
   hurriedly got off the phone saying she
d call back later to check on
   him.
   Goals of care for Mr. [**Known lastname 7368**] are to be CMO given his end-stage
   disease.  This is to include d/c abx and peripheral pressor and start
   patient on a morphine gtt titrated to comfort.  Will also treat his
   epistaxis with phenylephrine nasal spray as this is making him
   uncomfortable.  Will have SW and Attending discuss this change of plan

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer who is experiencing oral candidiasis, hypotension, and respiratory distress. He has declining mental status and is requiring increasing doses of morphine for comfort due to air hunger. The goals of care for the patient are to provide comfort measures only (CMO) given his end-stage disease. This includes discontinuing antibiotics, stopping the peripheral pressor, and starting the patient on a morphine drip titrated to comfort. The patient's epistaxis will be treated with phenylephrine nasal spray. Social work and the attending physician will discuss this change in plan with the patient at implementation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which may worsen without appropriate management. This can lead to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which can result in inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ dysfunction.
3. Oral candidiasis: The presence of oral thrush suggests an immunocompromised state, increasing the risk of systemic fungal infection.
4. Metastatic prostate cancer: The patient's underlying malignancy may continue to progress, leading to further deterioration in his general condition.

   61 yo M with metastatic prostate ca s/p taxotere treatment on [**7-25**] who
   presents with oral candidiasis, hypotension and respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely volume overload
   at this point w/ non cardiogenic edema.  Is currently 6L positive on
   I/O.  Options are limited as borderline blood pressures this is not
   without risk for hemodynamic compromise.  Pt [**Name (NI) **]
   # Sepsis: Meets SIRS criteria w/ leukopenia, RR, and HR. Most likely
   source is pulmonary, though no distinct infiltrate on portable film in
   ED.  UA negative and blood cultures sent in ED. Patient currently
   interested in temporizing measures such as fluid resuscitation (s/p 5L
   ED), antibiotics and peripheral pressors.
   - Follow up ua/ucx and send bcx
   - Continue broad spectrum abx: vanc/cefepime/levoflox/fluconazole
   - Continue peripheral dopa for now given likelihood of septic shock.
   Pt requiring increasing dopa to maintain goal map >65
   - Attempt to maintain MAP>65 via non-invasive measurement
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine around 0.8.  Patient wet on
   exam so this is likley [**3-10**] poor perfusion/pre-renal azotemia.
   - Continue dopamine to maintain MAPs above 65
   - Not drawing labs currently for patient comfort so unable to determine
   trend.
   # Hyponatremia: improving.  Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia given ARF
   and septic picture.
   - Not drawing labs for patient comfort.  However unable to give volume
   given respiratory status
   # Hyperkalemia: resolved.  Likely in the setting of acute renal
   failure. Receiving kayexelate in the ED.  No peaked Ts or other ECG
   abnormalities
   - Not drawing labs so unable to evaluate.
   # Leukopenia:  Recent chemotherapy on [**7-25**].  Also likely component of
   marrow suppression in the setting of critical illness.  Platelets are,
   however, elevated, though this is most likely as an acute phase
   reactant.
   - Most resent CBC likely lab error, however given global picture will
   not redraw at present as this will not guide management.
   # Metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma: Apparently rapidly progressive.
   During most recent admission, patient was being evaluated by hospice
   for end of life care.  Now s/p taxotere on [**7-25**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer who presented with oral candidiasis, hypotension, and respiratory distress.
- He has hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely volume overload with non-cardiogenic edema.
- The patient meets SIRS criteria for sepsis, with leukopenia, tachypnea, and tachycardia.
- Most likely source of infection is pulmonary, but no distinct infiltrate was seen on the portable film in the ED.
- Blood cultures were sent in the ED, and the patient is interested in temporizing measures such as fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and peripheral pressors.
- The patient has acute renal failure, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, leukopenia, and metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma.
- He requires pain control and further treatment as per the outpatient oncologist.
- The patient's code status is DNR/I, and he is currently on hospice care.
- Disposition: ICU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's infection may progress, leading to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate, resulting in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of shock and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been worsening, as evidenced by the worsening mental status, op bleeding, hypotension, and inability to wean off respiratory support. The patient has been diagnosed with anxiety, dysphagia, pneumonia (bacterial community-acquired), pain control, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and non-cardiogenic edema. The patient's blood pressure is borderline, limiting the use of diuretics for fluid overload. There is concern for sepsis/SIRS, and the patient's renal function has improved with hydration. The patient's goals of care have shifted to hospice, and the family and primary oncology team have been updated on the situation. The patient's DNR/DNI status has been communicated to the mother and friend.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/SIRS: The patient's hypotension and worsening condition raise concerns for sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). If left untreated, this could lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to maintain adequate oxygenation despite high-flow nasal cannula suggests progressive respiratory failure. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to hypoxemia and subsequent organ damage.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant intake of fluids without adequate output, leading to fluid overload. This can worsen respiratory distress"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of [complaint]. The patient has allergies to hydrocodone and experiences nausea/vomiting as side effects. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, including levofloxacin, fluconazole, cefipime, and vancomycin, with the last doses administered on [date] at different times.

Infusions of morphine sulfate at a rate of 4 mg/hour and other ICU medications have been given. Other medications are also being administered. The patient's medical and family history remain unchanged from admission.

Review of systems shows no new findings except for the events mentioned below. The flowsheet data as of [date] at [time] provides information on vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results.

The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.2°C (97.2°F), but their blood pressure is significantly low at 62/29 mmHg. The heart rate is slightly elevated at 104 bpm, and the respiratory rate is within normal limits at 13 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 77%, indicating possible hypoxemia.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation, but no specific details about the settings are provided. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an overall fluid balance of +414 mL since midnight, with a total input of 1,010 mL and output of 596 mL, including 596 mL of urine output.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC) at 14.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 28.7%, platelets (Plt) at 278 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 1.3 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) at 22 mg/dL, glucose at 111 mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 624 IU/L. Liver enzymes such as ALT and AST are elevated, as well as bilirubin levels. Kidney function tests show normal calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) levels.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and they are on full ventilatory support. No prophylactic measures have been initiated for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure reading of 62/29 mmHg is significantly low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to septic shock, inadequate fluid resuscitation, or medication side effects. Immediate fluid resuscitation and further investigation into the cause of hypotension are necessary.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation of 77%"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with known metastatic prostate cancer who was transitioned to comfort measures only (CMO) on [**8-6**]. He is currently on a morphine drip at 4mg/hr and appears comfortable. The patient has a history of allergies to hydrocodone and nausea/vomiting. He has received various antibiotics, including levofloxacin, fluconazole, cefepime, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 104 bpm with a sinus tachycardia rhythm, blood pressure of 62/29 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 77%. The patient is unresponsive to verbal stimuli but has not been checked for response to painful stimulation. Physical examination findings include rhonchi/rales in the chest, soft abdomen, and 3+ edema bilaterally in the lower extremities.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 28.7 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 236 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated liver enzymes. Other lab results indicate abnormalities in electrolyte levels and kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has received multiple antibiotics, suggesting a concern for infection. The elevated white blood cell count also supports this possibility.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's oxygen saturation of 77% indicates significant hypoxemia, which can lead to respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure of 62/29 mmHg is significantly low, indicating hypotension. This may be due to sepsis or other underlying conditions.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient has received a total of 1,010 mL of fluids and lost 596 mL of fluids, resulting in a net positive fluid balance of 414 mL. This imbalance could contribute to edema in the lower extremities.
5. Metastatic prostate cancer progression: The patient has known metastatic prostate cancer, which could continue to progress and cause further complications.
6. Morphine overdose: The patient is on a morphine drip, and excessive titration may lead to morphine overdose, resulting in respiratory depression and decreased level of consciousness.

These potential complications should be closely monitored and managed accordingly to ensure the patient's comfort and well-being."
