","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of urinary retention and chronic indwelling Foley catheter. He presents with symptoms of diarrhea, fever, and lower abdominal pain. The patient has been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and impaired skin integrity. He is currently being treated in the ICU for septic shock, UTI, acute renal failure (ARF), atrial flutter, anemia, dementia, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's current condition of septic shock poses a significant risk. Immediate medical intervention is required to manage his vital signs, fluid status, and antibiotic therapy.
2. UTI: The patient has a UTI, which can potentially lead to further complications such as pyelonephritis or kidney infection if not effectively treated.
3. ARF: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if not properly managed. This could result in worsening kidney function and potentially require renal replacement therapy.
4. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter needs close monitoring, and rate control measures should be continued to prevent potential complications like stroke or heart failure.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers or bedsores, which can be challenging to manage and heal.
6. Malnutrition: Given the patient's poor oral intake and potential for prolonged ICU stay, there"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of urinary retention and chronic indwelling Foley catheter. He presented with diarrhea, fever, and lower abdominal pain. The patient was found to have a malpositioned Foley catheter and septic shock. His condition has been complicated by several medical issues including sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, urinary tract infection (UTI), and acute kidney injury (AKI). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/39 to 104/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, presence of crackles in the bilateral lung bases, and tenderness in the lower abdomen. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, slightly elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. 

The patient is receiving IV fluids to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) at around 12, antibiotics for UTI and sepsis, and supportive care for other medical conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to the UTI. It is important to continue aggressive management with IV fluids, antibiotics, and close monitoring of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of urinary retention and chronic indwelling Foley catheter. He presents with fever, lower abdominal pain, and hypotension, and is diagnosed with urosepsis. In the emergency department, he was resuscitated with fluids and received broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was admitted to the ICU where he remained on vasopressors for hemodynamic support. The patient's condition improved, and he was eventually weaned off the vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock due to a urinary tract infection caused by a Gram-Negative Rod (GNR). The LLL opacity on the chest X-ray may indicate asbestosis plaques or atelectasis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 0.7, suggesting a combination of pre-renal (sepsis) and post-renal (malpositioned Foley) causes. Appropriate fluid management and monitoring of urine output are necessary.
3. EKG Changes: The patient's EKG shows atrial flutter with lateral ST depression at a rate of 120, raising suspicion for rate-related ischemia. Serial cardiac enzyme tests (CEs) and EKG monitoring are recommended.
4. Diarrhea: The patient reports diarrhea, although no episodes were noted during his ICU stay. Stool cultures"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of urinary retention and chronic indwelling Foley catheter who presents with fever, lower abdominal pain, and hypotension. The patient was found to have urosepsis, malpositioned Foley, and urinary retention. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with urosepsis, which can lead to sepsis-related complications such as organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level is 0.7, and there is evidence of pre-renal and post-renal factors contributing to renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolytes is essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. Continuous monitoring and appropriate management of blood pressure with IV fluids and vasopressors are necessary.
4. Diarrhea: The patient has diarrhea, and stool cultures have been ordered to check for Clostridium difficile infection.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of urinary retention and chronic indwelling Foley catheter who presented with diarrhea, fever, and lower abdominal pain. He was found to have a malpositioned Foley catheter and septic shock due to a Gram-negative bacterial infection. The patient is currently off levophed and has been weaned off vasopressors. His blood pressure is improving, but his urine output remains low. His creatinine level has decreased, and he is being evaluated for the cause of diarrhea. The patient's EKG shows atrial flutter with lateral ST depression at a rate of 120, suspecting rate-related ischemia, but cardiac enzymes are negative. The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to hypovolemia, and is on a pureed diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): The patient's presentation with diarrhea, fever, and lower abdominal pain, along with a malpositioned Foley catheter, suggests a urinary tract infection. This can lead to septic shock, which the patient is currently experiencing.
2. Rate-related ischemia: The patient's EKG shows atrial flutter with lateral ST depression at a rate of 120. This raises suspicion for rate-related ischemia, which can be a complication of atrial flutter. Further evaluation and management are needed to prevent further cardiac complications.
3. Diarrhea: The cause of the patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of urinary retention and chronic indwelling Foley catheter. He presents with diarrhea, fever, and lower abdominal pain. The patient was found to have a malpositioned Foley catheter and septic shock, likely caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI) with a Gram-Negative Rod (GNR) bacteria. He also has acute kidney injury (ARF), possibly due to sepsis and a misplaced Foley catheter. The patient has EKG changes showing atrial flutter with lateral ST depression, suggesting rate-related ischemia. He is experiencing diarrhea and hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UTI: The patient's symptoms and septic shock suggest a urinary tract infection. It is crucial to monitor for any signs of worsening infection and repeat blood cultures to identify the causative organism.
2. ARF: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, and there is evidence of both pre-renal and post-renal causes for acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of urine output, electrolytes, and renal function is necessary.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: The EKG changes indicate atrial flutter with lateral ST depression, suggesting potential rate-related ischemia. Serial cardiac enzyme measurements and continuous monitoring of the EKG are recommended to assess for any progression of cardiac ischemia.
4. Diarrhea: Given the patient's presentation and recent antibiotic use, there is a possibility of Clo"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of urinary retention and chronic indwelling Foley catheter. He presents with diarrhea, fever, and lower abdominal pain. The patient was found to have a malpositioned Foley catheter and septic shock. He is currently off levophed and his condition has improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is diagnosed with septic shock due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Gram-negative bacteria (GNR). It is important to continue the current antibiotic therapy and follow up with culture speciation. The patient's septic shock is likely related to the malpositioned Foley catheter, which should be corrected.

2. EKG Changes: The patient's EKG shows atrial flutter with lateral ST depression at a rate of 120, suspecting rate-related ischemia. However, cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no immediate cardiac damage. The patient should be monitored closely, and rate control measures should be implemented as necessary.

3. Diarrhea: The etiology of the patient's diarrhea is unclear. Stool cultures should be checked for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Additionally, intravenous fluid (IVF) administration should be provided as needed to maintain hydration.

4. Asbestosis Plaques or Atelectasis: The patient's chest X-ray shows lower lobe lung opacity, which could be due to as"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of urinary retention and chronic indwelling Foley catheter. He presents with symptoms of diarrhea, fever, and lower abdominal pain. The patient was found to have a malpositioned Foley catheter and septic shock, likely caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI) with a gram-negative bacillus (GNR) organism.

The patient's respiratory status appears stable with room air oxygen delivery and a SpO2 of 96%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.29, which indicates acidosis. However, there are no respiratory symptoms suggesting pneumonia.

The patient's cardiac status shows an atrial flutter with a rate of 120, but cardiac enzymes are negative, suggesting no ongoing cardiac ischemia.

The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms include difficulty sleeping, thirst, and diarrhea. Stool cultures will be checked, including for Clostridium difficile (C. diff).

The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to hypovolemia, as he is afraid to drink due to worsening diarrhea. Intravenous fluids (IVF) will be given as needed.

The patient requires ICU care, including nutrition support with a pureed diet, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and stress ulcer protection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening septic shock, development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M with h/o urinary retention and chronic indwelling foley who
   presents with diarrhea, fever, and lower abdominal pain, found to have
   malpositioned Foley and septic shock.
   # Septic shock:  The most likely source is UTI given malpositioned
   Foley and U/A.  CXR shows no infiltrate.  No other acute abdominal
   source on CT.  Likely also hypovolemic as has had poor PO.  Less likely
   cardiogenic though EKG showed lateral STD, likely rate-related.  CEs
   negative.
   - IVFs to maintain CVP 12ish as does have [**2-1**]+ TR
   - monitor fluid status with IVFs given AR
   - cont. abx to zosyn. tailor as appropriate
   - f/u bcxs, ucx and tailor as allowed
   - trend WBC, bandemia
   # UTI:
   - Ucx cancelled as specimen thought to be have fecal contamination,
   will tailor antibx to blood cultures.
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.7.  Slowly improving with IVFs.  FeNa 0.9%.
   Likely post-renal.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have component of pre-renal with decreased
   po intake, ATN from hypotension/sepsis.  No interesting sed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of urinary retention and chronic indwelling Foley catheter. He presents with diarrhea, fever, and lower abdominal pain. The patient was found to have a malpositioned Foley catheter and is in septic shock. The most likely source of infection is a urinary tract infection (UTI), given the malpositioned Foley catheter and urinalysis results. The patient's chest X-ray shows no infiltrate, and there are no other acute abdominal sources identified on CT. The patient is also hypovolemic due to poor oral intake. The EKG showed lateral ST depression, which is likely rate-related. Cardiac enzymes are negative.

The patient has several medical issues, including septic shock, urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury (ARF), atrial flutter, anemia, dementia, and pressure ulcer prevention.

Assessment and Plan:
- Septic shock: Maintain CVP at 12ish with IV fluids, monitor fluid status, continue antibiotics tailored as appropriate.
- UTI: Tailor antibiotics to blood cultures, monitor WBC and bandemia.
- ARF: Continue IV fluids, Foley catheter in place, monitor urine output.
- Atrial flutter: Rate-controlled off medications, continue ASA 325 mg.
- Diarrhea: Check stool cultures, monitor for Clostridium difficile.
- Anemia: Monitor HCT, guaiac stools, continue iron supplementation"
