","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. The patient's condition has been unstable overnight, with a CIWA score in the mid-30s that improved to 11-21 this morning. He received a total of 6 mg IV Ativan overnight. His heart rate and blood pressure are within normal limits, but he is experiencing mild fever and chills. The patient reports neck pain but denies any other pain. His respiratory support includes high flow nebulization with oxygen, maintaining an SpO2 of 100%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, PaO2 of 463, and a FiO2 of 21%. The patient's physical examination reveals no murmurs, normal peripheral pulses, symmetric chest expansion, and breath sounds that are rhonchorous intermittently. His abdomen is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds, and he has no lower extremity edema. Neurologically, he is oriented and follows simple commands but has tremulousness with asterixis. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, normal hemoglobin, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profile. The patient is receiving heparin and diltiazem infusions, as well as oral medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's unstable condition, fever, chills, and elevated white blood cell count suggest ongoing infection and sepsis.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and current EKG findings indicate ongoing arrhythmia, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of septic shock.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's intermittent rhonchorous breath sounds and ABG results may indicate impaired gas exchange, potentially leading to respiratory failure.
5. Hepatic Dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) suggest hepatic dysfunction, which can be associated with sepsis or underlying liver disease.
6. Coagulopathy: The abnormal coagulation profile (PTT/INR) indicates a bleeding risk, which can be exacerbated by anticoagulant therapy (heparin).
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's tremulousness with asterixis may indicate encephalopathy, which can be a consequence of severe sepsis or hepatic dysfunction.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based solely on the provided progress note and may not cover all aspects of the patient's condition."

   atelectasis vs infection.
   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with history of recent C5 spinous process fracture, atrial
   fibrillation, PEs, and tricuspid valve endocarditis admitted for a fib
   with RVR, respiratory distress and EtOH intoxication.
   .
   #.  Altered mental Status/ETOH abuse: Likely EtOH intoxication now
   progressing to withdrawal.  Patient requiring q2h CIWA currently. Hold
   suboxone as unclear if the patient is taking as prescribed given tox
   screen negative for opiates and can complicate respiratory status.
   Will encourage admission to detox facility on discharge.
   - Multivitamin/Thiamine/Folate
   - CIWA scales Q2H with ativan
   - All meds IV for now, patient NPO as unable to protect airway
   .
   #.  Respiratory Distress:  The patient has a history of prolonged
   hospitalization for respiratory distress following similar
   presentation, requiring intubation and ultimately tracheostomy.  Most
   likely the patient's cause for respiratory distress is intoxication
   causing a possible aspiration event, in conjuction with oversedation
   from EtOH and benzo administration.  CXR also shows infiltrate versus
   atelectasis. PE seems less likely given prelim read of CTA and clinical
   context.  Pt now with decreasing oxygen requirements.
   - Monitor O2 sats closely, wean to NC O2 as tolerated
   - Empiric treatment with heparin gtt until final read of CTA returns
   - empiric tx with levo/flagyl for aspiration pneumonia
   .
   #Fever: Most likely related to aspiration event in the context of
   sedation/intoxication.  Differential includes aspiration pneumonitis
   versus pneumonia versus occult source of fever.  Patient does have a
   history of tricuspid valve endocarditis.
   -Continue empiric tx with levo/flagyl
   -f/u cultures
   -consider TTE to evaluate tricuspid valve if patient worsens clinically
   or culture is positive
   -Urine culture
   .
   #.  Atrial Fibrillation:  Periodically in RVR overnight, requiring IV
   bolus of diltiazem in conjunction with drips.  Most likely was in rapid
   ventricular response secondary to increased catecholamine surge from
   either intoxication, infection or hypoxia.  Will treat underlying
   disorders as outlined.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - wean dilt drip as tolerated
   - start home regimen of metoprolol and dilt when able to take PO
   .
   #.  Hepatitis:  Likely secondary to alcohol given AST to ALT ratio in
   addition to Hep C.  The patient has a tremor at baseline, but has
   preserved synthetic function.  Will avoid long acting benzos and other
   hepatotoxic medications.  Monitor for signs of decompensation.
   .
   # Hx of PE:
   -continue heparin as above until final read CTA
   -will confirm with PCP why patient stopped anticoagulation
   .
   #.  History of C diff colitis:  Maintain precautions.  Monitor for
   diarrhea.
   .
   #   C5 spinous process fracture:  No acute issues.  Follow up final
   read of CT c spine.  Discuss plan with ortho spine in AM.
   .
   #.  Depression:  Continue citalopram.  Hold quetiapine for now as can
   worsen sedation.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for now given inability to protect airway, restart diet in AM
   if improved, replete lytes PRN
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt, PPI
   -Bowel regimen with colace and senna PRN
   -Pain management on hold given sedation

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual admitted to the ICU. They have been started on a heparin drip and are receiving infusions of diltiazem. The patient's vital signs indicate a fever with a maximum temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F) and an increased heart rate of 107-129 bpm. Blood pressure is within normal range but slightly lower than previous readings. Respiratory rate is normal. Oxygen saturation is at 100% with the use of high flow nebulization. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient has received lorazepam for agitation and has shown no known drug allergies. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,021 mL since 12 AM, with a total output of 1,900 mL. The patient has received 911 mL of IV fluids.

The patient's ABG results indicate a slightly alkalotic pH of 7.45, a normal PaCO2 level of 38 mmHg, and a high oxygen content of 185 mL/L. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 463, which suggests good oxygenation.

Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the eyes, cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, respiratory system, abdomen, extremities, or skin. Neurological assessment is limited due to non-assessment of movement and tone.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with history of recent C5 spinous process fracture, atrial
   fibrillation, PEs, and tricuspid valve endocarditis admitted for a fib
   with RVR, respiratory distress and EtOH intoxication.
   .
   #.  ETOH intoxication/Polysubstance abuse:  Most likely resulted in
   aspiration event Monitor for signs of inability to protect airway.
   Currently, should not require CIWA, but will monitor.  Hold suboxone as
   unclear if the patient is taking as prescribed given tox screen
   negative for opiates and can complicate respiratory status.  Will
   encourage admission to detox facility on discharge.
   - Multivitamin/Thiamine/Folate in 1L D5W
   - CIWA scales Q2H with ativan
   #.  Respiratory Distress:  The patient has a history of prolonged
   hospitalization for respiratory distress following similar
   presentation, requiring intubation and ultimately tracheostomy.  Most
   likely the patient's cause for respiratory distress related to
   intoxication causing a possible aspiration event, in conjuction with
   oversedation from EtOH and benzo administration.  CXR also
    over sedation from ETOH intoxication, haldol, lorazepam and valium
   administration in addition to possible aspiration event.  Given the
   patient is afebrile, this is likely aspiration pneumonitis, but will
   monitor for fever.  The patient has received first dose antibiotics of
   ceftriaxone and levofloxacin in the ED.  The patient had a CTA which
   preliminarily was negative for PE, the patient has a history of PEs
   requiring tPA, is off anticoagulation, but is s/p IVC filter
   placement.  Given the current a/A gradient, will treat empirically for
   PE.  Also on the differential is CHF, flash pulmonary edema from A fib
   with RVR, however less likely given CXR findings.
   - Monitor O2 sats closely, wean to NC O2 as tolerated
   - Empiric treatment with heparin gtt
   - Avoid all sedating medications
   - F/U final read of CTA
   - Hold further antibiotics for now, if spikes will cover with
   levo/flagyl for possible aspiration and community acquired pneumonia
   (we will avoid clinda as history of c diff)
   .
   #.  Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently in sinus tachycardia.  Most likely
   was in rapid ventricular response secondary to increased catecholamine
   surge from either intoxication, infection or hypoxia.  Will treat
   underlying disorders as outlined.  Will treat with diltiazem drip
   initially.  Goal to get patient back on home regimen of 60mg PO QID.
   CHADS score is 2, however given history of PEs will start
   anticoagulation empirically until CTA results are final.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - wean dilt drip as tolerated
   - start home regimen of metoprolol and dilt when able to take PO
   .
   .
   #.  Hepatitis:  Likely secondary to alcohol given AST to ALT ratio in
   addition to Hep C.  The patient has a tremor at baseline, but has
   preserved synthetic function.  Will avoid long acting benzos and other
   hepatotoxic medications.  Monitor for signs of decompensation.
   .
   #.  Hyperkalemia:  Initial K hemolyzed, repeat 4.1 with no EKG
   changes.  Will monitor [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   #.  History of Tricuspid Valve Endocarditis:  Currently afebrile, will
   send set of blood cultures as did not have sent in the ED prior to
   antibiotics.  If spikes will treat empirically and get TTE.
   .
   #.  History of C diff colitis:  Maintain precautions.  Monitor for
   diarrhea.
   .
   #   C5 spinous process fracture:  No acute issues.  Follow up final
   read of CT c spine.  Discuss plan with ortho spine in AM.
   .
   #.  Depression:  Continue citalopram.  Hold quetiapine for now as can
   worsen sedation.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for now given inability to protect airway, restart diet in AM
   if improved, replete lytes PRN
   .

   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of recent C5 spinous process fracture, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, and tricuspid valve endocarditis. He was admitted for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, respiratory distress, and ethanol intoxication. 

The patient's current conditions include ETOH intoxication/polysubstance abuse, respiratory distress, hepatitis, hyperkalemia, history of tricuspid valve endocarditis, history of Clostridium difficile colitis, C5 spinous process fracture, and depression. 

The patient is on various medications including multivitamin/thiamine/folate, CIWA scales with Ativan, empiric treatment with heparin, and diltiazem drip. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.5°F, heart rate of 107-129 bpm, blood pressure of 99/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, warm skin, and tremulousness with asterixis. Neurologic examination shows that the patient follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, is oriented to person and place, but movement and tone assessments are not performed due to the patient's current medical conditions. 

Laboratory results show white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, hematocrit of 38.4%, platelet count of 164 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, total CO2 of 27 mEq/L, glucose of 160 mg/dL, and various other abnormal lab values. 

Imaging studies reveal no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, and no pulmonary embolism or dissection on computed tomography angiography (CTA). 

The patient's plan includes monitoring for signs of inability to protect airway, respiratory distress, and fever. Antibiotics will be held for now, but if fever spikes, they will cover with Levo/Flagyl for possible aspiration and community-acquired pneumonia. The patient will be treated empirically for pulmonary embolism, and anticoagulation will be started due to the patient's history of pulmonary embolism. The patient's atrial fibrillation will be managed with diltiazem drip initially, aiming to get the patient back on his home regimen of 60 mg PO QID. 

The patient's hepatitis will be monitored, and he will avoid long-acting benzodiazepines and other hepatotoxic medications. Hyperkalemia will be monitored, and the patient will be sent to [**Hospital1 **]. 

The patient's history of tricuspid valve endocarditis will be addressed by sending blood cultures, and he will be treated empirically if fever spikes. The patient will also be monitored for Clostridium difficile colitis. 

The patient's C5 spinous process fracture will be discussed with ortho spine in the morning. The patient's depression will continue with citalopram, and quetiapine will be held due to sedation concerns. 

The patient is NPO for now due to the inability to protect the airway, but diet will be restarted in the morning if improved. Lytes will be replenished as needed. 

The patient is presumed to have full code status."

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with history of recent C5 spinous process fracture, atrial
   fibrillation, PEs, and tricuspid valve endocarditis admitted for a fib
   with RVR, respiratory distress and EtOH intoxication.
   .
   #.  ETOH intoxication/Polysubstance abuse: Patient requiring q2h CIWA
   currently. Hold suboxone as unclear if the patient is taking as
   prescribed given tox screen negative for opiates and can complicate
   respiratory status.  Will encourage admission to detox facility on
   discharge.
   - Multivitamin/Thiamine/Folate in 1L D5W
   - CIWA scales Q2H with ativan
   - All meds IV for now, patient NPO as unable to protect airway
   .
   #.  Respiratory Distress:  The patient has a history of prolonged
   hospitalization for respiratory distress following similar
   presentation, requiring intubation and ultimately tracheostomy.  Most
   likely the patient's cause for respiratory distress is intoxication
   causing a possible aspiration event, in conjuction with oversedation
   from EtOH and benzo administration.  CXR also shows infiltrate versus
   atelectasis. PE seems less likely given prelim read of CTA and clinical
   context.  Pt now with decreasing oxygen requirements.
   - Monitor O2 sats closely, wean to NC O2 as tolerated
   - Empiric treatment with heparin gtt until final read of CTA returns
   .
   #Fever: Most likely related to aspiration event in the context of
   sedation/intoxication.  Differential includes aspiration pneumonitis
   versus pneumonia versus occult source of fever.  Patient does have a
   history of tricuspid valve endocarditis.
   -Continue empiric tx with levo/flagyl
   -f/u cultures
   -consider TTE to evaluate tricuspid valve if patient worsens clinically
   or culture is positive
   -Urine culture
   .
   #.  Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently in sinus tachycardia.  Most likely
   was in rapid ventricular response secondary to increased catecholamine
   surge from either intoxication, infection or hypoxia.  Will treat
   underlying disorders as outlined.  Will treat with diltiazem drip
   initially.  Goal to get patient back on home regimen of 60mg PO QID.
   CHADS score is 2, however given history of PEs will start
   anticoagulation empirically until CTA results are final.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - wean dilt drip as tolerated
   - start home regimen of metoprolol and dilt when able to take PO
   .
   .
   #.  Hepatitis:  Likely secondary to alcohol given AST to ALT ratio in
   addition to Hep C.  The patient has a tremor at baseline, but has
   preserved synthetic function.  Will avoid long acting benzos and other
   hepatotoxic medications.  Monitor for signs of decompensation.
   .
   # Hx of PE:
   -will confirm with PCP why patient stopped anticoagulation
   .
   #.  Hyperkalemia:  Initial K hemolyzed, repeat 4.1 with no EKG
   changes.  Will monitor [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   #.  History of Tricuspid Valve Endocarditis:  Currently afebrile, will
   send set of blood cultures as did not have sent in the ED prior to
   antibiotics.  If spikes will treat empirically and get TTE.
   .
   #.  History of C diff colitis:  Maintain precautions.  Monitor for
   diarrhea.
   .
   #   C5 spinous process fracture:  No acute issues.  Follow up final
   read of CT c spine.  Discuss plan with ortho spine in AM.
   .
   #.  Depression:  Continue citalopram.  Hold quetiapine for now as can
   worsen sedation.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for now given inability to protect airway, restart diet in AM
   if improved, replete lytes PRN
   .

   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of recent C5 spinous process fracture, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism (PE), and tricuspid valve endocarditis. He was admitted for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, respiratory distress, and ethanol intoxication. 

Upon admission, the patient received a CIWA scale, indicating ongoing ethanol intoxication, and was started on lorazepam (Ativan) to manage symptoms. The patient's atrial fibrillation was treated with diltiazem and metoprolol. Fever and chills developed overnight, leading to the initiation of empirical antibiotic therapy with levo/flagyl. The patient's respiratory distress was attributed to intoxication and oversedation from ethanol and benzodiazepine administration. The chest X-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema but did reveal right lower lobe atelectasis. The CT angiogram (CTA) did not show any PE or dissection. 

The patient's current conditions include ongoing ethanol intoxication requiring CIWA scales with Ativan every 2 hours, respiratory distress likely due to intoxication and oversedation, fever most likely related to aspiration event, atrial fibrillation secondary to increased catecholamine surge from intoxication, infection, or hypoxia, hepatitis possibly secondary to alcohol abuse, hyperkalemia initially but now within normal range, history of PE, tricuspid valve endocarditis,"

   fibrillation, PEs, and tricuspid valve endocarditis admitted for a fib
   with RVR, respiratory distress and EtOH intoxication.
   .
   #.  Altered mental Status/ETOH abuse: Likely EtOH intoxication now
   progressing to withdrawal.  Patient requiring q3H CIWA currently. Hold
   suboxone as unclear if the patient is taking as prescribed given tox
   screen negative for opiates and can complicate respiratory status.
   Will encourage admission to detox facility on discharge.    Will need
   s/s before starts eating.
   - continue CIWA Q1H with ativan
   - All meds IV for now, patient NPO as unable to protect airway
   -recheck LFTs
   -add Thiamine IVF X3 days
   .
   #.  Respiratory Distress:  The patient has a history of prolonged
   hospitalization for respiratory distress following similar
   presentation, requiring intubation and ultimately tracheostomy.  Most
   likely the patient's cause for respiratory distress is intoxication
   causing a possible aspiration event, in conjuction with oversedation
   from EtOH and benzo administration.  CXR also shows infiltrate versus
   atelectasis. PE seems less likely given  read of CTA and clinical
   context so heparin gtt stopped.  Pt now with decreasing oxygen
   requirements, on RA.
   - empiric tx with levo/flagyl for aspiration pneumonia, currently day
   2/likely 7 day course
   .
   #Fever: Most likely related to aspiration event in the context of
   sedation/intoxication.  Differential includes aspiration pneumonitis
   versus pneumonia versus occult source of fever.  Patient does have a
   history of tricuspid valve endocarditis.
   -Continue empiric tx with levo/flagyl
   -f/u cultures
   -send cdiff once has BM
   -consider TTE to evaluate tricuspid valve if patient worsens clinically
   or culture is positive
   .
   #.  Atrial Fibrillation:  Periodically in RVR overnight on admission,
   requiring IV bolus of diltiazem in conjunction with drips.  Most likely
   was in rapid ventricular response secondary to increased catecholamine
   surge from either intoxication, infection or hypoxia.  Will treat
   underlying disorders as outlined.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - wean dilt drip as tolerated
   - start home regimen of metoprolol and dilt when able to take PO
   .
   #.  Hepatitis:  Likely secondary to alcohol given AST to ALT ratio in
   addition to Hep C.  The patient has a tremor at baseline, but has
   preserved synthetic function.  Will avoid long acting benzos and other
   hepatotoxic medications.  Monitor for signs of decompensation.
   .
   # Hx of PE:  seems that anticoagulation stopped as outpatient due to
   elevated INR, patient with recurrent etoh abuse and falls
   -SC Heparin for pphx.
   .
   #.  History of C diff colitis:  Maintain precautions.  Monitor for
   diarrhea.
   .
   #   C5 spinous process fracture:  No acute issues.  Will need CT or MRI
   to clear.
   .
   #.  Depression:  Continue citalopram when can take PO.  Hold quetiapine
   for now as can worsen sedation.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently showing signs of intoxication progressing to withdrawal. They require frequent CIWA assessments and may need admission to a detox facility upon discharge.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory distress and may require intubation and tracheostomy. The current symptoms could be due to intoxication leading to aspiration or oversedation from EtOH and benzodiazepine administration. A chest X-ray shows infiltrate versus atelectasis, making it important to consider aspiration pneumonia, especially given the patient's history of tricuspid valve endocarditis.

3. Fever: The patient has an elevated temperature, which could be related to the aspiration event. Differential diagnosis includes aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, or an occult source of fever. Empiric treatment with levofloxacin and metronidazole has been initiated, and follow-up cultures are necessary.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was in rapid ventricular response overnight on admission. IV bolus of diltiazem was given, and monitoring on telemetry is ongoing. The underlying disorders causing the increased catecholamine surge should be addressed.

5. Hepatitis: The patient likely has hepatitis secondary to alcohol abuse, as indicated by the AST to ALT ratio. Hepatitis C is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status due to EtOH intoxication. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and was admitted with acute alcohol intoxication, significant altered mental status, and concern for cough, hypoxia, and possible pneumonia with aspiration as the most likely cause. The patient also has atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 134/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished, with normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat. The cardiovascular examination shows distant S2 heart sound, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. Respiratory examination shows symmetric expansion, dullness, and diminished breath sounds. The abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremities show 1+ edema in the right and left lower extremities. Neurologic examination shows the patient is not attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and movement, tone, and skin are not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.6 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 38.2%, decreased potassium at 3.4 mEq/L, decreased magnesium at 0.6 mg/dL, decreased calcium at 8.1 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 129/338). Imaging shows right upper lobe pneumonia and right lower lobe atelectasis.

The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for alcohol withdrawal with lorazepam as needed, pneumonia with levofloxacin and metronidazole, atrial fibrillation with diltiazem, and ICU care including nutrition via oral intake, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is planned for transfer to the floor with stable CIWA dosing and tolerance of oral intake.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as seizures or delirium tremens, progression of pneumonia, and potential thromboembolic events due to immobilization and risk factors for DVT. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent these complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status and respiratory distress. He has a history of alcohol abuse and cervical injury. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 84 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 107-155/84-117 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently receiving various medications including diltiazem, lansoprazole, lorazepam, and heparin. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose level, liver enzymes (ALT and AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The patient's abdominal ultrasound reveals fatty infiltration of the liver with no significant abnormalities. The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia, alcohol withdrawal, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cervical injury. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory complications such as worsening respiratory distress or even respiratory failure.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse puts him at risk for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including seizures and delirium tremens.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and he may be experiencing respiratory failure, which could worsen if left untreated.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with history of recent C5 spinous process fracture, atrial
   fibrillation, PEs, and tricuspid valve endocarditis admitted for a fib
   with RVR, respiratory distress and EtOH intoxication/withdrawal.
   .
   #.  Altered mental Status/ETOH abuse: Likely EtOH intoxication now
   progressing to withdrawal.  Patient requiring q2-3H CIWA currently.
   Hold suboxone as unclear if the patient is taking as prescribed given
   tox screen negative for opiates and can complicate respiratory status.
   Will encourage admission to detox facility on discharge.    Will need
   s/s before starts eating.
   - Will space out CIWA to q4h (has been [**Doctor Last Name 2110**] 5 overnight, 12 this AM)
   -MVI and thiamine
   .
   #.  Hepatitis:  Likely secondary to alcohol given AST to ALT ratio in
   addition to Hep C.  The patient has a tremor at baseline, but has
   preserved synthetic function.  LFTs on the rise today, possibly a
   result of alcoholic hepatitis in conjunction with ativan
   administration.
   -continue to monitor lfts
   -hepatitis serologies
   #.  Respiratory Distress:  The patient has a history of prolonged
   hospitalization for respiratory distress following similar
   presentation, requiring intubation and ultimately tracheostomy.  Most
   likely the patient's cause for respiratory distress is intoxication
   causing a possible aspiration event, in conjuction with oversedation
   from EtOH and benzo administration.  CXR also shows infiltrate versus
   atelectasis. PE seems less likely given  read of CTA and clinical
   context so heparin gtt stopped.  Pt now with decreasing oxygen
   requirements, on RA.
   - Pt had been receiving levo/flagyl for aspiration pneumonia; will stop
   flagyl and continue Levofloxacin (day [**4-14**])
   .
   #Fever: Most likely related to aspiration event in the context of
   sedation/intoxication.  Differential includes aspiration pneumonitis
   versus pneumonia versus occult source of fever.  Patient does have a
   history of tricuspid valve endocarditis. C diff neg
   -Continue empiric tx with levo
   -f/u cultures
   -consider TTE to evaluate tricuspid valve if patient worsens clinically
   or blood culture is positive
   .
   #.  Atrial Fibrillation:  Periodically in RVR overnight on admission,
   requiring IV bolus of diltiazem in conjunction with drips.  Most likely
   was in rapid ventricular response secondary to increased catecholamine
   surge from either intoxication, infection or hypoxia.  Will treat
   underlying disorders as outlined.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - restart PO metoprolol and diltiazem and stop dilt drip
   .
   # Hx of PE:  seems that anticoagulation stopped as outpatient due to
   elevated INR, patient with recurrent etoh abuse and falls
   -SC Heparin for pphx.
   .
   #   C5 spinous process fracture:  No acute issues.  Will need CT or MRI
   to clear.
   - f/u ortho spine recs now that patient more awake and conversant
   #.  History of C diff colitis:  Maintain precautions.  Monitor for
   diarrhea.

   #.  Depression:  Continue citalopram when can take PO.  Hold quetiapine
   for now as can worsen sedation.

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of recent C5 spinous process fracture, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, and tricuspid valve endocarditis. He was admitted for fib with respiratory volume ratio (RVR), respiratory distress, and ethanol (EtOH) intoxication/withdrawal. The patient presented with altered mental status, likely due to EtOH intoxication progressing to withdrawal. He required continuous monitoring for CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) every 2-3 hours. Suboxone was held as it is unclear if the patient is taking it as prescribed. The patient also has a tremor at baseline, indicating possible underlying liver disease, such as alcoholic hepatitis. 

The patient has a history of prolonged hospitalization for respiratory distress, requiring intubation and tracheostomy. The current respiratory distress is likely due to intoxication causing a possible aspiration event, in conjunction with oversedation from EtOH and benzodiazepine administration. A chest X-ray (CXR) showed infiltrate versus atelectasis, making pulmonary embolism (PE) less likely. Heparin gtt was stopped, and the patient is now on room air (RA). 

The patient has a fever, most likely related to the aspiration event in the context of sedation/intoxication. Differential diagnoses include aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, or an occult source of fever. The patient also has"

   -Temp of 100.6 at 4pm, sent blood cx
   - LFTs down, except Bili is slightly up (1.7) so ordered RUQ ultrasound
   which preliminarily showed just fatty liver
   - Having Aflutter with HR in 150's and hypertensive with diastolics in
   the low 100's, increased Dilt drip to 15, gave extra 5mg IV Dilt with
   good effect (HR decreased to 100, BP to 130's/90's)
   - Ortho recs: Pt too confused to clear spine.  Await better mental
   status.  Once more appropriate, can clear clinically.  If still has
   symptoms at that time, will need additional imaging.
   - Sent CK because urine looked a little pink, came back at 257, also

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with history of recent C5 spinous process fracture, atrial
   fibrillation, PEs, and tricuspid valve endocarditis admitted for a fib
   with RVR, respiratory distress and EtOH intoxication.
   .
   #.  Altered mental Status/ETOH abuse: Likely EtOH intoxication now
   progressing to withdrawal.  Patient requiring q3H CIWA currently. Hold
   suboxone as unclear if the patient is taking as prescribed given tox
   screen negative for opiates and can complicate respiratory status.
   Will encourage admission to detox facility on discharge.    Will need
   s/s before starts eating.
   - continue CIWA Q1H with ativan
 space out? CIWAs 5 overnight, 12 this
   AM
   - All meds IV for now, patient NPO as unable to protect airway
   -recheck LFTs
   -add Thiamine IVF X3 days (day 3 today)
   .
   #.  Respiratory Distress:  The patient has a history of prolonged
   hospitalization for respiratory distress following similar
   presentation, requiring intubation and ultimately tracheostomy.  Most
   likely the patient's cause for respiratory distress is intoxication
   causing a possible aspiration event, in conjuction with oversedation
   from EtOH and benzo administration.  CXR also shows infiltrate versus
   atelectasis. PE seems less likely given  read of CTA and clinical
   context so heparin gtt stopped.  Pt now with decreasing oxygen
   requirements, on RA.
   - empiric tx with levo/flagyl for aspiration pneumonia, currently day
   2/likely 7 day course
   .
   #Fever: Most likely related to aspiration event in the context of
   sedation/intoxication.  Differential includes aspiration pneumonitis
   versus pneumonia versus occult source of fever.  Patient does have a
   history of tricuspid valve endocarditis.
   -Continue empiric tx with levo/flagyl
   -f/u cultures
   -send cdiff once has BM
   -consider TTE to evaluate tricuspid valve if patient worsens clinically
   or culture is positive
   .
   #.  Atrial Fibrillation:  Periodically in RVR overnight on admission,
   requiring IV bolus of diltiazem in conjunction with drips.  Most likely
   was in rapid ventricular response secondary to increased catecholamine
   surge from either intoxication, infection or hypoxia.  Will treat
   underlying disorders as outlined.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - wean dilt drip as tolerated
   - start home regimen of metoprolol and dilt when able to take PO
   .
   #.  Hepatitis:  Likely secondary to alcohol given AST to ALT ratio in
   addition to Hep C.  The patient has a tremor at baseline, but has
   preserved synthetic function.  Will avoid long acting benzos and other
   hepatotoxic medications.  Monitor for signs of decompensation.
   .
   # Hx of PE:  seems that anticoagulation stopped as outpatient due to
   elevated INR, patient with recurrent etoh abuse and falls
   -SC Heparin for pphx.
   .
   #.  History of C diff colitis:  Maintain precautions.  Monitor for
   diarrhea.
   .
   #   C5 spinous process fracture:  No acute issues.  Will need CT or MRI
   to clear.
   .
   #.  Depression:  Continue citalopram when can take PO.  Hold quetiapine
   for now as can worsen sedation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cervical injury, currently admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, alcohol withdrawal, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and possible cervical injury. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they show signs of agitation and increased CIWA score indicating worsening alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The patient received Ativan for agitation. Labs show elevated liver enzymes, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated levels of LDH. The patient is being monitored for potential complications related to pneumonia, alcohol withdrawal, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. Complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of worsening alcohol withdrawal symptoms, which can lead to severe complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, and increased risk of infections.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which can progress to respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not managed properly. This can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and ultimately respiratory arrest.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events like stroke if not managed with anticoagulation therapy.
5. Cervical Injury: The patient has a history of cervical injury, which"

   58 yo male with history of recent C5 spinous process fracture, atrial
   fibrillation, PEs, and tricuspid valve endocarditis admitted for a fib
   with RVR, respiratory distress and EtOH intoxication/withdrawal.

   progressing to withdrawal.  Patient requiring q4h CIWA currently. Hold
   suboxone as unclear if the patient is taking as prescribed given tox
   screen negative for opiates and can complicate respiratory status.
   Will encourage admission to detox facility on discharge.    Will need

   addition to Hep C.  The patient has a tremor at baseline, but has
   preserved synthetic function.  LFTs trending down today.
   -continue to monitor lfts
   -f/u hepatitis serologies
   #.  Respiratory Distress:  The patient has a history of prolonged
   hospitalization for respiratory distress following similar
   presentation, requiring intubation and ultimately tracheostomy.  Most
   likely the patient's cause for respiratory distress is intoxication
   causing a possible aspiration event, in conjuction with oversedation
   from EtOH and benzo administration.  CXR also shows infiltrate versus
   atelectasis. PE seems less likely given  read of CTA and clinical
   context so heparin gtt stopped.  Pt now with decreasing oxygen
   requirements, on RA.
   - Pt had been receiving levo/flagyl for aspiration pneumonia; will stop
   flagyl and continue Levofloxacin (day [**5-15**])
   .
   #Fever: Most likely related to aspiration event in the context of
   sedation/intoxication.  Differential includes aspiration pneumonitis
   versus pneumonia versus occult source of fever.  Patient does have a
   history of tricuspid valve endocarditis. C diff neg
   -Continue empiric tx with levo
   -f/u cultures
   -consider TTE to evaluate tricuspid valve if patient worsens clinically
   or blood culture is positive
   .
   #.  Atrial Fibrillation:  Periodically in RVR overnight on admission,
   requiring IV bolus of diltiazem in conjunction with drips.  Most likely
   was in rapid ventricular response secondary to increased catecholamine
   surge from either intoxication, infection or hypoxia.  Will treat
   underlying disorders as outlined.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue PO metoprolol and diltiazem
   .
   #   C5 spinous process fracture:  No acute issues.  Will need CT or MRI
   to clear.

   58 yo male with history of recent C5 spinous process fracture, atrial
   fibrillation, PEs, and tricuspid valve endocarditis admitted for a fib
   with RVR, respiratory distress and EtOH intoxication/withdrawal.

   progressing to withdrawal.  Patient requiring q4h CIWA currently. Hold
   suboxone as unclear if the patient is taking as prescribed given tox
   screen negative for opiates and can complicate respiratory status.

   addition to Hep C.  The patient has a tremor at baseline, but has
   preserved synthetic function.  LFTs trending down today.
   -continue to monitor lfts
   -f/u hepatitis serologies
   #.  Respiratory Distress:  The patient has a history of prolonged
   hospitalization for respiratory distress following similar
   presentation, requiring intubation and ultimately tracheostomy.  Most
   likely the patient's cause for respiratory distress is intoxication
   causing a possible aspiration event, in conjuction with oversedation
   from EtOH and benzo administration.  CXR also shows infiltrate versus
   atelectasis. PE seems less likely given  read of CTA and clinical
   context so heparin gtt stopped.  Pt now with decreasing oxygen
   requirements, on RA.
   - Pt had been receiving levo/flagyl for aspiration pneumonia; will stop
   flagyl and continue Levofloxacin (day [**5-15**])
   .

   sedation/intoxication.  Differential includes aspiration pneumonitis
   versus pneumonia versus occult source of fever.  Patient does have a
   history of tricuspid valve endocarditis. C diff neg
   -Continue empiric tx with levo

   or blood culture is positive
   .
   #.  Atrial Fibrillation:  Periodically in RVR overnight on admission,
   requiring IV bolus of diltiazem in conjunction with drips.  Most likely
   was in rapid ventricular response secondary to increased catecholamine
   surge from either intoxication, infection or hypoxia.  Will treat
   underlying disorders as outlined.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of recent C5 spinous process fracture, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism (PE), and tricuspid valve endocarditis. He was admitted for fib with respiratory viral infection (RVI), respiratory distress, and ethanol (EtOH) intoxication/withdrawal.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Altered mental status/ETOH abuse: The patient is likely experiencing ethanol intoxication that is progressing to withdrawal. He requires frequent monitoring of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA) scale and may need admission to a detox facility upon discharge. 

2. Hepatitis: The patient likely has hepatitis, possibly secondary to alcohol abuse given the elevated AST to ALT ratio and presence of Hepatitis C. Monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) and follow-up hepatitis serologies are recommended.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of prolonged hospitalization for respiratory distress following similar presentations, requiring intubation and tracheostomy. This episode may be caused by intoxication leading to a possible aspiration event, along with oversedation from EtOH and benzodiazepine administration. The patient has decreased oxygen requirements and is on room air.

4. Fever: The patient's fever is most likely related to the aspiration event in the context of sedation/intoxication. Differential diagnoses include aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted with acute alcohol intoxication and likely aspiration pneumonia. He has shown slow improvement in mental status but still experiences intermittent confusion due to active withdrawal. The patient is currently being managed with CIWA for alcohol withdrawal and continues to receive antibiotics for pneumonia. Other medical conditions include bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, alcohol withdrawal (with delirium tremens, seizures), and atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/81 to 154/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,145 mL, output of 1,650 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 505 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, increased liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated blood glucose level, and abnormal kidney function (creatinine). Imaging shows evidence of fatty liver.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. If left untreated or inadequately treated, the infection can worsen, leading to increased inflammation in the lungs and potentially causing respiratory failure or sepsis.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing active alcohol withdrawal, which can progress to severe complications such as delirium trem"
