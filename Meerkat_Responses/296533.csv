   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of stage [**Doctor First Name **] squamous cell carcinoma
   of the vulva and recent diagnosis of DVT on anticoagulation who
   presents from rehab with bright red blood per rectum.
   Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Differential diagnosis for lower
   gastrointestinal bleeding includes diverticulosis, polyps,
   gastrointestinal malignancies, AVM, hemorrhoids, versus malignant
   invasion of known gynecologic tumor into rectum.  Currently
   hemodynamically stable with stable hct since admission to ICU.
   Management is complicated by recent diagnosis of extensive left sided
   DVT and need for anticoagulation.
   - holding heparin and coumadin for now
   - in light of inability to place IVC [**Last Name (LF) 2616**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] contact heme/onc attg
   re: restarting heparin/coumadin as she is at high risk of PE
   -  GI planning to scope on Monday unless actively bleeding: will need
   to f/u with them prior to restarting anticoag
   - has now received vitamin K as well as 3 units of FFP in preparation
   for IVC [**First Name3 (LF) 2616**]
   - will check hematocrits [**Hospital1 **]
   - if continues to bleed by is stable would consider formal prep with
   colonoscopy in ICU
   - NPO pending GI input about colonoscopy
   - would consider bleeding study and angiography if increased bleeding
   - transfusion goal > 25
   Left Lower Extremity DVT: Patient recently diagnosed and started on
   heparin and coumadin.  Now with active gastrointestinal bleeding.
   - holding heparin and coumadin but will restart as soon as get the ok
   from heme/onc
   Vulvar Cancer:  s/p radical vulvectomy and chemoradiation but with
   recently with new pelvic mass and associated hydronephrosis and urinary
   tract infection.  Renal function currently stable.  Further plans for
   treatment are unclear.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of stage 4 squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, recent diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and presentation from rehabilitation with bright red blood per rectum. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient has been experiencing lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and the differential diagnosis includes diverticulosis, polyps, gastrointestinal malignancies, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), hemorrhoids, or malignant invasion of the known gynecologic tumor into the rectum. The patient is hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit levels since admission to the ICU.

Management is complicated by the recent diagnosis of extensive left-sided DVT and the need for anticoagulation. Heparin and coumadin have been temporarily held due to the active gastrointestinal bleeding. The plan is to restart heparin and coumadin once it is safe to do so, in consultation with the hematologist/oncologist. A bleeding study and angiography may be considered if there is increased bleeding.

The patient also has a history of vulvar cancer, for which she underwent radical vulvectomy and chemoradiation. However, she has developed a new pelvic mass with associated hydronephrosis and urinary tract infection. Renal function is currently stable, but further plans for treatment are unclear.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk of developing pulmonary"

The physician favors obtaining an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter to allow for safe holding of anticoagulation in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding and potential pulmonary embolism. 

The patient has received vitamin K and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in preparation for the IVC filter. Hematocrit levels will be checked every 6 hours. A gastroenterology consult has been requested. If the bleeding continues and the patient is stable, a formal preparation with colonoscopy in the ICU may be considered. If there is increased bleeding, a bleeding study and angiography may be necessary. The transfusion goal is set at >25.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 82-year-old female with stage IV vulvar cancer and a large pelvic mass. She also has a left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is experiencing rectal bleeding. The patient attempted to receive an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, but it was unsuccessful due to superior vena cava (SVC) dilation. The patient has been stable hemodynamically and has had one further episode of bleeding, requiring one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and three fresh frozen plasma (FFP) units.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), current temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate (HR) of 70 bpm (69-93 bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 102/42 mmHg (98/42 mmHg - 136/82 mmHg), respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute (17-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.2 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 23.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 353 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 79 mg/dL, prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT)/international normalized ratio (INR) of 14.1/29.5/1.2, calcium level (Ca++) of 8.7 mg/dL, magnesium level (Mg++) of 1.4 mg/dL, and phosphate level (PO4) of 3.1 mg/dL.

The patient has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity and was unable to receive an IVC filter due to SVC dilation. She will likely need to restart anticoagulation. The patient is also experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, which is currently being managed with supportive care. The patient's vulvar carcinoma is being treated symptomatically, and further diagnostic tests may be required to evaluate the extent of the disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the DVT, pulmonary embolism, further episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, and complications related to the patient's underlying vulvar carcinoma."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old female with stage IV vulvar cancer, a large pelvic mass, and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).
- The patient had an attempted inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, but it was unsuccessful due to superior vena cava (SVC) dilation.
- The patient has been stable without further bleeding episodes since yesterday.
- Vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated heart rate and temperature.
- Physical examination reveals pale conjunctiva, right-sided heart sounds with a loud S2 sound at the lower left sternal border, pronounced lateralized point of maximum intensity, and benign abdominal findings.
- Laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, normal kidney function, and electrolyte imbalances.
- The patient is currently holding anticoagulation therapy and is expected to resume it soon, but with close monitoring due to the high risk of bleeding.
- The patient's condition requires ongoing ICU care, and plans are being made for further management, including a flexible sigmoidoscopy and potential bleeding scan if rebleeding occurs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: Given the patient's history of GIB, there is a risk of rebleeding, which can lead to hypotension, shock, and even death if not promptly managed.
2. Pulmonary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with stage IV vulvar cancer, a large pelvic mass, and a left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), which has since stabilized. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was attempted but could not be placed due to a superior vena cava (SVC) that is too dilated. The patient is currently not receiving anticoagulation but may need to restart it in the future. The patient is also being treated for vulvar carcinoma with symptomatic care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient initially presented with GIB, which has been stabilized but could potentially reoccur. Further evaluation with a bleeding scan or colonoscopy may be necessary if there is a rebleeding event.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed left lower extremity DVT. If anticoagulation is restarted, there is a risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring will be required.
3. Vulvar Carcinoma: The patient has stage IV vulvar cancer. Treatment is focused on symptomatic management at this time.
4. Enlarged Superior Vena Cava (SVC): The SVC is too dilated to accommodate an IVC filter, posing a risk for further thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation may be"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of stage 4 squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, recent diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and presentation from rehab with bright red blood per rectum. The patient is currently in the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding and has been diagnosed with diverticular disease in the sigmoid colon. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a high risk of developing a PE due to the extensive left-sided DVT and the need for anticoagulation. The plan is to restart heparin and coumadin after obtaining clearance from the hematology/oncology department.

2. Further gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is currently stable, but there is a possibility of further bleeding, especially if the anticoagulation therapy is restarted. Close monitoring and potential intervention such as a bleeding study and angiography may be necessary.

3. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection and may be at risk for further infections due to her immunocompromised state from cancer and the ICU environment. Repeat urinalysis and appropriate antibiotic treatment should be considered.

4. Renal function decline: Although the patient's renal function is currently stable, the recent diagnosis of a pelvic mass and associated hydronephrosis may lead to a decline in renal function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and further evaluation of the pelvic"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of stage II squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva and a recent diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). She presents from rehab with bright red blood per rectum. She underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy which showed sigmoid diverticuli, no active bleed, and no tumor invasion of bowel walls up to the ascending colon. The source of bleeding is still unknown. Differential diagnosis for lower gastrointestinal bleeding includes diverticulosis, polyps, gastrointestinal malignancies, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), hemorrhoids, versus malignant invasion of known gynecologic tumor into rectum. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit since admission to the ICU. Management is complicated by the need for anticoagulation due to the recent diagnosis of extensive left-sided DVT. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she has clear lung sounds bilaterally. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, with bowel sounds present. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding, and no organomegaly. She has 3+ edema of the left lower extremity and trace edema of the right lower extremity, with 2+ pulses. There is no clubbing or cyanosis. The patient has several pending tests including urinalysis, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of stage 3 squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, recent diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and current presentation with lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is being managed in the ICU due to her unstable condition.

The patient has undergone a colonoscopy which showed no active bleed, no tumor invasion, and sigmoid diverticuli. The source of bleeding remains unknown. The patient's hematocrit levels have been stable overnight, and she has been restarted on a heparin drip. The management plan includes monitoring the hematocrit levels, aiming for a transfusion goal of hematocrit >25, and performing another colonoscopy if the hematocrit remains unstable or if the patient is stable enough before discharge from the floor.

Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with a left lower extremity DVT, for which she is being restarted on a heparin drip and will have her PTTs monitored.

The patient's history also includes vulvar cancer, for which she underwent radical vulvectomy and chemoradiation, but with a recent new pelvic mass and associated hydronephrosis and urinary tract infection. Her renal function is currently stable, but further plans for treatment are unclear. The oncology team has been involved, and repeat urinalysis is planned.

The patient's GERD is stable, and she will continue with home protonix. She"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with stage IV vulvar cancer and a history of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and rectal bleeding. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/54 to 117/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is currently on systemic anticoagulation with heparin due to her DVT. Her laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, leukocyte count of 8.2 K/uL, hematocrit of 23.3%, platelet count of 353 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and glucose level of 79 mg/dL. The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding has been stabilized, but there is a concern for potential rebleeding. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter could not be placed due to an enlarged IVC caliber. The patient's nutritional status is described as clear, and her glycemic control is within normal limits. She is receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and her code status is full code. The patient's disposition is planned for transfer to the floor.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with stage IV vulvar cancer, a large pelvic mass, and a lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) who presented with rectal bleeding. She has been admitted to the ICU. 

24-hour events: 
- Flexible sigmoidoscopy yesterday did not show any infiltrating lesion or active bleeding.
- Heparin infusion was restarted without a bolus.
- Hematocrit was stable overnight, and there was no rectal bleeding.
- Urine output decreased overnight.
- The patient received 1 liter of normal saline overnight.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's rectal bleeding has been resolved since yesterday. The differential diagnosis includes a mass higher up in the gastrointestinal tract, diverticular bleeding, or hemorrhoidal bleeding. The plan is to monitor for any signs of rebleeding and perform a tagged red blood cell scan if rebleeding occurs. Transfusion is planned to maintain a hematocrit level above 25%.
2. Lower Extremity DVT: The patient had an unsuccessful attempt to place an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter due to an enlarged IVC caliber. Heparin infusion has been restarted, and the patient is being monitored for any further bleeding.
3. Vulvar Carcinoma: The patient is under the care of the hematology/oncology team for symptomatic treatment of her vulvar cancer.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with stage IV vulvar cancer, a large pelvic mass, and a left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She presented with rectal bleeding. Despite initial concerns, there was no evidence of an active bleed on flexible sigmoidoscopy yesterday. Heparin infusion was restarted without any further bleeding at this time. Her hemoglobin concentration has remained stable overnight. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, and she is receiving IV fluids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although the flexible sigmoidoscopy did not reveal an active bleed, the patient's initial presentation with rectal bleeding indicates a risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring for any signs of rebleeding is crucial.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient already has a left lower extremity DVT, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism. Continued anticoagulation with heparin is necessary to prevent clot propagation or new clot formation. Considering the inability to place an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, close monitoring for signs of pulmonary embolism is important.
3. Vulvar Carcinoma: The patient's underlying vulvar cancer may contribute to her overall clinical deterioration. Symptomatic treatment will be focused on managing her pain and discomfort related to the cancer.
4. Renal Function: The patient's serum creatinine levels are within normal range, but careful"
