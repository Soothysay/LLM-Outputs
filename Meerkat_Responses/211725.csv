","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to trauma, including head trauma, delirium, and agitation. The patient has undergone several medical interventions, including extubation, administration of antibiotics (Cefazolin), antiepileptic medication (Dilantin), sedatives (Lorazepam), and pain management with hydromorphone.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 108 to 126 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/100 to 171/127 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 26 to 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's neurological status is described as encephalopathic, with agitation and delirium. The patient's pain level is reported as comfortable.

Laboratory results show a decrease in white blood cell count from 8.8 to 7.2 K/uL and an increase in hemoglobin from 17.1 to 22.9 g/dL. Other lab values, including platelet count, creatinine, TCO2, glucose, PT/PTT/INR, and electrolytes, are within normal ranges or show minor fluctuations.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's medical conditions include anemia secondary to blood loss, acute pain, trauma surgery, alcohol withdrawal, fractures of the left clavicle and open tib/fib"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of trauma and head trauma. The patient has been extubated but continues to be agitated, leading the medical team to feel unsafe in transferring him to the floor even with a sitter. The patient has a history of encephalopathy and is unable to provide his own medical history. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/100 mmHg to 171/127 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's neurological examination shows that he responds to tactile stimuli, has non-purposeful movement, normal muscle tone, and is sedated.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL and a hematocrit of 22.9%. The white blood cell count is within normal range. Other lab values are also provided, including blood glucose levels, electrolytes, and kidney function tests.

The patient has several medical conditions, including acute anemia secondary to blood loss, pain control, trauma with subsequent injuries, alcohol withdrawal, fracture of the left clavicle and open tibial-fibular fracture, skull fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and subdural hem"
