","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse admitted to the ICU for syncope and delirium. The patient's urine culture showed no growth, and all other infectious workup was unrevealing. The patient required a significant amount of diazepam, indicating possible alcohol withdrawal. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in blood pressure. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,012 mL and output of 1,550 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,462 mL. The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes and a slightly decreased platelet count. The patient has not had a repeat head CT due to agitation, but other imaging and tests have been negative. The patient's current assessment includes delirium likely secondary to alcohol withdrawal, syncope with an unknown cause, and elevated liver function tests possibly due to alcohol abuse.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening delirium: If the patient's delirium is not properly managed, it can lead to increased agitation, confusion, and potential falls or self-injury.
2. Alcohol withdrawal seizures: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and the need for diazepam suggest that he may be experiencing alcohol withdrawal. If not managed appropriately, this could result in seizures.
3. Infection: Despite negative urine cultures and other tests, there is still a possibility of an undetected infection, which could worsen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU for altered mental status (AMS), agitation, and delirium. The patient experienced a syncopal episode prior to admission, and the initial workup did not reveal any significant findings. The patient was suspected to have alcohol withdrawal, but a subdural hematoma was also considered due to the syncopal episode. There is low suspicion for infection based on the patient's exam, labs (normal white blood cell count), and lack of fever.

The patient has been receiving high doses of valium to manage agitation and delirium. He is now less agitated and more alert, but still exhibits slurred speech. The valium dosage has been adjusted to 10 mg every 4 hours, with consideration to increase the interval to every 6 hours. Prn valium is to be administered every 2 hours using the CIWA scale, and haloperidol will be given as needed.

A repeat head CT is planned to rule out a subdural hematoma, despite low suspicion due to recent syncope. The infection workup has been unrevealing, with the patient remaining afebrile and having a normal white blood cell count.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 143/76 mmHg to 169/90 mm"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcohol use who was admitted on [**5-10**] after experiencing a syncopal episode. He has been transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status, agitation, and delirium. There is suspicion of alcohol withdrawal, but a subdural hematoma is also in the differential diagnosis. The patient's urine culture came back negative, and a chest X-ray showed no focal abnormalities. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, blood pressure ranging from 143/76 mmHg to 169/90 mmHg, heart rate between 90 and 125 bpm, respiratory rate of 16-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's laboratory results show slightly abnormal levels of white blood cells, platelets, and liver enzymes, but these are within acceptable ranges. The patient is currently receiving diazepam infusions and other medications for his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Subdural hematoma: The patient's syncopal episode raises concern for a possible subdural hematoma, which can cause altered mental status and delirium. A repeat head CT scan is recommended to rule out this condition.
2. Infection: Although the patient's initial laboratory results and lack of fever suggest a low suspicion for infection, it should still be considered as a potential complication due to the patient's altered mental"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcohol use disorder who was admitted on [**5-10**] after experiencing a syncopal episode. He was transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status, agitation, and delirium. Suspected etoh withdrawal is a possible cause, although a subdural hematoma is also being considered given the recent syncopal episode. The patient's physical examination revealed warm skin, mild resolving phlebitis at an old IV site, and normal breath sounds. Vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 127/66 mmHg and a heart rate of 74 bpm.

The patient's lab results showed a slightly elevated white blood cell count of 11.9 g/dL and a low platelet count of 212 K/uL. Liver function tests showed elevated ALT and AST levels, while kidney function tests were within normal limits. Imaging revealed fatty infiltration in the liver without any bile duct dilation. Microbiology tests were negative for infection.

Plan and Assessment:
The patient is diagnosed with delirium, most likely due to suspected etoh withdrawal. Treatment includes administering benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium) and haloperidol (Haldol) as needed. Thiamine, multivitamins, and folate supplementation will be provided. The patient's syncope remains unexplained, and a repeat head CT scan will be obtained to"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 49-year-old male with a chief complaint of alcohol (etoh) withdrawal.
- The patient was admitted on [**5-10**] after experiencing a syncopal episode, and his workup has been unrevealing so far.
- The patient is currently in the ICU with altered mental status (AMS), agitation, and delirium.
- The medical team suspects etoh withdrawal as the cause of these symptoms but is also considering a subdural hematoma due to the recent syncopal episode. However, there is low suspicion for infection given the patient's presentation, normal white blood cell count, and absence of fever.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/73 to 114/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,577 mL and output of 1,640 mL over the past 24 hours.
- The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL and a high leukocyte count of 223 K/uL.

","The patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of alcohol withdrawal. The patient has been aggressive and delirious, with intermittent agitation. The medical team suspects alcohol withdrawal as the cause of these symptoms. They also consider the possibility of a subdural hematoma due to the patient's recent syncopal episode, but their suspicion is low. The patient's labs show normal white blood cell count, indicating a low suspicion for infection. The assessment plan includes ruling out other potential causes such as thyroid hormone imbalance, vitamin B12 deficiency, and syphilis.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), blood pressure ranging from 140/73 to 114/55 mmHg, heart rate between 71-95 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is alert and pleasant, responding appropriately.

The patient's extremities are absent on both sides, and the peripheral pulses are not assessed. The neurologic examination reveals that the patient is attentive, oriented, and has normal movement and tone. However, he is not following commands.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels for hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. The liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are slightly elevated, and there is a decrease in albumin level. The imaging studies are unremarkable, and the microbiology results are pending.

The patient's care plan includes switching from intravenous diazepam to oral prn for CIWA > 10, obtaining a repeat head CT to rule out subdural hematoma, and checking thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. The patient will receive multivitamins, thiamine, and folate supplementation. Additionally, the patient's Foley catheter needs to be changed, and a bladder scan should be performed due to low urine output. Intravenous fluids should be given as well.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening alcohol withdrawal symptoms, development of delirium tremens, seizures, or infections. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, neurologic status, and laboratory parameters is essential to prevent and manage these complications promptly."

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcohol use who presented with a syncopal episode. He was admitted to the hospital and later transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status (AMS), agitation, and delirium. The main concerns in the progress note are delirium, agitation, suspected alcohol withdrawal, potential subdural hematoma, and infection.

From the information provided, the patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate within normal limits, blood pressure slightly elevated, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,577 mL and output of 1,977 mL, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation.

Laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, liver function tests (ALT/AST), amylase/lipase, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The coagulation profile (PT/PTT/INR) is also within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Delirium - The patient is suspected to have alcohol withdrawal delirium, but a low suspicion for infection due to the normal white blood cell count and absence of fever.
2. Syncope - The workup for syncope has been unrevealing so far.
3. Transaminitis - The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to recent alcohol"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcohol use disorder, admitted to the ICU after experiencing a syncopal episode. He presents with altered mental status, agitation, and delirium. The medical team suspects alcohol withdrawal but also considers the possibility of a subdural hematoma due to the syncopal episode. Laboratory tests show elevated liver enzymes, but no evidence of infection. The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. Vital signs are within normal limits, with stable hemodynamics and respiratory support. The patient has a history of fatty infiltrate on abdominal ultrasound, but no significant abnormalities in coagulation tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be a common complication in alcohol withdrawal. It is important to manage this condition promptly to prevent further complications such as falls or worsening agitation.
2. Subdural hematoma: Although the suspicion is low, the patient's recent syncopal episode raises concern for a subdural hematoma. A repeat head CT scan is planned to rule out this possibility.
3. Infection: Despite the normal white blood cell count and absence of fever, there is still a risk of infection in the ICU setting. Close monitoring and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be considered if there are any signs of infection.
4. Alcohol withdrawal seizures: Seizures can occur as a complication of alcohol withdrawal."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of ethanol (etoh) withdrawal. The patient's medical history is significant for a syncopal episode, but further investigation has been unrevealing. The patient presented with altered mental status, agitation, and delirium. 

Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/74 mmHg to 157/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium and receives diazepam and haloperidol as needed.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Kidney function appears to be within normal limits, as indicated by creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. Liver function tests reveal elevated liver enzymes, but coagulation profile is normal. Electrolyte levels are also within normal range. Imaging studies have been performed, but the results are not mentioned in the progress note.

The patient's condition has been complicated by delirium, possibly due to etoh withdrawal, intermittent agitation, and transaminitis. A head CT was ordered to rule out subdural hematoma. The patient's syncope remains unexplained. The fatty infiltrate seen on ultrasound of the right upper quadrant is noted"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a chief complaint of alcohol (etoh) withdrawal. He was admitted on [**5-10**] after experiencing a syncopal episode, and his initial workup did not reveal any significant findings. He was transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status, agitation, and delirium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/74 to 157/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium, diazepam (Valium), and haloperidol (Haldol). His fluid balance shows an intake of 3,521 mL (554 mL IVF, 690 mL PO, 2,831 mL IVF, and 871 mL balance) and output of 2,650 mL (600 mL urine). The patient is not receiving respiratory support, and his ABG results are pending.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds, and absent peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities. Neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, and is oriented. However, movement, tone, and skin assessments were not performed.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 8.2 K"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with suspected ethanol (etoh) withdrawal, agitation, and delirium. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a syncopal episode with an unrevealing workup to date. The patient has intermittent agitation and is being monitored with the CIWA scale for etoh withdrawal. Valium and Haldol are being administered as needed. There are no known drug allergies. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium for DVT, stress ulcer prevention, and VAP prevention. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), blood pressure ranging from 124/74-157/99 mmHg, heart rate between 69-88 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has trace edema and soft breath sounds. His lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolyte levels. However, there is transaminitis with improved liver function tests and fatty infiltrate seen on RUQ ultrasound without bile dilation. The patient is tolerating oral intake well and has good glycemic control. Further evaluation is needed to rule out potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ETOH withdrawal symptoms: The patient's delirium, agitation, and history of ethanol use suggest possible etoh withdrawal. Close monitoring and administration"

     49 yo M with etoh, admitted [**5-10**] after syncopal episode with
   unrevealing w/u to date, transferred to ICU with AMS, agitation,
   delirium.
   Suspected etoh withdrawal, though sub-dural hematoma in ddx given
   recent syncopal episode, low suspicion for infection given presenting
   exam,  labs (nl wbc) and lack of temp.

   Disposition :
   Patient transferred to floor stable. Significant improvement since
   admission. Agree with plan as discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2730**]
","The patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU with AMS, agitation, and delirium. The chief complaint is delirium and suspected ethanol (etoh) withdrawal. The patient also experienced a syncopal episode prior to admission, but further investigation did not reveal any significant findings.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/74 to 157/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

Physical examination reveals trace edema and easy reorientation. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, glucose, and liver function tests. However, there is a significant elevation in creatinine level at 801 mg/dL, indicating renal impairment. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium.

The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin, diazepam (Valium), and haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation and suspected etoh withdrawal. The patient is also receiving nutrition through oral intake and has good glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening delirium and agitation due to ongoing etoh withdrawal.
2. Development of infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
