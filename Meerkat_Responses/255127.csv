","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. He had unstable angina earlier in the day and is now intubated. The patient underwent cooling as part of the Arctic Sun protocol and is currently being re-warmed. There are no signs of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient has a history of little known active medical issues and does not receive regular medical care.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest with documented asystole versus ventricular fibrillation, requiring two shocks and lidocaine. He is now hemodynamically stable and off lidocaine. The arrest occurred during chest pain. No signs of STEMI were observed. Enzymes are trending down, suggesting a possible infarction. Work-up for ischemic heart disease is pending, including an echocardiogram today.

2. Respiratory arrest: The patient had respiratory acidosis just before leaving the emergency department for the floor, with a gas exchange of 7.21/67/174/28. A chest X-ray showed bilateral lung aspiration in the context of multiple intubation attempts. Yesterday, the patient's PCO2 decreased from 26 to 32, and the last gas exchange improved at 7.36/40/94. Ventilation settings are being adjusted to maintain a PCO2 of 35-40. Sedation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest in the setting of unstable angina. He was resuscitated and intubated, and underwent cooling on the Arctic Sun protocol. The patient's current condition is stable, and he is beginning the rewarming process. There are no signs of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient has a history of little-known medical issues and does not receive regular medical care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. S/p Arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest with documented asystole versus ventricular fibrillation, requiring two shocks and lidocaine. Although he is currently hemodynamically stable off lidocaine, there is suspicion of an infarction. Enzymes are trending down, but further work-up is needed for ischemic heart disease, including an echocardiogram today.
2. Respiratory arrest: The patient had a respiratory acidosis just before leaving the emergency department, with gas exchange at 7.21/67/174/28. A chest X-ray suggested bilateral aspiration in the context of multiple intubation attempts. The patient's pCO2 levels have improved from 26 to 32, and his last gas exchange is at 7.36/40/94.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has improved with captopril and metoprolol.

Overall, the patient's medical history is limited, and there are several"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient underwent cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure of 120/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving continuous infusions of midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, and vecuronium. The flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, respiratory support, and laboratory results. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal potassium levels, and elevated troponin T levels. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. This requires regular assessment of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy if needed.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and use of venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. Regular assessment of lower extremities and consideration of prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or anticoagulation may be necessary.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and mechanical ventilation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who experienced cardiac arrest in the context of unstable angina earlier today. He is currently intubated and undergoing cooling on an Arctic sun protocol, with the process of re-warming beginning. There are no signs of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient has a history of little-known active medical issues and does not receive regular medical care. The plan for the patient will ultimately be determined by the family's goals of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anoxic brain damage (anoxic encephalopathy, hypoxic ischemic): The patient's cardiac arrest and subsequent lack of oxygen supply to the brain may have resulted in significant damage.
2. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have increased to 2.6, indicating potential acute kidney injury, possibly due to pre-renal causes or acute tubular necrosis following cardiac arrest.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, which required resuscitation efforts and resulted in prolonged hypoxia and potential brain injury.
4. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS, unstable angina, coronary ischemia): The patient's cardiac arrest occurred in the setting of unstable angina, suggesting ongoing coronary artery disease.
5. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory arrest and increased carbon dioxide levels indicate inadequate ventilation. This could be due to"

The patient is receiving multiple medications including heparin sodium, propofol, metoprolol, and famotidine. The patient also has several lines in place, including an arterial line, as well as being on a ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of troponin T, creatine kinase (CK), and lactate acid. The complete blood count (CBC) shows a normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count. The blood chemistry panel reveals renal dysfunction with elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and has undergone several interventions including chest compressions, defibrillation, and administration of medications. The patient's condition has been complicated by anoxic brain damage, acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that could arise for this patient include further deterioration of renal function, development of ventilator"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of unstable angina and is being treated with medications such as aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, and a statin. The patient's medical conditions include anoxic brain damage, renal failure, acute coronary syndrome, and respiratory failure.

The patient's recent events include completing a cooling protocol due to suspected hypoxic ischemic injury, being febrile and starting on Tylenol, and having a head CT showing no intracranial hemorrhage but bilateral ethmoidal and sphenoidal maxillary sinus mucosal thickening. The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure, bradycardia, and an elevated respiratory rate. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated potassium, and elevated lactate levels. The cardiac enzymes (CK and CKMB) are decreasing, indicating some improvement in cardiac function.

The potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, worsening of respiratory status, development of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential complications related to the patient's cardiac condition.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note, and additional details may be required for a more comprehensive assessment."

","The patient is a 68-year-old male who presented with unstable angina and experienced a cardiac arrest. He was successfully resuscitated but suffered from anoxic brain damage due to the lack of oxygen during the arrest. The patient remains intubated and is currently being cooled as part of the Arctic Sun protocol. He is now beginning the rewarming process.

The patient's medical history is limited, as he does not regularly receive medical care. There are no signs of a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), but there is suspicion of an inferior wall infarction. Enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement. An echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis, which suggests reduced heart function.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). His blood glucose levels are high, and he has an increased creatinine level with poor urine output. These findings are consistent with pre-renal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to the cardiac arrest. The patient received a 1L bolus of fluid with minimal improvement in urine output.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. His temperature is elevated at 38.1 degrees Celsius. His arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with an increased pCO2 level of 47 mmHg.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who presented with unstable angina and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated and placed on an Arctic Sun cooling protocol. The patient remains intubated and is currently undergoing re-warming. There is suspicion of an infarction, but no signs of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were observed. Enzymes are trending down, indicating a possible decrease in cardiac damage.

The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, leading to an increase in respiratory rate. An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis revealed a pH of 7.3, indicating respiratory acidosis. The goal is to maintain pCO2 levels between 35-40 mmHg. The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral lung aspiration, likely due to multiple intubation attempts. Ventilation will continue with the goal of maintaining pCO2 levels between 35-40 mmHg. Sedation weaning and daily chest X-rays will be done to monitor for further aspiration.

The patient has acute renal failure, with an increase in serum creatinine levels to 2.6 mg/dL. This could be due to pre-renal causes or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following cardiac arrest. A 1L bolus was given, but there was minimal improvement in urine output. Continuing to trend creatinine levels, avoiding nephrotoxins, and administering IV fluids as needed are"

","Summary:
- 68-year-old male patient with a history of unstable angina who experienced a cardiac arrest and is currently intubated.
- The patient is undergoing cooling on the Arctic Sun protocol and beginning re-warming process.
- There are no signs of STEMI, and very little is known about the patient's active medical issues and history since he does not receive regular medical care.
- The patient's plan of care will ultimately be dictated by the family's goals.
- The patient has had a respiratory arrest, acute renal failure, UTI, and hypertension.
- The patient's prognosis is poor per neurology, and cardiac arrest consult recommendations are being followed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been intubated multiple times, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia due to aspiration.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and potential hypoperfusion, which can lead to acute renal failure.
5. Delirium or cognitive impairment: The patient's severe brain injury and prolonged sedation may increase the risk of delirium or cognitive impairment.
6. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility increases the"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest in the context of unstable angina earlier today. He is currently intubated and undergoing cooling on the Arctic Sun protocol, with the re-warming process beginning. The patient has a history of very little known active medical issues since he does not receive regular medical care. The plan for the patient will ultimately be dictated by the family's goals of care.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/85 mmHg to 182/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube ventilation. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F) and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is not documented.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is obese, intubated, and dusky. His pupils are pinpoint and unreactive, with conjunctiva that is pink.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest in the context of unstable angina earlier today. He is currently intubated and has undergone cooling on the Arctic sun protocol, with the re-warming process beginning. There are no signs of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient does not receive regular medical care, and the plan will be determined by the family's goals of care.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
- Heart rate: 57 bpm
- Blood pressure: 165/85 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 98%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's lab results show:
- White blood cell count: 11.3 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 40.0%
- Platelet count: 220 K/uL
- Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
- Troponin T: 0.51 ng/mL
- Blood glucose: 114 mg/dL

The patient has several medical complications, including:
1. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest with documented asystole versus ventricular fibrillation, requiring two shocks and lidocaine. This occurred in the setting of earlier chest pain, but there were no signs of STEMI. Enzym"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 68yo M s/p cardiac arrest in context of unstable
   angina earlier today, now intubated, s/p cooling on arctic sun protocol
   and beginning re-warming process. No signs STEMI. Very little known
   about active medical issues and history since he does not rec. regular
   medical care. Pt plan will ultimately be dictated by family
s goals of
   care.
   .
   #. S/p Arrest:  Pt non-reponsive. Cold caloric negative indicating no
   brainstem reflex.  Pt completed cool protocol.  Cardiac arrest consult
   following.  With documented Asystole vs VFib, requiring 2 shocks and
   lidocaine, Occurred in setting of earlier CP. No signs of ST elevation
   MI. Suspect [**1-24**] infarction. Enzymes trending down with CK 609 -> 300,
   MB 82 -> 57.  ECHO showed global hypokinesis.
   - f/u cardiac arrest consult recs
             - f/u eeg, goal pCO2 35-40, avoid high sugars, HOB greater
   than 30 degrees, avoid fever
   - Con
t ASA, Plavix, BB (Metoprolol 5mg with hold parameters), Statin
   - d/c Heparin gtt
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u neuro regarding prognosis (possible repeat CT)
   - plan for family meeting, will get SW and Palliative Care consults,
   likely tomorrow
   #. Respiratory arrest ABG 7.3/47/101/24, RR increased to 20. Goal to
   maintain pCO2 35-40. New ABG 7.35/40/104/23.  CXR suggestive of BL
   aspiration in context of multiple intubation attempts.
   - Con't vent with goal pC02 35-40
   - Weaning sedation
   - Daily CXR
   - concern for aspiration given fevers overnight consider levaquin for
   coverage if worsens
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Pt Cr increased to 2.6 with poor UOP. FeUrea 29
   consistent with pre-renal. Also could represent ATN in the setting of
   cardiac arrest. Pt received 1L bolus with minimal improvement in UOP.
   -          cont to trend Cr
   -          avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   -          bolus with IVF prn
   -          consider renal consult if continues to worsen
   -          further management will be dependent on goals of care
   discussion
   .
   #. UTI: Pt with mildly positive UA w\ith [**6-1**] WBC and mod bacteria.  If
   patient worsens or becomes febrile will treat with empiric levaquin for
   aspiration pna, which will also cover for UTI
   -          f/u cx
   -          repeat UA
   #. HTN: Improved and also hypotensive to 80
s this AM. Responded to
   500cc bolus and d/c sedation. Captopril 6.25 mg PO TID and metoprolol..
   -Con
t Captopril and Metoprolol with holding parameters as written.
   - cont to monitor off sedation
   .
   FEN:  Increased residuals and TF on hold.  Will obtain KUB
   ACCESS: 3 PIV's, A line insterted [**5-23**]
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with on heparin
   -Bowel regimen with Senna/Colace PRN
   CODE: Presumed full. Will need neurology to weigh in on prognosis and
   then plan for goals of care meeting with patient
s family.
   DISPO: CCU for now
