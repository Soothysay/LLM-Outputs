   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE to eval EF on [**11-1**]
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - hold lidocaine ggt; if goes back in VF then amiodarone, since no
   ischemic disease.
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - EEG and neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated.
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.
   - treating with HCO3 bolus to prevent acidosis induced VF.
   - continue IVF support, insulin drip, lyte replete.
   - q1h glucose check, with ABG's to see if he is responding to
   treatment.
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation in am as tolerated
   - emperically coverage with zosyn.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest.
- He experienced VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. The most likely etiology is primary arrhythmogenic arrest.
- Possible differential diagnoses include ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis, and long QT syndrome.
- The patient has a history of ventricular arrhythmia.
- Neurologic compromise is suspected due to anoxic injury from the cardiac arrest. The patient is currently on a cooling protocol.
- An EEG and neurology consultation have been requested.
- Hypotension was initially present during VF, suggesting cardiogenic shock. This could be related to an artifactual line or a cardiogenic process.
- Metabolic acidosis is likely due to tissue ischemia. The patient has elevated lactate levels and a combined metabolic acidosis with an anion gap.
- Respiratory arrest is believed to be a consequence of VF arrest. The patient is intubated and sedated. A chest X-ray showed mild hilar fullness but no signs of pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic dysfunction.
- The patient's leukocytosis is likely attributed to the arrest rather than pneumonia.
- An ABG indicates respiratory alkalosis.
- The patient is receiving empiric coverage with Zosyn for aspiration pneumonia.

   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated, currently only on
   levophed
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest, most likely due to a primary arrhythmogenic arrest. He had episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and asystole during the arrest. The etiology of the arrest is unclear, but it could be related to ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis, or long QT syndrome.

The patient has shown signs of neurological compromise, likely due to anoxic injury from the cardiac arrest. He is currently undergoing cooling protocol and will have an EEG and neurology consultation. His coagulation and electrolyte levels will be monitored while he is cooled.

The patient's hypotension initially suggested cardiogenic shock, but it may have been artifactual due to a line. His cardiac index is elevated at 6.3 L/min/m2, indicating increased cardiac output. He is on a pressor called levophed and will be weaned off it as tolerated.

The patient also has metabolic acidosis, likely caused by tissue ischemia and lactate accumulation. This is further complicated by hyperglycemic episodes throughout the night. The non-anion gap component of the acidosis is of unclear etiology, but could be due to a dilutional effect or respiratory alkalosis. The patient received an experimental medication that may have contributed to the hyperglycemia.

The patient has respiratory arrest, which is a likely consequence of the VF"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.  Unclear etiology ? if
   metabolic related (ie. Hyperthyroidism) vs infection
   (pulmonary/intra-abdominal)
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE to eval EF on [**11-1**]
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - hold lidocaine ggt; if goes back in VF then amiodarone, since no
   ischemic disease.
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated after warming
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated, currently only on
   levophed
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.
   - treating with HCO3 bolus to prevent acidosis induced VF.
   - continue IVF support, insulin drip (pending warming), lyte replete.
   - q1h glucose check, with ABG's to see if he is responding to
   treatment.
   - serial ABG check q6h.
   - q6h lytes
   - consider RTA work-up given non-gap acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation after warming as tolerated
   - emperically coverage with zosyn, d1 [**10-31**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest. The arrest was characterized by episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), and asystole. The most likely etiology of the cardiac arrest is primary arrhythmogenic arrest, with other possible causes including ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis, and long QT syndrome. The patient has a history of ventricular arrhythmia.

The patient is currently in the ICU, intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. He is being treated for hypotension, metabolic acidosis, and respiratory compromise. The metabolic acidosis is likely due to tissue ischemia and is being treated with bicarbonate infusions. The respiratory compromise is a result of the cardiac arrest, and the patient is being monitored closely for oxygen saturation and arterial blood gas levels.

The patient's neurological status is also a concern, with evidence of global cerebral edema on a CT scan, likely as a result of anoxic injury. The patient is being cooled as part of a cooling protocol and will undergo continuous EEG monitoring for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation.

Other notable findings include leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and evidence of renal dysfunction. The patient has undergone several procedures, including arterial line placement, sheath placement, and central venous line placement. He is receiving prophylactic medications for stress ulcers"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.  Unclear etiology ? if
   metabolic related (ie. Hyperthyroidism) vs infection
   (pulmonary/intra-abdominal)
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE to eval EF on [**11-1**]
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - hold lidocaine ggt; if goes back in VF then amiodarone, since no
   ischemic disease.
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated after warming
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated, currently only on
   levophed
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.
   - treating with HCO3 bolus to prevent acidosis induced VF.
   - continue IVF support, insulin drip (pending warming), lyte replete.
   - q1h glucose check, with ABG's to see if he is responding to
   treatment.
   - serial ABG check q6h.
   - q6h lytes
   - consider RTA work-up given non-gap acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation after warming as tolerated
   - emperically coverage with zosyn, d1 [**10-31**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with cardiac arrest. He experienced episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and asystole. The most likely etiology is primary arrhythmogenic arrest, with other possible causes including ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis, and long QT syndrome. The patient has a history of ventricular arrhythmia. 

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a likely respiratory arrest due to the VF arrest. He is being treated for hypotension, metabolic acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. His condition is complicated by global cerebral edema and anoxic brain injury, as shown by a CT head. 

The patient has leukocytosis and mild bilateral dependent consolidations on a CT chest, which may indicate atelectasis or aspiration. He also has an axial hiatal hernia, trace ascites, and duodenitis. 

His arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates a combined metabolic acidosis with an anion gap (AG) and non-AG component. The AG is due to lactate hypoperfusion, while the non-AG component could be due to a dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis, although renal tubular acidosis (RTA) etiology cannot be ruled out. 

The patient's electrolytes show hyperglycemia, likely from tissue ischemia and hyperglycemic episodes throughout the night. His serum potassium is slightly low, and magnesium is within normal range. 

The patient has a history of ventricular arrhythmia and is currently on a cooling protocol for neurologic compromise. He is also being treated for possible sepsis with empiric coverage using Zosyn.

The patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with a cardiac arrest, most likely caused by a primary arrhythmogenic event. The possible etiologies include ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis, and long QT syndrome. The patient had a history of a stress test showing a run of polymorphic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showing an ejection fraction of 30-35% with dilation and global hypokinesis. These findings suggest an acute process causing heart failure.

The patient's neurological status is compromised, with concerns for anoxic injury due to the cardiac arrest. He is being treated with the Arctic Sun protocol to rewarm his body temperature. Continuous EEG monitoring has been initiated, and a neurology consultation will be obtained.

The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, initially in the setting of VF and suggesting cardiogenic shock. However, worsening hypotension may have been artifactual, related to a line. The patient is no longer on pressors.

The patient also has metabolic acidosis, likely initially from tissue ischemia. Lactate was elevated, and there was an anion gap (AG) of 18 with delta-delta of 6-9 (0.5), indicating a combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG). The AG was due to lactate hypoperfusion"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.  Unclear etiology ? if
   metabolic related (ie. Hyperthyroidism) vs infection
   (pulmonary/intra-abdominal)
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE EF 30-35 Moderate to severe moderate to severe global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %). The right ventricular cavity
   is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. - monitor CBC, CMP
   - After AM VF, patient was started on Amiodarone drip
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated after warming
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated, currently only on
   levophed
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.
   - treating with HCO3 bolus to prevent acidosis induced VF.
   - continue IVF support, insulin drip (pending warming), lyte replete.
   - q1h glucose check, with ABG's to see if he is responding to
   treatment.
   - serial ABG check q6h.
   - q6h lytes
   - consider RTA work-up given non-gap acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation after warming as tolerated
   - emperically coverage with zosyn, d1 [**10-31**]

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest. The most likely etiology of his cardiac arrest is primary arrhythmogenic arrest, although other possible causes such as ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis, and long QT syndrome are also considered. The patient has a history of ventricular arrhythmia.

The patient's neurological status is compromised, and there is concern for anoxic injury due to the cardiac arrest. He is currently being cooled as part of the cooling protocol and will undergo continuous EEG monitoring with reflex neurology consultation. Sedation will be weaned as tolerated after warming.

The patient's blood pressure is initially low, suggesting cardiogenic shock. This could be related to a line or an artifact. The pressor (dopa/levo) will be weaned down as tolerated, currently only on levophed, and consideration will be given to changing to Neo since it has less B1 ionotropic effect.

The patient also has metabolic acidosis, which is likely due to tissue ischemia and elevated lactate levels. The anion gap (AG) is 18 with delta-delta of 6-9 (0.5), indicating a combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG). The AG is due to lactate hypoperfusion that is complicated by hyperglycemic episodes throughout the night. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, possibly dilutional effect"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest. The most likely etiology of the cardiac arrest is primary arrhythmogenic arrest, with other possible causes including ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis, and long QT syndrome.

The patient has a history of ventricular arrhythmia, and further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause, such as obtaining primary care physician records and conducting tests like a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The TTE showed moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with an LVEF of 30-35%.

The patient also experienced neurologic compromise due to anoxic injury during the cardiac arrest. Continuous EEG monitoring was initiated, and the patient is currently on a cooling protocol. Sedation should be weaned as tolerated after warming, and follow-up with neurology is recommended.

Hypotension was initially present during the VF episode, suggesting cardiogenic shock. This could be related to a line tracing from the femoral sheath. The patient is no longer on pressors, but consideration should be given to changing to Neo due to its less B1 ionotropic effect.

Metabolic acidosis is likely due to tissue ischemia, with elevated lactate levels. The anion gap (AG) is 18, indicating a combined metabolic acidosis (AG and"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.  Unclear etiology ? if
   metabolic related (ie. Hyperthyroidism) vs infection
   (pulmonary/intra-abdominal)
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE to eval EF on [**11-1**]
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - After AM VF, patient was started on Amiodarone drip
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated after warming
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated, currently only on
   levophed
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.
   - treating with HCO3 bolus to prevent acidosis induced VF.
   - continue IVF support, insulin drip (pending warming), lyte replete.
   - q1h glucose check, with ABG's to see if he is responding to
   treatment.
   - serial ABG check q6h.
   - q6h lytes
   - consider RTA work-up given non-gap acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation after warming as tolerated
   - emperically coverage with zosyn, d1 [**10-31**]

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with cardiac arrest, specifically ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest with episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and asystole. The most likely etiology of the cardiac arrest is primary arrhythmogenic arrest, although other possibilities such as ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis, or long QT syndrome should also be considered.

The patient has a history of ventricular arrhythmia according to cardiology records. The patient's current condition includes neurologic compromise, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, and respiratory arrest. 

The neurologic compromise is a concern for anoxic injury due to the cardiac arrest. The patient is currently undergoing a cooling protocol and continuous EEG monitoring with reflex neurology consultation. Coagulation and electrolyte levels will be monitored while cooled, and the arctic sun treatment protocol will be followed. Sedation will be weaned as tolerated after warming.

Hypotension was initially observed during VF, suggesting cardiogenic shock. The worsening hypotension may have been artifactual or related to a line. The central venous pressure (CVP) during catheterization and a line tracing from the femoral sheath support this. 

Metabolic acidosis is likely due to tissue ischemia, with elevated lactate levels. Anion gap (AG) is due to lactate hypoperfusion that is complicated by hyperglycemic episodes throughout the night."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - @1530 neuro noted that patient had lost corneal reflexes, which he
   had had in the morning
   - @1630 CT scan head showed significantly increased brain edema
   worrisome for impending herniation.  Per Neuro, prognosis is very
   grave; no emergent management (i.e. mannitol, hyperventilation)
   warranted.
   - family informed, NEOB informed, they will come by around 9AM [**11-3**]
   - spoke to patient's cardiologist.  Apparently, he had been referred
   from PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) **] on stress test (unclear why this was performed).  Pt
   was started on BB and cathed, which was clean with normal V-gram.  Plan
   was to f/u in 1 yr for repeat stress but patient was lost to f/u.
   - @0100 pt became hypertensive to SBP 190s for several minutes and then
   relatively quickly MAPs dropped to low 60s - high 50s.  Pressors
   started.  Pt noted to have low tidal volumes on PS, switched to AC.
   - @0200 pupils noted to dilated bilaterally (midline positioning)
   - initial concern for brain death, however it was then noted that
   patient was overbreathing ventilator, after which no further effort to
   pursue brain death protocol overnight
   - family agreed to make patient DNR; additionally, they would like no
   further escalation of care, but do not wish to withdraw care at this
   time

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o stress test in which a 4 beat run of polymoprhic
   NSVT was observed.  TTE notes EF 30-35% with dilation and global
   hypokinesis.  As patient had normal cardiac function per OSH
   cardiologist
s records as of several years ago, this may suggest an
   acute process causing heart failure in this patient.
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - d/c
d amiodarone due to prolonged PR.
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest.  On Arctic Sun protocol, now warmed to 98.6 since 9pm
   yesterday.  Over-breathing the vent, no pupil light reflex.  Off
   sedation.  Patient has lost corneal reflexes and now has dilated
   midline pupils bilaterally, indicative of very poor prognosis.  CT head
   showed aggressively worsened brain edema worrisome for impending
   herniation.  Per Neurology, no indication for mannitol/hyperventilation
   given catastrophic area of injury.
   - f/u neurology recs
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - DNR, no escalation of care, now on dopa only.
   - organ bank discussion
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely initially from tissue ischemia.
   - currently on insulin gtt
   - monitor
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated on AC.  Patient has been noted to be overbreathing the vent
   at this time.
   - monitor O2 sats and ABG prn
   - continue to monitor overbreathing; if patient suddenly stops, concern
   for brain death
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - d/ced zosyn given no strong clinical signs of PNA at this time

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with cardiac arrest, likely due to primary arrhythmogenic arrest. He had a history of stress test showing NSVT and a TTE indicating EF 30-35% with dilation and global hypokinesis, suggesting an acute process causing heart failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on assisted ventilation. Neurologic compromise is evident with lost corneal reflexes and dilated midline pupils, indicating poor prognosis. A CT scan revealed worsened brain edema worrisome for impending herniation. The patient's blood pressure has fluctuated, and there is concern for cardiogenic shock. Metabolic acidosis is present, likely from tissue ischemia. The patient's respiratory arrest is likely a consequence of VF arrest, and he is currently on AC ventilation. The family has agreed to make the patient DNR and does not wish to withdraw care at this time. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impending herniation due to aggressive brain edema.
2. Cardiogenic shock secondary to primary arrhythmogenic arrest.
3. Metabolic acidosis from tissue ischemia.
4. Respiratory failure due to VF arrest.
5. Brain death due to severe neurologic compromise."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest. The most likely etiology of the arrest is primary arrhythmogenic arrest, with other possible causes including ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis, and long QT syndrome. The patient had a history of a stress test that showed a run of polymorphic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30-35% with dilation and global hypokinesis, suggesting an acute process causing heart failure in this patient.

The patient's neurological condition has significantly deteriorated, with loss of corneal reflexes and dilated midline pupils bilaterally. A CT scan of the head showed aggressively worsened brain edema worrisome for impending herniation. Neurology does not recommend mannitol/hyperventilation due to the catastrophic area of injury.

The patient's blood pressure initially dropped in the setting of VF, suggesting cardiogenic shock. However, worsening hypotension may have been artifactual, related to a line. The central venous pressure (CVP) during catheterization and a line tracing from the femoral sheath support this.

Metabolic acidosis is likely initially from tissue ischemia. The patient is currently on insulin gtt and being monitored.

The patient's respiratory arrest is"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o stress test in which a 4 beat run of polymoprhic
   NSVT was observed.  TTE notes EF 30-35% with dilation and global
   hypokinesis.  As patient had normal cardiac function per OSH
   cardiologist
s records as of several years ago, this may suggest an
   acute process causing heart failure in this patient.
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - d/c
d amiodarone given bradycardia with prolonged PR
   - DNR/DNI
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest.  On Arctic Sun protocol, now warmed to 98.6 since 9pm
   yesterday.
   -  Not brain dead given spontaneous respirations (would pass apnea
   test)
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - f/u neurology
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.   Very labile today
   - Monitor BP
   - no escalation of pressors, currently on dopamine.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely initially from tissue ischemia. Lactate
   was elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.  Currently improved with no continued evidence of gap
   acidosis.
   - cover with insulin sliding scale
   - d/c insulin gtt
   - monitor
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.
   - monitor O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis, trial pressure
   support
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - d/c zosyn given no strong clinical signs of PNA at this time

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient in the ICU. These include:

1. Impending herniation: The CT scan of the head showed significantly increased brain edema, which is worrisome for impending herniation. This is a neurological complication that requires immediate attention.

2. Brain death: The patient exhibited dilated pupils and was unresponsive, leading to initial concern for brain death. However, it was noted that the patient was overbreathing on the ventilator, and no further effort was made to pursue brain death protocol overnight.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of low blood pressure, which may indicate cardiogenic shock or an artifactual cause related to a line. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure is necessary.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient had an elevated lactate level, indicating tissue ischemia. There is also evidence of a combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG) with unclear etiology. Close monitoring and management of electrolytes and acid-base balance are essential.

5. Respiratory arrest: The patient likely suffered a respiratory arrest as a consequence of ventricular fibrillation arrest. The patient is currently intubated and sedated. Regular monitoring of oxygen saturation and arterial blood gases is required.

6. Potential pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the PE CT was negative, leukocytosis could still be attributed to the arrest and not necessarily indicative of pneumonia. Monitoring of"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o stress test in which a 4 beat run of polymoprhic
   NSVT was observed.  TTE notes EF 30-35% with dilation and global
   hypokinesis.  As patient had normal cardiac function per OSH
   cardiologist
s records as of several years ago, this may suggest an
   acute process causing heart failure in this patient.
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - d/c
d amiodarone due to prolonged PR.
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest.  On Arctic Sun protocol, now warmed to 98.6 since 9pm
   yesterday.  Over-breathing the vent, no pupil light reflex.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - f/u neurology rec
   - prognosis poor
 recent CT of head showed worsening edema
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - DNR, no excelation of care, now on dopa only.
   - organ bank discussion
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely initially from tissue ischemia. Lactate
   was elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.  Currently improved with no continued evidence of gap
   acidosis.
   - cover with insulin sliding scale
   - d/c insulin gtt
   - monitor
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.
   - monitor O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis, trial pressure
   support
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - d/c zosyn given no strong clinical signs of PNA at this time
   - I/O goal negative given about 7 L positive.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - @1530 neuro noted that patient had lost corneal reflexes, which he
   had had in the morning
   - @1630 CT scan head showed significantly increased brain edema
   worrisome for impending herniation.  Per Neuro, prognosis is very
   grave; no emergent management (i.e. mannitol, hyperventilation)
   warranted.
   - family informed, NEOB informed, they will come by around 9AM [**11-3**]
   - spoke to patient's cardiologist.  Apparently, he had been referred
   from PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) **] on stress test (unclear why this was performed).  Pt
   was started on BB and cathed, which was clean with normal V-gram.  Plan
   was to f/u in 1 yr for repeat stress but patient was lost to f/u.
   - @0100 pt became hypertensive to SBP 190s for several minutes and then
   relatively quickly MAPs dropped to low 60s - high 50s.  Pressors
   started.  Pt noted to have low tidal volumes on PS, switched to AC.
   - @0200 pupils noted to dilated bilaterally (midline positioning)
   - initial concern for brain death, however it was then noted that
   patient was overbreathing ventilator, after which no further effort to
   pursue brain death protocol overnight
   - family agreed to make patient DNR; additionally, they would like no
   further escalation of care, but do not wish to withdraw care at this
   time

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest. The likely etiology of the cardiac arrest is primary arrhythmogenic arrest, although other possible causes such as ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis, and long QT syndrome were also considered. The patient had a history of a stress test showing a run of polymorphic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 30-35% with dilation and global hypokinesis. 

The patient's neurologic status is concerning for anoxic injury due to the cardiac arrest. He is currently on the Arctic Sun warming protocol and will undergo continuous EEG monitoring with a reflex neurology consultation. Sedation will be weaned as tolerated, and he will be followed up with neurology.

The patient's hypotension initially suggested cardiogenic shock, but it may have been artifactual or related to a line. The patient is no longer on pressors, and his blood pressure should be monitored.

The patient also has metabolic acidosis, likely initially from tissue ischemia. Lactate levels were elevated, indicating hypoperfusion complicated by hyperglycemic episodes throughout the night. The acid-base gap is indicative of a combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG). The non-AG component could be due to a dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis or possibly renal tubular acidosis (RTA). The patient received an experimental dose of medication, which may have contributed to the hyperglycemia. He was also receiving HCO3 in D5W. The metabolic acidosis resembles diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), although he does not have a documented diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Currently, the patient's metabolic acidosis has improved, and there is no continued evidence of gap acidosis.

The patient's respiratory arrest is likely a consequence of the VF arrest. He is currently intubated and sedated. His chest X-ray shows mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam is inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed to the arrest and is less indicative of pneumonia (PNA). Although the pretest probability for pulmonary embolism (PE) is low, a CT scan was obtained in the emergency department and was negative. The most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) suggests metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.

Based on the above assessment, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Neurologic compromise: The patient's neurologic status is concerning for anoxic injury due to the cardiac arrest. Continuous EEG monitoring and reflex neurology consultation will be done to monitor his condition.
2. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension suggested cardiogenic shock, which may have been artifactual or related to a line. Close monitoring"
