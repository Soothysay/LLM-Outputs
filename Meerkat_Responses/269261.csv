   Assessment and Plan
   68 yom renal cell carcinoma --> metastatic (brain), s/p 2nd week of
   IL-2 completed and now with persistent hypotension and anuric renal
   failure.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to IL-2 (vasodilatory and 3rd spacing
   due to vasculare leak), although effect apprears somewhat protracted,
   and may be component of hypovolemia.  No evidence for cardiogenic
   etiology.   With concern for sepsis (with specific concerns including
   skin infection,LLL pneumonia, line-related infection), remains on
   Vanco, Cefopime, Levofloxicin.  Maintain MAP > 65 mmHg.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL infiltrate +/- atalectasis.  Check sputum.
   Monitor exam and CXR.
   DYSPNEA -- may in part be due to early pulmonary edema (3rd spacing),
   with contribution of acidosis (metabolic, renal failure).  Monitor RR,
   SaO2, provide supplimental oxygen.  Low threshold for intubation.
   ACIDOSIS -- attributed in part to renal failure.  HCO3 boluses as
   needed.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- multifactorial, attributed to IL-2, hypovolemia,
   possible ATN.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, UO, electrolytes.  Monitor
   closely for possible need for dailysis.  Renal ultrasound.
   FLUIDS -- intravascular hypovolemia.  Plan continue to replete, monitor
   CVP > 9 cm H2O.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- known brain mets.  Monitor exam.  Low
   threshold for head imaging (ex.CT).
   A-FIB -- rate controlled.
   SKIN RASH -- desquamation.  Attributed to IL-2.
   RENAL CELL CA -- metastatitc, now receiving IL-2 (last dose [**2124-3-3**]).
   Monitor exam, electrolytes.
   EOSINOPHILIA --  attributed in part to medications.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- remains NPO overnight.  Initiate clear liquids,

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma that has metastasized to the brain. He has completed the second week of IL-2 treatment and is currently experiencing persistent hypotension and anuric renal failure. 

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 95/52 mmHg, heart rate of 115 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, extensive erythema with desquamation over the upper torso, warm skin, and no jaundice. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, high potassium levels, slightly elevated creatinine, and decreased albumin. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, and electrolytes are also provided.

Assessment and plan include the following:
1. HYPOTENSION: The patient's persistent hypotension is attributed to IL-2 treatment, which causes vasodilation and third spacing due to vascular leak. There is no evidence of cardiogenic etiology, but sepsis is a concern. The patient remains on vancomycin, cefopime, and levofloxacin to cover potential infections. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg.
2. PULMONARY INFILTRATE: There is an LLL infiltrate, possibly due to atelectasis or pneumonia. The patient's sputum should be checked, and the exam and chest X-ray should be monitored.
3. DYSPNEA: The patient's dyspnea may be caused by early pulmonary edema, metabolic acidosis, or renal failure. Respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and supplemental oxygen should be monitored. Intubation should be considered at a low threshold.
4. ACIDOSIS: Metabolic acidosis is attributed to renal failure. HCO3 boluses may be given as needed to manage the acidosis.
5. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: The patient has multifactorial acute renal failure due to IL-2 treatment, hypovolemia, and possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal function should be closely monitored, and there may be a need for dialysis. A renal ultrasound should be performed.
6. FLUIDS: The patient has intravascular hypovolemia. Fluid repletion should continue, and central venous pressure (CVP) should be maintained above 9 cm H2O.
7. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to known brain metastases. Mental status should be monitored, and imaging such as a CT scan should be considered at a low threshold.
8. A-FIB: The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a controlled rate.
9. SKIN RASH: The patient has a desquamating skin rash attributed to IL-2 treatment.
10. RENAL CELL CA: The patient has metastatic renal cell carcinoma and has completed IL-2 treatment. Renal function and electrolytes should be monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include sepsis, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), further deterioration of renal function leading to end-stage renal disease or the need for dialysis, and complications related to atrial fibrillation."

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma and metastasis to the brain. He has completed the second week of IL-2 treatment and is currently experiencing persistent hypotension and anuric renal failure. The patient's condition is critical, and he remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be attributed to IL-2 therapy causing vasodilation and third spacing of fluids, as well as hypovolemia. There is concern for sepsis, and the patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Pulmonary Infiltrate: The patient has a left lower lobe infiltrate, which may be due to pneumonia or atelectasis. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory exam and chest X-ray is recommended.
3. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea may be caused by early pulmonary edema secondary to fluid retention and acidosis resulting from renal failure. Supplemental oxygen is being provided, and the patient is closely monitored for the need of intubation.
4. Acidosis: The patient's acidosis is attributed to renal failure. Boluses of bicarbonate may be required to correct the acidosis.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has multifactorial acute renal failure, including possible IL-2-induced nephrotoxicity, hypovolemia, and acute tubular nec"

   .
   #. Shock: hypotension in the setting of IL-2 therapy is common, though
   unusual for it to extend this far past the last dose; therefore,
   concern is for another cause for his hypotension.  Possible etiologies
   include distrubitive in setting of IL-2, infection (lung with LLL
   infiltrate, GU tract, GI tract, skin); less likely hypovolemic.  No
   evidence of obstructive, cardiogenic shock given TTE.  No evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency.  Antibiotic coverage includes health-care
   associated agents.  Fluid status appears total body overloaded, but may
   be intravascularly dry given FeNa 0.7.  Likely has large insensible
   losses through skin.  Lactate trending down.  Unable to place a-line

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) admitted to the ICU. He is currently experiencing acute renal failure, hypoxemia, shock, metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been receiving IL-2 infusion therapy for his RCC and is now presenting with these complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's hypotension could be due to distributive shock, possibly caused by IL-2 therapy, or another underlying cause such as infection. It is important to investigate further and consider broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): ARF is suspected in this case due to the patient's history of IL-2 infusion therapy, which can cause kidney damage. Other possible causes include prerenal or ischemic acute tubular necrosis. Monitoring of creatinine and electrolytes is necessary.
3. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, likely resulting from a combination of ARF and lactic acidosis. ABG analysis should be repeated, and lactate levels should be monitored.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to known metastatic disease in the brain or swelling caused by IL-2 therapy. A CT scan of the head is recommended, and steroids may be considered depending"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with acute renal failure, hypoxemia, and altered mental status. The patient has been unresponsive to fluid resuscitation and requires vasopressor support with phenylephrine and norepinephrine for blood pressure management. The patient is anuric, showing signs of uremia, and is expected to require continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) likely tomorrow. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and there are no signs of infection. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage. The patient's physical examination reveals scleral edema, crackles in the chest, distended abdomen, peripheral edema, and sloughing skin. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/38 mmHg to 132/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, electrolyte imbalances, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's echocardiogram reveals a mildly dilated ascending aorta and a small pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade. The patient is in shock, has acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, hypoxemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and hypotension. The patient is currently receiving ICU care with multi-lumen lines, prophylactic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prevention, as well as monitoring for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unknown. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive renal failure leading to further electrolyte imbalances and uremia.
2. Sepsis due to the presence of infection, which may worsen the patient's condition.
3. Cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias due to the patient's history of hypertension and the findings on the echocardiogram.
4. Pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's hypoxemia and respiratory rate abnormalities.
5. Coagulopathy and bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities.
6. Skin breakdown and infection at the site of impaired skin integrity.
7. Delirium or further deterioration in mental status.
8. Hypotension and shock state requiring ongoing vasopressor support.
9. Malnutrition and glycemic control issues due to the patient's inability to eat normally.
10. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and thrombocytopenia."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo male with RCC here 3 days s/p IL2 infusion with ongoing
   hypotension and renal failure.
   .
   #. Hypotension: hypotension in the setting of IL-2 therapy is common,
   though unusual for it to extend this far past the last dose; therefore,
   concern is for another cause for his hypotension.  SIRS/sepsis is
   possible, with most likely sources being skin (breakdown), pna (LLL
   infiltrate on CXR), urine (recently straight cathed).  Antibiotic
   coverage should include health-care associated agents.  Cardiogenic
   shock also in the differential with slightly lower voltage on EKG
   compared to previous.  Other causes of inflammation such as
   pancreatitis, though LFTs wnl.  Fluid status appears total body
   overloaded, but may be intravascularly dry.  Likely has large
   insensible losses through skin.
   - broaded antibiotics to vanc/levo/cefepime to cover above sources
   - check CVP and central venous sat --> CV sat 91
   - change dopa to levo and wean neo in favor of levo for MAP > 65
   - IVF for CVP 8-12, though total body overloaded and unknown EF so
   monitor resp status carefully when fluid repleting
   - check pulsus - 5
   - ECHO
   - check [**Doctor First Name **]/lipase
   - ABG/lactate
   .
   #. ARF: IL-2 mediated ARF most likely, however prerenal or postrenal
   etiology also possible.  K wnl, phos elevated though stable from last
   draw.
   - urine lytes
   - follow Cr and electrolytes
   - renal consult in AM
   .
   #. AGMA: likely from combination of ARF and hypotension, lactic
   acidosis.  ABG appears pure met acidosis with resp compromise.
   - ABG with lactate
   - bicarb if pH < 7.1
   .
   #. HA/MS changes: Known metastatic disease to brain and IL-2 can cause
   swelling.  He is AOx3, though slightly agitated.  Clinical picture not
   c/w meningitis/encephalitis and most likely toxic-metabolic.
   - if worsens, CT HEAD and ? indication for steroids
   - NO LP given intracranial masses
   .
   #. RCC: finished week 2 of IL-2.  Side effects of IL-2 include
   myocarditis, ectopy, neurotoxicity, tyrombcytopenia, hypocalcemia, and
   hyperbilirubinemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo male with RCC here 3 days s/p IL2 infusion with shock, renal
   failure, and altered mental status.
   .
   #. Shock: hypotension in the setting of IL-2 therapy is common, though
   unusual for it to extend this far past the last dose; therefore,
   concern is for another cause for his hypotension.  Possible etiologies
   include distrubitive in setting of IL-2, infection (lung with LLL
   infiltrate, GU tract, GI tract, skin); less likely hypovolemic.  No
   evidence of obstructive, cardiogenic shock given TTE.  No evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency.  Antibiotic coverage includes health-care
   associated agents.  Fluid status appears total body overloaded, but may
   be intravascularly dry given FeNa 0.7.  Likely has large insensible
   losses through skin.  Lactate trending down.  Unable to place a-line
   overnight [**3-14**] agitation.
   - broaded antibiotics to vanc/levo/cefepime to cover above sources ->
   will obtain cefepime ID approval; check random trough for vanc and dose
   by level given renal failure
   - cont levo and neo, wean neo for MAP > 65
   - goal CVP 10-12, bolus with NS and D5 W with 3 amps of bicarb
   - will obtain CT head and torso to eval for abscess/intra-abdominal
   source of infection
   .
   #. ARF: IL-2 mediated ARF most likely, however prerenal or ischemic ATN
   also possible.  K wnl, phos elevated though stable from last draw.  No
   evidence of obstruction in right collecting system on renal
   ultrasound.   FeNa 0.7.  Does show some UOP response to IVF boluses.
   - follow Cr and electrolytes Q8
   - follow up Renal recs, appreciate input
   - no emergent indication for renal replacement therapy at this time
   - trend lactate
   .
   #. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: likely from combination of ARF and
   hypotension, lactic acidosis.  ABG appears pure met acidosis with resp
   compromise.
   - repeat ABG, trend lactate
   - lytes as above
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status: Known metastatic disease to brain and IL-2
   can cause swelling.  He is AOx3, though slightly agitated.  Clinical
   picture not c/w meningitis/encephalitis and most likely
   toxic-metabolic.  Patient has signs of uremia on exam.
   - will obtain CT head today, ? need for steroids
   - NO LP given intracranial masses
   .
   #. RCC: finished week 2 of IL-2.  Side effects of IL-2 include
   myocarditis, ectopy, neurotoxicity, tyrombcytopenia, hypocalcemia, and

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are acute renal failure and hypoxemia. The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who was admitted to the ICU after receiving IL-2 infusion therapy.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate of 115 bpm) and hypotension (blood pressure ranging from 85/38 mmHg to 132/102 mmHg). The patient is also experiencing respiratory distress, as indicated by crackles in the anterior chest and a requirement for supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. The patient's mental status is altered, and he is not following commands.

The patient has a Foley catheter in place, indicating urinary catheterization. There is no mention of any other lines or tubes.

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels (6.8-7.0 mg/dL), indicating renal dysfunction. The patient also has metabolic acidosis (pH 7.21) and hypernatremia (sodium level of 147 mEq/L). Other lab abnormalities include thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 81 K/uL), elevated lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes.

Imaging studies reveal a mildly dilated ascending aorta and a small pericardial effusion, but no signs of tamponade or significant structural heart abnormalities.

The patient's condition requires continuous monitoring, and several"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yom renal cell carcinoma --> metastatic (brain), s/p 2nd week of
   IL-2 completed and now with persistent hypotension and anuric renal
   failure.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to IL-2 (vasodilatory and 3rd spacing
   due to vasculare leak), although effect apprears somewhat protracted,
   and may be component of hypovolemia.  No evidence for cardiogenic
   etiology.   With concern for sepsis (with specific concerns including
   skin infection,LLL pneumonia, line-related infection), remains on
   Vanco, Cefopime, Levofloxicin.  Maintain MAP > 65 mmHg.  Vasopressor as
   needed.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL infiltrate +/- atalectasis.  Check sputum.
   Monitor exam and CXR.
   DYSPNEA -- may in part be due to early pulmonary edema (3rd spacing),
   with contribution of acidosis (metabolic, renal failure).  Monitor RR,
   SaO2, provide supplimental oxygen.  Low threshold for intubation.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- multifactorial, including uremia, medications
   (benzodiazepines), evolving hypernatremia, reversal of sleep-wake
   cycle.  Also concerned about increased intracranial edema with known
   renal cell mets and now positive fluid balance, and also
   thrombocytopenia.  Plan head CT (non contrast).
   ACIDOSIS -- attributed in part to renal failure.  HCO3 boluses as
   needed.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- multifactorial, attributed to IL-2, hypovolemia,
   possible ATN, single kidney.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, UO,
   electrolytes.  Monitor closely for possible need for dailysis.  Renal
   ultrasound.  Increase in urine output since midnight may herald
   recovery phase.  Maintain intravascular repletion.
   FLUIDS -- intravascular hypovolemia.  Plan continue to replete, monitor
   CVP > 9 cm H2O.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 increased insensible losses.  Provide free H2O.
   Monitor Na+
   A-FIB -- rate controlled.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 attributed to medications, but concern for HIT (>50%
   decline).
   INR
 elevated.  Plan FFP, monitor INR.
   SKIN RASH -- desquamation.  Attributed to IL-2.
   RENAL CELL CA -- metastatitc, now receiving IL-2 (last dose [**2124-3-3**]).
   Monitor exam, electrolytes.
   EOSINOPHILIA --  attributed in part to medications.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- remains NPO overnight.  Initiate clear liquids,
   advance as tolerated, dependent on nausea.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma that has metastasized to the brain. He completed the second week of IL-2 therapy and is now experiencing persistent hypotension and anuric renal failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be attributed to IL-2 therapy, which can cause vasodilation and third spacing of fluids. There is also concern for sepsis, specifically infections such as skin infection or line-related infection, as the patient remains on vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin.

2. Pulmonary infiltrate: The patient has an LLL infiltrate, which could be due to pneumonia or atelectasis. Monitoring the sputum production and performing a chest X-ray would be important for further evaluation.

3. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea may be caused by early pulmonary edema due to third spacing of fluids, metabolic acidosis resulting from renal failure, or a combination of both. Continuous monitoring of respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and providing supplemental oxygen are necessary. Intubation should be considered at a low threshold.

4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be multifactorial, including uremia, medication effects (benzodiazepines), evolving hypernatremia, reversal of the"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yom renal cell carcinoma --> metastatic (brain), s/p 2nd week of
   IL-2 completed and now with persistent hypotension and anuric renal
   failure.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to IL-2 (vasodilatory and 3rd spacing
   due to vasculare leak), although effect apprears somewhat protracted,
   and may be component of hypovolemia.  No evidence for cardiogenic
   etiology.   With concern for sepsis (with specific concerns including
   skin infection,LLL pneumonia, line-related infection), remains on
   Vanco, Cefopime, Levofloxicin.  Maintain MAP > 65 mmHg.  Vasopressor as
   needed.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL infiltrate +/- atalectasis.  Check sputum.
   Monitor exam and CXR.
   DYSPNEA -- may in part be due to early pulmonary edema (3rd spacing),
   with contribution of acidosis (metabolic, renal failure).  Monitor RR,
   SaO2, provide supplimental oxygen.  Low threshold for intubation.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- multifactorial, including uremia, medications
   (benzodiazepines), evolving hypernatremia, reversal of sleep-wake
   cycle.  Also concerned about increased intracranial edema with known
   renal cell mets and now positive fluid balance, and also
   thrombocytopenia.  Plan head CT (non contrast).
   ACIDOSIS -- attributed in part to renal failure.  HCO3 boluses as
   needed.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- multifactorial, attributed to IL-2, hypovolemia,
   possible ATN, single kidney.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, UO,
   electrolytes.  Monitor closely for possible need for dailysis.  Renal
   ultrasound.  Increase in urine output since midnight may herald
   recovery phase.  Maintain intravascular repletion.
   FLUIDS -- intravascular hypovolemia.  Plan continue to replete, monitor
   CVP > 9 cm H2O.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 increased insensible losses.  Provide free H2O.
   Monitor Na+
   A-FIB -- rate controlled.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 attributed to medications, but concern for HIT (>50%
   decline).
   INR
 elevated.  Plan FFP, monitor INR.
   SKIN RASH -- desquamation.  Attributed to IL-2.
   RENAL CELL CA -- metastatitc, now receiving IL-2 (last dose [**2124-3-3**]).
   Monitor exam, electrolytes.
   EOSINOPHILIA --  attributed in part to medications.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- remains NPO overnight.  Initiate clear liquids,
   advance as tolerated, dependent on nausea.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma that has metastasized to the brain. He has completed the second week of IL-2 treatment and is now experiencing persistent hypotension and anuric renal failure. The patient's hypotension is attributed to IL-2, which causes vasodilation and third spacing due to vascular leak. There is no evidence of cardiogenic etiology, but there are concerns for sepsis, including skin infection, left lower lobe pneumonia, and line-related infection. The patient remains on vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg, with vasopressor use as needed.

The patient also has pulmonary infiltrate in the left lower lobe, possibly due to atelectasis or pneumonia. The sputum should be checked, and the exam and chest X-ray should be monitored. The patient's dyspnea may be caused by early pulmonary edema, metabolic acidosis, and renal failure. The respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation (SaO2), and supplemental oxygen should be monitored closely, with a low threshold for intubation.

The patient's altered mental status is multifactorial, including uremia, medications (benzodiazepines), evolving hypernatremia, reversal of the sleep-wake cycle, increased intracranial edema from known renal cell"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock: The patient is in shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by inadequate blood flow to meet the body's needs. It can be caused by various factors such as hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction, or sepsis.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is also diagnosed with acute renal failure, which means their kidneys are not functioning properly. This can lead to a buildup of waste products and fluid imbalance in the body.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has worsening acidosis, indicating an imbalance in the body's acid-base levels. Metabolic acidosis can be caused by various conditions like kidney failure, diabetic ketoacidosis, or severe lactic acidosis.

4. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient has hypernatremia, which means there is an excess amount of sodium in the blood. This can result from dehydration, excessive sodium intake, or impaired water balance.

5. Hypoxemia: The patient has low levels of oxygen in the blood, indicating inadequate oxygenation. This can be caused by respiratory issues, cardiac problems, or other factors affecting oxygen delivery to the tissues.

6. Thrombocytopenia, Acute: The patient has a low platelet count, leading to increased bleeding and clotting risks. Thrombocytopenia can be"

   .
   #. Shock: hypotension in the setting of IL-2 therapy is common, though
   unusual for it to extend this far past the last dose; therefore,
   concern is for another cause for his hypotension.  Possible etiologies
   include distrubitive in setting of IL-2, infection (lung with LLL
   infiltrate, GU tract, GI tract, skin); less likely hypovolemic.  No
   evidence of obstructive, cardiogenic shock given TTE.  No evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency.  Antibiotic coverage includes health-care
   associated agents.  Fluid status appears total body overloaded, but may
   be intravascularly dry given FeNa 0.7.  Likely has large insensible
   losses through skin.  Lactate trending down.  Unable to place a-line

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) admitted to the ICU three days ago after receiving an infusion of IL2 therapy. He presented with shock, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine for hypotension. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 132 bpm, blood pressure of 86/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's hypotension in the setting of IL2 therapy raises concern for another cause of hypotension, such as distributive shock. Infection is a possible etiology, including lung, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, or skin infections. The patient has an infiltrate in the left lower lobe of the lung, which may indicate pneumonia. Additionally, the presence of gram-negative rods in the urine culture suggests a possible urinary tract infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started to cover these potential sources of infection.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate ARF. The cause of ARF could be IL2-mediated, prerenal, or ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There is no evidence of"

   #  A. fib with RVR-  likely [**3-14**] volume overload and atrial stretch.
   Other factors to consider include myocardial ischmemia.  Underlying
   sepsis also likely contributing.  Patient received to attempts at DC
   cardioversion, 100 and 150 joules, which were successful and converted
   patient back into NSR, with improving blood pressure.  Patient
   unfortunately converted back into a. fib with RVR within seconds.  Amio
   bolus and drip started.
   -  cont amio gtt
   -  rule out ischemia with two sets of markers
   -  repeat TTE for new WMAs, possible worsening of effusion, evidence of
   endocarditis
   #. Shock: hypotension in the setting of IL-2 therapy is common, though
   unusual for it to extend this far past the last dose; therefore,
   concern is for another cause for his hypotension.  Possible etiologies
   include distrubitive in setting of IL-2, infection (lung with LLL
   infiltrate, GU tract, GI tract, skin); less likely hypovolemic.  No
   evidence of obstructive, cardiogenic shock given TTE.  No evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency.  Antibiotic coverage includes health-care
   associated agents.  Fluid status appears total body overloaded, but may
   be intravascularly dry given FeNa 0.7.  Likely has large insensible
   losses through skin.  Lactate trending down.  Unable to place a-line

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma who was admitted to the ICU three days ago following an infusion of IL-2 therapy. The patient presented with shock, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, hypernatremia, metabolic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy.

Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (a.fib with RVR): The patient's initial ECG showed a.fib with RVR. Cardioversion attempts were made but unfortunately, the patient converted back into a.fib with RVR within seconds. Amiodarone bolus and drip were started.

2. Shock: The patient's hypotension is concerning, especially considering the IL-2 therapy. Possible etiologies include distributive shock, septic shock, or hypovolemic shock.

   #  A. fib with RVR-  likely [**3-14**] volume overload and atrial stretch.
   Other factors to consider include myocardial ischmemia.  Underlying
   sepsis also likely contributing.  Patient received to attempts at DC
   cardioversion, 100 and 150 joules, which were successful and converted
   patient back into NSR, with improving blood pressure.  Patient
   unfortunately converted back into a. fib with RVR within seconds.  Amio
   bolus and drip started.
   -  cont amio gtt
   -  rule out ischemia with two sets of markers
   -  repeat TTE for new WMAs, possible worsening of effusion, evidence of
   endocarditis
   -  will need to consider anti-coagulation in future if chemical
   cardioversion unsuccessful
   - cont levo and neo as needed for  MAP > 65
   #. Shock: hypotension in the setting of IL-2 therapy is common, though
   unusual for it to extend this far past the last dose; therefore,
   concern is for another cause for his hypotension.  Possible etiologies
   include distrubitive in setting of IL-2, septic/nfection (lung with LLL
   infiltrate, GU tract, GI tract, skin); less likely hypovolemic.  No
   evidence of obstructive, cardiogenic shock given TTE.  No evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency.  Antibiotic coverage includes health-care
   associated agents.  Fluid status is total body overloaded, but may be
   intravascularly dry given FeNa 0.7.  Likely has large insensible losses
   through skin.  Lactate trending down.  Given GPC bacteremia, skin,
   line, and endocarditis are possible sources.  A-line placed today.
   Given thrombocytopenia and possible HIT Ab, thromboembolic dz is on
   differential.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented to the ICU three days after receiving IL-2 infusion. He is experiencing shock, acute renal failure, altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, hypoxemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient has been diagnosed with AFib with RVR, which is likely due to volume overload and atrial stretch. Myocardial ischemia and underlying sepsis may also contribute to this condition. Cardioversion attempts were unsuccessful initially but successful later on. Amiodarone has been started.

2. Ischemic Stroke: Given the patient's altered mental status and known metastatic disease to the brain, there is a concern for an ischemic stroke. A CT head has been ordered to rule out any new changes.

3. Infection: The patient has evidence of infection, including a lung infiltrate and positive gram-negative rod bacteria in the urine culture. Antibiotic coverage has been initiated, including healthcare-associated agents. Further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute kidney injury. IL-2 therapy, pre-renal factors, ischemic ATN"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yom renal cell carcinoma --> metastatic (brain), s/p 2nd week of
   IL-2 completed and now with persistent hypotension and anuric renal
   failure, and now A-fibrillation.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to IL-2 (vasodilatory and 3rd spacing
   due to vasculare leak), although effect apprears somewhat protracted,
   and may be component of hypovolemia.  A-fib likely contributing to
   hypotension.  No evidence for adrenal insufficiency.  Consider
   pulmonary embolism --> plan check LE NIVS, check cardiac echo to assess
   RV function .   With concern for sepsis (with specific concerns
   including skin infection,LLL pneumonia, line-related infection),
   remains on Vanco, Cefopime, Levofloxicin.  Maintain MAP > 65 mmHg.
   Vasopressor as needed.
   A-FIB -- Rapid rate this AM.  Predisposition is bilateral atrial
   enlargement.  Precipitant likely context of sepsis, bacteremia, IL-2
   syndrome ""cytokine storm.""  Doubt DC cardioversion effective in current
   context --> plan continue Amioderone.  Replete electrolytes.
   Anticoagulation would be desired --> need to discuss with primary team,
   as potential use of anticoagulation complicated and high risk  for
   bleeding.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Chest CT with evidence of diffuse, patchy,
   focal infiltrates, many peripheral.  [**Month (only) 51**] be atypical pattern for
   fluid/pulmonary edema.  Concerns for possible infection, and nodular
   infiltrates raise possibility of embolic events (right sided
   endocarditis) or fungal pneumonia.  Also consider pulmonary renal
   syndrome (ex. anti-GBM Ab, Wegener's).  Check sputum, serum b-glucan
   and galactomannan.  Monitor exam and CXR, consider bronchoscopy.
   SEPSIS -- attributed in part to IL-2, but now with evidence for
   infections (bacteremia, urine source), and concerns for possible lung
   infection.  Plan continue support.
   DYSPNEA -- may in part be due to early pulmonary edema (3rd spacing),
   with contribution of acidosis (metabolic, renal failure).  Monitor RR,
   SaO2, provide supplimental oxygen.  Continue mask ventilation.  Monitor
   ABG.  Low threshold for intubation.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- progressive.  Concerns include DIC, HIT, TTP and
   medication effect.  Monitor plts count.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- multifactorial, including uremia, medications
   (benzodiazepines), evolving hypernatremia, reversal of sleep-wake
   cycle.  Also concerned about increased intracranial edema with known
   renal cell mets and now positive fluid balance, and also
   thrombocytopenia.  No bleed on non-contrast head CT.  Plan to move to
   intubation to control airway.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC, possible line-related or skin-related.  Plan
   continue Vancomycin --> await identification.  Check cardiac echo to
   assess valves.
   ACIDOSIS -- attributed in part to renal failure.  HCO3 boluses as
   needed.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- multifactorial, attributed to IL-2, hypovolemia,
   possible ATN, single kidney.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, UO,
   electrolytes.  Evidence for improvement (increasing urine output,
   decline in creatinine).  Monitor closely for possible need for
   dailysis.  Renal ultrasound.  Increase in urine output since midnight
   may herald recovery phase.  Maintain intravascular repletion.  Renal
   service to begin renal replacement therapy.
   FLUIDS -- intravascular hypovolemia.  Plan continue to replete, monitor
   CVP > 9 cm H2O.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 increased insensible losses.  Provide free H2O.
   Monitor Na+
   INR
 elevated.  Plan FFP, monitor INR.
   SKIN RASH -- desquamation.  Attributed to IL-2.
   RENAL CELL CA -- metastatitc, now receiving IL-2 (last dose [**2124-3-3**]).
   Monitor exam, electrolytes.
   EOSINOPHILIA --  attributed in part to medications, including IL-2.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- Poor PO intake.  Unable to provide TF while
   receiving mask ventilation.  Consider TPN.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the brain, who has completed the second week of IL-2 therapy. He is currently experiencing hypotension, anuria, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary infiltrates, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient has been on multiple vasopressors, including norepinephrine and phenylephrine, and has received sedation and DC cardioversion for rapid ventricular response. He is now on non-invasive mask ventilation and has shown improvement in urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's symptoms of hypotension and respiratory distress could be indicative of a pulmonary embolism. This is a concern given the patient's recent immobility and cancer diagnosis.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to immunosuppression from IL-2 therapy and the presence of central lines and Foley catheter. Signs of infection include fever, leukocytosis, and bacteremia.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's oliguria and elevated creatinine suggest acute kidney injury, possibly due to sepsis, hypotension, or direct renal damage from IL-2 therapy.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may contribute to his hypotension and could potentially lead to hemodynamic"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yom renal cell carcinoma --> metastatic (brain), s/p 2nd week of
   IL-2 completed and now with persistent hypotension and anuric renal
   failure, and now A-fibrillation.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed in part to IL-2 (vasodilatory and 3rd spacing
   due to vasculare leak), although effect apprears somewhat protracted,
   and may be component of hypovolemia.  A-fib likely contributing to
   hypotension.  No evidence for adrenal insufficiency.  Consider
   pulmonary embolism --> plan check LE NIVS, check cardiac echo to assess
   RV function .   With concern for sepsis (with specific concerns
   including skin infection,LLL pneumonia, line-related infection),
   remains on Vanco, Cefopime, Levofloxicin.  Maintain MAP > 65 mmHg.
   Vasopressor as needed.
   A-FIB -- Rapid rate this AM.  Predisposition is bilateral atrial
   enlargement.  Precipitant likely context of sepsis, bacteremia, IL-2
   syndrome ""cytokine storm.""  Doubt DC cardioversion effective in current
   context --> plan continue Amioderone.  Replete electrolytes.
   Anticoagulation would be desired --> need to discuss with primary team,
   as potential use of anticoagulation complicated and high risk  for
   bleeding.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Chest CT with evidence of diffuse, patchy,
   focal infiltrates, many peripheral.  [**Month (only) 51**] be atypical pattern for
   fluid/pulmonary edema.  Concerns for possible infection, and nodular
   infiltrates raise possibility of embolic events (right sided
   endocarditis) or fungal pneumonia.  Also consider pulmonary renal
   syndrome (ex. anti-GBM Ab, Wegener's).  Check sputum, serum b-glucan
   and galactomannan.  Monitor exam and CXR, consider bronchoscopy.
   SEPSIS -- attributed in part to IL-2, but now with evidence for
   infections (bacteremia, urine source), and concerns for possible lung
   infection.  Plan continue support.
   DYSPNEA -- may in part be due to early pulmonary edema (3rd spacing),
   with contribution of acidosis (metabolic, renal failure).  Monitor RR,
   SaO2, provide supplimental oxygen.  Continue mask ventilation.  Monitor
   ABG.  Low threshold for intubation.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- progressive.  Concerns include DIC, HIT, TTP and
   medication effect.  Monitor plts count.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- multifactorial, including uremia, medications
   (benzodiazepines), evolving hypernatremia, reversal of sleep-wake
   cycle.  Also concerned about increased intracranial edema with known
   renal cell mets and now positive fluid balance, and also
   thrombocytopenia.  No bleed on non-contrast head CT.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC, possible line-related or skin-related.  Plan
   continue Vancomycin --> await identification.  Check cardiac echo to
   assess valves.
   ACIDOSIS -- attributed in part to renal failure.  HCO3 boluses as
   needed.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- multifactorial, attributed to IL-2, hypovolemia,
   possible ATN, single kidney.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, UO,
   electrolytes.  Evidence for improvement (increasing urine output,
   decline in creatinine).  Monitor closely for possible need for
   dailysis.  Renal ultrasound.  Increase in urine output since midnight
   may herald recovery phase.  Maintain intravascular repletion.
   FLUIDS -- intravascular hypovolemia.  Plan continue to replete, monitor
   CVP > 9 cm H2O.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 increased insensible losses.  Provide free H2O.
   Monitor Na+
   INR
 elevated.  Plan FFP, monitor INR.
   SKIN RASH -- desquamation.  Attributed to IL-2.
   RENAL CELL CA -- metastatitc, now receiving IL-2 (last dose [**2124-3-3**]).
   Monitor exam, electrolytes.
   EOSINOPHILIA --  attributed in part to medications, including IL-2.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- Poor PO intake.  Unable to provide TF while
   receiving mask ventilation.  Consider TPN.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma, metastatic to the brain, who has completed the second week of IL-2 therapy. He is currently experiencing persistent hypotension, anuric renal failure, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's condition is attributed to multiple factors including IL-2 therapy, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and infections such as skin infection and lower lobe pneumonia. The patient is receiving multiple vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension is attributed to various factors including IL-2 therapy, sepsis, and atrial fibrillation. The patient requires continuous monitoring and administration of vasopressors to maintain MAP above 65 mmHg.
2. Anuric Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing anuric renal failure, which may be due to hypovolemia, IL-2 therapy, and possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has rapid ventricular response due to atrial fibrillation. The precipitant is likely sepsis, bacteremia, and IL-2 syndrome. Amiodarone is being administered to control the heart rate, and further evaluation for anticoagulation"

   Imaging: CT chest [**3-7**]:
   1. Extensive new strikingly peripheral/subpleural ground-glass
   opacities with a slight upper lobe predominance is highly suggestive of
   drug-induced toxicity (likely IL-2 drug-induced eosinophilic lung
   disease). The more confluent lower lobe opacities are most suggestive
   of atelectasis, although infection cannot be excluded by imaging.
   2. Persistent findings suggestive of vascular engorgement with mild
   interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
   3. No significant interval change to some of the previously noted
   metastatic lesions with many of the previously noted foci obscured by
   the new lung parenchymal opacities. Slight enlargement of prevascular
   lymph nodes can be seen in the setting of underlying pulmonary
   edema/elevated CVP.
   CT head: Slightly decreased vasogenic edema in region of known left
   temporal lobe metastasis
   TTE:
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
   are normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: small pericardial effusion located mostly posterior to the
   left ventricle. There is minimal fluid anterior to the right ventricle.
   There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in
   mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, which can be consistent with impaired
   ventricular filling but is more likely due to the irregularity of the
   heart rate. There is no frank tamponade seen. Normal biventricular
   function. No evidence of endocarditis although the valves are not well
   seen.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-3-6**], this is a
   limited study. The valves are not well seen. The patient remains
   tachycardic but is now in atrial fibrillation. The size of the
   pericardial effusion is similar

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. The presence of crackles at the right base suggests pulmonary edema, which may be contributing to the respiratory distress.

2. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient was initially in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and later converted to sinus rhythm but did not stay in it. AFib can lead to ineffective atrial contraction and contribute to the development of congestive heart failure.

3. Shock: The patient is in shock, as indicated by the need for multiple vasopressors (levo, neo, vaso) to maintain blood pressure. Shock can be caused by a combination of factors, including hypovolemia, cardiogenic dysfunction, and sepsis.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output indicate impaired renal function. ARF can be caused by hypoperfusion, intrinsic renal injury, or obstructive processes.

5. Metabolic acidosis: The low pH and high lactate levels suggest metabolic acidosis, which may be due to poor tissue perfusion, lactic acid production, or renal dysfunction.

6. Hypernatremia: The high sodium level indicates hypernatremia, which may result from dehydration or inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIAD"

   Imaging: CT chest [**3-7**]:
   1. Extensive new strikingly peripheral/subpleural ground-glass
   opacities with a slight upper lobe predominance is highly suggestive of
   drug-induced toxicity (likely IL-2 drug-induced eosinophilic lung
   disease). The more confluent lower lobe opacities are most suggestive
   of atelectasis, although infection cannot be excluded by imaging.
   2. Persistent findings suggestive of vascular engorgement with mild
   interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
   3. No significant interval change to some of the previously noted
   metastatic lesions with many of the previously noted foci obscured by
   the new lung parenchymal opacities. Slight enlargement of prevascular
   lymph nodes can be seen in the setting of underlying pulmonary
   edema/elevated CVP.
   CT head: Slightly decreased vasogenic edema in region of known left
   temporal lobe metastasis
   TTE:
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
   are normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: small pericardial effusion located mostly posterior to the
   left ventricle. There is minimal fluid anterior to the right ventricle.
   There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in
   mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, which can be consistent with impaired
   ventricular filling but is more likely due to the irregularity of the
   heart rate. There is no frank tamponade seen. Normal biventricular
   function. No evidence of endocarditis although the valves are not well
   seen.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-3-6**], this is a
   limited study. The valves are not well seen. The patient remains
   tachycardic but is now in atrial fibrillation. The size of the
   pericardial effusion is similar

   #  A. fib with RVR-  likely [**3-14**] volume overload and atrial stretch.
   Other factors to consider include myocardial ischmemia.  Underlying
   sepsis also likely contributing.  Patient received to attempts at DC
   cardioversion, 100 and 150 joules, which were successful and converted
   patient back into NSR, with improving blood pressure.  Patient
   unfortunately converted back into a. fib with RVR within seconds.  Amio
   bolus and drip started.  Now back in NSR.  24 hour IV drip nearly
   completed
   -  will convert to amio 400 PO TID when OG tube placed.
   -  two sets of cardiac markers flat
   -  no new WMAs, no evidence of endocarditis on TTE
   -  will need to consider anti-coagulation in future if chemical
   cardioversion unsuccessful
   -  cont levo, neo, vaso as needed for  MAP > 65; wean levo first if
   able
   #. Shock: hypotension in the setting of IL-2 therapy is common, though
   unusual for it to extend this far past the last dose; therefore,
   concern is for another cause for his hypotension.  Likely etiology is
   septic shock from S. aureus, coag (+).  No evidence of obstructive,
   cardiogenic shock on repeat TTE.  No evidence of adrenal
   insufficiency.  Antibiotic coverage includes health-care associated
   agents.  Fluid status is total body overloaded, but may have been
   intravascularly dry given FeNa 0.7.  Likely has large insensible losses
   through skin.  Lactate trending down.  Given CPSA bacteremia, skin,
   line, and endocarditis are possible sources.  Thromboembolic dz is on
   differential.

   #  Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure-  Decreased respiratory drive
   likely [**3-14**] depressed mental status, sedation.  Serial ABGs showed mild
   resp and metabolic acidosis.  Given worsening clinical picture today,
   will electively intubate to facilitate placement of HD line.  Pt now on
   CMV, with mild metabolic acidosis, likely [**3-14**] renal failure, and
   respiratory acidosis.

   #. ARF: IL-2 mediated ARF most likely, however prerenal or ischemic ATN
   also possible.  K wnl, phos elevated though stable from last draw.  No
   evidence of obstruction in right collecting system on renal
   ultrasound.   FeNa 0.7.  Does show some UOP response to IVF boluses.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented to the ICU three days ago.
- He received an infusion of IL-2 therapy and subsequently developed shock, likely due to sepsis.
- The patient also has acute renal failure, altered mental status, and respiratory failure.
- He has a positive blood culture for coagulasive-negative Staphylococcus aureus (CoNS) and a significant infection in the urinary tract.
- The patient has hypernatremia and is receiving IV fluids to replete electrolytes.
- He is on mechanical ventilation and has been intubated to facilitate the placement of a hemodialysis line.
- The patient's condition is complicated by several comorbidities including metastatic disease to the brain, RCC, and potential cardiac involvement.
- He is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and supportive care.
- The patient's prognosis is guarded due to the severity of his illness and the presence of multiple organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of shock is suggestive of sepsis, possibly caused by CoNS bacteremia. This condition can lead to further organ dysfunction and potential death if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, which may be secondary to sepsis or IL-2"

   Imaging: CT chest [**3-7**]:
   1. Extensive new strikingly peripheral/subpleural ground-glass
   opacities with a slight upper lobe predominance is highly suggestive of
   drug-induced toxicity (likely IL-2 drug-induced eosinophilic lung
   disease). The more confluent lower lobe opacities are most suggestive
   of atelectasis, although infection cannot be excluded by imaging.
   2. Persistent findings suggestive of vascular engorgement with mild
   interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
   3. No significant interval change to some of the previously noted
   metastatic lesions with many of the previously noted foci obscured by
   the new lung parenchymal opacities. Slight enlargement of prevascular
   lymph nodes can be seen in the setting of underlying pulmonary
   edema/elevated CVP.
   CT head: Slightly decreased vasogenic edema in region of known left
   temporal lobe metastasis
   TTE:
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
   are normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: small pericardial effusion located mostly posterior to the
   left ventricle. There is minimal fluid anterior to the right ventricle.
   There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in
   mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, which can be consistent with impaired
   ventricular filling but is more likely due to the irregularity of the
   heart rate. There is no frank tamponade seen. Normal biventricular
   function. No evidence of endocarditis although the valves are not well
   seen.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-3-6**], this is a
   limited study. The valves are not well seen. The patient remains
   tachycardic but is now in atrial fibrillation. The size of the
   pericardial effusion is similar

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented to the ICU with shock, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. He has been on IL-2 therapy for his RCC. The patient has multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation, hypercapneic respiratory failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation suggests sepsis due to the presence of coag (+) S. aureus bacteremia. This could be a result of healthcare-associated infections or skin/line endocarditis.
2. Endocarditis: Given the presence of S. aureus bacteremia, there is a concern for endocarditis, especially considering the patient's immunocompromised state and recent intravenous catheter use.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, which may be caused by IL-2 therapy, prerenal causes, ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or pulmonary-renal syndrome.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to a combination of acute kidney injury and lactic acidosis.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which could be caused by iatrogenic factors or consum"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo male with RCC here 3 days s/p IL2 infusion with shock, renal
   failure, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  A. fib with RVR-  likely [**3-14**] volume overload and atrial stretch.
   Other factors to consider include myocardial ischmemia.  Underlying
   sepsis also likely contributing.  Patient received to attempts at DC
   cardioversion, 100 and 150 joules, which were successful and converted
   patient back into NSR, with improving blood pressure.  Patient
   unfortunately converted back into a. fib with RVR within seconds.  Amio
   bolus and drip started.
   -  cont amio gtt
   -  rule out ischemia with two sets of markers
   -  repeat TTE for new WMAs, possible worsening of effusion, evidence of
   endocarditis
   -  will need to consider anti-coagulation in future if chemical
   cardioversion unsuccessful
   -  cont levo and neo as needed for  MAP > 65
   #. Shock: hypotension in the setting of IL-2 therapy is common, though
   unusual for it to extend this far past the last dose; therefore,
   concern is for another cause for his hypotension.  Possible etiologies
   include distrubitive in setting of IL-2, septic/nfection (lung with LLL
   infiltrate, GU tract, GI tract, skin); less likely hypovolemic.  No
   evidence of obstructive, cardiogenic shock given TTE.  No evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency.  Antibiotic coverage includes health-care
   associated agents.  Fluid status is total body overloaded, but may be
   intravascularly dry given FeNa 0.7.  Likely has large insensible losses
   through skin.  Lactate trending down.  Given GPC bacteremia, skin,
   line, and endocarditis are possible sources.  A-line placed today.
   Given thrombocytopenia and possible HIT Ab, thromboembolic dz is on
   differential.

   #  Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure-  Decreased respiratory drive
   likely [**3-14**] depressed mental status, sedation.  Serial ABGs showed mild
   resp and metabolic acidosis.  Given worsening clinical picture today,
   will electively intubate to facilitate placement of HD line.
   -  stat CXR post-intubation to eval for ET tube placement
   .
   #. ARF: IL-2 mediated ARF most likely, however prerenal or ischemic ATN
   also possible.  K wnl, phos elevated though stable from last draw.  No
   evidence of obstruction in right collecting system on renal
   ultrasound.   FeNa 0.7.  Does show some UOP response to IVF boluses.
   Lactate improved.  Also on differential is pulm-renal syndrome.
   - follow Cr and electrolytes Q8

   - follow up Renal Recs -> will place right femoral HD line and CVVH
   today following intubation
   - will check anti-GBM, [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA

   #. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: likely from combination of ARF and
   hypotension, lactic acidosis.  ABG appears pure met acidosis with resp
   acidosis contributing.  Lactate improved.  Remaining acidosis likely
   [**3-14**] ARF.

   #. Altered Mental Status: Known metastatic disease to brain and IL-2
   can cause swelling.  He is AOx3, though slightly agitated.  Clinical

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yom renal cell carcinoma --> metastatic (brain), s/p 2nd week of
   IL-2 completed and now with shock.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE  -- may in part be due to early pulmonary edema
   (3rd spacing), with contribution of acidosis (metabolic, renal
   failure).  Monitor RR, SaO2, provide supplimental oxygen.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Lung protective strategy.  Monitor ABG.
   HYPOTENSION -- Multifactorial.  Attributed in part to IL-2
   (vasodilatory and 3rd spacing due to vasculare leak), although effect
   apprears somewhat protracted, concern for superimposed sepsis.
   Intermittent A-fib likely contributing to hypotension.  No evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency.  Consider pulmonary embolism --> plan check LE
   NIVS, check cardiac echo to assess RV function .   With concern for
   sepsis (with specific concerns including skin infection,LLL pneumonia,
   line-related infection), remains on Vanco, Cefopime, Levofloxicin.
   Maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.  Vasopressors as needed.
   A-FIB -- Reverted to NSR this AM on Amioderone.  Bilateral atrial
   enlargement.  Precipitant likely context of sepsis, bacteremia, IL-2
   syndrome ""cytokine storm.""  Plan continue Amioderone.  Replete
   electrolytes.  Anticoagulation would be desired --> need to discuss
   with primary team, as potential use of anticoagulation complicated and
   high risk  for bleeding.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Chest CT with evidence of diffuse, patchy,
   focal infiltrates, many peripheral.  [**Month (only) 51**] be atypical pattern for
   fluid/pulmonary edema.  Concerns for possible infection, and nodular
   infiltrates raise possibility of embolic events (right sided
   endocarditis) or fungal pneumonia.  Also consider pulmonary renal
   syndrome (ex. anti-GBM Ab, Wegener's).  Check sputum, serum b-glucan
   and galactomannan.  Monitor exam and CXR, plan bronchoscopy to assess
   for respiratory process/infection (cultures, stains, cell count, etc).
   SEPSIS -- attributed in part to IL-2, but now with evidence for
   infections (bacteremia, urine source), and concerns for possible lung
   infection.  Plan continue support, including broad spectrum
   antimicrobials.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- progressive.  No evidence for HIT.  Concerns
   include DIC, medication effect, or possible TTP.  Monitor plts count.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- multifactorial, including uremia, medications
   (benzodiazepines), evolving hypernatremia, reversal of sleep-wake
   cycle.  Also concerned about increased intracranial edema with known
   renal cell mets and now positive fluid balance, and also
   thrombocytopenia.  No bleed on non-contrast head CT.  Plan to move to
   intubation to control airway.
   BACTEREMIA -- S. aureus, possible line-related or skin-related.  Plan
   continue Vancomycin.  Cardiac echo without evidence for valvular
   abnormalities.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- multifactorial, attributed to IL-2, hypovolemia,
   possible ATN, single kidney.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, UO,
   electrolytes.  Evidence for improvement (increasing urine output,
   decline in creatinine).  Continue CVVH as tolerated.  Contined increase
   in urine output since midnight may herald recovery phase.  Maintain
   intravascular repletion.
   ACIDOSIS -- attributed in part to renal failure.  Now on CVVH.  HCO3
   boluses as needed.
   FLUIDS -- intravascular hypovolemia.  Plan continue to replete, monitor
   CVP > 9 cm H2O.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 increased insensible losses.  Provide free H2O.
   Monitor Na+
   INR
 elevated.  Plan FFP, monitor INR.
   SKIN RASH -- desquamation.  Attributed to IL-2.
   RENAL CELL CA -- metastatitc, now receiving IL-2 (last dose [**2124-3-3**]).
   Monitor exam, electrolytes.
   EOSINOPHILIA --  attributed in part to medications, including IL-2.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- Poor PO intake.  Unable to provide TF while
   receiving mask ventilation.  Consider TPN.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma, metastatic to the brain, who recently completed the second week of IL-2 therapy and is now in shock. The patient has respiratory failure, which may be due to early pulmonary edema, metabolic acidosis, and renal failure. The patient also has hypotension, likely due to IL-2 syndrome, sepsis, and possible pulmonary embolism. The patient experienced intermittent atrial fibrillation but has since reverted to normal sinus rhythm on Amioderone. Bilateral atrial enlargement is noted. There are pulmonary infiltrates on chest CT, which may be due to infection, embolic events, or fungal pneumonia. The patient has bacteremia, attributed in part to IL-2 therapy, as well as thrombocytopenia, possibly due to DIC, medication effect, or TTP. The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to uremia, medications, evolving hypernatremia, and reversal of the sleep-wake cycle. The patient has acute renal failure, likely multifactorial, with improvement in urine output. The patient has acidosis, hypernatremia, and elevated INR, which are being managed accordingly. The patient has a skin rash, possibly due to IL-2 therapy, and a history of renal cell carcinoma. The patient is critically ill and requires continued ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yom renal cell carcinoma --> metastatic (brain), s/p 2nd week of
   IL-2 completed and now with shock.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE  -- may in part be due to early pulmonary edema
   (3rd spacing), with contribution of acidosis (metabolic, renal
   failure).  Monitor RR, SaO2, provide supplimental oxygen.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Lung protective strategy.  Monitor ABG.
   HYPOTENSION -- Multifactorial.  Attributed in part to IL-2
   (vasodilatory and 3rd spacing due to vasculare leak), although effect
   apprears somewhat protracted, concern for superimposed sepsis.
   Intermittent A-fib likely contributing to hypotension.  No evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency.  Consider pulmonary embolism --> plan check LE
   NIVS, check cardiac echo to assess RV function .   With concern for
   sepsis (with specific concerns including skin infection,LLL pneumonia,
   line-related infection), remains on Vanco, Cefopime, Levofloxicin.
   Maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.  Vasopressors as needed.
   A-FIB -- Reverted to NSR this AM on Amioderone.  Bilateral atrial
   enlargement.  Precipitant likely context of sepsis, bacteremia, IL-2
   syndrome ""cytokine storm.""  Plan continue Amioderone.  Replete
   electrolytes.  Anticoagulation would be desired --> need to discuss
   with primary team, as potential use of anticoagulation complicated and
   high risk  for bleeding.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Chest CT with evidence of diffuse, patchy,
   focal infiltrates, many peripheral.  [**Month (only) 51**] be atypical pattern for
   fluid/pulmonary edema.  Concerns for possible infection, and nodular
   infiltrates raise possibility of embolic events (right sided
   endocarditis) or fungal pneumonia.  Also consider pulmonary renal
   syndrome (ex. anti-GBM Ab, Wegener's).  Check sputum, serum b-glucan
   and galactomannan.  Monitor exam and CXR, plan bronchoscopy to assess
   for respiratory process/infection (cultures, stains, cell count, etc).
   SEPSIS -- attributed in part to IL-2, but now with evidence for
   infections (bacteremia, urine source), and concerns for possible lung
   infection.  Plan continue support, including broad spectrum
   antimicrobials.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- progressive.  No evidence for HIT.  Concerns
   include DIC, medication effect, or possible TTP.  Monitor plts count.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- multifactorial, including uremia, medications
   (benzodiazepines), evolving hypernatremia, reversal of sleep-wake
   cycle.  Also concerned about increased intracranial edema with known
   renal cell mets and now positive fluid balance, and also
   thrombocytopenia.  No bleed on non-contrast head CT.  Plan to move to
   intubation to control airway.
   BACTEREMIA -- S. aureus, possible line-related or skin-related.  Plan
   continue Vancomycin.  Cardiac echo without evidence for valvular
   abnormalities.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- multifactorial, attributed to IL-2, hypovolemia,
   possible ATN, single kidney.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, UO,
   electrolytes.  Evidence for improvement (increasing urine output,
   decline in creatinine).  Continue CVVH as tolerated.  Contined increase
   in urine output since midnight may herald recovery phase.  Maintain
   intravascular repletion.
   ACIDOSIS -- attributed in part to renal failure.  Now on CVVH.  HCO3
   boluses as needed.
   FLUIDS -- intravascular hypovolemia.  Plan continue to replete, monitor
   CVP > 9 cm H2O.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 increased insensible losses.  Provide free H2O.
   Monitor Na+
   INR
 elevated.  Plan FFP, monitor INR.
   SKIN RASH -- desquamation.  Attributed to IL-2.
   RENAL CELL CA -- metastatitc, now receiving IL-2 (last dose [**2124-3-3**]).
   Monitor exam, electrolytes.
   EOSINOPHILIA --  attributed in part to medications, including IL-2.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- Poor PO intake.  Unable to provide TF while
   receiving mask ventilation.  Consider TPN.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. He has been receiving treatment with IL-2 for metastatic disease but has now developed shock, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary infiltrates, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, acute renal failure, acidosis, hypernatremia, and skin rash. The patient's condition is multifactorial and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to early pulmonary edema, acidosis, and the use of IL-2. Monitoring RR, SaO2, providing supplemental oxygen, and continuing mechanical ventilation are necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial and may be attributed to IL-2-induced vasodilation and third-spacing of fluids, as well as possible sepsis. Maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg and using vasopressors as needed are recommended.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has intermittent atrial fibrillation, which may contribute to hypotension. Reversion to normal sinus rhythm was achieved with amiodarone, and continued monitoring and anticoagulation are necessary.

4. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The presence of diffuse, patchy, focal infiltrates on chest CT raises concerns"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo male with RCC here 3 days s/p IL2 infusion with shock, likely
   septic in etiology, renal failure, and altered mental status.
   .
   #. Shock: Likely etiology is septic shock from S. aureus, coag (+),
   exacerbated by distributive physiology from IL-2.  No evidence of
   obstructive, cardiogenic shock on repeat TTE.  No evidence of adrenal
   insufficiency.  Antibiotic coverage includes health-care associated
   agents.  Fluid status is total body overloaded, but may have been
   intravascularly dry given FeNa 0.7.  Likely has large insensible losses
   through skin.  Lactate trending down.  Given CPSA bacteremia, skin,
   line, and endocarditis are possible sources.  Thromboembolic dz is on
   differential.  Levo weaned overnight.
   - cont cefepime, flagyl, levoflox, and vanc, dosed for CVVH
   - cont neo and vaso, wean neo if possible for MAP > 65, CVP 10-12
   - surveillance blood cultures
   -  LENIs and HIT Ab (-)
   -  right SCL line removed, right IJ placed
   -  f/u multiple blood/fungal cultures, and BAL cultures
   .
   #  A. fib with RVR-  likely [**3-14**] volume overload and atrial stretch.
   Other factors to consider include myocardial ischmemia.  Underlying
   sepsis also likely contributing.  Patient received to attempts at DC
   cardioversion, 100 and 150 joules, which were successful and converted
   patient back into NSR, with improving blood pressure.  Patient
   unfortunately converted back into a. fib with RVR within seconds.  Amio
   bolus and drip started.  Now back in NSR.
   -  will cont amio gtt to complete full amio load, defer PO amio
   -  two sets of cardiac markers flat
   -  no new WMAs, no evidence of endocarditis on TTE
   -  will need to consider anti-coagulation in future if chemical
   cardioversion unsuccessful
     .
   #  Coag (+) S. aureus bacteremia- possible source includes skin, line,
   less likely endocarditis.
   -  will f/u cultures, surveillance cultures
   - 10,000-100,000 GNRs in urine, will not treat, as repeat U/A with
   culture (-)
   -  cont Abx as above
   .
   #  Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure-  Decreased respiratory drive
   likely [**3-14**] depressed mental status, sedation.  Serial ABGs showed mild
   resp and metabolic acidosis.  Given worsening clinical picture today,
   will electively intubate to facilitate placement of HD line.  Pt now on
   CMV, with mild metabolic acidosis, likely [**3-14**] renal failure, and
   respiratory acidosis.
   -  daily RSBI, trial of weaning
   -  bedside BAL today, f/u cultures
   .
   #. ARF: IL-2 mediated ARF most likely, however prerenal or ischemic ATN
   also possible.  No evidence of obstruction in right collecting system
   on renal ultrasound.   FeNa 0.7.  Does show some UOP response to IVF
   boluses.  Lactate improved.  Also on differential is pulm-renal
   syndrome.
   - follow up Renal recs, appreciate input, cont CVVH, run even today,
   attempt to cont to wean pressors
   - anti-GBM, [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA all (-)
   .
   #. Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: likely from combination of ARF and
   hypotension.  ABG normal.  Lactate improved.  Remaining mild acidosis
   likely [**3-14**] ARF.
   - CVVH
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status: Known metastatic disease to brain and IL-2
   can cause swelling.  He is AOx3, though slightly agitated.  Clinical
   picture not c/w meningitis/encephalitis and most likely
   toxic-metabolic.  Patient has signs of uremia on exam.
   - NO LP given intracranial masses
   - CT head unremarkable
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy- no evidence of hemorrhage.
   Thrombocytopenia etiology iatrogenic vs. consumptive.  Increased INR
   could be [**3-14**] poor nutrition, consumption, DIC.  No schistocytes on
   smear.
   -  fibrinogen normal.  Could have low grade DIC in setting of sepsis
   -  will give FFP and platelets to correct coagulopathy, provide colloid
   to intravascular volume, in anticipation for HD line
   -  HIT Ab (-)
   -  d/c

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma who was admitted to the ICU three days ago following an infusion of IL-2. He presented with shock, likely septic in origin, renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, shock, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, hypoxemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, impaired skin integrity, and hypotension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. This can lead to decreased tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercapneic respiratory failure with decreased respiratory drive, possibly due to depressed mental status and sedation. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a need for ongoing renal support. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is being continued.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to renal failure. Management involves CVVH and correction of acid-base imbalance.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, possibly due to insensible losses and decreased intake. Repletion with D5W is recommended"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo male with RCC here 3 days s/p IL2 infusion with shock, likely
   septic in etiology, renal failure, and altered mental status.
   .
   #. Shock: Likely etiology is septic shock from S. aureus, coag (+),
   exacerbated by distributive physiology from IL-2.  No evidence of
   obstructive, cardiogenic shock on repeat TTE.  No evidence of adrenal
   insufficiency.  Antibiotic coverage includes health-care associated
   agents.  Fluid status is total body overloaded, but may have been
   intravascularly dry given FeNa 0.7.  Likely has large insensible losses
   through skin.  Lactate trending down.  Given CPSA bacteremia, skin,
   line, and endocarditis are possible sources.  Thromboembolic dz is on
   differential.
   - cont cefepime, flagyl, levoflox, and vanc, dosed for CVVH
   - cont neo and vaso, wean neo if possible for MAP > 65, CVP 10-12
   - surveillance blood cultures
   -  LENIs and HIT Ab (-)
   -  right SCL line removed, right IJ placed
   -  f/u multiple blood/fungal cultures
   .
   #  A. fib with RVR-  likely [**3-14**] volume overload and atrial stretch.
   Other factors to consider include myocardial ischmemia.  Underlying
   sepsis also likely contributing.  Patient received to attempts at DC
   cardioversion, 100 and 150 joules, which were successful and converted
   patient back into NSR, with improving blood pressure.  Patient
   unfortunately converted back into a. fib with RVR within seconds.  Amio
   bolus and drip started.  Now back in NSR.  24 hour IV drip nearly
   completed
   -  will convert to amio 400 PO TID when OG tube placed.
   -  two sets of cardiac markers flat
   -  no new WMAs, no evidence of endocarditis on TTE
   -  will need to consider anti-coagulation in future if chemical
   cardioversion unsuccessful
   -  cont levo, neo, vaso as needed for  MAP > 65; wean levo first if
   able
     .
   #  Coag (+) S. aureus bacteremia- possible source includes skin, line,
   less likely endocarditis.
   -  will f/u cultures, surveillance cultures
   - 10,000-100,000 GNRs in urine, will not treat, repeat U/A with culture
   (-)
   -  cont Abx as above
   .
   #  Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure-  Decreased respiratory drive
   likely [**3-14**] depressed mental status, sedation.  Serial ABGs showed mild
   resp and metabolic acidosis.  Given worsening clinical picture today,
   will electively intubate to facilitate placement of HD line.  Pt now on
   CMV, with mild metabolic acidosis, likely [**3-14**] renal failure, and
   respiratory acidosis.
   -  daily RSBI, trial of weaning
   -  bedside BAL today, f/u cultures
   .
   #. ARF: IL-2 mediated ARF most likely, however prerenal or ischemic ATN
   also possible.  K wnl, phos elevated though stable from last draw.  No
   evidence of obstruction in right collecting system on renal
   ultrasound.   FeNa 0.7.  Does show some UOP response to IVF boluses.
   Lactate improved.  Also on differential is pulm-renal syndrome.
   - follow up Renal recs, appreciate input, cont CVVH, run even today,
   attempt to wean pressors
   - f/u anti-GBM, [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA
   .
   #. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: likely from combination of ARF and
   hypotension, lactic acidosis.  ABG appears pure met acidosis with resp
   acidosis contributing.  Lactate improved.  Remaining acidosis likely
   [**3-14**] ARF.
   - CVVH
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status: Known metastatic disease to brain and IL-2
   can cause swelling.  He is AOx3, though slightly agitated.  Clinical
   picture not c/w meningitis/encephalitis and most likely
   toxic-metabolic.  Patient has signs of uremia on exam.
   - NO LP given intracranial masses
   - CT head unremarkable
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy- no evidence of hemorrhage.
   Thrombocytopenia etiology iatrogenic vs. consumptive.  Increased INR
   could be [**3-14**] poor nutrition, consumption, DIC.  No schistocytes on
   smear.
   -  fibrinogen normal.  Could have low grade DIC in setting of sepsis
   -  will give FFP and platelets to correct coagulopathy, provide colloid
   to intravascular volume, in anticipation for HD line

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing shock, likely septic in origin, renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient received IL-2 infusion prior to admission. He has multiple comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, hypercapneic respiratory failure, and metabolic acidosis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: The patient's likely septic shock is believed to be caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, which may have originated from the skin, line, or endocarditis. Antibiotic coverage has been initiated, and fluid management is ongoing.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is thought to be related to volume overload, atrial stretch, and myocardial ischemia. Cardioversion attempts have been unsuccessful so far. Amiodarone has been started, and efforts are being made to convert the patient to normal sinus rhythm.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy associated with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. This may be due to consumption of coagulation factors. Surveillance cultures are being followed, and the patient will be evaluated for endocarditis.
4. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is believed to be due to decreased respiratory drive, possibly caused by depressed mental status and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented to the ICU three days ago following an infusion of IL-2 therapy. He was diagnosed with septic shock, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The patient has a history of RCC and received IL-2 therapy, which can cause various side effects including myocarditis, ectopy, neurotoxicity, thrombocytopenia, hypocalcemia, and hyperbilirubinemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercapneic respiratory failure due to decreased respiratory drive, likely caused by depressed mental status and sedation. Intubation was elected to facilitate the placement of a hemodialysis line.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): ARF may be caused by IL-2-mediated renal injury, prerenal or ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or pulmonary-renal syndrome. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is being run, and efforts are being made to wean off pressors.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: Anion gap metabolic acidosis is likely due to the combination of ARF and hypotension-induced lactic acidosis. CVVH is helping to correct the acidosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yom renal cell carcinoma --> metastatic (brain), s/p 2nd week of
   IL-2 completed and now with shock.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE  -- may in part be due to early pulmonary edema
   (3rd spacing), with contribution of acidosis (metabolic, renal
   failure), and evidence for pneumonitis (neutrophilic infiltrates on
   BAL).  Monitor RR, SaO2, provide supplimental oxygen.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Lung protective strategy.  Monitor ABG.
   HYPOTENSION -- Multifactorial.  Attributed in part to IL-2
   (vasodilatory and 3rd spacing due to vasculare leak), although effect
   apprears somewhat protracted, concern for superimposed sepsis.
   Intermittent A-fib likely contributing to hypotension.  No evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency.  Consider pulmonary embolism --> plan check LE
   NIVS, check cardiac echo to assess RV function .   With concern for
   sepsis (with specific concerns including skin infection,LLL pneumonia,
   line-related infection), remains on Vanco, Cefopime, Levofloxicin.
   Maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.  Vasopressors as needed.
   A-FIB -- Reverted to NSR on Amioderone.  Bilateral atrial enlargement.
   Precipitant likely context of sepsis, bacteremia, IL-2 syndrome
   ""cytokine storm.""  Plan continue Amioderone.  Replete electrolytes.
   Anticoagulation would be desired --> need to discuss with primary team,
   as potential use of anticoagulation complicated and high risk  for
   bleeding.  Hopefully will not need long-term rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Chest CT with evidence of diffuse, patchy,
   focal infiltrates, many peripheral.  [**Month (only) 51**] be atypical pattern for
   fluid/pulmonary edema.  Concerns for possible infection, and nodular
   infiltrates raise possibility of embolic events (right sided
   endocarditis) or fungal pneumonia.  Also consider pulmonary renal
   syndrome (ex. anti-GBM Ab, Wegener's).  Check sputum, serum b-glucan
   and galactomannan.  Monitor exam and CXR, plan bronchoscopy to assess
   for respiratory process/infection (cultures, stains, cell count, etc).
   SEPSIS -- attributed in part to IL-2, but now with evidence for
   infections (bacteremia, urine source), and concerns for possible lung
   infection.  Plan continue support, including broad spectrum
   antimicrobials.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- progressive.  No evidence for HIT.  Concerns
   include DIC, medication effect, or possible TTP.  Monitor plts count.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- multifactorial, including uremia, medications
   (benzodiazepines), evolving hypernatremia, reversal of sleep-wake
   cycle.  Currently sedated.
   BACTEREMIA -- S. aureus, possible line-related or skin-related.  Plan
   continue Vancomycin.  Cardiac echo without evidence for valvular
   abnormalities.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- multifactorial, attributed to IL-2, hypovolemia,
   possible ATN, single kidney.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, UO,
   electrolytes.  Evidence for improvement (increasing urine output,
   decline in creatinine).  Continue CVVH as tolerated.  Contined increase
   in urine output since midnight may herald recovery phase.  Maintain
   intravascular repletion.
   ACIDOSIS -- attributed in part to renal failure.  Now on CVVH.  HCO3
   boluses as needed.
   FLUIDS -- intravascular hypovolemia improved.  Plan maintain balance
   while on vasopressor, monitor CVP > 9 cm H2O.  Eventually will desire
   net diuresis.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 increased insensible losses.  Provide free H2O.
   Monitor Na+
   INR
 elevated.  Plan FFP, monitor INR.
   SKIN RASH -- desquamation.  Attributed to IL-2.
   CYANOSIS
 toes improved.  Fingers persist.
   RENAL CELL CA -- metastatitc, now receiving IL-2 (last dose [**2124-3-3**]).
   Monitor exam, electrolytes.
   EOSINOPHILIA --  attributed in part to medications, including IL-2.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- Poor PO intake.  Unable to provide TF while
   receiving mask ventilation.  Consider TPN.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma, now with metastasis to the brain. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has been receiving IL-2 therapy, which is known to cause cytokine storm and immunosuppression. He also has hypotension, likely due to vasodilatory effects of IL-2 and third-spacing of fluids. There are concerns for sepsis, bacteremia, and pulmonary infiltrates, possibly secondary to infection or embolic events. The patient has thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, and acute renal failure, all of which may be attributed to IL-2 therapy and sepsis. Acidosis is present and attributed to renal failure. The patient's electrolytes are imbalanced, particularly hypernatremia. INR is elevated, and skin rash is attributed to IL-2 therapy. Cyanosis in the toes has improved, but persists in the fingers. The patient has a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and is currently receiving IL-2 therapy. Eosinophilia is noted, possibly due to medications. Nutritional support is needed due to poor oral intake. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yom renal cell carcinoma --> metastatic (brain), s/p 2nd week of
   IL-2 completed and now with shock.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE  -- may in part be due to early pulmonary edema
   (3rd spacing), with contribution of acidosis (metabolic, renal
   failure), and evidence for pneumonitis (neutrophilic infiltrates on
   BAL).  Monitor RR, SaO2, provide supplimental oxygen.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Lung protective strategy.  Monitor ABG.
   HYPOTENSION -- Multifactorial.  Attributed in part to IL-2
   (vasodilatory and 3rd spacing due to vasculare leak), although effect
   apprears somewhat protracted, concern for superimposed sepsis.
   Intermittent A-fib likely contributing to hypotension.  No evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency.  Consider pulmonary embolism --> plan check LE
   NIVS, check cardiac echo to assess RV function .   With concern for
   sepsis (with specific concerns including skin infection,LLL pneumonia,
   line-related infection), remains on Vanco, Cefopime, Levofloxicin.
   Maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.  Vasopressors as needed.
   A-FIB -- Reverted to NSR on Amioderone.  Bilateral atrial enlargement.
   Precipitant likely context of sepsis, bacteremia, IL-2 syndrome
   ""cytokine storm.""  Plan continue Amioderone.  Replete electrolytes.
   Anticoagulation would be desired --> need to discuss with primary team,
   as potential use of anticoagulation complicated and high risk  for
   bleeding.  Hopefully will not need long-term rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Chest CT with evidence of diffuse, patchy,
   focal infiltrates, many peripheral.  [**Month (only) 51**] be atypical pattern for
   fluid/pulmonary edema.  Concerns for possible infection, and nodular
   infiltrates raise possibility of embolic events (right sided
   endocarditis) or fungal pneumonia.  Also consider pulmonary renal
   syndrome (ex. anti-GBM Ab, Wegener's).  Check sputum, serum b-glucan
   and galactomannan.  Monitor exam and CXR, plan bronchoscopy to assess
   for respiratory process/infection (cultures, stains, cell count, etc).
   SEPSIS -- attributed in part to IL-2, but now with evidence for
   infections (bacteremia, urine source), and concerns for possible lung
   infection.  Plan continue support, including broad spectrum
   antimicrobials.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- progressive.  No evidence for HIT.  Concerns
   include DIC, medication effect, or possible TTP.  Monitor plts count.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- multifactorial, including uremia, medications
   (benzodiazepines), evolving hypernatremia, reversal of sleep-wake
   cycle.  Currently sedated.
   BACTEREMIA -- S. aureus, possible line-related or skin-related.  Plan
   continue Vancomycin.  Cardiac echo without evidence for valvular
   abnormalities.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- multifactorial, attributed to IL-2, hypovolemia,
   possible ATN, single kidney.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, UO,
   electrolytes.  Evidence for improvement (increasing urine output,
   decline in creatinine).  Continue CVVH as tolerated.  Contined increase
   in urine output since midnight may herald recovery phase.  Maintain
   intravascular repletion.
   ACIDOSIS -- attributed in part to renal failure.  Now on CVVH.  HCO3
   boluses as needed.
   FLUIDS -- intravascular hypovolemia improved.  Plan maintain balance
   while on vasopressor, monitor CVP > 9 cm H2O.  Eventually will desire
   net diuresis.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 increased insensible losses.  Provide free H2O.
   Monitor Na+
   INR
 elevated.  Plan FFP, monitor INR.
   SKIN RASH -- desquamation.  Attributed to IL-2.
   CYANOSIS
 toes improved.  Fingers persist.
   RENAL CELL CA -- metastatitc, now receiving IL-2 (last dose [**2124-3-3**]).
   Monitor exam, electrolytes.
   EOSINOPHILIA --  attributed in part to medications, including IL-2.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- Poor PO intake.  Unable to provide TF while
   receiving mask ventilation.  Consider TPN.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma and metastatic disease to the brain. He has completed his second week of IL-2 therapy and is now experiencing respiratory failure, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary infiltrates, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Pneumonia: The presence of diffuse, patchy focal infiltrates on chest CT suggests a possible infection in the lungs. This could be due to an embolic event, such as right-sided endocarditis, or a fungal pneumonia.

2. Sepsis: The patient is already on broad-spectrum antimicrobials for suspected sepsis, which may be attributed to IL-2 therapy, bacteremia from a urinary source, or lung infection.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is progressively decreasing, which could be due to medication effects, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level, which may be due to increased insensible losses. Free water administration is planned to address this issue.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly,"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma, currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. He is mechanically ventilated and requires vasopressor support. The patient has several medical complications including hypotension, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary infiltrates, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, bacteremia, acute renal failure, acidosis, hypernatremia, and a skin rash.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient may be experiencing respiratory failure due to early pulmonary edema, acidosis, and evidence of pneumonitis. He will be monitored for RR, SaO2, and provided with supplemental oxygen. Mechanical ventilation will continue with a lung protective strategy, and ABG monitoring will be done.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial and attributed in part to IL-2 therapy causing vasodilation and third spacing of fluids. There is also concern for sepsis. The patient will be maintained with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >60 mmHg and vasopressors as needed.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may be precipitated by sepsis, bacteremia, and IL-2 syndrome. Amiodarone will be continued, and electrolyte repletion will be monitored. Anticoagulation is desired but complicated by the risk of bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yom renal cell carcinoma --> metastatic (brain), s/p 2nd week of
   IL-2 completed and now with shock.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE  -- may in part be due to early pulmonary edema
   (3rd spacing), with contribution of acidosis (metabolic, renal
   failure), and evidence for pneumonitis (neutrophilic infiltrates on
   BAL).  Monitor RR, SaO2, provide supplimental oxygen.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Lung protective strategy.  Monitor ABG.
   HYPOTENSION -- Multifactorial.  Attributed in part to IL-2
   (vasodilatory and 3rd spacing due to vasculare leak), although effect
   apprears somewhat protracted, concern for superimposed sepsis.
   Intermittent A-fib likely contributing to hypotension.  No evidence for
   adrenal insufficiency.  Consider pulmonary embolism --> plan check LE
   NIVS, check cardiac echo to assess RV function .   With concern for
   sepsis (with specific concerns including skin infection,LLL pneumonia,
   line-related infection), remains on Vanco, Cefopime, Levofloxicin.
   Maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.  Vasopressors as needed.
   A-FIB -- Reverted to NSR on Amioderone.  Bilateral atrial enlargement.
   Precipitant likely context of sepsis, bacteremia, IL-2 syndrome
   ""cytokine storm.""  Plan continue Amioderone.  Replete electrolytes.
   Anticoagulation would be desired --> need to discuss with primary team,
   as potential use of anticoagulation complicated and high risk  for
   bleeding.  Hopefully will not need long-term rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Chest CT with evidence of diffuse, patchy,
   focal infiltrates, many peripheral.  [**Month (only) 51**] be atypical pattern for
   fluid/pulmonary edema.  Concerns for possible infection, and nodular
   infiltrates raise possibility of embolic events (right sided
   endocarditis) or fungal pneumonia.  Also consider pulmonary renal
   syndrome (ex. anti-GBM Ab, Wegener's).  Check sputum, serum b-glucan
   and galactomannan.  Monitor exam and CXR, plan bronchoscopy to assess
   for respiratory process/infection (cultures, stains, cell count, etc).
   SEPSIS -- attributed in part to IL-2, but now with evidence for
   infections (bacteremia, urine source), and concerns for possible lung
   infection.  Plan continue support, including broad spectrum
   antimicrobials.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- progressive.  No evidence for HIT.  Concerns
   include DIC, medication effect, or possible TTP.  Monitor plts count.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- multifactorial, including uremia, medications
   (benzodiazepines), evolving hypernatremia, reversal of sleep-wake
   cycle.  Currently sedated.
   BACTEREMIA -- S. aureus, possible line-related or skin-related.  Plan
   continue Vancomycin.  Cardiac echo without evidence for valvular
   abnormalities.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- multifactorial, attributed to IL-2, hypovolemia,
   possible ATN, single kidney.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, UO,
   electrolytes.  Evidence for improvement (increasing urine output,
   decline in creatinine).  Continue CVVH as tolerated.  Contined increase
   in urine output since midnight may herald recovery phase.  Maintain
   intravascular repletion.
   ACIDOSIS -- attributed in part to renal failure.  Now on CVVH.  HCO3
   boluses as needed.
   FLUIDS -- intravascular hypovolemia improved.  Plan maintain balance
   while on vasopressor, monitor CVP > 9 cm H2O.  Eventually will desire
   net diuresis.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 increased insensible losses.  Provide free H2O.
   Monitor Na+
   INR
 elevated.  Plan FFP, monitor INR.
   SKIN RASH -- desquamation.  Attributed to IL-2.
   CYANOSIS
 toes improved.  Fingers persist.
   RENAL CELL CA -- metastatitc, now receiving IL-2 (last dose [**2124-3-3**]).
   Monitor exam, electrolytes.
   EOSINOPHILIA --  attributed in part to medications, including IL-2.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT  -- Poor PO intake.  Unable to provide TF while
   receiving mask ventilation.  Consider TPN.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo male with RCC here 3 days s/p IL2 infusion with shock, likely
   septic in etiology, renal failure, and altered mental status.
   .
   #. Shock: Likely etiology is septic shock from MRSA exacerbated by
   distributive physiology from IL-2, though now with GPC
s in pairs and
   chains and GPC
s in pairs on BAL despite, cefepime, flagyl, levoflox,
   and vanc there is good reason to be concerned about VRE versus Vanco
   faillure MRSA.  No evidence of obstructive, cardiogenic shock on repeat
   TTE.  No evidence of adrenal insufficiency.  Antibiotic coverage
   includes health-care associated agents.  Fluid status is total body
   overloaded, but may have been intravascularly dry given FeNa 0.7.
   Likely has large insensible losses through skin.  Lactate trending
   down.  Given CPSA bacteremia, skin, line, and endocarditis are possible
   sources.  Thromboembolic dz is on differential.
   - cont cefepime, flagyl, levoflox, and vanc, dosed for CVVH
   - cont neo and vaso, wean neo if possible for MAP > 65, CVP 10-12
   - surveillance blood cultures
   -  LENIs and HIT Ab (-)
   -  right SCL line removed, right IJ placed
   -  f/u multiple blood/fungal cultures, and BAL cultures
   -  would not advance abx unless clinically worsening
   .
   #  A. fib with RVR-  likely [**3-14**] volume overload and atrial stretch.
   Other factors to consider include myocardial ischmemia.  Underlying
   sepsis also likely contributing.  Patient received to attempts at DC
   cardioversion, 100 and 150 joules, which were successful and converted
   patient back into NSR, with improving blood pressure.  Patient
   unfortunately converted back into a. fib with RVR within seconds.  Amio
   bolus and drip started.  Now back in NSR.
   -  will cont amio gtt to complete full amio load, defer PO amio
   -  two sets of cardiac markers flat
   -  no new WMAs, no evidence of endocarditis on TTE
   -  will need to consider anti-coagulation in future if chemical
   cardioversion unsuccessful
     .
   #  Persistent GPC bacteremia- possible source includes skin, line, less
   likely endocarditis.  [**Month (only) 51**] represent vancomycin faillure of MRSA
   treatment versus VRE
   -  will f/u cultures, surveillance cultures
   -  Consider switch to linezolide if worsening
   .
   #  Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure-  Decreased respiratory drive
   likely [**3-14**] depressed mental status, sedation.  Serial ABGs showed mild
   resp and metabolic acidosis.  Plan per team had been to leave him on
   these settings, keep him sedated and when and if his shock is resolved
   to wean him and attempt to extubate.  At the moment there is medical
   need for sedation because his CVVH stops with even the slightest
   motion.
   .
   #. ARF: IL-2 mediated ARF most likely, however prerenal or ischemic ATN
   also possible.  No evidence of obstruction in right collecting system
   on renal ultrasound.   FeNa 0.7.  Does show some UOP response to IVF
   boluses.  Lactate improved.  Also on differential is pulm-renal
   syndrome.
   - follow up Renal recs, appreciate input, cont CVVH, run even today,
   attempt to cont to wean pressors
   - anti-GBM, [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA all (-)
   - would start to run negative tomorrw
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy- no evidence of hemorrhage.
   Thrombocytopenia etiology iatrogenic vs. consumptive.  Increased INR
   could be [**3-14**] poor nutrition, consumption, DIC.  No schistocytes on
   smear.
   -  fibrinogen normal.  Could have low grade DIC in setting of sepsis
   -  will give FFP and platelets to correct coagulopathy, provide colloid
   to intravascular volume,
   -  HIT Ab (-)
   -  d/c
d SC heparin
   .
   #. RCC: finished week 2 of IL-2.  Side effects of IL-2 include
   myocarditis, ectopy, neurotoxicity, tyrombcytopenia, hypocalcemia, and
   hyperbilirubinemia.
   - tele
   - f/u Heme/Onc recs, appreciate input
   - will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12918**] -> ? steroids given persistent
   eosinophilia
   .
   FEN: CVVH, replete lytes, will start TFs
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with SCDs, cont to hold SC heparin in setting of
   thrombocytopenia
   -Bowel regimen
   -PPI
   -Pain management with morphine/tylenol;  midaz and fent for sedation
   post-extubation
   .
   ACCESS: right IJ triple lumen, a-line, PIV, left HD line -> will pull

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who has been admitted to the ICU for three days. The patient has experienced several medical complications and is currently receiving multiple treatments.

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to MRSA infection, which was exacerbated by the distributive physiology from IL-2 infusion. Despite receiving antibiotics (cefepime, flagyl, levofloxacin, and vancomycin), the patient still has gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains in the blood culture, suggesting a possible VRE infection. There is no evidence of obstructive or cardiogenic shock.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to sepsis or other factors. The patient is sedated and intubated.

3. Hypercapneic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypercapneic respiratory failure, likely due to decreased respiratory drive caused by depressed mental status and sedation. The plan is to keep the patient sedated and attempt to wean off ventilation when the shock resolves.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient likely has ARF, possibly caused by IL-2 mediated ARF, prerenal or ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or pulmonary-renal syndrome. The patient's FeNa is 0.7, and there is some urine output response to intravenous fluid boluses"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Fluid overload persists
   albet unable to start diuresis as discussed below.  Appears comfortable
   on current sedation.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):
 SHOCK, SEPTIC:  WBC decreased.  Redose vancomycin. Continues on
   vasopressin, neo weaned off.  Has GPC in blood culture albeit in
   pairs/chains - may be a contaminant since other signs suggest
   improvement (decreased leukocytosis, weaning off pressors).  Will
   follow up on final ID on GPC.  Continue current antibiotics.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Continues CRT, goal
   to keep I/Os even until off vasopressin, then hopefully will be able to
   start to diurese given he is very total body fluid overloaded.
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM):
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION:
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE:  HITT negative. Platelets stable.  Hct down
   albeit significantly positive fluid status.  Repeat this afternoon to
   be sure not continuing to trend down. No signs of active bleeding.

   `
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and hypotension.

Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient's blood oxygenation is maintained at 100% with an FiO2 of 40%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.43, indicating normal acid-base balance.

Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension despite being on vasopressin and other pressors. The blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, which could be a contaminant or indicate an ongoing infection. The white blood cell count is decreasing, suggesting an improving infection.

Acute Renal Failure: The patient is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with a goal to keep input/output (I/O) even until off vasopressin. The serum creatinine levels are elevated at 2.6, 2.2, and 1.7 mg/dL.

Metabolic Acidosis: The ABG results show a decreased bicarbonate level of 32 mEq/L and an increased base excess of -1, indicating metabolic acidosis.

   TTE.  No evidence of adrenal insufficiency.  Antibiotic coverage
   includes health-care associated agents.  Fluid status is total body
   overloaded, but may have been intravascularly dry given FeNa 0.7.
   Likely has large insensible losses through skin.  Lactate trending
   down.  Given CPSA bacteremia, skin, line, and endocarditis are possible
   sources.  Thromboembolic dz is on differential.  Enterococcus in blood,

   sepsis also likely contributing.  Patient received to attempts at DC
   cardioversion, 100 and 150 joules, which were successful and converted
   patient back into NSR, with improving blood pressure.  Patient
   unfortunately converted back into a. fib with RVR within seconds.  Amio

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who has been admitted to the ICU for shock, likely septic in etiology, renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including cefepime, flagyl, levofloxacin, and vancomycin for suspected MRSA infection. However, the blood cultures have grown Enterococcus species, and there is a concern for vancomycin failure or VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) infection.

The patient's condition is complex and involves several potential medical complications. These include respiratory failure due to depressed mental status and sedation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, shock (likely septic), acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing the current antibiotic regimen, switching to linezolid if there is no improvement, surveillance blood cultures, and further investigation into the source of the infection. The patient's CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) will be continued, and efforts will be made to wean off sedation and attempt extubation when the patient's condition stabilizes.

The patient's medical history includes RCC and recent infusion of IL-2 (interleukin-2), which can cause various"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with shock, renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and is currently sedated and intubated. Blood cultures were taken and showed growth of enterococcus. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics including linezolid, cefepime, metronidazole, and levofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they continue to experience multi-organ dysfunction. They have acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, shock, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, impaired skin integrity, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The presence of enterococcus in the blood culture indicates a potential bloodstream infection. This can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not treated promptly.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure puts them at risk for further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute renal failure increases the risk of further kidney damage and the need for dialysis.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count and prolonged clotting times suggest a coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.

   .
   #. Shock: Likely etiology is septic shock from MRSA exacerbated by
   distributive physiology from IL-2, though now with GPC
s in pairs and
   chains and GPC
s in pairs on BAL despite, cefepime, flagyl, levoflox,
   and vanc there is good reason to be concerned about VRE versus Vanco
   faillure MRSA.  [**3-10**] blood cx now grew Enterococcus.  No evidence of
   obstructive, cardiogenic shock on repeat TTE.  No evidence of adrenal
   insufficiency.  Antibiotic coverage includes health-care associated
   agents.  Fluid status is total body overloaded, but may have been
   intravascularly dry last week given FeNa 0.7 prior to CVVH.  Likely has
   large insensible losses through skin.  Lactate trending down.  Given
   CPSA and Enterococcus bacteremia, skin, line, and GI tract are possible
   sources.  Thromboembolic dz is on differential.

   .
   #  A. fib with RVR-  likely [**3-14**] volume overload and atrial stretch.
   Other factors to consider include myocardial ischmemia.  Underlying
   sepsis also likely contributing.  Patient received to attempts at DC
   cardioversion, 100 and 150 joules, which were successful and converted
   patient back into NSR, with improving blood pressure.  Patient
   unfortunately converted back into a. fib with RVR within seconds.  Amio
   bolus and drip started.  Now back in NSR.
   -  will cont amio gtt to complete full amio load, defer PO amio
   -  two sets of cardiac markers flat
   -  no new WMAs, no evidence of endocarditis on TTE
   -  will need to consider anti-coagulation in future if chemical
   cardioversion unsuccessful

   #  MRSA bacteremia, now with Enterococcus bacteremia- possible source
   includes skin, line, less likely endocarditis.  [**Month (only) 51**] represent
   vancomycin faillure of MRSA treatment versus VRE given Enterococcus
   -  will f/u cultures, surveillance cultures
   -  will cont Linezolid until speciation

   #  Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure-  Decreased respiratory drive
   likely [**3-14**] depressed mental status, sedation.  Serial ABGs showed mild
   resp and metabolic acidosis.  Plan per team had been to leave him on
   these settings, keep him sedated and when and if his shock is resolved
   to wean him and attempt to extubate.  At the moment there is medical
   need for sedation because his CVVH stops with even the slightest
   motion.
   - resp alkalosis, will monitor with serial ABGs
   - daily lifting of sedation if tolerable from CVVH standpoint
   .
   #. ARF: IL-2 mediated ARF most likely, however prerenal or ischemic ATN
   also possible.  No evidence of obstruction in right collecting system
   on renal ultrasound.   FeNa 0.7.  Does show some UOP response to IVF
   boluses.  Lactate improved.  Also on differential is pulm-renal
   syndrome.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who has been admitted to the ICU for shock, likely septic in etiology, renal failure, and altered mental status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Shock: The patient's initial presentation suggests septic shock, likely caused by MRSA infection. However, with the growth of Enterococcus in the blood cultures, there is a concern for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infection. This can lead to continued hypotension and organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercapneic respiratory failure, which is likely due to decreased respiratory drive caused by sedation and depressed mental status. There is a need for close monitoring of ABGs and consideration of weaning off sedation when appropriate.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which could be due to IL-2 infusion, prerenal causes, ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or obstructive uropathy. Monitoring renal function and adjusting treatment accordingly is crucial.

4. Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: The patient has thrombocytopenia and increased INR, suggesting a possible coagulopathy. This could be due to iatrogenic causes, consumptive coagulopathy, or low-grade disseminated intr"

   intravascularly dry last week given FeNa 0.7 prior to CVVH.  Likely has
   large insensible losses through skin.  Lactate trending down.  Given
   CPSA and Enterococcus bacteremia, skin, line, and GI tract are possible

   sepsis also likely contributing.  Patient received to attempts at DC
   cardioversion, 100 and 150 joules, which were successful and converted
   patient back into NSR, with improving blood pressure.  Patient

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma who was admitted to the ICU three days ago. He presented with shock, likely due to septicemia caused by MRSA, as well as renal failure and altered mental status. The patient received multiple infusions of IL-2 for his RCC, which may have contributed to his condition.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has developed hypercapneic respiratory failure. His blood cultures have grown Enterococcus, and he is also positive for gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains on a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The source of infection is suspected to be the skin, line, or gastrointestinal tract. The patient's renal function has worsened, and he is currently on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH). He also has thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.

The patient's atrial fibrillation was successfully cardioverted back to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) twice, but he converted back to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB-RVR) within seconds. Amiodarone was started, and the patient is now in NSR.

The patient's hypercapneic respiratory failure is likely due to decreased respiratory drive caused by sedation and depressed mental status. The plan is to continue sedation until the patient's shock resolves and then attempt to wean him off mechanical ventilation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are experiencing respiratory failure and have been placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently being treated with an amiodarone infusion. They also have acute renal failure and are undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). The patient has a positive blood culture for enterococcus bacteremia and is being started on linezolid. They have been off pressors since yesterday afternoon. The patient's nutritional status is a concern, as indicated by high residuals. There are no signs of deep vein thrombosis or thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating severe respiratory distress. This condition can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is in atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure. Maintaining adequate rate control and preventing clot formation are crucial.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately. This condition requires careful monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as managing the underlying cause.
4. Enterococcus bacteremia: The presence of enterococcus bacteremia indicates a systemic infection that requires prompt treatment to prevent complications"

   68 yo male with RCC presenting 3 days s/p IL2 infusion with shock,
   renal failure and altered mental status now with blood cultures
   positive for VRE and MRSA.
   .
   #  BACTEREMIA: MRSA and VRE. Likely [**3-14**] skin breakdown and/or line
   infection and VRE perhas GI, also possibly endocarditis but less
   likely.
   -continue linezolid
   -consider narrowing coverage for PNA
   -stool cultures for cdiff, continue metronidazole until neg x3
   -surveilllance cultures
   -will need to change HD and CV lines when cultures negative and
   consider changing sooner if persistantly positive
   -TEE if bacteremia persists
   #. Shock: Likely etiology is septic shock from MRSA/VRE exacerbated by
   distributive physiology from IL-2,.  No evidence of obstructive,
   cardiogenic shock on repeat TTE.  No evidence of adrenal
   insufficiency.  Antibiotic coverage includes health-care associated
   agents.  Fluid status is total body overloaded, but may have been
   intravascularly dry last week given FeNa 0.7 prior to CVVH.  Likely has
   large insensible losses through skin.  Lactate trending down.  Given
   CPSA and Enterococcus bacteremia, skin, line, and GI tract are possible
   sources.  Thromboembolic dz is on differential.
   - cont cefepime, flagyl, levoflox, and vanc, dosed for CVVH, today day

   - will cont linezolid until speciation of Enterococcus
   -  weaned off pressors
   -  surveillance blood cultures
   -  LENIs and HIT Ab (-)
   -  f/u multiple blood/fungal cultures, and BAL cultures
   -  resited a-line
   .
   #  A. fib with RVR-  Now in NSR on amiodarone drip.
   likely [**3-14**] volume overload and atrial stretch.  Other factors to
   consider include myocardial ischmemia.  Underlying sepsis also likely
   contributing.  Patient received to attempts at DC cardioversion, 100
   and 150 joules, which were successful and converted patient back into
   NSR, with improving blood pressure.  Patient unfortunately converted
   back into a. fib with RVR within seconds..
   -  will cont amio gtt to complete full amio load, defer PO amio
   -  ruled out for MI with flat CEs x3 two
   -  no new WMAs, no evidence of endocarditis on TTE
   -  will need to consider anti-coagulation in future if chemical
   cardioversion unsuccessful
   .
   #  Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure-  Decreased respiratory drive
   likely [**3-14**] depressed mental status, sedation.  Serial ABGs showed mild
   resp and metabolic acidosis.  Plan per team had been to leave him on
   these settings, keep him sedated and when and if his shock is resolved
   to wean him and attempt to extubate.  At the moment there is medical
   need for sedation because his CVVH stops with even the slightest
   motion.
   - resp alkalosis now resolved, will monitor with serial ABGs
   - daily lifting of sedation if tolerable from CVVH standpoint
   .
   #. ARF: most likely [**3-14**] ATN from hypoperfusion vs IL-2 mediated ARF.
   anti-GBM, [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA all (-). UOP improving
   - appreciate renal recs
   - cont CVVH, goal is (-) 3-4 liters/day as long as SBP >100
   - PM lytes
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy- no evidence of hemorrhage.
   Thrombocytopenia etiology iatrogenic vs. consumptive.  Increased INR
   could be [**3-14**] poor nutrition, consumption, DIC.  No schistocytes on
   smear.
   -  fibrinogen normal.  Could have low grade DIC in setting of sepsis
   -  will give FFP and platelets to correct coagulopathy if coags worsen
   -  HIT Ab (-)

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with shock, renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has experienced episodes of AFib with rapid ventricular response. It is important to maintain sinus rhythm and control heart rate to prevent hemodynamic instability and potential complications such as stroke.

3. Shock: The patient is suspected to have septic shock secondary to the bacteremia. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics and supportive care are crucial to manage this condition.

4. Renal failure: The patient is already experiencing acute renal failure, which may be due to either acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypoperfusion or interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy-related nephrotoxicity. Continued monitoring of renal function and consideration of renal replacement therapy (e.g., continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration) may be required.

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has multiple medical complications. The arterial line was stopped on 03/12/2124 at 08:39 AM and restarted at 03:23 PM on the same day. The patient continues to be on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). The left arterial line was removed and sent for culture.

The patient's GPCs (gram-positive cocci) from 03/10/2124 were positive for VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus) and they are continuing linezolid. The patient also has high residuals on therapeutic fluid (TFs) and tried reglan. The ID (infection department) recommends pulling off cefepime and ciprofloxacin given the negative blood cultures, deferred until rounds. They also suggested C. diff (clostridium difficile) tests, if negative three times, discontinuing flagyl; if positive, PO vancomycin for two weeks and an antibiotic course for MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and VRE bacteremia.

The patient's allergies include penicillins and unspecified allergies.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with shock, renal failure, and altered mental status after receiving IL-2 infusion. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by MRSA and VRE. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. The need for prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. This condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.

3. Shock: The patient initially presented with shock, likely due to septic shock caused by MRSA and VRE bacteremia. There is a risk of recurrent or persistent shock if the infection is not adequately controlled.

4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis from hypoperfusion or IL-2-mediated renal injury. Close monitoring of renal function and ongoing management of fluid and electrolyte balance are necessary.

5. Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy: The patient has thrombocytopenia with a low platelet count, which could be due to iatrogenic causes or consumptive coagulopathy. This increases the risk of bleeding or thrombotic events.

6. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient is hypercapnic and requires continuous mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if sedation is reduced or if weaning from mechanical ventilation fails.

7. Line infections: Given the presence of central venous catheters and arterial lines, there is a risk of line-related infections, which can worsen the patient's condition.

8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to prolonged immobility and the presence of malignancy, the patient is at increased risk for DVT. Prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin is recommended.

9. Malnutrition: Prolonged hospitalization and critical illness can lead to malnutrition. Nutritional support should be considered to optimize recovery.

10. Infection control measures: With positive blood cultures for MRSA and VRE, strict infection control measures should be implemented to prevent the spread of these resistant organisms.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of sepsis and is now tolerating CVVH diuresis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36 C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105-159 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema, warm skin with desquamative rash, and diminished pulses in the upper and lower extremities. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The coagulation profile is also abnormal with prolonged PT and PTT. The electrolyte levels are within normal range, but the glucose level is elevated. The microbiology results indicate a negative c-diff infection. 

The patient's current medical issues include respiratory failure, bacteremia, atrial fibrillation, shock, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, and hypotension. The patient is being treated with various medications and interventions such as antibiotics, diuretics, sedation, and dialysis. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and consider extubation if successful.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma who presented with shock, bacteremia, renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient has shown improvement with blood cultures persistently negative on antibiotics and is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient is also running a net negative on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and does not require pressors for the past two days.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Extubation is limited by agitation and delirium. The plan is to decrease fentanyl and midazolam by half, administer Haldol for agitation, wean off midazolam, reassess mental status, and reconsider extubation.

2. Bacteremia: The patient is being treated with Linezolid for MRSA and VRE, and completed cefepime and levofloxacin for E. coli UTI. No new growth has been observed in surveillance cultures. Metronidazole is being used empirically for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) until the C. diff test results are negative. The plan is to continue Linezolid until day 5, discontinue Flagyl when the last C. diff test is negative, follow up with tip culture, continue surveillance cultures, and maintain awareness of lines.

   likely was in setting of sepsis, volume overload. on amiodarone, in
   NSR. ROMI complete.
   - will amio through extubation and then stop and see if stays in NSR
 SHOCK, OTHER
   now weaned off pressors and stable. Likely IL-2 related +/- bacteremia
   - antibiotics and surveilllance cultures as above
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   likely ATN, on CVVH, UOP stable to improving 20-30 cc/hr
   -continue CVVH with goal net negative 100-200 hr
   -per renal, may be ready for HD tomorrow, which would help with
   reducing [**Month/Year (2) 6573**], extubating
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE
   Likely in setting of sepsis, improving
   -start Heparin DVT proph
 COAGULOPATHY
   likely in setting of sepsis, stable to improving
   may also be nutritional contribution, and will readdress nutrition when
   successfully extubated
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
   as above, will readdress when extubated
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   now sedated but with plan to lighten. Will keep cerebral edema from

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points. 68M met RCC p/w septic shock s/p IL-2. BCx
   +MRSA / VRE - remains on linezolid and flagyl with c diff pending (neg
   X 2). Remains off pressors. Tolerating volume removal w/ CVVH (4.8L).
   On PS overngiht now on SBT.

   bb. S1S2, no M, Soft +BS. 1+ dependent edema. Labs notable for WBC
   14.6K, HCT 22, plt 87 (up), K+ 4.4, Cr 0.8. CXR with improving volume
   overload,
   Agree with plan to manage IL2 capillary leak/ VRE/MRSA sepsis with day
   [**5-24**] linezolid IV, will continue flagyl pending c.diff rule out. He is
   doing well on SBT, with main barrier to extubation his MS/[**Month/Year (2) 6573**].
   Will decrease versed/fentanyl further and reasses, monitoring  for
   signs of withdrawal. He remains off pressors, now improved
   hemodynamically. ARF improving based on UOP, continue CVVH for volume
   removal, which he is well tolerating with improved line flow.  D/w
   renal timing for switch to HD, would consider line holiday.  AF w/ RVR
   improved on amio, will continue for now, possibly d/c post-extubation,
   continue to hold off on anticoagulation for now. Repeat hct and
   follow, minimize phelbatomy. Reassess MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 6573**] decreased,
   while [**Last Name (Titles) 6573**] effects likely, if remains altered consider IL2
   effect.  Ongoing communication with family. Remainder of plan as
   outlined above.
   ICU: Will resume sq heparin, PPI, TFs held for possible extubation.
   Patient is critically ill

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with shock, bacteremia, renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient has been improving with blood cultures persistently negative on antibiotics and is tolerating pressure-controlled ventilation (PSV). The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, bacteremia, atrial fibrillation (AF), shock, acute renal failure (ARF), thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still on mechanical ventilation, which indicates ongoing respiratory support. Extubation may be limited due to agitation and delirium.

2. Bacteremia: The patient is on linezolid for MRSA and VRE, and completed cefepime and levofloxacin for E. coli UTI. There is no new growth in surveillance cultures, but the patient remains on metronidazole for empirical c.diff until the last c.diff negative. The risk of bacterial infection persists.

3. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient likely developed AF in the setting of sepsis and volume overload. The patient is on amiodarone and is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The plan is to continue amiodarone through extubation and then stop"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo male with RCC presenting 3 days s/p IL2 infusion with shock,
   bacteremia, renal failure and altered mental status now improving with
   blood cultures persistantly negative on antibiotics, tolerating PSV,
   running net negative on CVVH, nolonger requiring pressors.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): Patient passed breathing
   trial.  Can be extubated today as mental status is improving.  Will
   continue to follow respiratory status.
 BACTEREMIA:
   On Linezolid for MRSA and VRE. Completed cefepime and levo for Ecoli
   UTI. no new growth in surveillance cultures. Metronidazole for empiric
   cdiff, can d/c when [**4-12**] cdiffs negative
   - continue linezolid [**3-14**] is day [**6-23**] -> can likely be transitioned to
   po
   - d/c flagyl - last cdiff negative
   - f/u tip culture and repeat blood cultures
   - will address removal of lines as renal function improves (see below)
   and nolonger requires pressors
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Likely was in setting of sepsis, volume
   overload. On amiodarone, though currently NSR. ROMI complete.
   - Can likely d/c amiodarone, will follow post-extubation
 SHOCK, OTHER: Likely IL2 vs sepsis

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented three days after receiving IL2 infusion with shock, bacteremia, renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient has been improving with blood cultures persistently negative on antibiotics, tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV), running a net negative on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), and no longer requiring vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a potential risk of extubation failure if the patient's mental status does not continue to improve.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, likely caused by MRSA and VRE. There is a potential risk of recurrent or persistent bacteremia if appropriate antibiotic therapy is not continued or if new sources of infection are introduced.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There is a potential risk of worsening renal function if CVVH is discontinued prematurely or if there are complications related to the dialysis catheter.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute thrombocytopenia, which is stable at present. There is a potential risk of bleeding if the platelet count drops further.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has improved coagulopathy but remains"

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points. 68M met RCC p/w septic shock s/p IL-2. BCx
   +MRSA / VRE - remains on linezolid and flagyl with c diff pending (neg
   X 2). Remains off pressors. Tolerating volume removal w/ CVVH (4.8L).
   On PS overngiht now on SBT.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.6  BP 150/78  HR 80  RR 16 w/ sat 99 on PS
   5/0 (TV 400) RSBI 30 --> 7.45/36/123  Minimally arousable, not
   following commands,  Necrotic fingertips. Coarse BS, decreased
   bb. S1S2, no M, Soft +BS. 1+ dependent edema. Labs notable for WBC
   14.6K, HCT 22, plt 87 (up), K+ 4.4, Cr 0.8. CXR with improving volume
   overload,
   Agree with plan to manage IL2 capillary leak/ VRE/MRSA sepsis with day
   [**5-24**] linezolid IV, will continue flagyl pending c.diff rule out. He is
   doing well on SBT, with main barrier to extubation his MS/[**Month/Year (2) 6573**].
   Will decrease versed/fentanyl further and reasses, monitoring  for
   signs of withdrawal. He remains off pressors, now improved
   hemodynamically. ARF improving based on UOP, continue CVVH for volume
   removal, which he is well tolerating with improved line flow.  D/w
   renal timing for switch to HD, would consider line holiday.  AF w/ RVR
   improved on amio, will continue for now, possibly d/c post-extubation,
   continue to hold off on anticoagulation for now. Repeat hct and
   follow, minimize phelbatomy. Reassess MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 6573**] decreased,
   while [**Last Name (Titles) 6573**] effects likely, if remains altered consider IL2
   effect.  Ongoing communication with family. Remainder of plan as
   outlined above.
   ICU: Will resume sq heparin, PPI, TFs held for possible extubation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented to the ICU after experiencing shock, bacteremia, renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient has been improving and is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient's blood cultures have been persistently negative, and he is on antibiotics for MRSA and VRE. He has completed courses of cefepime and levofloxacin for suspected E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is also on metronidazole for empiric Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. He is now weaned off pressors and is stable. The patient has acute thrombocytopenia, likely due to sepsis, and is being started on heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. There is a concern for impaired skin integrity and altered mental status, which may be related to malnutrition. The patient's renal function is improving, and he may be ready for hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow. The main barrier to extubation is his altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and has a history of acute respiratory failure. There is a plan to extubate him once his mental status improves.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has persistent bacteremia, and his"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and bacteremia caused by IL2/VRE and MRSA. He has shown improvement in his vitals, mental status, and renal function. The patient's current conditions include bacteremia, anemia, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, gangrene of the fingertips, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, alteration in nutrition, altered mental status, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is receiving various treatments including antibiotics, blood transfusion, dialysis, and wound care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient still has bacteremia, which can lead to further systemic infections.
2. Gangrene: The patient's fingertips are showing signs of gangrene, which can progress and require amputation if not properly managed.
3. Thrombocytopenia: Although the patient's thrombocytopenia has resolved, it is essential to monitor the platelet count and coagulation status to prevent bleeding complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status should be closely monitored, as coagulopathy can lead to excessive bleeding.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure needs close monitoring, and further interventions may be required to maintain kidney function.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is likely experiencing atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke if not"

 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
   68 yo male with RCC presenting 3 days s/p IL2 infusion with shock,
   bacteremia, renal failure and altered mental status now improving with
   blood cultures persistantly negative on antibiotics, tolerating PSV,
   running net negative on CVVH, nolonger requiring pressors.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): Patient passed breathing
   trial.  Can be extubated today as mental status is improving.  Will
   continue to follow respiratory status.
 BACTEREMIA:
   On Linezolid for MRSA and VRE. Completed cefepime and levo for Ecoli
   UTI. no new growth in surveillance cultures. Metronidazole for empiric
   cdiff, can d/c when [**4-12**] cdiffs negative
   - continue linezolid [**3-14**] is day [**6-23**] -> can likely be transitioned to
   po
   - d/c flagyl - last cdiff negative
   - f/u tip culture and repeat blood cultures
   - will address removal of lines as renal function improves (see below)
   and nolonger requires pressors
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Likely was in setting of sepsis, volume
   overload. On amiodarone, though currently NSR. ROMI complete.
   - Can likely d/c amiodarone, will follow post-extubation
 SHOCK, OTHER: Likely IL2 vs sepsis
   - Continue abx (see above)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) :Likely ATN, on CVVH.
   UOP has improved remarkadly.  Will likely not require HD.
   -D/w renal, will likely not need HD as UOP continues to improve.
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE: Stable.
 COAGULOPATHY: Improved
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION: Tube feeds have been on hold, patient w/
   high residuals.  Post-extubation will get Speech and Swallow consult,
   advance diet as tolerated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with shock, bacteremia, and acute renal failure after receiving IL2 infusion. The patient has shown improvement in mental status, respiratory status, and renal function. The patient is now extubated and no longer requires pressors. The patient's blood cultures have been negative, and he has completed antibiotics for MRSA, VRE, and E. coli UTI.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bacteremia: The patient initially presented with bacteremia, but his blood cultures have been persistently negative on antibiotics. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and his urine output has improved remarkably. It is recommended to continue CVVH until renal function fully recovers.

3. Gangrene: The patient has gangrene of the fingertips. Wound care should be continued as recommended.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute thrombocytopenia, which is stable. Close monitoring of platelet levels is necessary.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy has improved. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters is required.

6. Altered Mental Status"
