","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse presenting after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, spine fracture, anemia, hypernatremia, and other medical conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure, which was likely multifactorial including bronchospasm, hypoventilation from narcotics, and potential aspiration. There is still a significant A-a gradient, and the chest x-ray shows underpenetrated lung fields with potential effusion on the right. This suggests the possibility of additional pulmonary edema. The patient's hypernatremia limits her ability to diurese. Therefore, close monitoring of her respiratory status and consideration of further interventions such as daily chest x-ray, holding on CT chest or airway pending IP consult, IP consult, and adjusting ventilator settings are necessary.

2. Spine fracture: The patient has a traumatic T spine fracture that is neurologically intact distally. Previous notes from neurosurgeons indicate no surgical procedure is needed, and the patient will continue with a spine brace. It is important to monitor the patient's distal neurologic function and ensure adherence to the spine brace protocol.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased from approximately 40% on admission to 30% without signs of active GI bleed or other"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU after a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure, fever, hypotension, and anemia. She is on mechanical ventilation with a low respiratory rate and tidal volume set at 500 mL. Her blood pressure is unstable, and she has low urine output despite fluid boluses. She has edema in her right upper extremity and mildly increased warmth compared to the left side. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, low magnesium, and normal liver function tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is initially multifactorial, including bronchospasm, hypoventilation from narcotics, and potential aspiration. She has an A-a gradient and her chest X-ray shows small lung fields and potential effusion on the right, which could be due to pneumonia.
2. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could be caused by various infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), infected PICC line, or urinary tract infection (UTI). Cultures have been sent, and she is being treated with empiric antibiotics.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or cardiogenic causes. Given her fever and falling hematocrit, sepsis is likely"

   in differential given falling hematocrit.  BP responded well to fluid
   boluses but urine output low.
   - Monitor BP and urine output.
   - Consider additional fluid boluses.
   - If patient

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse presenting after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to a potential aspiration event, fever, hypotension, anemia, spine fracture, hypernatremia, and right upper extremity edema.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.7 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 96/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on supplemental oxygen. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a radial pulse of 2+ bilaterally, and her fluid balance indicates an intake of 10 mL and output of 425 mL.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with settings of assist-control (AC) 500, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 32 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. She is also receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam for sedation.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 333 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 6 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 130 mg/dL. Other lab"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU following a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial including bronchospasm, hypoventilation from narcotics, and potential aspiration. The chest X-ray shows underpenetrated lung fields and a potential effusion on the right side, which could be related to pneumonia given her fever.

The patient has developed several complications since admission. She had a fever with a temperature of 102.7°F at 4:00 am, along with hypotension to 83/38 mmHg at 6:15 am. Her blood pressure responded well to a fluid bolus but her urine output remained low. Antibiotics were initiated for suspected infection, including coverage for gram positives, gram negatives, anaerobes, MRSA, and MDR pathogens.

The patient also has anemia with a hematocrit of 30.7%, which is down from 40% on admission. There are no signs of active GI bleed or other source of blood loss. The cause of the anemia could be related to fluid administration, phlebotomy, anemia of inflammation, or active bleed. The patient's sodium levels improved from 150 to 147 today, most likely due to inadequate free water repletion. The right upper extremity (RUE) shows ed"

","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented following a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, fever, hypotension, anemia, and other medical complications. 

Respiratory failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure likely due to multiple factors including bronchospasm, hypoventilation from narcotics, and potential aspiration. Her chest X-ray showed small lung fields and potential effusion on the right, which could be related to pneumonia given her fever.

Fever: The patient developed a fever, which may be caused by various infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), infected PICC line, or urinary tract infection (UTI). Cultures have been sent, and she is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or cardiogenic causes. Given her fever, sepsis seems likely, but hypovolemia remains in the differential given her falling hematocrit. Her blood pressure responded well to fluid boluses, but her urine output is still low.

Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have decreased from around 40% on admission to 30% now, without signs of active GI bleed or other sources of blood loss. This could be related to fluid administration, phlebotomy, anemia of inflammation, or ongoing blood loss"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill obese woman who has undergone treatment for a traumatic spine injury. She is experiencing respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been evaluated for a possible tracheobronchomalacia stent placement. She has developed new fevers and hypotension, which may indicate a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection. The patient has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. Her last dose of antibiotics was metronidazole on 09/20/2167 at 08:00 AM. She is receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam, as well as other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.7 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 110/55 mmHg to 154/71 mmHg, heart rate between 72-97 beats per minute, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1043 mL and output of 425 mL through the first 24 hours. Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (9.7 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin (9.7 g/dL), elevated platelet count (333 K/uL), and abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of spine injury from [**State 507**] Med, who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. She also requires a stent for tracheobronchomalacia. The patient has been experiencing fevers, transient hypotension, and has shown signs of fluid responsiveness. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 102.7°F (39.3°C), blood pressure of 110/55 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial cause of respiratory failure is unclear, but she needs to be assessed for current mechanics and reserve. It is suggested to switch to Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) and observe her ability to pull ventilation independently.
2. New Fevers and Transient Hypotension: The patient is experiencing fevers and transient hypotension, which could be indicative of various conditions such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), aspiration pneumonia (asp PNA), or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). The patient has penicillin and beta-lactam allergies, so alternative antibiotics like Levofloxacin, Aztreonam, Vancomycin, and Flagyl have been ordered for VAP and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill obese woman who has undergone treatment for a traumatic spine injury. She is experiencing respiratory failure and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient has developed new fevers and hypotension, indicating a possible infection. She also has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa drugs. The patient's vital signs show a high body temperature, low blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. Her oxygen saturation is 100% and she is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 12, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results are within normal range. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which may worsen if the mechanical ventilation settings are not optimized or if there is an underlying infection.
2. Infection: The patient's new fevers and hypotension could indicate an infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to septic shock caused by an underlying infection.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, which need to be corrected carefully to avoid complications like osmotic demyelination syndrome.
5. Spine fracture: The patient has a spine fracture, and appropriate management is necessary to prevent further complications related to spinal cord injury."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture
   # Respiratory failure: initial etiology unclear, likely multifactorial
   including bronchspasm, hypoventilation from narcotics, potential
   aspiration, infection.  By report, had a neg evaluation for PE at OSH,
   however, unable to open disc to confirm.  Concern for VAP.
   - Failed yesterday
s NIF; score was -15
   - Increased FiO2 overnight.  Had increased pCO2 which resolved with
   increasing RR
   - IP stopped by but will complete official consult today; suggested
   repeating CT scan
   - Need to contact [**Name (NI) 507**] Medical re previous CT scan.  Can attempt to
   resend disc.  Otherwise, will most likely benefit from repeat CT to
   look for acute pulm process such as PE or PNA.
   # Fever: Likely due to combination of infection and DVT.  Cultures
   sent.  Will treat with empiric antibiotics.  Tylenol PRN for fever.
   - Known RUE DVT
   - Infectious etiologies include VAP, asp PNA, line infections.  Removed
   PICC yesterday and cultured tip.  Mini-BAL- gram stain neg.  Sputum
   grew GPC in pairs and GPR.  Flagyl, aztreonam, vancomycin, levofloxacin
   for coverage of gram positives, gram negatives, anaerobes, MRSA.  Urine
   and blood cultures NGTD
   - f/u blood, urine, and sputum cultures.
   - Concern for abd cause; KUB unrevealing.  High residuals.  [**Month (only) 8**] require
   further imaging
   # Transient hypotension: Has been somewhat fluid responsive; UOP [**11-12**]
   ccs/hr.  Diff dx includes hypovolemia, sepsis, cardiogenic.
   - Sepsis most likely given fever.
   - HCT decreasing; ? stable at 24-25
   - Unable to place central line despite multiple attempts.  First tired
   left IJ [**2-14**] RUE DVT.  2^nd attempt in left IJ.  Can place femoral if pt
   requires more active repletion
   # RUE DVT: Have held on starting treatment in light of need for central
   access.  Can start therapeutic heparin vs Lovenox with bridge to
   coumadin.
    # Abd distention:
   -KUB unrevealing
   -High residuals
   -[**Month (only) 8**] benefit from further imaging; if unstable consider ultrasound,
   however, if pt can tolerate it, a CT scan might be more helpful.  Can
   also scan chest and pelvis.
   # Anemia: On admission to [**Hospital 507**] Medical Center, Hct was ~40, now down
   to 30 and then 25 w/o sign of active GI bleed or other source of blood
   loss.  [**Month (only) 8**] be related to fluid administration, phlebotomy, anemia of
   inflammation, active bleed still considered in differential.
   - trend Hct
   - guaiac stools
   - S/p failed attempts at line placement; watch for neck hematomas
   # Spine fracture: neurologically intact distal to the lesion. prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - monitor distal neurologic function
   - cto brace x3 months unless supine in bed
   - consult neurosurgery for further recs
   # Hypernatremia:  correcting with g tube free flush and D5W

   55 year old woman with hx of obesity presented to [**Hospital 507**] Medical Center
   on [**2167-9-10**] after falling down stairs while at home.  She suffered a
   traumatic T5-8 fracture with retropulsion of fragments. Per medical
   records and discussion with her brother, she was awake for the fall (no
   LOC) and the fall was triggered by unsteady gait, potentially
   influenced by alcohol.  Her fracture was managed concervatively. She
   was placed in a torso brace but her course was complicated by
   respiratory failure requiring intubation. At that time a CT was
   negative for PE but showed bilateral bibasilar consolidations vs
   atelectasis.  At that time an ABG was 7.20/89/57 (unknown FIO2 but
   likely >6L facemask). She was intubated on [**2167-9-12**] at 08:40. The
   respiratory failure was thought likely to be related to pain med
   induced hypoventilation, bronchospasm, or restricted breathing duet to
   the back brace. The [**Hospital 508**] hospital course was complicated by
   difficulty weaning form the ventilator.  Her periodic agitation was
   managed with seroquel.  Prior to transfer her vent settings were: SIMV
   12x600 [**10-18**] FIO2 0.45.
   The neurosurgery service evaluated her and recommended concervative
   management of her fracture including a back brace and outpatient
   neurosurgery followup.  The CT chest showed notable narrowing of her
   central airways and the patient was referred for Interventional
   Pulmonary evaluation for airway stenting.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse presenting with respiratory failure, fever, right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), transient hypotension, abdominal distention, anemia, traumatic thoracic spine fracture, and hypernatremia. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential complications and ongoing evaluations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, and there is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). This is indicated by increased FiO2 and pCO2 levels, as well as the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and gram-positive rods in the sputum culture.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed right upper extremity DVT and is at risk for further thrombotic events. Anticoagulation therapy is recommended, and consideration should be given to extending anticoagulation prophylaxis to other extremities.
3. Fever: The patient has had persistent fever, which could be due to a combination of infection and DVT. Cultures have been sent, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started empirically to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms, including MRSA.
4. Transient Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of transient hypotension, which could"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is difficulty obtaining central venous access, along with a warm and erythematous right upper extremity (RUE). An ultrasound revealed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the RUE. The patient's oxygen saturation decreased during the first central line attempt but recovered with increased FiO2. The patient's urine output has decreased to 10-30 mL/hr and is experiencing hypotension overnight, although lactate levels remain low. Arterial and nasogastric (NG) tubes have been placed, and blood cultures are pending. The patient was switched from cefepime to levofloxacin and aztreonam due to a penicillin allergy. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/51 to 70/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted DVT. The patient's height and weight remain unchanged at 67 inches and 94.2 kg, respectively. Fluid balance shows an input of 5,600 mL and output of 798 mL, with a total balance of 4,802 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 80%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 120. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.7 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 30.7%, elevated platelet count (Plt) at 333 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) at 0.6 mg/dL, normal glucose levels ranging from 103 to 129 mg/dL, and elevated lactic acid levels at 0.7 mmol/L. The patient also has an ultrasound finding of non-occlusive right axillary DVT and non-occlusive right basilic superficial thrombosis. The patient has been started on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse who presented to the hospital following a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely caused by a combination of factors including bronchospasm, hypoventilation from narcotics, potential aspiration, and infection. She has been diagnosed with a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is being treated with therapeutic heparin and will be bridged to coumadin. Cultures have been sent, and she is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), aspiration pneumonia, and line infections. The patient is also experiencing fever, hypotension, oliguria, anemia, hypernatremia, and abdominal distention. She has had multiple attempts at central line placement, which have been unsuccessful. Her current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, ranitidine, and aztreonam.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given her DVT and risk factors, there is a possibility of a PE.
2. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections, including VAP, aspiration pneumonia, and line-related infections.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria and decreasing urine output may indicate AKI.
4. Hypotension: The patient's transient hypot"

   Assessment and Plan
   55-year-old woman with
          Respiratory failure
          Traumatic thoracic spinal fractures
          Probable VAP
          Upper extremity DVT
          Oliguria
          Anemia
          Possible tracheobronchomalacia (reason for transfer)
   I am uncertain about both the risks of anticoagulation and the risks of
   moving to radiology (e.g. CT or IR) in the context of her spinal
   fractures.  Therefore we will consult spine surgery urgently for help
   with these questions.
   Her respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including obesity,
   probable VAP, probable PE, and possible tracheobronchomalacia.  She may
   also have weakness, but she is sedated and cannot cooperate with exam
   at present.  We will check an echo to examine her RV.  We will
   ventilate per ARDSnet; she may warrant esophageal-balloon-guided
   therapy if she does not improve in the next few hours.
   Oliguria is concerning, though BUN/Creatinine are reassuring.  NG to
   suction to relieve abdominal distention.  We will check urine lytes and
   assess stroke volume variation with the Vigileo.  We will consider
   volume challenge based on this result.
   For central access, if we are able to safely move her we will ask I.R.
   to help with central access.
   We will continue broad antibiotics while awaiting cultures.

   CVL successfully placed.  CVP and SVV argue that she is adequately
   volume-replete.  Hypoxemia has been a major issue, and we have taken
   her to CT this afternoon.  We are awaiting final reads of the images.
   We will pursue esophageal balloon to help guide PEEP; first attempt was
   unsuccessful due to oropharyngeal coiling.
   Discussed in detail with patient

   Stable on PEEP 15, FiO2 0.8, low-dose Levophed.  RT was unable to place
   esophageal balloon.  CT reviewed and shows basilar >> apical collapse
   but no PE.  Echo was limited but reassuring, with normal RV function
   and no obvious shunt.
   We will continue to pursue 6cc/kg PBW ventilation.  If unable to wean
   FiO2 further, will increase PEEP.  If difficulties, will repeat
   attempts at esophageal balloon and consider proning.
   Since sputum is growing GNR, suspect that much of this may be related
   to VAP acquired at OSH.  Since we do not know their resistance
   patterns, will continue extended-spectrum GNR coverage with aztreonam
   and levofloxacin.
   Await spine surgery

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition can be summarized as follows:

- The patient is a 55-year-old woman with respiratory failure, traumatic thoracic spinal fractures, probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), oliguria, anemia, and possible tracheobronchomalacia.
- The patient has been critically ill and requires close monitoring and management in the ICU.
- The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including obesity, probable VAP, probable pulmonary embolism (PE), and possible tracheobronchomalacia.
- The patient's oliguria is concerning, but the BUN/Creatinine levels are reassuring.
- The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is being ventilated per ARDSnet guidelines. Esophageal-balloon-guided therapy may be considered if there is no improvement in the next few hours.
- The patient's central access has been attempted multiple times due to malposition and difficulty threading the wire.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued while awaiting cultures.
- The patient's nutrition status is currently NPO (nothing by mouth), and glycemic control is being maintained with regular insulin sliding scale.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with boots and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and VAP prevention with head of bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up"

   Assessment and Plan
   55-year-old woman with
          Respiratory failure
          Traumatic thoracic spinal fractures
          Probable VAP
          Upper extremity DVT
          Oliguria
          Anemia
          Possible tracheobronchomalacia (reason for transfer)
   I am uncertain about both the risks of anticoagulation and the risks of
   moving to radiology (e.g. CT or IR) in the context of her spinal
   fractures.  Therefore we will consult spine surgery urgently for help
   with these questions.
   Her respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including obesity,
   probable VAP, probable PE, and possible tracheobronchomalacia.  She may
   also have weakness, but she is sedated and cannot cooperate with exam
   at present.  We will check an echo to examine her RV.  We will
   ventilate per ARDSnet; she may warrant esophageal-balloon-guided
   therapy if she does not improve in the next few hours.
   Oliguria is concerning, though BUN/Creatinine are reassuring.  NG to
   suction to relieve abdominal distention.  We will check urine lytes and
   assess stroke volume variation with the Vigileo.  We will consider
   volume challenge based on this result.
   For central access, if we are able to safely move her we will ask I.R.
   to help with central access.
   We will continue broad antibiotics while awaiting cultures.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. She has traumatic thoracic spinal fractures, probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), oliguria, anemia, and possible tracheobronchomalacia. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/48-139/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 89%, and sinus rhythm. Her weight is 94.2 kg and height is 67 inches.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 5,600 mL and output of 798 mL, resulting in a balance of 4,802 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 80%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 37 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O, and spontaneous respiratory rate (RR Spont) of 0 breaths per minute.

   Assessment and Plan
   55-year-old woman with
          Respiratory failure
          Traumatic thoracic spinal fractures
          Probable VAP
          Upper extremity DVT
          Oliguria
          Anemia
          Possible tracheobronchomalacia (reason for transfer)
   I am uncertain about both the risks of anticoagulation and the risks of
   moving to radiology (e.g. CT or IR) in the context of her spinal
   fractures.  Therefore we will consult spine surgery urgently for help
   with these questions.
   Her respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including obesity,
   probable VAP, probable PE, and possible tracheobronchomalacia.  She may
   also have weakness, but she is sedated and cannot cooperate with exam
   at present.  We will check an echo to examine her RV.  We will
   ventilate per ARDSnet; she may warrant esophageal-balloon-guided
   therapy if she does not improve in the next few hours.
   Oliguria is concerning, though BUN/Creatinine are reassuring.  NG to
   suction to relieve abdominal distention.  We will check urine lytes and
   assess stroke volume variation with the Vigileo.  We will consider
   volume challenge based on this result.
   For central access, if we are able to safely move her we will ask I.R.
   to help with central access.
   We will continue broad antibiotics while awaiting cultures.

","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they are currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of traumatic thoracic spinal fractures, upper extremity DVT, oliguria, anemia, and possible tracheobronchomalacia. They also have respiratory failure that may be multifactorial, including obesity, probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), probable pulmonary embolism (PE), and possible tracheobronchomalacia. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/48 mmHg to 139/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient is sedated, and their physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds, distant heart sounds, protuberant abdomen, and some peripheral edema. They are unable to cooperate with peripheral strength or sensory exam.

The patient has undergone various tests and procedures, including arterial blood gas analysis, imaging studies such as a chest X-ray showing bilateral opacities, and laboratory tests showing elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal electrolyte levels.

The patient's plan of care includes ventilatory support per ARDSnet, consideration of esophageal-balloon-guided therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and various prophylactic measures. The patient"

   Right lower lobe consolidation, and superimposed atelectasis/lower lobe
   collapse, and effusions. Acute T8 compression deformity, with no
   posterior
   retropulsion of fracture fragments. No associated hematoma.
   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture
   # Respiratory failure: initial etiology unclear, likely multifactorial
   now with significant pneumonia.  Had one sputum that showed GNR.
   - Had a desat event yesterday.  Responded positively to recruitment
   maneuvers.
   - Will attempt placement of an esophageal balloon; with knowledge of
   intrathoracic pressures, can consider going up on PEEP
   # Infectious process:  Had been febrile, now resolved
   - [**Month (only) 8**] be [**2-14**] aspiration or be VAP.  Sputum from [**9-20**] grew rare GNR;
   awaiting speciation.
   - Continues on Vanc, aztreonam, levofloxicin. Vanc trough pending today
   - Also on flagyl for empiric coverage of c. diff
   - Per CT, unlikely to be abdominal process
   # Hypotension, requiring Levophed:
   - Hypovolemia is possibly a factor- responded to a transfusion; HCT had
   been dropping
   - Sepsis also a factor- on broad spectrum abs
   - Central line in place.
   # Oliguria:
   -BUN and Cr reassuring.
   # RUE DVT: Have held on starting treatment in light of need for central
   access.  Can start therapeutic heparin vs Lovenox with bridge to
   coumadin.
   - No PE noted on CT scan.
    # Abd distention:
   - CT abd only showed appendiceal mucocele without inflammation, not
   concerning, most likely chronic
   - No BM in several days, continue bowel regimen, add fleets enema
   - Can test for c.diff when pt stool
s.  Continue flagyl empirically
   - Check amylase and lipase
   # Anemia:
   - Trend HCT
   - Gave 1 un pRBC with good results
   - Will guiac stools when she has a BM
   - INR rising, now 1.7, may be nutritional
   # Spine fracture: neurologically intact distal to the lesion. prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - Will have spine see pt today for recs regarding pt movement and
   anticoagulation
   # Hypernatremia, resolved:  correcting with g tube free flush and D5W
    -Holding on g tube feeds at present due to high residuals
   -Replete lytes as necessary
   # Communication:
   - Brother has been with pt, although, live in boyfriend of 10 [**Name2 (NI) 579**] is
   her HCP.  Boyfriend will hopefully visit pt today

","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse presenting after a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely multifactorial, now complicated by significant pneumonia. The patient had a desaturation event yesterday that responded positively to recruitment maneuvers.

The patient's recent laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 37600 cells/mm3, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr), low platelet count (Plt), and hyponatremia. Imaging shows right lower lobe consolidation, superimposed atelectasis/lower lobe collapse, and effusions. There is also an acute T8 compression deformity without posterior retropulsion of fracture fragments, no associated hematoma, and no pulmonary embolism noted on CT scan.

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, infectious process (possible aspiration or ventilator-associated pneumonia), hypotension requiring vasopressor support (Levophed), oliguria, right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), abdominal distention, anemia, hypernatremia (resolved), and a traumatic T-spine fracture. The patient's code status is full code.

The patient's family has been informed about her condition and the plan of care. The ICU team will continue to monitor her closely and provide appropriate interventions to manage her multiple medical complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the hospital after a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely caused by a combination of factors such as bronchospasm, hypoventilation from narcotics, potential aspiration, and infection. There is also a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient has a known right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and fever, which could be due to infection or DVT itself. Cultures have been sent, and she is being treated empirically with antibiotics. Her blood pressure has been transiently low, possibly due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or cardiogenic causes. She has oliguria with reassuring laboratory values, and further imaging may be helpful. She also has a history of anemia, abdominal distention, and hypernatremia.

The patient has had multiple attempts at central line placement, but it has been unsuccessful. She requires more active fluid repletion, and the plan is to place a femoral line if necessary. She has a spinal fracture but remains neurologically intact distally. The neurosurgeons have indicated that surgery is not needed, and she will continue with a spine brace.

The patient's family has been informed and consulted regarding her healthcare decisions while she is intubated and sedated. She is on tube feed with free water, regular"

   - f/u blood, urine, and sputum cultures.
   - Concern for abd cause; KUB unrevealing.  High residuals.  [**Month (only) 8**] require

   - Sepsis most likely given fever.
   - HCT decreasing; ? stable at 24-25
   - Unable to place central line despite multiple attempts.  First tired
   left IJ [**2-14**] RUE DVT.  2^nd attempt in left IJ.  Can place femoral if pt
   requires more active repletion
   - Consider another attempt at a line.
   # Oliguria:
   -BUN and Cr as well as lactate reassuring.
   -Increased bladder pressures this am- 20.  Further imaging may be
   helpful
   # RUE DVT: Have held on starting treatment in light of need for central
   access.  Can start therapeutic heparin vs Lovenox with bridge to
   coumadin.
   -Can consider rescanning for PE.  High risk for PE given UE DVT.
    # Abd distention:
   -KUB unrevealing
   -High residuals
   -[**Month (only) 8**] benefit from further imaging; if unstable consider ultrasound,
   however, if pt can tolerate it, a CT scan might be more helpful.  Can
   also scan chest and pelvis.
   # Anemia: On admission to [**Hospital 507**] Medical Center, Hct was ~40, now down
   to 30 and then 25 w/o sign of active GI bleed or other source of blood
   loss.  [**Month (only) 8**] be related to fluid administration, phlebotomy, anemia of
   inflammation, active bleed still considered in differential.

   # Spine fracture: neurologically intact distal to the lesion. prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - Need to talk to neurosurg to see if pt can tolerate a CT scan as well
   as the risks of anticoag for DVT
   - monitor distal neurologic function
   - cto brace x3 months unless supine in bed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse who presented following a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has difficulty breathing and requires mechanical ventilation. The cause of respiratory failure is unclear but may be multifactorial, including bronchospasm, hypoventilation from narcotics, potential aspiration, and infection. There is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Fever: The patient has a fever, which is likely due to a combination of infection and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Cultures have been sent, and the patient is being treated with empirical antibiotics. There is also concern for aspiration pneumonia.

3. Transient hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of low blood pressure, which may be caused by hypovolemia, sepsis, or cardiogenic shock. The patient is somewhat fluid responsive, but further imaging may be helpful to determine the cause.

4. Oliguria: The patient has decreased urine output, which could be due to kidney issues or increased bladder pressures. BUN and creatinine levels are reassuring, indicating no immediate kidney failure.

5. Right upper extremity DVT: The patient has a known DVT in the right upper extremity. It has been held on starting treatment in light of the need for central access. The patient can start therapeutic he"

   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture
   # Respiratory failure: initial etiology unclear, likely multifactorial
   now with significant pneumonia.  Had one sputum that showed GNR.
   - Had a desat event yesterday.  Responded positively to recruitment
   maneuvers.
   - Will attempt placement of an esophageal balloon; with knowledge of
   intrathoracic pressures, can consider going up on PEEP
   # Infectious process:  Had been febrile, now resolved
   - [**Month (only) 8**] be [**2-14**] aspiration or be VAP.  Sputum from [**9-20**] grew rare GNR;
   awaiting speciation.
   - Continues on Vanc, aztreonam, levofloxicin. Vanc trough pending today
   - Also on flagyl for empiric coverage of c. diff
   - Per CT, unlikely to be abdominal process
   # Hypotension, requiring Levophed:
   - Hypovolemia is possibly a factor- responded to a transfusion; HCT had
   been dropping
   - Sepsis also a factor- on broad spectrum abs
   - Central line in place.
   # Oliguria:
   -BUN and Cr reassuring.
   # RUE DVT: Have held on starting treatment in light of need for central
   access.  Can start therapeutic heparin vs Lovenox with bridge to
   coumadin.
   - No PE noted on CT scan.
    # Abd distention:
   - CT abd only showed appendiceal mucocele without inflammation, not
   concerning, most likely chronic
   - No BM in several days, continue bowel regimen, add fleets enema
   - Can test for c.diff when pt stool
s.  Continue flagyl empirically
   - Check amylase and lipase
   # Anemia:
   - Trend HCT
   - Gave 1 un pRBC with good results
   - Will guiac stools when she has a BM
   - INR rising, now 1.7, may be nutritional
   # Spine fracture: neurologically intact distal to the lesion. prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - Will have spine see pt today for recs regarding pt movement and
   anticoagulation
   # Hypernatremia, resolved:  correcting with g tube free flush and D5W
    -Holding on g tube feeds at present due to high residuals
   -Replete lytes as necessary
   # Communication:
   - Brother has been with pt, although, live in boyfriend of 10 [**Name2 (NI) 579**] is
   her HCP.  Boyfriend will hopefully visit pt today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU following a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure, likely caused by pneumonia, as indicated by her desaturation event yesterday and positive response to recruitment maneuvers. The sputum culture showed growth of gram-negative rods (GNR), awaiting speciation.

The patient also has an infectious process, which was initially suspected to be aspiration or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is being treated with vancomycin, aztreonam, and levofloxacin. A CT scan showed no evidence of an abdominal process, making abdominal distention less concerning.

The patient is hypotensive and requires norepinephrine (Levophed) support. This may be due to hypovolemia, as she responded well to a transfusion and had a dropping hematocrit (HCT) level. Sepsis is also a contributing factor, and she is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient has oliguria, with low urine output. However, her BUN and creatinine levels are reassuring. She has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and will start therapeutic heparin once central access is established.

Other issues include anemia, spine fracture, hypernatremia, and communication concerns. The anemia is being managed with blood transfusions and close monitoring of electrolytes"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse who presented following a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely caused by pneumonia. The patient has shown improvement with recruitment maneuvers during desat events.

The patient also has an infectious process, with previous sputum cultures showing growth of GNR (Gram-negative rods). She is being treated with Vancomycin, aztreonam, and levofloxacin. The source of the infection could be aspiration or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's fever has resolved.

The patient is experiencing hypotension and requires Levophed. This could be due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or both. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has a central line in place.

The patient has oliguria, with low urine output. Her BUN and creatinine levels are reassuring, indicating no acute kidney injury.

The patient has a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is waiting for central access before starting treatment with therapeutic heparin.

The patient has abdominal distention, possibly due to an appendiceal mucocele. There is no evidence of inflammation, so it is likely chronic. The patient will continue with bowel regimens and may receive a fleets enema. She is also being tested for Clostridium difficile infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU after a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely caused by a significant pneumonia. The initial etiology of the respiratory failure is unclear, but it is now believed to be multifactorial. The patient had a desaturation event yesterday, which responded positively to recruitment maneuvers. An esophageal balloon was attempted, and PEEP was increased to improve oxygenation.

The patient has also had an infectious process, initially presenting with fever, which has since resolved. She is being treated with vancomycin, aztreonam, and levofloxacin. Sputum cultures have grown rare gram-negative rods, awaiting speciation. The patient is also on Flagyl for empirical coverage of Clostridium difficile.

She is experiencing hypotension, requiring norepinephrine. Hypovolemia and sepsis are possible factors contributing to her low blood pressure. The patient has a central line in place. She is also oliguric, with low urine output. Her BUN and creatinine levels are reassuring.

The patient has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently holding off on starting treatment due to the need for central access. Therapeutic heparin will be started versus Lovenox, with a bridge to warfarin.

   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture
   # Respiratory failure: initial etiology unclear, likely multifactorial
   now with significant pneumonia.  Had one sputum that showed GNR.
   - Had a desat event yesterday.  Responded positively to recruitment
   maneuvers.
   - Will attempt placement of an esophageal balloon; with knowledge of
   intrathoracic pressures, can consider going up on PEEP
   # Infectious process:  Had been febrile, now resolved
   - [**Month (only) 8**] be [**2-14**] aspiration or be VAP.  Sputum from [**9-20**] grew rare GNR;
   awaiting speciation.
   - Continues on Vanc, aztreonam, levofloxicin. Vanc trough pending today
   - Also on flagyl for empiric coverage of c. diff
   - Per CT, unlikely to be abdominal process
   # Hypotension, requiring Levophed:
   - Hypovolemia is possibly a factor- responded to a transfusion; HCT had
   been dropping
   - Sepsis also a factor- on broad spectrum abs
   - Central line in place.
   # Oliguria:
   -BUN and Cr reassuring.
   # RUE DVT: Have held on starting treatment in light of need for central
   access.  Can start therapeutic heparin vs Lovenox with bridge to
   coumadin.
   - No PE noted on CT scan.
    # Abd distention:
   - CT abd only showed appendiceal mucocele without inflammation, not
   concerning, most likely chronic
   - No BM in several days, continue bowel regimen, add fleets enema
   - Can test for c.diff when pt stool
s.  Continue flagyl empirically
   - Check amylase and lipase
   # Anemia:
   - Trend HCT
   - Gave 1 un pRBC with good results
   - Will guiac stools when she has a BM
   - INR rising, now 1.7, may be nutritional
   # Spine fracture: neurologically intact distal to the lesion. prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - Will have spine see pt today for recs regarding pt movement and
   anticoagulation
   # Hypernatremia, resolved:  correcting with g tube free flush and D5W
    -Holding on g tube feeds at present due to high residuals
   -Replete lytes as necessary
   # Communication:
   - Brother has been with pt, although, live in boyfriend of 10 [**Name2 (NI) 579**] is
   her HCP.  Boyfriend will hopefully visit pt today

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse who presented following a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely caused by pneumonia, and has been febrile but now resolved. The initial etiology of respiratory failure is unclear, but it is believed to be multifactorial.

The patient's condition requires the use of mechanical ventilation with increased PEEP to improve oxygenation. Naloxone has been started to encourage bowel motility, and a rectal tube is in place. She has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and will start therapeutic heparin once central access is obtained. The patient's hypotension may be due to hypovolemia or sepsis, and she is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Other issues include oliguria, abdominal distention, anemia, spine fracture, hypernatremia, and potential communication barriers. The patient's family has been informed about her condition, and consent for ICU care has been obtained.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may be caused by pneumonia. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not adequately addressed.

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis, potentially caused by an infectious process. If not appropriately managed, sepsis"

She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely caused by pneumonia. There is concern for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) based on her clinical and radiographic picture. The patient also has a VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia) and is being treated with antibiotics. She is experiencing hypotension requiring norepinephrine and has low urine output. She has a history of DVT and is on heparin gtt. The patient's abdominal distention is chronic and not concerning. She has anemia and is being transfused with packed red blood cells. Her spine fracture is neurologically intact distally, and she will continue with a spine brace. The patient's hypernatremia has resolved, and she is being repleted with D5W. Communication with the patient's family and healthcare proxy is being facilitated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's clinical and radiographic picture suggest the possibility of ARDS. This is a serious condition that can lead to severe lung damage and even death.
2. VAP: The patient already has VAP, which is a type of pneumonia that develops in patients who are on mechanical ventilation. This condition can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of mortality.
3. Hypotension:"

          Incidental peri-appendiceal finding (will need eventual
   follow-up)
   Although differential remains open, the most compelling course of
   events is probably that she required intubation at the outside hospital
   (?sedation ?restriction from obesity/brace ?other) and subsequently
   developed a GNR-related VAP.  Her pattern of acute lung injury,
   combined with obesity, is resulting in basilar and
   posterior-predominant atelectasis/consolidation with a high proportion
   of shunt.  Given her very high PEEP, will try to avoid bronchoscopy if
   possible.

   Although differential remains open, the most compelling course of
   events is probably that she required intubation at the outside hospital
   (?sedation ?restriction from obesity/brace ?other) and subsequently
   developed a GNR-related VAP.  Her pattern of acute lung injury,
   combined with obesity, is resulting in basilar and
   posterior-predominant atelectasis/consolidation with a high proportion
   of shunt.  Given her very high PEEP, will try to avoid bronchoscopy if
   possible.

   Oxygenation has continued to improved throughout the day.
   Remains on levophed.
   Repeat baseline cortisol < 5.
   Had relative oliguria for several hours.
   Her baseline cortisol should be substantially higher than it is; she
   should be maximally stimulated given her degree of illness.  I
   therefore think this represents meaningful cortisol deficiency.  Since
   she is vasopressor-requiring, we will treat for adrenal insufficiency.
   We will wean FiO2 to 0.4.  If tolerates, then wean PEEP.
   These maneuvers are likely to help with urine output, as well.  If they
   do not, will increase levophed and see if higher blood pressures result
   in higher UOP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman who is critically ill and currently in the ICU. She has several medical complications and conditions, including respiratory failure, traumatic thoracic spinal fracture, probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), shock, upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), anemia, possible tracheobronchomalacia, and incidental peri-appendiceal finding.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 75 bpm, hypotension with a blood pressure of 96/49 mmHg, and an increased respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including sedatives, pain medication, vasopressors, antibiotics, and anticoagulants. She has several lines and tubes inserted, including an endotracheal tube, arterial line, and central venous catheter.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 8.4 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 376 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's chest x-ray shows basilar and posterior-predominant atelectasis/consolidation. Her esophageal pressures"

   Although differential remains open, the most compelling course of
   events is probably that she required intubation at the outside hospital
   (?sedation ?restriction from obesity/brace ?other) and subsequently
   developed a GNR-related VAP.  Her pattern of acute lung injury,
   combined with obesity, is resulting in basilar and
   posterior-predominant atelectasis/consolidation with a high proportion
   of shunt.  Given her very high PEEP, will try to avoid bronchoscopy if
   possible.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old woman with respiratory failure, who is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. She has a history of traumatic thoracic spinal fracture, probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), shock, upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), anemia, possible tracheobronchomalacia, and an incidental peri-appendiceal finding.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/49 mmHg to 160/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and liver function tests, with slightly elevated blood glucose levels.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory system compliance of 40 cmH2O/mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 23 cmH2O. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 320 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg.

   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Over the evening yesterday, were able to
   decrease FiO2 and PEEP.  Clinical and imaging suggestive of ARDS.
   Initial preceptiationg factors: sedation, hypovent [**2-14**] obesity,
   orthotic brace.  Now thought to have VAP.
   - Placed esophageal balloon on [**9-22**] which will help guide PEEP settings.
   # VAP:  Re-spiked fever overnight.  Stopped vanc yesterday, [**9-23**], as
   treating for GNR infection.  Current GS shows GPC
   - Follow cultures
   - Restart Vanc.
   - Continue aztreonam, levofloxicin for 8 days pending speciation (at
   that time can increase to 15 days if necessary)
   - Also, stopped flagyl because had one neg c. diff toxin and CT did not
   show evidence of colitis
   # EKG changes: very low voltages and no change in QRS morphology.
   P-waves may be buried.

   # Hypotension, requiring Levophed:  Increased urine output c/w
   autodiuresing
   - Attempt to wean from levophed with MAP goal 65 and UOP goal >30 cc/hr
   - Hypovolemia is possibly a factor- responded to a transfusion; HCT had
   been dropping.  However, SVV with Vigileo was 13, making her CO less
   likely to respond to fluids.  Held on giving any boluses overnight.
   - Sepsis also a factor- on broad spectrum abs
   - Central line in place.
   # Oliguria:  Improved recently.  BUN and Cr reassuring.
   -Continue to monitor
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**].
   -Therapeutic in one day; may be related to poor nutritional status.
   Will continue to closely monitor
    # Abd distention: [**Month (only) 8**] be chronic condition not requiring immediate
   medical attention

   - Gave 1 un pRBC with good results
   - INR rising, now 2.0, may be nutritional
   # Spine fracture: neurologically intact distal to the lesion. prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - Repeat CT C, L spine.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.
   # Hypernatremia, resolved:  correcting with g tube free flush and D5W

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU with respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. She has a traumatic T-spine fracture, ARDS, and suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She also has low cortisol levels suggestive of adrenal insufficiency and has been started on hydrocortisone and Florinef. Other findings include oliguria, abdominal distention, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has shown signs of infection, including fever and an elevated white blood cell count. The sputum culture initially showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, which could indicate Staphylococcus aureus. However, a more recent culture shows gram-negative rods, suggesting a different bacterial infection. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status and adjusting the antibiotic treatment accordingly.

2. Junctional rhythm: The patient has experienced episodes of junctional rhythm, which is an abnormal heart rhythm originating from the AV junction. This can be caused by electrolyte imbalances or medication side effects. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rate and rhythm closely and address any underlying causes.

3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's random cortisol level was low, indicating possible adrenal insufficiency. She has been started on hydrocortisone and Flor"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure: initial etiology unclear, likely multifactorial
   (sedation vs hypovent [**2-14**] obesity/orthotic brace vs ?) which lead to
   VAP most likely with GNR (by one sputum).
   - Concern for ARDS given clinical and radiographic picture.
   - Placed esophageal balloon on [**9-22**] which will help guide PEEP
   settings.
   - Over the evening yesterday, were able to decrease FiO2 and PEEP.
   # VAP:  Re-spiked fever overnight.
   - Sputum from [**9-20**] grew rare GNR; awaiting speciation.
   - Has been  Vanc, aztreonam, levofloxicin. Vanc trough today was 20
   - Stopped vanc yesterday, [**9-23**], as there was no current evidence to
   suggest a gram positive infection
   - Also, stopped flagyl because had one neg c. diff toxin and CT did not
   show evidence of colitis
   - Continued aztreonam and levofloxicin for gram neg pneumonia for 8
   days pending speciation (at that time can increase to 15 days if
   necessary)
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need to reconsider restarting d/c'd meds if she continues to
   spike a fever
   # Hypotension, requiring Levophed:
   - Hypovolemia is possibly a factor- responded to a transfusion; HCT had
   been dropping.  However, SVV with Vigileo was 13, making her CO less
   likely to respond to fluids.  Held on giving any boluses overnight.
   - Sepsis also a factor- on broad spectrum abs
   - Central line in place.
   # Oliguria:
   -BUN and Cr reassuring.
   -Continues to be low.  Hopefully, by decreasing PEEP and using levophed
   to keep MAPs high, UOP will increase.
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**].
   -Therapeutic in one day; may be related to poor nutritional status.
   Will continue to closely monitor
    # Abd distention: [**Month (only) 8**] be chronic condition not requiring immediate
   medical attention
   - CT abd only showed appendiceal mucocele without inflammation, not
   concerning, most likely chronic.  No concern for intraabd disaster
   - Now having BMs; c. diff toxin neg
   - amylase and lipase wnl
   # Adrenal Insufficency:
   -Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should have been maximally
   stimulated.
   -Started hydrocortisone and florinef.  ? switch to methylpred
   # Anemia:
   - Trend HCT
   - Gave 1 un pRBC with good results
   - INR rising, now 2.0, may be nutritional
   # Spine fracture: neurologically intact distal to the lesion. prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per verbal report.
   # Hypernatremia, resolved:  correcting with g tube free flush and D5W
    -Holding on g tube feeds at present due to high residuals
   -Replete lytes as necessary
   # Communication:
   - Brother has been with pt, although, live in boyfriend of 10 [**Name2 (NI) 579**] is
   her HCP.  Boyfriend will hopefully visit pt today

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse who presented to the ICU with respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She also has an unclear initial etiology for respiratory failure, likely multifactorial, which led to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) most likely with Gram-negative rods (GNR). The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, aztreonam, and levofloxacin. She has also been experiencing hypotension requiring norepinephrine (Levophed), oliguria with reassuring BUN and creatinine levels, right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), abdominal distention, adrenal insufficiency, anemia, and hypernatremia, which has since resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's initial respiratory failure and subsequent development of VAP indicate a potential complication related to prolonged mechanical ventilation. The presence of GNR in the sputum culture suggests an infection caused by Gram-negative bacteria.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the clinical and radiographic picture, there is concern for ARDS. This condition can lead to severe lung dysfunction and may require additional interventions such as increased oxygen support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

3. Junctional rhythm: The patient's heart rhythm"

   # Respiratory failure:  Over the evening yesterday, were able to
   decrease FiO2 and PEEP.  Clinical and imaging suggestive of ARDS.
   Initial preceptiationg factors: sedation, hypovent [**2-14**] obesity,
   orthotic brace.  Now thought to have VAP.
   - Placed esophageal balloon on [**9-22**] which will help guide PEEP settings.
   # VAP:  Re-spiked fever overnight.  Stopped vanc yesterday, [**9-23**], as
   treating for GNR infection.  Current GS shows GPC
   - Follow cultures
   - Restart Vanc.
   - Continue aztreonam, levofloxicin for 8 days pending speciation (at
   that time can increase to 15 days if necessary)
   - Also, stopped flagyl because had one neg c. diff toxin and CT did not

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator after a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has low blood pressure requiring norepinephrine infusion. Her heart rate is in the normal range, and she has a junctional rhythm. The patient's oxygen saturation is good, but her PaO2/FiO2 ratio is low.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, except for high potassium levels. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by an increased creatinine level. Liver enzymes are normal, and there are no signs of infection in the urine or stool.

The patient has a central line in place and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for the suspected GNR infection. She also has a Foley catheter in situ. The patient's nutritional status is poor, as she is unable to tolerate oral feeds and requires tube feeds.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, oliguria, right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and adrenal insufficiency. The patient's serum cortisol level was"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Over the evening yesterday, were able to
   decrease FiO2 and PEEP.  Clinical and imaging suggestive of ARDS.
   Initial precipitating factors were thought to be: sedation, hypovent
   [**2-14**] obesity, orthotic brace.  Now thought to have VAP.
   - Placed esophageal balloon on [**9-22**] which will help guide PEEP settings.
   - Given small size of effusion and high PEEP (risk of pneumothorax),
   will not attempt to tap
   - Appreciate IP recs.  Will consider tracheomalacia workup when more
   stable.
   # VAP/ID:  Re-spiked fever overnight.  Stopped vanc yesterday, [**9-23**], as
   treating for GNR infection.  Current GS shows GPC
   - Follow cultures
   - Restart Vanc.
   - Continue aztreonam, levofloxicin for 8 days pending speciation (at
   that time can increase to 15 days if necessary)
   - Also, stopped flagyl because had one neg c. diff toxin and CT did not
   show evidence of colitis
   - Will replace A-line today.
   # EKG changes: Sinus bradycardia.  Very low voltages and no change in
   QRS morphology.  P-waves are visible and prolonged PR interval is old.
   CK and troponins flat.  Likely related to increased vagal tone possibly
   related to steroid replacement.
   - Will avoid excessive alpha-agonism
   - Continue to monitor
   - could consider atrial EKG
   .
   # Hypotension: now off levophed, with good urine output.  Hypovolemia
   is possibly a factor- responded to a transfusion; HCT had been
   dropping.  However, SVV with Vigileo was 7, making her CO less likely
   to respond to fluids.  Held on giving any boluses overnight.  Today CVP
   is low given PEEP. Sepsis also a consideration
   - continue on broad spectrum abs
   - replete fluids.
   - Restart pressors as needed.  Consider dopamine over levophed given
   bradycardia.
   - Central line in place.
   # Urine output:  Previously oliguric, now with high urine output.
   Concern for autodiuresis but BUN and Cr reassuring.
   -Continue to monitor
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**].
   -Therapeutic in one day; may be related to poor nutritional status.
   Will continue to closely monitor
   # Adrenal Insufficency:
   -Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should have been maximally
   stimulated.
   -Started hydrocortisone and florinef.  ? switch to methylpred
   # Anemia:
   - Trend HCT
   - Gave 1 un pRBC with good results
   - INR rising, now 2.0, may be nutritional
   # Spine fracture: neurologically intact distal to the lesion. prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. She has been diagnosed with ARDS and is suspected to have VAP. The patient's fever has been intermittent, and there has been a change in her sputum culture from gram-negative rods to gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. The patient's EKG shows junctional rhythm with low voltages and prolonged PR interval. Her hypotension has responded to fluid resuscitation but may be related to sepsis. She is oliguric but now has a high urine output. The patient has a DVT and is on therapeutic heparin. She is being treated for adrenal insufficiency and anemia. The patient's spine fracture is neurologically intact, and conservative management with a spine brace is planned. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is suspected to have VAP, which is a common complication in patients on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours.
2. Junctional rhythm: The patient's EKG shows junctional rhythm with low voltages, which can be a complication of critical illness or electrolyte imbalance.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis or fluid loss, and it requires careful monitoring and management.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure: initial etiology unclear, likely multifactorial
   (sedation vs hypovent [**2-14**] obesity/orthotic brace vs ?) which lead to
   VAP most likely with GNR (by one sputum).
   - Concern for ARDS given clinical and radiographic picture.
   - Placed esophageal balloon on [**9-22**] which will help guide PEEP
   settings.
   - Over the evening yesterday, were able to decrease FiO2 and PEEP.
   # VAP:  Re-spiked fever overnight.
   - Sputum from [**9-20**] grew rare GNR; awaiting speciation.
   - Has been  Vanc, aztreonam, levofloxicin. Vanc trough today was 20
   - Stopped vanc yesterday, [**9-23**], as there was no current evidence to
   suggest a gram positive infection
   - Also, stopped flagyl because had one neg c. diff toxin and CT did not
   show evidence of colitis
   - Continued aztreonam and levofloxicin for gram neg pneumonia for 8
   days pending speciation (at that time can increase to 15 days if
   necessary)
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need to reconsider restarting d/c'd meds if she continues to
   spike a fever
   # Hypotension, requiring Levophed:
   - Hypovolemia is possibly a factor- responded to a transfusion; HCT had
   been dropping.  However, SVV with Vigileo was 13, making her CO less
   likely to respond to fluids.  Held on giving any boluses overnight.
   - Sepsis also a factor- on broad spectrum abs
   - Central line in place.
   # Oliguria:
   -BUN and Cr reassuring.
   -Continues to be low.  Hopefully, by decreasing PEEP and using levophed
   to keep MAPs high, UOP will increase.
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**].
   -Therapeutic in one day; may be related to poor nutritional status.
   Will continue to closely monitor
    # Abd distention: [**Month (only) 8**] be chronic condition not requiring immediate
   medical attention
   - CT abd only showed appendiceal mucocele without inflammation, not
   concerning, most likely chronic.  No concern for intraabd disaster
   - Now having BMs; c. diff toxin neg
   - amylase and lipase wnl
   # Adrenal Insufficency:
   -Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should have been maximally
   stimulated.
   -Started hydrocortisone and florinef.  ? switch to methylpred
   # Anemia:
   - Trend HCT
   - Gave 1 un pRBC with good results
   - INR rising, now 2.0, may be nutritional
   # Spine fracture: neurologically intact distal to the lesion. prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per verbal report.
   # Hypernatremia, resolved:  correcting with g tube free flush and D5W
    -Holding on g tube feeds at present due to high residuals
   -Replete lytes as necessary
   # Communication:
   - Brother has been with pt, although, live in boyfriend of 10 [**Name2 (NI) 579**] is
   her HCP.  Boyfriend will hopefully visit pt today

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU following a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The initial cause of respiratory failure is unclear, but it could be due to sedation, hypoventilation, obesity, or an orthotic brace. She also has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) likely caused by Gram-negative rods (GNR), as indicated by a positive sputum culture.

The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension requiring the use of norepinephrine (Levophed), oliguria, right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), abdominal distention, adrenal insufficiency, anemia, and hypernatremia. These conditions require close monitoring and management.

Plan:
1. Continue treatment for VAP with aztreonam and levofloxacin for 8 days, pending speciation of the GNR.
2. Reassess the need for continued use of vancomycin and flagyl based on the results of sputum culture and clinical response.
3. Monitor and manage hypotension with norepinephrine and consider other causes such as hypovolemia or sepsis.
4. Address oliguria by decreasing PEEP and using Levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) high, and continue to monitor urine output.
5. Continue he"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa (sulfonamides). The patient's temperature spiked to 101 degrees Fahrenheit, and they are experiencing a junctional rhythm with a heart rate of 47-50 beats per minute. The patient is sedated and unable to provide any history. 

24-hour events include obtaining blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures. An EKG was also performed. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (101 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 57 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/46 to 121/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is currently 101 kg, and their height is 67 inches.

   Assessment and Plan
   55-year-old woman with
          Respiratory failure
          Recheck esophageal pressures today.
          Wean PEEP as tolerated and guided by Pes
          On our ultrasound exam, effusion would be high risk to tap
          Adrenal insufficiency
          Based on very low random cortisol while in shock and
   respiratory failure
          On steroids
          Bradycardia
          Rhythm appear sinus.
          Will try to check an atrial EKG via her CVL to confirm
          Heart rate increases with stimulation, suggesting that this
   is mostly vagal in etiology
          Sedation and high ventilatory pressures may contribute to
   high vagal tone
          Continues to have signs of good perfusion
          This may be reflex bradycardia from increased perfusion
   relating to steroid dosing
          Probable VAP
          Discuss GNRs with lab
          Complete 8
 15d course of present ABX pending cultures
          D/C vancomycin since no identified GPCs
          D/C Flagyl since no CT or toxin evidence of C diff
          Shock
 now off of levophed (again)
          SVV is low, suggesting adequate volume repletion
          Treating adrenal insufficiency
          Polyuria
          [**Month (only) 8**] be response to increased perfusion (comes at right time
   course to be an effect of treating adrenal insufficiency)
          Upper extremity DVT
          Therapeutic heparin
          Anemia
          Follow
          Possible tracheobronchomalacia (reason for transfer)
          Incidental peri-appendiceal finding (will need eventual
   follow-up)
          Traumatic thoracic spinal fracture
          Eventual MRI.  Too high-risk at present.  Brace when out of
   bed.
          Fever
          Restart vanco (GPCs on G/S of sputum)
          Follow cultures
          Resite art line (dysfunctional).
          CVL is within 3 days; will follow
   Although differential remains open, the most compelling course of
   events is probably that she required intubation at the outside hospital
   (?sedation ?restriction from obesity/brace ?other) and subsequently
   developed a GNR-related VAP.  Her pattern of acute lung injury,
   combined with obesity, is resulting in basilar and
   posterior-predominant atelectasis/consolidation with a high proportion
   of shunt.  Will consider bronchoscopy based on course today, given
   apparent increased atelectasis on CXR.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. She has a history of allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. The patient is sedated and unable to provide her own medical history.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate ranging from 47 to 50 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/48 to 121/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in a junctional rhythm and has been stable with holding a blood pressure.

The patient has been started on steroids and antibiotics tailored to her condition. PEEP has been decreased, and the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Blood cultures were taken on September 24th at 12:24 AM, urine culture at the same time, and sputum culture at 3:30 AM. An EKG was also performed at 5:20 AM.

The patient's imaging shows increased right base opacity on a chest X-ray. Microbiology reports indicate the presence of gram-positive cocci (GPCs) with pairs/clusters and gram-positive rods (GNRs) in the sputum.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure,"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   55-year-old woman with
          Unclear location of ETT
          Since only 18cm in holder, we will bronch to confirm correct
   position since an inadvertent extubation might be fatal.
          Respiratory failure
          Oxygenation is improving
          Wean PEEP as tolerated by hypoxemia
          [**Month (only) 8**] eventually need investigation for TBM
          At present, her PEEP is too high to consider tracheostomy
   but if we are able to wean it (and not able to extubate her) would
   consider tracheostomy soon
          Adrenal insufficiency
          Based on very low random cortisol while in shock and
   respiratory failure
          On steroids, has come off and stayed off of pressors.
   Eventually wean, but still getting fluid boluses
          Bradycardia
          Rhythm is sinus, confirmed by CVL-directed
atrial
 lead
          Heart rate increases with stimulation, suggesting that this
   is mostly vagal in etiology
          Klebsiella VAP
          Complete 8d course of levofloxacin
          Discontinue aztreonam
          If [**9-24**] sputum culture remains negative (GPCs on G/S),
   discontinue vancomycin tomorrow
          Shock
 now off of levophed
          Intermittent fluid boluses
          Treating adrenal insufficiency
          Upper extremity DVT
          Therapeutic heparin
          Anemia
          Follow
          Possible tracheobronchomalacia (reason for transfer)
          Incidental peri-appendiceal finding (will need eventual
   follow-up)
          Traumatic thoracic spinal fracture
          Eventual MRI.  Too high-risk at present.  Brace when out of
   bed.
   # Respiratory failure currently with unclear ETT location:  Intubated
   on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.  Likely [**2-14**] VAP. Unlikely to have
   tracheomalacia as initially transferred for.
   - bronch for ETT location
   - wean PEEP
   # Pneumonia: Kleb oxytoca pneumonia and sputum with GPCs on gram stain.
     Afebrile overnight. On levofloxacin, vancomycin, aztreonam. Resp
   status seems to be improving.
   - Follow cultures
   - d/c aztreonam
   - Continue levofloxacin for 8 days
   # EKG changes: Sinus bradycardia.  Very low voltages and no change in
   QRS morphology.  P-waves are visible and prolonged PR interval is old.
   CK and troponins flat.  Likely related to increased vagal tone possibly
   related to steroid replacement. Atrial EKG with p-waves c/w sinus
   bradycardia.
   - Will avoid excessive alpha-agonism
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Hypotension: now off levophed, with good urine output.  Hypovolemia
   is possibly a factor- responded to a transfusion; HCT had been
   dropping.  However, SVV with Vigileo was 7, making her CO less likely
   to respond to fluids.  Held on giving any boluses overnight.  Today CVP
   is low given PEEP. Sepsis also a consideration.
   - continue abx as above (vanc and levofloxacin)
   - replete fluids.
   - Restart pressors as needed.  Consider dopamine given bradycardia.
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**].
   - closely monitor
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should
   have been maximally stimulated.
   -  hydrocortisone and florinef for 5 days
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - Trend HCT
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

   Disposition:  ICU
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is an unclear location of the endotracheal tube (ETT), which increases the risk of inadvertent extubation, a potentially fatal event. The patient also has a traumatic thoracic spinal fracture, which may contribute to respiratory difficulties.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for more than 48 hours and has developed pneumonia caused by Klebsiella oxytoca. Appropriate antibiotics have been initiated, but the patient needs close monitoring and follow-up cultures.

3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has very low random cortisol levels while in shock and respiratory failure, indicating a possible case of adrenal insufficiency. Steroids have been started, but the patient requires ongoing evaluation and management.

4. Bradycardia: The patient exhibits sinus bradycardia, which is likely related to increased vagal tone possibly associated with steroid replacement. Close monitoring is necessary, and excessive alpha-agonism should be avoided.

5. Hypotension: The patient is now off vasopressor support but still requires intermittent fluid boluses. Hypovolemia and sepsis are possible contributing factors. Continuous monitoring and appropriate management of blood pressure are essential.

6. Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Over the evening yesterday, were able to
   decrease FiO2 and PEEP.  Clinical and imaging suggestive of ARDS.
   Initial precipitating factors were thought to be: sedation, hypovent
   [**2-14**] obesity, orthotic brace.  Now thought to have VAP.
   - Placed esophageal balloon on [**9-22**] which will help guide PEEP settings.
   - Given small size of effusion and high PEEP (risk of pneumothorax),
   will not attempt to tap
   - Appreciate IP recs.  Will consider tracheomalacia workup when more
   stable.
   - Approaching 2-week intubation point (intubated [**9-12**]);  Trach?
   # VAP/ID:  Re-spiked fever overnight.  Stopped vanc yesterday, [**9-23**], as
   treating for GNR infection.  Current GS shows GPC
   - Follow cultures
   - Restart Vanc.
   - Continue aztreonam, levofloxicin for 8 days pending speciation (at
   that time can increase to 15 days if necessary)
   - Also, stopped flagyl because had one neg c. diff toxin and CT did not
   show evidence of colitis
   - Will replace A-line today.
   # EKG changes: Sinus bradycardia.  Very low voltages and no change in
   QRS morphology.  P-waves are visible and prolonged PR interval is old.
   CK and troponins flat.  Likely related to increased vagal tone possibly
   related to steroid replacement.
   - Will avoid excessive alpha-agonism
   - Continue to monitor
   - could consider atrial EKG
   .
   # Hypotension: now off levophed, with good urine output.  Hypovolemia
   is possibly a factor- responded to a transfusion; HCT had been
   dropping.  However, SVV with Vigileo was 7, making her CO less likely
   to respond to fluids.  Held on giving any boluses overnight.  Today CVP
   is low given PEEP. Sepsis also a consideration
   - continue on broad spectrum abs
   - replete fluids.
   - Restart pressors as needed.  Consider dopamine over levophed given
   bradycardia.
   - Central line in place.
   # Urine output:  Previously oliguric, now with high urine output.
   Concern for autodiuresis but BUN and Cr reassuring.
   -Continue to monitor
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**].
   -Therapeutic in one day; may be related to poor nutritional status.
   Will continue to closely monitor
   # Adrenal Insufficency:
   -Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should have been maximally
   stimulated.
   -Started hydrocortisone and florinef.  ? switch to methylpred
   # Anemia:
   - Trend HCT
   - Gave 1 un pRBC with good results
   - INR rising, now 2.0, may be nutritional
   # Spine fracture: neurologically intact distal to the lesion. prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.
   # Hypernatremia, resolved:  correcting with g tube free flush and D5W
    -Continue to follow
   # Communication:
   - Brother has been with pt, although, live in boyfriend of 10 [**Name2 (NI) 579**] is
   her HCP.  Boyfriend will hopefully visit pt today

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture.
- She is experiencing respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
- The patient has been intubated for about two weeks, and there is consideration for tracheostomy.
- She has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The patient's EKG shows sinus bradycardia, very low voltages, and no change in QRS morphology.
- She has hypotension and is off levophed, with good urine output.
- The patient has a central line, and there is a concern for central venous catheter-related infection.
- She also has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her right upper extremity and is receiving therapeutic heparin.
- The patient has been diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency and is receiving hydrocortisone and Florinef.
- She has anemia and received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC) with good results.
- The patient has a spine fracture but is neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Surgery is not indicated at this time.
- She has hypernatremia, which has resolved with the administration of D5W via the gastric tube."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Over the evening yesterday, were able to
   decrease FiO2 and PEEP.  Clinical and imaging suggestive of ARDS.
   Initial precipitating factors were thought to be: sedation, hypovent
   [**2-14**] obesity, orthotic brace.  Now thought to have VAP.
   - Placed esophageal balloon on [**9-22**] which will help guide PEEP settings.
   - Given small size of effusion and high PEEP (risk of pneumothorax),
   will not attempt to tap
   - Appreciate IP recs.  Will consider tracheomalacia workup when more
   stable.
   - Approaching 2-week intubation point (intubated [**9-12**]);  Trach?
   # VAP/ID:  Re-spiked fever overnight.  Stopped vanc yesterday, [**9-23**], as
   treating for GNR infection.  Current GS shows GPC
   - Follow cultures
   - Restart Vanc.
   - Continue aztreonam, levofloxicin for 8 days pending speciation (at
   that time can increase to 15 days if necessary)
   - Also, stopped flagyl because had one neg c. diff toxin and CT did not
   show evidence of colitis
   - Will replace A-line today.
   # EKG changes: Sinus bradycardia.  Very low voltages and no change in
   QRS morphology.  P-waves are visible and prolonged PR interval is old.
   CK and troponins flat.  Likely related to increased vagal tone possibly
   related to steroid replacement.
   - Will avoid excessive alpha-agonism
   - Continue to monitor
   - could consider atrial EKG
   .
   # Hypotension: now off levophed, with good urine output.  Hypovolemia
   is possibly a factor- responded to a transfusion; HCT had been
   dropping.  However, SVV with Vigileo was 7, making her CO less likely
   to respond to fluids.  Held on giving any boluses overnight.  Today CVP
   is low given PEEP. Sepsis also a consideration
   - continue on broad spectrum abs
   - replete fluids.
   - Restart pressors as needed.  Consider dopamine over levophed given
   bradycardia.
   - Central line in place.
   # Urine output:  Previously oliguric, now with high urine output.
   Concern for autodiuresis but BUN and Cr reassuring.
   -Continue to monitor
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**].
   -Therapeutic in one day; may be related to poor nutritional status.
   Will continue to closely monitor
   # Adrenal Insufficency:
   -Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should have been maximally
   stimulated.
   -Started hydrocortisone and florinef.  ? switch to methylpred
   # Anemia:
   - Trend HCT
   - Gave 1 un pRBC with good results
   - INR rising, now 2.0, may be nutritional
   # Spine fracture: neurologically intact distal to the lesion. prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.
   # Hypernatremia, resolved:  correcting with g tube free flush and D5W
    -Continue to follow
   # Communication:
   - Brother has been with pt, although, live in boyfriend of 10 [**Name2 (NI) 579**] is
   her HCP.  Boyfriend will hopefully visit pt today

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill, overweight/obese male with no known history of allergies. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics (Metronidazole, Levofloxacin, Aztreonam, and Vancomycin), as well as sedatives (Midazolam) and pain management medications (Fentanyl). The patient has been admitted to the ICU with an arterial line placed and is receiving Heparin sodium infusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 125/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for some respiratory symptoms. The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, clear breath sounds, and normal heart sounds. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and abnormal kidney function. The patient's chest X-ray shows right base opacity, making it difficult to identify the endotracheal tube. The patient is being treated with ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   55-year-old woman with
          Unclear location of ETT
          Since only 18cm in holder, we will bronch to confirm correct
   position since an inadvertent extubation might be fatal.
          Respiratory failure
          Oxygenation is improving
          Wean PEEP as tolerated by hypoxemia
          [**Month (only) 8**] eventually need investigation for TBM
          At present, her PEEP is too high to consider tracheostomy
   but if we are able to wean it (and not able to extubate her) would
   consider tracheostomy soon
          Adrenal insufficiency
          Based on very low random cortisol while in shock and
   respiratory failure
          On steroids, has come off and stayed off of pressors.
   Eventually wean, but still getting fluid boluses
          Bradycardia
          Rhythm is sinus, confirmed by CVL-directed
atrial
 lead
          Heart rate increases with stimulation, suggesting that this
   is mostly vagal in etiology
          Klebsiella VAP
          Complete 8d course of levofloxacin
          Discontinue aztreonam
          If [**9-24**] sputum culture remains negative (GPCs on G/S),
   discontinue vancomycin tomorrow
          Shock
 now off of levophed
          Intermittent fluid boluses
          Treating adrenal insufficiency
          Upper extremity DVT
          Therapeutic heparin
          Anemia
          Follow
          Possible tracheobronchomalacia (reason for transfer)
          Incidental peri-appendiceal finding (will need eventual
   follow-up)
          Traumatic thoracic spinal fracture
          Eventual MRI.  Too high-risk at present.  Brace when out of
   bed.
   Other issues as per ICU team note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman who is critically ill. She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, and her current condition is unclear due to an inadvertent extubation. The patient has a history of unclear location of endotracheal tube (ETT), respiratory failure, oxygenation improvement, and low random cortisol levels. She also has bradycardia, Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), shock, upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), anemia, possible tracheobronchomalacia, incidental peri-appendiceal finding, and traumatic thoracic spinal fracture.

Medical Complications:
1. Unclear location of ETT: The patient's ETT is not in a clear location, which can lead to respiratory complications if not corrected promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may require assisted ventilation and careful monitoring of oxygenation levels.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has low random cortisol levels, indicating possible adrenal insufficiency. This condition requires immediate attention and treatment with steroids.
4. Bradycardia: The patient has bradycardia, a slower-than-normal heart rate. This can be caused by various factors and needs to be closely monitored and managed accordingly.
5. Klebsiella VAP: The patient has developed Klebsiella VAP, which is a type of lung infection commonly"

   on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.  Likely [**2-14**] VAP. Unlikely to have
   tracheomalacia as initially transferred for.
   - bronch for ETT location
   - wean PEEP
   # Pneumonia: Kleb oxytoca pneumonia and sputum with GPCs on gram
   stain.   Afebrile overnight. On levofloxacin, vancomycin, aztreonam.
   Resp status seems to be improving.
   - Follow cultures
   - d/c aztreonam
   - Continue levofloxacin for 8 days
   # EKG changes: Sinus bradycardia.  Very low voltages and no change in
   QRS morphology.  P-waves are visible and prolonged PR interval is old.
   CK and troponins flat.  Likely related to increased vagal tone possibly
   related to steroid replacement. Atrial EKG with p-waves c/w sinus
   bradycardia.
   - Will avoid excessive alpha-agonism
   - Continue to monitor
   # Hypotension: now off levophed, with good urine output.  Hypovolemia
   is possibly a factor- responded to a transfusion; HCT had been
   dropping.  However, SVV with Vigileo was 7, making her CO less likely
   to respond to fluids.  Held on giving any boluses overnight.  Today CVP
   is low given PEEP. Sepsis also a consideration.
   - continue abx as above (vanc and levofloxacin)
   - replete fluids.
   - Restart pressors as needed.  Consider dopamine given bradycardia.
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**].
   - closely monitor
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should
   have been maximally stimulated.
   -  hydrocortisone and florinef for 5 days
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - Trend HCT
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the hospital after a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She required intubation for respiratory failure and has been experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pneumonia caused by Klebsiella oxytoca, sepsis, hypotension, right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), adrenal insufficiency, and a T-spine fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently unstable, with unclear endotracheal tube (ETT) location and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring and bronchoscopy may be necessary to assess ETT position.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has Klebsiella oxytoca pneumonia, which is being treated with levofloxacin, vancomycin, and aztreonam. It is important to follow cultures and continue levofloxacin for an additional 8 days.

3. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis, especially considering the presence of pneumonia and potential hypovolemia. Appropriate antibiotics should be continued, and fluid resuscitation may be required.

4. Right upper extremity DVT: The patient has been started on heparin for the DVT. Close monitoring is necessary to"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.
   Likely [**2-14**] VAP. Unlikely to have tracheomalacia as initially
   transferred for.
   -          wean PEEP
   -          discuss need for trach with patient and her family
   # Pneumonia: Pansensitive Kleb oxytoca pneumonia and sputum with GPCs
   on gram stain.   Afebrile overnight. On levofloxacin since [**9-20**].
   Vancomycin, aztreonam have been stopped. Resp status seems to be
   improving.
   - Follow cultures
   - d/c aztreonam
   - Continue levofloxacin for 8 days (today = day [**7-21**])
   # EKG changes: Sinus bradycardia.  Very low voltages and no change in
   QRS morphology.  P-waves are visible and prolonged PR interval is old.
   CK and troponins flat.  Likely related to increased vagal tone possibly
   related to steroid replacement. Atrial EKG with p-waves c/w sinus
   bradycardia.
   - Will avoid excessive alpha-agonism
   - Continue to monitor
   # Hypotension: Improved, off levophed for 2 days, with good urine
   output.  SVV with Vigileo was 7, making her CO less likely to respond
   to fluids.  CVP increasing with reduction in PEEP.  Unlikely
   hypovolemic or septic.  Likely [**2-14**] poor adrenal response in setting of
   acute illness and very high PEEP.
   -continue fludricort and hydrocortisone for total 5 days (begun [**9-23**])
   -monitor, expect improvement with continual reduction in PEEP
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**].
   - closely monitor
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should
   have been maximally stimulated.
   -  hydrocortisone and florinef for 5 days
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - Trend HCT
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse who presented following a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, EKG changes, hypotension, RUE DVT, adrenal insufficiency, anemia, and a spine fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating severe respiratory distress. Weaning from the ventilator has been difficult, and there is a suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Monitoring for further deterioration in respiratory status and considering tracheostomy placement to facilitate long-term ventilation support.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has pansensitive Klebsiella oxytoca pneumonia, as evidenced by sputum culture results. Levofloxacin therapy has been initiated and appears to be improving her respiratory status. Ongoing monitoring for clinical improvement and follow-up with cultures is essential.

3. EKG changes: The patient exhibits sinus bradycardia with very low voltages on EKG. These findings are likely due to increased vagal tone, possibly related to steroid replacement. Continued monitoring and avoidance of excessive alpha-agonism are recommended.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved, and she is off vasopressor support. However, her cardiac output"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which may be caused by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), traumatic brain injury (TBI), or tracheobronchomalacia.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a confirmed Klebsiella infection, for which she is receiving an appropriate antibiotic course. The plan is to complete an 8-day course of levofloxacin and discontinue vancomycin if sputum cultures remain negative.

3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has very low random cortisol levels while in shock and respiratory failure. She is currently on steroids but has come off and stayed off of pressors. Eventually, she will need to be weaned off steroids as well.

4. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low, but it increases with stimulation. This suggests that the bradycardia is mostly due to vagal stimulation rather than a more serious underlying condition.

5. Right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed a DVT, and therapeutic heparin is being administered. She will likely need to be transitioned to warfarin for long-term anticoagulation.

6. Traumatic thoracic spinal fracture: The patient has a spinal fracture, and an MRI is planned to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a prolonged hospital course, including a fall and thoracic compression fractures. She was admitted for evaluation of a Y stent for bronchopleural fistula. Her medical history includes right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and sepsis with hypotension, pressor needs, and respiratory failure, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bronchopleural fistula (TBM). The patient has been unable to wean off the ventilator and requires high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). She also has adrenal insufficiency, bradycardia, and a Klebsiella infection. The patient is hemodynamically stable off pressors but remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation and has difficulty weaning off the ventilator. High PEEP requirements indicate ongoing respiratory distress.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a prolonged course of mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Klebsiella infection has been identified, and the patient is on appropriate antibiotics.
3. Bronchopleural Fistula (TBM): The patient's prolonged hospital stay and respiratory failure may be related to a bronchopleural fistula, which is a connection between the bronchus and the pleural cavity.
4. Adrenal"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.
   Likely [**2-14**] VAP. Unlikely to have tracheomalacia as initially
   transferred for.
   -          wean PEEP
   -          Given mild alkalosis, will decrease RR to 18, repeat ABG
   -          discuss need for trach with patient and her family
   -          Will continue gentle diuresis once alkalosis resolved
   # Pneumonia: Pansensitive Kleb oxytoca pneumonia and sputum with GPCs
   on gram stain.   Afebrile overnight. On levofloxacin since [**9-20**].
   Vancomycin, aztreonam have been stopped. Resp status seems to be
   improving.
   - Follow cultures
   - d/c levofloxacin having completed 8 day course
   # Sedation: On versed and fentanyl
   # EKG changes: Sinus bradycardia, now somewhat improved.  Likely
   related to increased vagal tone possibly related to steroid
   replacement.  Atrial EKG shows p-waves and cardiac enzymes normal.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Hypotension: Improved, off levophed for 2-3 days now, with good urine
   output.  CVP increasing with reduction in PEEP.  Likely [**2-14**] poor
   adrenal response in setting of acute illness and very high PEEP.
   -D/C fludricort and hydrocortisone now that the 5 day steroid course is
   complete
   -monitor, expect improvement with continual reduction in PEEP
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**], now therapeutic.  Follow
   PTTs.  Would hold off on coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - continue to monitor
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should
   have been maximally stimulated.
   -  hydrocortisone and florinef for 5 days
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - Trend HCT
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse who presented with mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, sedation, hypotension, DVT, adrenal insufficiency, anemia, and a spine fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is likely given her prolonged intubation time.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pansensitive Klebsiella oxytoca pneumonia. It is important to follow cultures and consider discontinuing levofloxacin after completing an 8-day course.
3. Sedation: The patient is on versed and fentanyl for sedation. Monitoring should continue as any changes in sedation level can impact weaning from the ventilator.
4. EKG Changes: The patient has experienced sinus bradycardia, which is likely related to increased vagal tone possibly due to steroid replacement. Cardiac enzymes are normal.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved, and she is off levophed for the past 2-3 days. With the reduction in PEEP, her CVP is increasing. It is possible that the poor adrenal response"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.
   Likely [**2-14**] VAP. Unlikely to have tracheomalacia as initially
   transferred for.
   -          wean PEEP
   -          discuss need for trach with patient and her family
   # Pneumonia: Pansensitive Kleb oxytoca pneumonia and sputum with GPCs
   on gram stain.   Afebrile overnight. On levofloxacin since [**9-20**].
   Vancomycin, aztreonam have been stopped. Resp status seems to be
   improving.
   - Follow cultures
   - d/c aztreonam
   - Continue levofloxacin for 8 days (today = day [**7-21**])
   # EKG changes: Sinus bradycardia.  Very low voltages and no change in
   QRS morphology.  P-waves are visible and prolonged PR interval is old.
   CK and troponins flat.  Likely related to increased vagal tone possibly
   related to steroid replacement. Atrial EKG with p-waves c/w sinus
   bradycardia.
   - Will avoid excessive alpha-agonism
   - Continue to monitor
   # Hypotension: Improved, off levophed for 2 days, with good urine

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU after a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She required intubation for respiratory failure and has difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient also has pneumonia caused by pansensitive Klebsiella oxytoca, for which she is being treated with levofloxacin. She has shown improvement in her respiratory status.

The patient has experienced several complications, including sinus bradycardia likely related to increased vagal tone possibly due to steroid replacement, hypotension that has improved, a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and adrenal insufficiency. She is being treated with hydrocortisone and fluorine for her adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's spine fracture is neurologically intact distal to the lesion, and no surgical procedure is planned at this time. The patient is in a spine brace and will have a CT scan of the C, L spine when stable. Nutrition and glycemic control are being monitored and managed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. It is important to monitor her respiratory status and follow up with cultures to prevent and treat any potential infection.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a right lower"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.
   Likely [**2-14**] VAP. Unlikely to have tracheomalacia as initially
   transferred for.
   -          wean PEEP
   -          Given mild alkalosis, will decrease RR to 18, repeat ABG
   -          discuss need for trach with patient and her family
   -          Will continue gentle diuresis once alkalosis resolved
   # Pneumonia: Pansensitive Kleb oxytoca pneumonia and sputum with GPCs
   on gram stain.   Afebrile overnight. On levofloxacin since [**9-20**].
   Vancomycin, aztreonam have been stopped. Resp status seems to be
   improving.
   - Follow cultures
   - d/c levofloxacin having completed 8 day course
   # Sedation: On versed and fentanyl
   # EKG changes: Sinus bradycardia, now somewhat improved.  Likely
   related to increased vagal tone possibly related to steroid
   replacement.  Atrial EKG shows p-waves and cardiac enzymes normal.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Hypotension: Improved, off levophed for 2-3 days now, with good urine
   output.  CVP increasing with reduction in PEEP.  Likely [**2-14**] poor
   adrenal response in setting of acute illness and very high PEEP.
   -D/C fludricort and hydrocortisone now that the 5 day steroid course is
   complete
   -monitor, expect improvement with continual reduction in PEEP
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**], now therapeutic.  Follow
   PTTs.  Would hold off on coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - continue to monitor
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should
   have been maximally stimulated.
   -  hydrocortisone and florinef for 5 days
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - Trend HCT
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-inch tall male weighing 101 kg, admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to pneumonia. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa (sulfonamides). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103-135 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 400 mL, set respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%.

The patient received one dose of Haldol yesterday afternoon and has been on steroids and antibiotics, which are being discontinued today. The patient has been receiving midazolam (Versed), heparin sodium, and fentanyl infusions. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,681 mL and output of 3,135 mL, with a negative balance of -454 mL. The patient's ABG results show pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, PaO2 of 68 mmHg, HCO3- of 27 mEq/L, BE of -3 mEq/L, and SaO2 of 95%.

The patient's laboratory results include WBC count of 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, glucose of 187 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, potassium of 3.8 mEq/L, sodium of 111 mEq/L, chloride of 103 mEq/L, magnesium of 2.1 mg/dL, calcium of 8.3 mg/dL, albumin of 2.4 g/dL, and total bilirubin of 9.7 K/uL. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, amylase/lipase, and differential white blood cell count are also provided.

The patient's physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not performed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment not performed due to sedation. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and early identification of any worsening respiratory symptoms or signs of infection is crucial.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin are being given, but regular assessment for signs of DVT and consideration for lower limb Doppler ultrasound should be done. If a DVT is confirmed, appropriate anticoagulation therapy and consideration for thrombectomy may be necessary.
3. Delirium: The patient's sedation and the ICU environment can contribute to delirium. Regular assessment of mental status and early mobilization when feasible can help prevent or manage delirium.
4. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections. Monitoring for any signs of infection, such as fever or worsening of symptoms, is important.
5. Fluid overload: The patient has a negative fluid balance, indicating ongoing fluid losses. Close monitoring of fluid status and careful management of fluid administration are necessary to prevent fluid overload and associated complications.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient is receiving tight glycemic control, and there is a risk of hypoglycemia. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to prevent and promptly manage hypoglycemia.
7. Bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin sodium, an anticoagulant, which increases the risk of bleeding. Regular assessment of bleeding parameters such as PT/PTT and careful management of anticoagulation therapy are important to prevent bleeding complications.

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable with controlled vital signs and improving laboratory values. However, close monitoring and prompt management of potential complications are necessary to ensure the patient's well-being."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a prolonged hospital course. She has a history of alcohol abuse and was admitted for evaluation of a Y stent for bronchopleural fistula (BTM). The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and traumatic thoracic spinal fracture. She also has right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), sepsis with hypotension, and adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is within normal range, blood pressure is relatively stable, heart rate is bradycardic but increases with stimulation, respiratory rate is set at 20 breaths per minute with assistance, and oxygen saturation is at 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, symmetric breath sounds, no cyanosis or clubbing, and warm skin. Neurological examination shows that the patient is sedated and non-purposeful, with no attentive or follow-up commands.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, normal creatinine, and electrolyte levels within normal range. Imaging shows no new data, but there are effusions in both lungs, which could be contributing to the respiratory failure.

The patient's assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory failure: Continue to wean PEEP as tolerated following ABG/SATs. Once P"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo F w/ prolonged hospital course, etoh abuse with fall and thoracic
   compression fxs who was  tranferred from OSH for evaluation of Y stent
   for BTM, course has been c/b R UE DVT and sepsis with hypotension,
   pressor needs, and resp failure likely [**2-14**] VAP,TBM now with failure to
   wean, still with high PEEP requirements.
   Main issues remain--
   #  Respiratory failure
       Continue to wean PEEP as tolerated following abg/sats
           Once PEEP lower, heading toward trach, given prolonged course,
   poor MS, vol overload
          IV lasix for goal neg 500 cc i/o
         [**Month (only) 8**] ultimately benefit form investigation for TBM
          Decrease RR on vent to optimize pH given alkalosis (mixed,
   mainly resp)
   # Adrenal insufficiency
        Had very low random cortisol while in shock and respiratory
   failure
        On steroids, has come off and stayed off of pressors
        Today completes 5 day course of stress dose steroids--will

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a prolonged hospital course, including a history of alcohol abuse, fall, and thoracic compression fractures. She was transferred for evaluation of Y stent placement for bronchopleural fistula (BTM). The patient's medical history includes right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), sepsis with hypotension and pressor needs, respiratory failure, and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and tracheobronchial mucosal injury (TBM). 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, failure to wean from the ventilator, and high PEEP requirements. She has been sedated and intubated. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is still experiencing crackles in her lungs, indicating ongoing fluid overload. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, suggesting an ongoing infection. Imaging reveals bilateral effusions and opacities in the lungs, consistent with pneumonia. 

Assessment and Plan:
The main issues remain respiratory failure, adrenal insufficiency, Klebsiella VAP, right upper extremity DVT, traumatic thoracic spinal fracture, and poor glycemic control. The plan includes continued weaning of PEEP, administration of IV lasix for fluid overload, completion of a course of levofloxacin for VAP, therapeutic heparin for DVT, MRI for spinal fracture"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.
   Likely [**2-14**] VAP. Transferred here for tracheomalacia, but not sure this
   is a component.  Will need bronch eval when improved
   -          wean PEEP
   -          repeat ABG this AM
   -          discuss need for trach with patient and her family
   -          Will continue gentle diuresis once alkalosis resolved
   # Diuresis
 Currently with hypernatremia, Cr increase, contract alk
   suggestive of overdiuresis
   - FW in TF at 150 cc q4hrs
   - PM lytes.  Can restart lasix if resolved
   # Pneumonia: Pansensitive Kleb oxytoca pneumonia and sputum with GPCs
   on gram stain.   Afebrile off abx.
   # Sedation: On versed  3mg/hr + .5 q 1hr and fentanyl  150 mcg/hr + 50
   bolus q 1hr.
   - seroquil 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   # EKG changes: Sinus bradycardia, responsive to stress.  Related to
   sedation, increased vagal tone, possibly related to steroid
   replacement.  Atrial EKG shows p-waves and cardiac enzymes normal.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Hypotension: Improved, off levophed for 2-3 days now, with good urine
   output.  s/p 5 d courserof steroids and getting high PEEP.  Now likely
   related to sedation and decreased intravascual volume,
   -monitor, expect improvement with continual reduction in PEEP
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**], now therapeutic.  Follow
   PTTs.  Would hold off on coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - continue to monitor
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should
   have been maximally stimulated.
   -  hydrocortisone and florinef for 5 days
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - Trend HCT
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory decompensation. There is a suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Bronchoscopy evaluation will be needed when she improves.
2. Diuresis: The patient has hypernatremia, creatinine increase, and contraction alkalosis, suggesting overdiuresis. Fluid restriction and adjustment of diuretic dosage will be necessary.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a pansensitive Klebsiella oxytoca pneumonia and sputum with gram-positive cocci on gram stain. She is off antibiotics for now.
4. Sedation: The patient is on midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl for sedation. Seroquel has been ordered for agitation.
5. EKG changes: The patient has sinus bradycardia, which is responsive to stress. It may be related to sedation, increased vagal tone, or steroid replacement. Cardiac enzymes are normal.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved, and she is no longer on levophed. Her low blood pressure may be due to sedation"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.
   Likely [**2-14**] VAP. Unlikely to have tracheomalacia as initially
   transferred for.
   -          wean PEEP
   -          Given mild alkalosis, will decrease RR to 18, repeat ABG
   -          discuss need for trach with patient and her family
   -          Will continue gentle diuresis once alkalosis resolved
   # Pneumonia: Pansensitive Kleb oxytoca pneumonia and sputum with GPCs
   on gram stain.   Afebrile overnight. On levofloxacin since [**9-20**].
   Vancomycin, aztreonam have been stopped. Resp status seems to be
   improving.
   - Follow cultures
   - d/c levofloxacin having completed 8 day course
   # Sedation: On versed and fentanyl
   # EKG changes: Sinus bradycardia, now somewhat improved.  Likely
   related to increased vagal tone possibly related to steroid
   replacement.  Atrial EKG shows p-waves and cardiac enzymes normal.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Hypotension: Improved, off levophed for 2-3 days now, with good urine
   output.  CVP increasing with reduction in PEEP.  Likely [**2-14**] poor
   adrenal response in setting of acute illness and very high PEEP.
   -D/C fludricort and hydrocortisone now that the 5 day steroid course is
   complete
   -monitor, expect improvement with continual reduction in PEEP
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**], now therapeutic.  Follow
   PTTs.  Would hold off on coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - continue to monitor
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should
   have been maximally stimulated.
   -  hydrocortisone and florinef for 5 days
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - Trend HCT
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

   -          Boyfriend of 10 [**Name2 (NI) 579**] is her HCP.  Also brother is involved

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented following a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on September 12th for respiratory decompensation and is suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan is to wean PEEP, decrease RR to 18, repeat ABG, discuss the need for tracheostomy, and continue gentle diuresis once alkalosis is resolved.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pansensitive Klebsiella oxytoca pneumonia, as indicated by sputum with gram-positive cocci on gram stain. She is currently on levofloxacin since September 20th. Vancomycin and aztreonam have been stopped, and her respiratory status seems to be improving. Follow-up cultures are planned, and levofloxacin will be discontinued after completing an 8-day course.
3. Sedation: The patient is on versed and fentanyl for sedation.
4. EKG changes: The patient experienced sinus bradycardia, which has somewhat improved. This may be related to increased vagal tone possibly associated with steroid replacement. The patient's cardiac enzymes are normal. Monitoring will continue.

   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.
   Likely [**2-14**] VAP. Transferred here for tracheomalacia, but not sure this
   is a component.  Will need bronch eval when improved
   - will discuss PEEP goal for trach placement with IP.
   - wean PEEP
   - repeat ABG this AM
   - discuss need for trach with patient and her family
   - Volume overload may be contributing.
   # Volume overload
 Currently with hypernatremia, Cr increase, contract
   alk, but mild
   - continue gentle diuresis
   - FW in TF at 150 cc q4hrs
   - PM lytes.
   # Sedation: On versed  3mg/hr + .5 q 1hr and fentanyl  150 mcg/hr + 50
   bolus q 1hr.
   - Start fentanyl patch and diazepam to provide long acting analgesia
   and wean from drips
   - Haldol 1 mg Q4h PRN agitation
   # Pneumonia: Pansensitive Kleb oxytoca pneumonia and sputum with GPCs
   on gram stain.   Afebrile off abx.
   # EKG changes: Sinus bradycardia, responsive to stress.  Related to
   sedation, increased vagal tone, possibly related to steroid
   replacement.  Atrial EKG shows p-waves and cardiac enzymes normal.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Hypotension: Improved, off levophed for 2-3 days now, with good urine
   output.  s/p 5 d course of steroids for adrenal insufficiency.  High
   PEEP may have been contributing.  Now likely related to sedation and
   decreased intravascular volume,
   -monitor, expect improvement with continual reduction in
   PEEP
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**], now therapeutic.  Follow
   PTTs.  Would hold off on coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - continue to monitor
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should
   have been maximally stimulated.
   -  hydrocortisone and florinef for 5 days
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - Trend HCT
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU with respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. She has a traumatic T-spine fracture, and her condition is complicated by several medical issues including volume overload, hypernatremia, pneumonia, adrenal insufficiency, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and anemia. She is currently intubated and on sedation medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory decompensation, and she required intubation. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which needs to be addressed.
2. Volume overload: The patient has signs of fluid overload, as evidenced by increased central venous pressure (CVP) and fluid balance. This can contribute to respiratory distress and other complications.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, indicating possible dehydration or imbalances in electrolytes.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has a pansensitive Klebsiella oxytoca infection in her sputum, which needs to be treated.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient may have adrenal gland dysfunction, as indicated by low cortisol levels. This condition requires prompt management with steroid replacement.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed DVT and is on heparin therapy. Monitoring PTTs is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU following a mechanical fall and traumatic thoracic spine fracture. She has respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient has been intubated multiple times for respiratory decompensation and transferred to our facility for tracheomalacia evaluation. She requires a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) once stable on PEEP around 10. 

The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be related to sedation, high PEEP, adrenal insufficiency, or sepsis. She also has hypernatremia, increased creatinine levels, metabolic acidosis, and mild volume overload. The patient is currently sedated with midazolam, fentanyl, diazepam, and haloperidol. 

She has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was previously on heparin but has been held for the planned tracheostomy. The patient also has a history of adrenal insufficiency, and cortisol levels have been low despite stimulation. She has been receiving hydrocortisone and florinef.

The patient's spine fracture is neurologically intact, and there are no plans for surgical intervention. She is currently wearing a brace and will undergo a CT scan of the cervical and lumbar spine when stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has difficulty weaning from the ventilator, which may lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Volume Overload: The patient has mild volume overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory function.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension can be caused by various factors such as sedation, high PEEP, adrenal insufficiency, or sepsis. It requires careful monitoring and management to prevent shock.
4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's low cortisol levels indicate adrenal insufficiency, which can lead to hypotension and electrolyte imbalances. Proper management with hydrocortisone and fluorine is essential.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a right upper extremity DVT, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation therapy is necessary.
6. Tracheostomy Complications: Tracheostomy carries risks such as bleeding, infection, and tracheal injury. Close monitoring during and after the procedure is crucial.
7. Spinal Cord Injury: Although the patient's spine fracture is neurologically intact, there is still a risk of neurological complications due to spinal cord compression or other factors. Regular assessment and management are required."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.
   Likely [**2-14**] VAP. Transferred here for tracheomalacia, but not sure this
   is a component.  Will need bronch eval when improved
   - will discuss PEEP goal for trach placement with IP.
   - wean PEEP
   - repeat ABG this AM
   - discuss need for trach with patient and her family
   - Volume overload may be contributing.
   # Volume overload
 Currently with hypernatremia, Cr increase, contract
   alk, but mild
   - continue gentle diuresis
   - FW in TF at 150 cc q4hrs
   - PM lytes.
   # Sedation: On versed  3mg/hr + .5 q 1hr and fentanyl  150 mcg/hr + 50
   bolus q 1hr.
   - Start fentanyl patch and diazepam to provide long acting analgesia
   and wean from drips
   - Haldol 1 mg Q4h PRN agitation
   # Pneumonia: Pansensitive Kleb oxytoca pneumonia and sputum with GPCs
   on gram stain.   Afebrile off abx.
   # EKG changes: Sinus bradycardia, responsive to stress.  Related to
   sedation, increased vagal tone, possibly related to steroid
   replacement.  Atrial EKG shows p-waves and cardiac enzymes normal.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Hypotension: Improved, off levophed for 2-3 days now, with good urine
   output.  s/p 5 d course of steroids for adrenal insufficiency.  High
   PEEP may have been contributing.  Now likely related to sedation and
   decreased intravascular volume,
   -monitor, expect improvement with continual reduction in PEEP
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**], now therapeutic.  Follow
   PTTs.  Would hold off on coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - continue to monitor
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should
   have been maximally stimulated.
   -  hydrocortisone and florinef for 5 days
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - Trend HCT
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse who presented following a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient has several medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on 9/12 due to respiratory decompensation, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She will need a tracheostomy evaluation when improved.

2. Volume overload: The patient may be experiencing volume overload, as indicated by hypernatremia, creatinine increase, and metabolic alkalosis. Gentle diuresis is recommended, along with fluid restriction in the titers.

3. Sedation: The patient is on midazolam and fentanyl for sedation. Fentanyl patch and diazepam will be started to provide long-acting analgesia and wean from the drips.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has pansensitive Kleb oxytoca pneumonia, and her sputum showed gram-positive cocci. She is currently afebrile and off antibiotics.

5. EKG changes: The patient has sinus bradycardia, which is responsive to stress. It may be related to sedation, increased vagal tone, or possibly related to steroid replacement. Cardiac enzymes are normal.

6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved, and she is no longer on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU following a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient is intubated and has been on mechanical ventilation since September 12th. She has been diagnosed with tracheomalacia and will require a tracheostomy. The patient also has a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is receiving treatment with heparin. She has hypernatremia, an increase in creatinine, metabolic alkalosis, and mild anemia. She has been sedated with midazolam and fentanyl due to agitation and agitation-related tachycardia and hypotension. She has been given haloperidol for agitation. The patient has been weaned off levophed and is now being supported by PEEP. She has evidence of pansensitive Klebsiella oxytoca pneumonia and sputum with gram-positive cocci. Her EKG shows sinus bradycardia, which is responsive to stress. She has been diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency and has been treated with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. The patient's spine fracture is neurologically intact distal to the lesion, and she is being managed conservatively with a spine brace. She has anemia, but it is stable, and she is currently receiving tube feeds. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is still pending."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented following a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has been diagnosed with various medical conditions, including respiratory failure, volume overload, hyperreflexia, sedation issues, hypotension, right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), adrenal insufficiency, and spine fracture.

The patient has been intubated since September 12th due to respiratory decompensation and was transferred to the current facility for tracheomalacia evaluation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 91/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%.

She has undergone several tests and procedures, including an arterial line placement, free water flushes for hypernatremia, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) ordered, and a chest X-ray. The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, TCO2, glucose, electrolytes, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.

The patient's plan of care involves weaning off sedatives, adjusting PEEP levels, addressing volume overload, managing hyperreflexia, treating DVT, managing adrenal insufficiency, and evaluating the need for trache"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, ? trachiomalacia, resolved
   VAP, volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.
   Transferred here for tracheomalacia, but not sure this is a component.
   Will need bronch eval when improved
   - Thoracics will do trach and PEG once stable on PEEPs around 10.
   Re-c/s today.
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   # Volume overload
 Hypernatremic (? Relationship to adrenal
   insufficiency), TBW deficit 2.6L.
   - goal even I/Os today
   - FW in TF at 250 cc q4hrs
   - PM lytes
   # Hyperreflexia - ? [**2-14**] meds vs central pathology
   - consider head CT in context of heparin gtt to r/o intracranial
   hemmorhage
   # Sedation: Poor sedation control. On Versed 1.5, Fentanyl 175,
   Fentanyl patch, Diazepam standing and haldo 2.5-5 mg PRN.  QTc stable
   at .44
   -          Wean versed/fentanyl as tolerated
   -          Recheck EKG today
   -
   # Hypotension:  Related to sedation, but high PEEP, adrenial
   insufficiency, sepsis have previously been contributing. Monitor with
   A-line. Failed [**Last Name (un) **] stim again.
   - hydrocortisol and fludrocortisone
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**]. PTTs.  Would hold off on
   coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - hold heparin gtt when anticipate trach/peg
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Minimal response to [**Last Name (un) **] stim test again.
   -          hydrocort and fludrocort
   -          consider endocrine c/s for further elucidation of etiology
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.
   # Communication:
   -          Boyfriend of 10 [**Name2 (NI) 579**] is her HCP.  Also brother is involved
   # FEN/GI:  Tube feeds @ goal.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse who presented following a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
- The patient has been intubated since September 12th for respiratory decompensation and was transferred to this ICU for tracheomalacia, although it is unclear if this is a contributing factor.
- The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, volume overload, hyperreflexia, poor sedation control, hypotension, right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), adrenal insufficiency, and spine fracture.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows:
  - Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
  - Heart rate: 63 bpm
  - Blood pressure: 91/41 mmHg
  - Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
  - Oxygen saturation: 91%
- The patient is currently receiving various medications including steroids, heparin, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, haloperidol (Haldol), and others.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, low platelet count, high creatinine, low total protein, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse presenting after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has been intubated since the end of [Month] due to respiratory failure related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, and resolved VAP. The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, which has led to respiratory failure. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient had a minimal response to the [Last Name (un)] stim test, indicating adrenal insufficiency. She has been started on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to adrenal insufficiency. Goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) is above 60, and she is receiving hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Levophed may be restarted if necessary.

4. Volume overload: The patient is volume overloaded, possibly related to adrenal insufficiency. Her total body water (TBW) deficit is 2.6L. Goals include maintaining even I/Os today, continuing free water flushes in the tube feed at 250 cc q4hrs, and starting a lasix drip when MAP is above 60.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.
   Transferred here for tracheomalacia, but not sure this is a component.
   Will need bronch eval when improved
   - Thoracics will do trach and PEG once stable on PEEPs around 10.  Had
   been planned for today but currently holding as PEEP is 15.
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - needs A-line
   # Volume overload
 Currently with hypernatremia, Cr increase, contract
   alk, but mild
   - continue gentle diuresis with goal -1L per day as tolerated by blood
   pressure.  IV lasix drip at 1-5 mg/hr.
   - FW in TF at 150 cc q4hrs
   - PM lytes.
   # Sedation: Now well seadated on Versed 1.5, Fentanyl 175, Fentanyl
   patch, Diazepam standing and haldo 2.5-5 mg PRN.  QTc stable at .44
   - Wean versed/fentanyl as tolerated
   # HCT
 Has had slow decline while in ICU.
   - Xfuse PRN Hct < 21
   - continue to follow, guiac stools
   # Hypotension:  Related to sedation, but high PEEP, adrenial
   insufficiency, sepsis have previously been contributing.
   - needs A-line for monitoring
   - cortisol stim to rule out persistent adrenal insufficiency
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**], now off for trach that was
   planned for today.  Follow PTTs.  Would hold off on coumadin at least
   until s/p trach.
   - restart heparin
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should
   have been maximally stimulated.   S/P 5 days of hydrocortisone and
   florinef.
   - will recheck as above and start at 50 q8 if needed
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure is related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP, and volume overload. Intubation was performed on [9-12] for respiratory decompensation. The patient needs further evaluation for bronchial issues when improved.

2. Volume overload: The patient has hypernatremia, creatinine increase, metabolic alkalosis, but mild volume overload. Gentle diuresis with a goal of -1L per day as tolerated by blood pressure is recommended. IV lasix drip at 1-5 mg/hr and fluid restriction in the titration fluid at 150 cc q4hrs are advised.

3. Sedation: The patient is well sedated on Versed 1.5, Fentanyl 175, Fentanyl patch, Diazepam standing, and haloperidol 2.5-5 mg PRN. QTc is stable at 0.44. Weaning of sedatives should be done as tolerated.

4. HCT: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has had a slow decline while in the ICU. Exchange transfusion PRN Hct < 21 is recommended. Monitoring for guaiac positive stools is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with respiratory failure
   and difficulty weaning from vent.
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.
   Transferred here for tracheomalacia, but not sure this is a component.
   Will need bronch eval when improved
   - Thoracics will do trach and PEG once stable on PEEPs around 10.  Had
   been planned for today but currently holding as PEEP is 15.
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - needs A-line
   # Volume overload
 Currently with hypernatremia, Cr increase, contract
   alk, but mild
   - continue gentle diuresis with goal -1L per day as tolerated by blood
   pressure.  IV lasix drip at 1-5 mg/hr.
   - FW in TF at 150 cc q4hrs
   - PM lytes.
   # Sedation: Now well seadated on Versed 1.5, Fentanyl 175, Fentanyl
   patch, Diazepam standing and haldo 2.5-5 mg PRN.  QTc stable at .44
   - Wean versed/fentanyl as tolerated
   # HCT
 Has had slow decline while in ICU.
   - Xfuse PRN Hct < 21
   - continue to follow, guiac stools
   # Hypotension:  Related to sedation, but high PEEP, adrenial
   insufficiency, sepsis have previously been contributing.
   - needs A-line for monitoring
   - cortisol stim to rule out persistent adrenal insufficiency
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**], now off for trach that was
   planned for today.  Follow PTTs.  Would hold off on coumadin at least
   until s/p trach.
   - restart heparin
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Random cortisol was approx 3 when it should
   have been maximally stimulated.   S/P 5 days of hydrocortisone and
   florinef.
   - will recheck as above and start at 50 q8 if needed
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She experienced respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient has been intubated since September 12th for respiratory decompensation and was transferred here due to tracheomalacia, although its contribution is uncertain. She requires a bronch evaluation when she improves.

The patient has several medical issues, including respiratory failure related to ARDS, tracheomalacia, resolved VAP, and volume overload. She is currently sedated on Versed 1.5, Fentanyl 175, Fentanyl patch, Diazepam standing, and Haloperidol 2.5-5 mg PRN. Her QTc is stable at 0.44, and she needs to be weaned off sedatives as tolerated.

She also has hypotension related to sedation, high PEEP, adrenal insufficiency, and sepsis. The patient requires an arterial line for monitoring, and cortisol stimulation is needed to rule out persistent adrenal insufficiency. Additionally, she has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently off heparin due to the planned tracheostomy. The heparin should be restarted, and PTTs should be followed. 

The patient's hematocrit (HCT) has been declining slowly in the"

   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.
   Transferred here for airway stenting.
   - attempt SBT today
   - OR add on for trach and PEG [**10-2**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 853**] (tube feeds off
   after MN, heparin off after 6am)
   # # Adrenal Insufficency: Minimal response to [**Last Name (un) **] stim test again.
   Appreciate endocrine recommendations.
   -          hydrocort and fludrocort (day 1 = [**9-30**])
   -          will continue at current dose until s/p trach and PEG and
   hemodynamically stable for 24 hours
 will then plan to taper
   hydrocortisone to 25mg IV q6 with a slow taper
   -          will repreat ACTH stim test after tapered to <30mg
   hydrocortisone or off steroids
   -          f/u daily endocrine recs
   # Hypotension:  Likely [**2-14**] adrenal insufficiency and sedation. Goal map
   > 60.  Much improved since re-administration of steroids.
   -          hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone as above
   -          restart levophed if necessary to maintain MAP > 60
   # Volume overloaded in setting of hypernatremia with TBW deficit.
   - goal -1000cc I/Os today
   - continue FW in TF at 250 cc q4hrs
   - lasix drip (1-5mg/hr) when MAP > 60
   # Sedation: Sedation control remains somewhat poor although fentanyl
   patch and diazpem are likely therapeutic range today. On Versed 1.5,
   Fentanyl 175, Fentanyl patch, Diazepam standing and haldo 2.5-5 mg
   PRN.  QTc increased to 480.
   -          Wean versed/fentanyl as tolerated, continue diazepam. Avoid
   haldol use if possible to avoid further prolongation of QTc
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**]. PTTs.  Would hold off on
   coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - hold heparin gtt when anticipate trach/peg
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has been intubated since the end of [Month] due to respiratory failure related to ARDS, tracheomalacia, and resolved ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is also experiencing adrenal insufficiency, hypotension, volume overload, and poor sedation control. She has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a history of ethanol abuse. The patient's current plan includes attempting spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today, undergoing surgery for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on [Date] with Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 853], and continuing steroids until stable, then tapering. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/69 mmHg to 143/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 91%, and sinus tachycardia on EKG.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of ARDS and tracheomalacia, which may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.

2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has minimal response"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with K. oxytoca PNA and
   ARDS intubated since the end of [**Month (only) **].
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.
   Transferred here for airway stenting.  Will need bronch eval when
   improved.
   - Thoracics will do trach and PEG once stable on PEEPs around 10.
   Re-c/s today.
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   # # Adrenal Insufficency: Minimal response to [**Last Name (un) **] stim test again.
   -          hydrocort and fludrocort (day 1 = [**9-30**])
   -          endocrine c/s for further elucidation of etiology
   # Hypotension:  Likely [**2-14**] adrenal insufficiency. Goal map > 60.
   -          hydrocortisol and fludrocortisone as above
   -          restart levophed if necessary to maintain MAP > 60
   # Volume overloaded in setting of hypernatremia (? Relationship to
   adrenal insufficiency), TBW deficit 2.6L.
   - goal even to -500cc I/Os today
   - continue FW in TF at 250 cc q4hrs
   - lasix drip (1-5mg/hr) when MAP > 60
   # Hyperreflexia - ? [**2-14**] meds vs central pathology.  Unlikely to be [**2-14**]
   intracranial hemorrhage as patient is diffusely hyperreflexic.
   Possible relationship to endocrine pathology?
   -          consider head CT in setting of heparin gtt
   -          monitor
   # Sedation: Sedation control remains somewhat poor although fentanyl
   patch and diazpem are likely starting increase to therapeutic range
   today. On Versed 1.5, Fentanyl 175, Fentanyl patch, Diazepam standing
   and haldo 2.5-5 mg PRN.  QTc stable at .44.
   -          Wean versed/fentanyl as tolerated, continue diazepam and prn
   haldol
   -          Recheck EKG today
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**]. PTTs.  Would hold off on
   coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - hold heparin gtt when anticipate trach/peg
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.
   # Communication:
   -          Boyfriend of 10 [**Name2 (NI) 579**] is her HCP.  Also brother is involved

   Assessment and Plan
   55 y/o woman with thoracic spinal fracture (mechanical after fall)
   complicated by ARDS from VAP, UE DVT, and adrenal insufficiency.
   Respiratory failure
   Try RSBI/SBT today.  If not extubatable, plan trach/G tomorrow
   Diurese with Lasix gtt
   [**Month (only) 8**] eventually need rx of tracheobronchomalacia
   s/p treatment for Klebsiella VAP acquired at OSH
   Shock / adrenal insufficiency
   She has essentially proven adrenal insufficiency, with a baseline
   cortisol that was very low on pressors and a vent, followed by
   resolution of shock with steroids, followed by recrudescence of shock
   when steroids stopped, followed by resolution of shock with steroids (a
   second time).
   Continue steroids at current dose until after tracheostomy/PEG.
   Appreciate endocrine
s help.
   DVT (UE)
   Resume heparin until several hours before O.R.
   Nutrition / Lytes
   Will restart tube feeds and free water boluses for hypernatremia.
   Spine fractures
   Continue spinal stabilization with brace when OOB; will eventually need
   MRI for further evaluation.  Would wait until she has a surgical airway
   if she does not pass SBT today.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with several medical conditions and complications. The chief complaint is respiratory failure. She has a history of thoracic spinal fracture, which was caused by a mechanical fall. This spinal fracture has led to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) secondary to Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), as well as upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and adrenal insufficiency.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device. Her vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and low oxygen saturation. The ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is overweight/obese, with clear breath sounds and no abnormal findings in other systems. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, high blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The chest X-ray shows increased opacity in the right lung base and lower lung volumes.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is being tried for spontaneous breathing trial (RSBI/SBT) today. If she is not extubatable, a tracheostomy will be performed tomorrow. She will continue to receive diuretics with Lasix to manage fluid balance.

2. Shock/adrenal insufficiency: The patient has proven adrenal insufficiency, requiring continuation of steroids at the current"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with K. oxytoca PNA and
   ARDS intubated since the end of [**Month (only) **].
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.
   Transferred here for airway stenting.
   - attempt SBT today
   - OR add on for trach and PEG [**10-2**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 853**] (tube feeds off
   after MN, heparin off after 6am)
   # # Adrenal Insufficency: Minimal response to [**Last Name (un) **] stim test again.
   Appreciate endocrine recommendations.
   -          hydrocort and fludrocort (day 1 = [**9-30**])
   -          will continue at current dose until s/p trach and PEG and
   hemodynamically stable for 24 hours
 will then plan to taper
   hydrocortisone to 25mg IV q6 with a slow taper
   -          will repreat ACTH stim test after tapered to <30mg
   hydrocortisone or off steroids
   -          f/u daily endocrine recs
   # Hypotension:  Likely [**2-14**] adrenal insufficiency and sedation. Goal map
   > 60.  Much improved since re-administration of steroids.
   -          hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone as above
   -          restart levophed if necessary to maintain MAP > 60
   # Volume overloaded in setting of hypernatremia with TBW deficit.
   - goal -1000cc I/Os today
   - continue FW in TF at 250 cc q4hrs
   - lasix drip (1-5mg/hr) when MAP >
   60
   # Sedation: Sedation control remains somewhat poor although fentanyl
   patch and diazpem are likely therapeutic range today. On Versed 1.5,
   Fentanyl 175, Fentanyl patch, Diazepam standing and haldo 2.5-5 mg
   PRN.  QTc increased to 480.
   -          Wean versed/fentanyl as tolerated, continue diazepam. Avoid
   haldol use if possible to avoid further prolongation of QTc
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**]. PTTs.  Would hold off on
   coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - hold heparin gtt when anticipate trach/peg
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.
   # FEN/GI:  Tube feeds with FWF @ goal.
   DVT: Treatment dose heparin
   Ulcer: Ranitidine
   VAP: Prevention per routine
   # Communication:
   -          Boyfriend of 10 [**Name2 (NI) 579**] is her HCP.  Also brother is involved
    -         touch base with SW today

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse who presented following a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has been diagnosed with Klebsiella oxytoca pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for which she was intubated. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to ARDS and trachiomalacia, resolved ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and volume overload. She is scheduled for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement tomorrow morning.

The patient also has adrenal insufficiency, as evidenced by minimal response to ACTH stimulation test and improvement in hypotension after re-administration of steroids. She is currently on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy. Additionally, the patient has a history of DVT and is currently on heparin gtt. She will hold off on coumadin until after the trach/PEG procedure.

The patient's vital signs include tachycardia and hypertension, with a maximum temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F). Her blood pressure ranges from 155/84 mmHg to 177/106 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 90%. The patient has non-pitting edema of both hands and anasarca. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and plate"

   # Hypotension:  Likely [**2-14**] adrenal insufficiency and sedation. Goal map
   > 60.  Much improved since re-administration of steroids.
   -          hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone as above
   -          restart levophed if necessary to maintain MAP > 60
   # Volume overloaded in setting of hypernatremia with TBW deficit.
   - goal -1000cc I/Os today
   - continue FW in TF at 250 cc q4hrs
   - lasix drip (1-5mg/hr) when MAP >
   60
   # Sedation: Sedation control remains somewhat poor although fentanyl
   patch and diazpem are likely therapeutic range today. On Versed 1.5,
   Fentanyl 175, Fentanyl patch, Diazepam standing and haldo 2.5-5 mg
   PRN.  QTc increased to 480.
   -          Wean versed/fentanyl as tolerated, continue diazepam. Avoid
   haldol use if possible to avoid further prolongation of QTc
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**]. PTTs.  Would hold off on
   coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - hold heparin gtt when anticipate trach/peg
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.
   # FEN/GI:  Tube feeds with FWF @ goal.
   DVT: Treatment dose heparin
   Ulcer: Ranitidine
   VAP: Prevention per routine

- The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has been intubated since the end of September due to respiratory failure caused by ARDS and trachiomalacia. She also had a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and volume overload.
- The patient is now experiencing agitation and combativeness, with increasing tachycardia and hypertension. She is currently on midazolam, fentanyl, lasix, heparin, and other medications.
- The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and decreased oxygen saturation.
- The patient has a white blood cell count of 8.6 and a platelet count of 306. Her creatinine level is elevated at 0.7, but her glucose level is within normal range.
- The patient has been diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency and is receiving hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Her blood pressure has improved since the administration of steroids.
- The patient is also volume overloaded, with a target I/O output of 1000 cc today. She is receiving lasix and fluids will be restricted.
- The patient's sedation control remains poor, and she is currently on multiple sedatives. There is an increased QTc interval.

   - may have some contraction alkalosis, w/ rising pH and bicarb. Start
   Diamox 500mg TID to decrease bicarb and pH and may improve respiratory
   drive.
   # Sedation: Sedation control remains somewhat poor although fentanyl
   patch and diazpem are likely therapeutic range today. On Versed 2.0,
   Fentanyl 100, Fentanyl patch, Diazepam standing and haldo 2.5-5 mg
   PRN.  QTc increased to 480.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has been intubated since the end of September and has developed ARDS. She has multiple medical complications including adrenal insufficiency, hypotension, volume overload, respiratory failure, DVT, and potential GI issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, and volume overload. She is currently intubated and will undergo tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. There is a risk of further respiratory complications during and after the surgical procedure.

2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has minimal response to ACTH stimulation test, indicating adrenal insufficiency. She is currently on hydrocortisone therapy, which will be continued until she is hemodynamically stable for 24 hours post-trach and PEG. A slow taper of hydrocortisone will be planned afterward.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to adrenal insufficiency and sedation. Hydrocortisone therapy will be continued, and levophed may be restarted to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.

4. Volume Overload: The patient is volume overloaded in the setting of hypernatremia with TBW deficit. The goal is"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with K. oxytoca PNA and
   ARDS intubated since the end of [**Month (only) **].
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.
   Transferred here for airway stenting.
   - attempt SBT yesterday. Failed.
   -To OR today [**10-2**], add-on for trach and PEG with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 853**] (tube feeds
   off after MN, heparin off after 6am)
   - Repeat CXR in PM post trach.
   ## Adrenal Insufficency: Minimal response to [**Last Name (un) **] stim test again.
   Appreciate endocrine recommendations.
   -          hydrocort and fludrocort (day 1 = [**9-30**])
   -          will continue at current dose until s/p trach and PEG and
   hemodynamically stable for 24 hours
 will then plan to taper
   hydrocortisone to 25mg IV q6 with a slow taper
   -          f/u daily endocrine recs
   -          Endocrine recs: d/c Fludrocort. Continue Hydrocort for now.
   # Hypotension:  Likely [**2-14**] adrenal insufficiency and sedation. Goal map
   > 60.  Much improved since re-administration of steroids.
   -          hydrocortisone as above
   -          restart levophed if necessary to maintain MAP > 60
   # Volume overloaded in setting of hypernatremia with TBW deficit.
   - goal -1000cc I/Os yesterday, was -1500cc for last 24 hours.
   - continue FW in TF at 250 cc q4hrs
   - lasix drip (1-5mg/hr) held before surgery, will restart when returns
   to MICU.
   - may have some contraction alkalosis, w/ rising pH and bicarb. Start
   Diamox 500mg TID to decrease bicarb and pH and may improve respiratory
   drive.
   # Sedation: Sedation control remains somewhat poor although fentanyl
   patch and diazpem are likely therapeutic range today. On Versed 2.0,
   Fentanyl 100, Fentanyl patch, Diazepam standing and haldo 2.5-5 mg
   PRN.  QTc increased to 480.
   -  Wean versed/fentanyl as tolerated, continue diazepam. Avoid haldol
   use if possible to avoid further prolongation of QTc
   -  Will reassess sedation/agitation after PEG/Trach.
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**]. PTTs.  Would hold off on
   coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - hold heparin gtt when anticipate trach/peg
   - will restart heparin gtt per recs from surgery post-op
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.
   # FEN/GI:  Tube feeds with FWF @ goal.
   -held for surgery. Will restart based on post-op recs after PEG
   placement.
   DVT: Treatment dose heparin, holding until post-op recs from PEG/Trach
   Ulcer: Ranitidine
   VAP: Prevention per routine
   # Access: L PICC line, and R brachial a-line
   # Communication:
   -          Boyfriend of 10 [**Name2 (NI) 579**] is her HCP.  Also brother is involved
    -         touch base with SW today

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse presenting after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has been intubated since the end of September due to respiratory failure related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP, and volume overload. She is currently in the ICU for airway stenting.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of ARDS and previous episodes of respiratory failure indicate an increased risk for recurrent respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.

2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has minimal response to ACTH stimulation test, indicating possible adrenal insufficiency. Appropriate management with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone is necessary to prevent further complications.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to adrenal insufficiency and sedation. It is crucial to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Hydrocortisone administration and levophed infusion may be required to achieve this goal.

4. Volume overload: The patient is volume overloaded, as indicated by hypernatremia and TBW deficit. Careful monitoring of fluid balance and appropriate diuresis with lasix are essential to avoid further fluid accumulation.

5. Sedation control: Sedation control remains challenging in this patient. Close monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with K. oxytoca PNA and
   ARDS intubated since the end of [**Month (only) **].
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.  Stenting
   unlikely to help for trachiomalacia as airways have poor structure
   diffusely.  S/P Trach yesterday
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Hypotension that resolved with steroids,
   returned as they came off and is now improved again.  Possible primary
   adrenal insufficency.  Appreciate endocrine recommendations.
   -          hydrocortt (day 1 = [**9-30**]), wean per endo recs
   # Hypotension:  Likely [**2-14**] adrenal insufficiency and sedation. Goal map
   > 60.  Much improved since re-administration of steroids.
   -          hydrocortisone as above
   -          restart levophed if necessary to maintain MAP > 60
   # Volume overloaded in setting of hypernatremia with TBW deficit.
   - Lasix gtt, continue with goal -1L per day.
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - may have some contraction alkalosis, w/ rising pH and bicarb. Start
   Diamox 500mg TID to decrease bicarb and pH and may improve respiratory
   drive.
   # Sedation: Sedation control remains somewhat poor although fentanyl
   patch and diazpem are likely therapeutic range today. On Versed 2.0,
   Fentanyl 100, Fentanyl patch, Diazepam standing and haldo 2.5-5 mg
   PRN.  QTc increased to 480.
   -  Wean versed/fentanyl as tolerated, continue diazepam. Avoid haldol
   use if possible to avoid further prolongation of QTc
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**]. PTTs.  Would hold off on
   coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - heparin gtt  restarted
   - plan to start coumadin night of [**10-4**] if stable
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.
   # FEN/GI:  Tube feeds
   DVT: Treatment dose heparin
   Ulcer: Ranitidine
   VAP: Prevention per routine
   # Access: L PICC line, and R brachial a-line
   # Communication:
   -          Boyfriend of 10 [**Name2 (NI) 579**] is her HCP.  Also brother is involved

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has been intubated since the end of [Month]. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure due to ARDS and trachiomalacia, adrenal insufficiency, hypotension, volume overload, and a potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right upper extremity.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS and trachiomalacia, which has resulted in respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient experienced hypotension that resolved with steroids and then returned again. This suggests possible primary adrenal insufficiency. She is currently being treated with hydrocortisone.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to adrenal insufficiency and sedation. Her blood pressure goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60.
4. Volume Overload: The patient is volume overloaded, as indicated by hypernatremia and a total body water (TBW) deficit. She is being treated with furosemide (Lasix) to promote diuresis and reduce fluid overload.
5. Potential DVT: The patient has a potential DVT in the right upper extremity. She is currently receiving treatment with he"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with K. oxytoca PNA and
   ARDS intubated since the end of [**Month (only) **].
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.  Stenting
   unlikely to help for trachiomalacia as airways have poor structure
   diffusely.  S/P Trach yesterday
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Hypotension that resolved with steroids,
   returned as they came off and is now improved again.  Possible primary
   adrenal insufficency.  Appreciate endocrine recommendations.
   -          hydrocortt (day 1 = [**9-30**]), wean per endo recs
   # Hypotension:  Likely [**2-14**] adrenal insufficiency and sedation. Goal map
   > 60.  Much improved since re-administration of steroids.
   -          hydrocortisone as above
   -          restart levophed if necessary to maintain MAP > 60
   # Volume overloaded in setting of hypernatremia with TBW deficit.
   - Lasix gtt, continue with goal -1L per day.
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - may have some contraction alkalosis, w/ rising pH and bicarb. Start
   Diamox 500mg TID to decrease bicarb and pH and may improve respiratory
   drive.
   # Sedation: Sedation control remains somewhat poor although fentanyl
   patch and diazpem are likely therapeutic range today. On Versed 2.0,
   Fentanyl 100, Fentanyl patch, Diazepam standing and haldo 2.5-5 mg
   PRN.  QTc increased to 480.
   -  Wean versed/fentanyl as tolerated, continue diazepam. Avoid haldol
   use if possible to avoid further prolongation of QTc
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**]. PTTs.  Would hold off on
   coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - heparin gtt  restarted
   - plan to start coumadin night of [**10-4**] if stable
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

   DVT: Treatment dose heparin
   Ulcer: Ranitidine

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse presenting with mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She also has K. oxytoca pneumonia (PNA) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for which she was intubated. The patient has several medical complications and conditions:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS and is currently intubated due to respiratory failure. There is also a mention of trachiomalacia, which has been resolved, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient experienced hypotension that improved with steroids administration, suggesting possible primary adrenal insufficiency.

3. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension that improved with the re-administration of steroids, indicating a possible contribution of adrenal insufficiency.

4. Volume overload: The patient is volume overloaded with hypernatremia and total body water (TBW) deficit.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a right upper extremity (RUE) DVT for which she is being treated with heparin.

6. Sedation: The patient's sedation control remains poor despite using various medications, including fentanyl patch, diazepam, versed, and haloperidol.

7. Spine fracture: The patient has a traumatic T spine fracture but remains neurologically intact distal to the lesion"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse who presented following a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has been intubated since the end of [Month] now s/p trach and PEG placement. 

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure due to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP, and volume overload. She is also being treated for adrenal insufficiency, which presented as hypotension that resolved with steroids. 

The patient has been diagnosed with volume overload in the setting of hypernatremia with TBW deficit. She is on a lasix drip and is being closely monitored for electrolyte imbalances. 

Additionally, the patient has poor sedation control, and her QTc has increased to 480. She is on multiple medications including versed, fentanyl patch, diazepam, and haldol, which may contribute to the QTc prolongation. 

The patient also has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is being treated with heparin gtt. 

Other issues include constipation, for which she is being given dulcolax PO/PR, and a spine fracture with neurological integrity preserved distal to the lesion. 

The patient is currently on tube feeds with free water flushes, and her glycemic control is well managed. She has two lines, a PICC line and an arterial line"

","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse who presented following a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She also has Klebsiella oxytoca pneumonia and ARDS, for which she was intubated. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. 

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure due to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and volume overload. She is currently intubated and it is unlikely that stenting will help with trachiomalacia as the airways have poor structure diffusely. 

The patient also has suspected adrenal insufficiency, which presented as hypotension that resolved with steroids but returned when they were weaned off. It is possible that she has primary adrenal insufficiency. The dose of hydrocortisone was halved today, and further endocrine recommendations are appreciated.

The patient is volume overloaded, especially with hypernatremia and a total body water (TBW) deficit. She is on a lasix drip and continues with the goal of losing 1-2 liters per day. Hospital electrolytes are recommended, and she should continue with tube feeds with free water flushes every four hours.

Regarding sedation, the patient's sedation control remains somewhat poor. Although the fentanyl patch and diazepam are likely in the therapeutic range today, she is on Vers"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse who presented after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has been intubated since the end of [Month] and underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement on [10-2]. The patient has respiratory failure related to ARDS and trachiomalacia, as well as volume overload. She also has suspected adrenal insufficiency, which is currently being managed with hydrocortisone. The patient is volume overloaded with hypernatremia and TBW deficit. Sedation control remains poor, and the patient is currently on multiple sedatives. She has a history of RUE DVT and is on heparin gtt. The patient is also experiencing constipation and will be evaluated for spine fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is related to ARDS and trachiomalacia. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to ongoing volume overload.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension resolved with steroids but returned when they were tapered off. There is a possibility of primary adrenal insufficiency, and further endocrine recommendations are needed.
3. Volume overload: The patient is currently volume overloaded with hypernatremia and TBW deficit. There is a risk of worsening fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and cardiac complications.
4. Poor sedation control: The patient"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current condition in the ICU, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. Additionally, the presence of an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Regular monitoring of vital signs and respiratory parameters is essential.

2. Fluid imbalance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids (total in: 4,228 mL) but has also lost a considerable amount of fluids (total out: 6,725 mL). Close monitoring of fluid balance is necessary to prevent fluid overload or dehydration.

3. Thrombosis: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy with heparin sodium. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters such as PT/INR is essential to ensure the appropriate anticoagulation effect without increasing the risk of bleeding.

4. Nutritional status: The patient is receiving nutrition support, but further evaluation may be required to optimize their nutritional intake considering their obesity status and current health condition.

5. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating, indicating a need for close monitoring and appropriate management of their glycemic control.

6. Cardiovascular status: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which may require further investigation and management to maintain adequate perfusion and prevent"

   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with K. oxytoca PNA and
   ARDS intubated since the end of [**Month (only) **] now s/p trach and PEG placement.
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.  Stenting
   unlikely to help for trachiomalacia as airways have poor structure
   diffusely.  S/P Trach and PEG on [**10-2**]. Increased effusion on recent
   CXR.
   -          wean FiO2 as tolerated
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Hypotension that resolved with steroids,
   returned as they came off and is now improved again.  Possible primary
   adrenal insufficency.  Appreciate endocrine recommendations. Hydrocort
   started on [**9-30**].

   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - continue tube feeds with free water flushes 300 cc q4
   # Sedation: Sedation control remains somewhat poor although fentanyl
   patch and diazpem are likely therapeutic range today. On Versed 2.0,
   Fentanyl 100, Fentanyl patch, Diazepam standing and haldo 2.5-5 mg
   PRN.  QTc increased to 480.
   -          Wean versed/fentanyl as tolerated, continue diazepam in
   hopes for vent facility placement
   -          Change diazepam to 5mg q8 with haldol 5 mg q8
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**]. PTTs.  Would hold off on
   coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - heparin gtt  restarted
   - coumadin 5mg G-tube today, INR in am
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse who presented after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has been intubated since the end of [Month] and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on [10-2]. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure due to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP, and volume overload. She also has adrenal insufficiency, hypotension that resolved with steroids, and a possible primary adrenal insufficiency. The patient is volume overloaded with hypernatremia and TBW deficit. She requires sedation control due to poor sedation control despite fentanyl patch and diazepam. There is also a concern for right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's spine fracture is neurologically intact, and no surgical procedure is needed according to prior notes from neurosurgeons. Nutrition and glycemic control are being managed appropriately. The patient's lines include a left PICC line and right arterial line. Prophylactic measures include heparin drip, ranitidine, VAP prevention, colace, and senna. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU with screening for vent facilities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is related to ARDS, trachiomalacia,"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with K. oxytoca PNA and
   ARDS intubated since the end of [**Month (only) **] now s/p trach and PEG placement.
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.  Stenting
   unlikely to help for trachiomalacia as airways have poor structure
   diffusely.  S/P Trach and PEG on [**10-2**]. Increased effusion on recent
   CXR.
   -          wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -          non-con head CT to further characterize pulmonary effusions,
   det potential for thoracentesis
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Hypotension that resolved with steroids,
   returned as they came off and is now improved again.  Possible primary
   adrenal insufficency.  Appreciate endocrine recommendations. Hydrocort
   started on [**9-30**].
   -          wean per endo recs, decrease to q8 today, likely q12 dosing
   tomorrow
   # Volume overloaded in setting of hypernatremia with TBW deficit.
   - Lasix gtt, continue with goal -1-2 L per day.
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - continue tube feeds with free water flushes increase from 250 to 300
   cc q4
   # Sedation: Sedation control remains somewhat poor although fentanyl
   patch and diazpem are likely therapeutic range today. On Versed 2.0,
   Fentanyl 100, Fentanyl patch, Diazepam standing and haldo 2.5-5 mg
   PRN.  QTc increased to 480.
   -          Wean versed/fentanyl as tolerated, continue diazepam in
   hopes for vent facility placement
   -          Increase diazepam to 12mg q4
   -          Check ekg for QTc
 if <480, restart haldol and/or increase
   fentanyl patch
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**]. PTTs.  Would hold off on
   coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - heparin gtt  restarted
   - coumadin 5mg G-tube today
 hold coumadin today for possible [**Female First Name (un) **]
   # Constipation
 current regimen of colace and senna, stooled during
   rounds
   -          dulcolax PO/PR
   -          reassess and increase bowel regimen PRN
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, who presented with a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She also has Klebsiella oxytoca pneumonia (PNA) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), resulting in intubation. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and volume overload. She is also suspected to have adrenal insufficiency, hypotension that resolved with steroids, and is now improved. The patient is volume overloaded in the setting of hypernatremia with a total body water (TBW) deficit. Her sedation control remains poor, and she requires ongoing management. Additionally, she has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is on heparin therapy. The patient's spine fracture is neurologically intact distally, and an MRI of the cervical and lumbar spine is recommended. The patient's nutritional status is being managed with tube feeds and free water flushes, and her glycemic control is well-managed. The patient has multiple lines in place, including a left peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line and a right arterial line. Prophylactic treatments include heparin, ranitidine, VAP prevention, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse who presented after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She was intubated due to respiratory failure caused by ARDS and trachiomalacia. The patient also has a PNA caused by K. oxytoca. She underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement on [**10-2**]. The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, adrenal insufficiency, volume overload, poor sedation control, RUE DVT, spine fracture, and a thyroid nodule. The patient is currently being treated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory failure due to ARDS and trachiomalacia. Weaning off FiO2 and attempting tracheostomy mask trials should be considered.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient may have primary adrenal insufficiency, as evidenced by hypotension that resolved with steroids. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's steroid dosage.
3. Volume Overload: The patient is volume overloaded, which is indicated by hypernatremia with TBW deficit and metabolic alkalosis. Diuretics like Lasix and diamox should be used to address this issue.
4. Poor Sedation Control: The patient has poor sedation control despite being on multiple sedatives. Adjusting the dosages of sedatives and considering alternative options should be considered"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented after a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She was intubated due to respiratory failure caused by ARDS and had a tracheostomy and PEG placement. The patient also has a thyroid nodule on CT and is suspected to have adrenal insufficiency, for which she is receiving hydrocortisone. She is currently experiencing volume overload, and her sodium levels are high. She has a trachiomalacia and is being weaned off sedation. She also has a DVT in her right upper extremity and is on heparin therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and trachiomalacia pose ongoing risks for respiratory failure. Weaning off FiO2 and ensuring proper ventilation is crucial.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension responded to steroids, suggesting possible primary adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring cortisol levels and adjusting hydrocortisone dosage accordingly is important.
3. Volume overload: The patient is currently volume overloaded, which needs to be managed with diuretics such as Lasix. Close monitoring of fluid balance is necessary.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to the volume overload. Managing her fluid intake and output carefully is essential.
5. Sedation control: The patient's sedation control remains poor,"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with K. oxytoca PNA and
   ARDS intubated since the end of [**Month (only) **] now s/p trach and PEG placement.
   Thyroid nodule on CT
   Watch phos product
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.  Stenting
   unlikely to help for trachiomalacia as airways have poor structure
   diffusely.  S/P Trach and PEG on [**10-2**]. Increased effusion on recent
   CXR.
   -          wean FiO2 as tolerated
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Hypotension that resolved with steroids,
   returned as they came off and is now improved again.  Possible primary
   adrenal insufficency.  Appreciate endocrine recommendations. Hydrocort
   started on [**9-30**].

   patient is somewhat hypotensive
 will restart once/if BP increases and
   remains stable for several hours
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - continue tube feeds with free water flushes 300 cc q4
   # Sedation: Sedation control remains somewhat poor although fentanyl
   patch and diazpem are likely therapeutic range today. On Versed 2.0,
   Fentanyl 100, Fentanyl patch, Diazepam standing and haldo 2.5-5 mg
   PRN.  QTc increased to 480.
   -          Wean versed/fentanyl as tolerated, continue diazepam in
   hopes for vent facility placement
   -          Change diazepam to 5mg q8 with haldol 5 mg q8
   # RUE DVT: Started on heparin gtt on [**9-22**]. PTTs.  Would hold off on
   coumadin at least until s/p trach.
   - heparin gtt  restarted
   - coumadin 5mg G-tube today, INR in am
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - CT of C, L spine when stable.  Currently, unlikely to change
   management and high risk for complications with transport.
   - Spine recommends MRI C/T/L/S if possible but likelihood for surgery
   is low.  Brace for OOB.  Ok for anticoag per note.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU following a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has been intubated since the end of [Month], underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and has been diagnosed with ARDS.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to ARDS and trachiomalacia. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the airways remain poorly structured.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has shown signs of hypotension that resolved with steroids and may indicate primary adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation and management are needed.
3. Volume overload: The patient is volume overloaded with hypernatremia and a TBW deficit. Careful monitoring and management of fluid balance is required.
4. Sedation control: The patient's sedation control remains poor despite medication adjustments, which may impact her ability to wean off ventilatory support.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a DVT in the right upper extremity (RUE), and anticoagulation therapy is necessary to prevent further clot formation.
6. Spine fracture: The patient has a traumatic T-spine fracture with neurological intactness distal to the lesion. Further imaging and evaluation are recommended to"

   # Sedation: Continue to have issues with pain/delirium causing
   tachycardia and hypertension with intermittent hypotension.  On Haldol
   5 TID, Fentanyl 100-150 mcg TP, Diazapam 10 QID; Haldol, midazolam and
   morphine PRN.  Had good response to morphine, minimal response to
   haldol bolus.
   -          Will d/c midazolam and haldol PRN and use morphine for now.
   -          If stable, would d/c standing Haldol tonight or tomorrow
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Hypotension that resolved with steroids,
   returned as they came off and is now improved again.  Possible primary
   adrenal insufficency.  Appreciate endocrine recommendations. Hydrocort

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse, who presented with a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has been diagnosed with ARDS and is intubated since the end of September. She underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement. 

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure due to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP, and volume overload. She is also experiencing issues with pain/delirium causing tachycardia and hypertension with intermittent hypotension. She has been on various sedatives and analgesics to manage these symptoms.

The patient is suspected to have adrenal insufficiency, as she had hypotension that resolved with steroids. Her electrolytes show hypernatremia with TBW deficit and metabolic alkalosis. She is volume overloaded and needs to be managed accordingly.

The patient has a history of RUE DVT and is currently on coumadin. She also has a spine fracture with neurological integrity preserved below the lesion. No surgical procedure is planned for the spine fracture, and she will be managed with a spine brace.

Additionally, the patient has a tracheomalacia and a thyroid nodule on CT. She is being managed with tube feeds and free water flushes, and her glycemic control is well maintained.

The patient's arterial line was stopped and restarted multiple times. Her PICC line was placed on September 27th. She is on prophylaxis for"

   -          wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -          attempt wean PS today and hopeful for trach mask trial
   # Sedation: Sedation control remains somewhat poor although fentanyl
   patch and diazpem are likely therapeutic range today. On Versed 2.0,
   Fentanyl 100, Fentanyl patch, Diazepam standing and haldo 2.5-5 mg
   PRN.  QTc increased to 480.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, who presented with a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has been intubated since the end of [month] and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. She has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, sedation control issues, adrenal insufficiency, volume overload, right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), spine fracture, tracheomalacia, thyroid nodule, and nutritional concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS and tracheomalacia may continue to cause respiratory difficulties, potentially leading to further respiratory failure.

2. Sedation Control: Poor sedation control could result in agitation or difficulty weaning off sedatives, leading to prolonged sedation and potential complications.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hypotension that resolved with steroids indicates possible primary adrenal insufficiency. If not managed appropriately, this condition can lead to life-threatening complications.

4. Volume Overload: The patient's volume overload, indicated by hypernatremia and metabolic alkalosis, needs to be carefully managed to prevent complications such as congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema.

5. Right Upper Extremity DVT: The patient's D"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with an unknown chief complaint. The patient's arterial line was discontinued and they spiked a fever of 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit, prompting the sending of blood and urine cultures as well as a chest X-ray. The patient was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Aztreonam. The patient remained hypotensive, with blood pressures in the 70s, and had low urine output and poor oxygen saturation levels. Levophed was started to improve blood pressure, and the patient received 1.75 liters of normal saline, which resulted in improved blood pressures and increased urine output. The patient has a large amount of oral secretions, possibly originating from the stomach, and tube feeds have been held due to suspected aspiration. The patient has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. The last doses of antibiotics were administered at 11:00 PM, 11:43 PM, and 4:07 AM, respectively. The patient is currently receiving norepinephrine at a rate of 0.03 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include midazolam, morphine sulfate, and furosemide. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. Flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented following a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has been intubated since the end of last month and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS, trachiomalacia, and resolved ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She also has issues with sedation, pain, and delirium, causing tachycardia and hypertension with intermittent hypotension. The patient is on multiple medications for sedation, including Haldol, Fentanyl, and Diazepam. 

The patient has been diagnosed with possible primary adrenal insufficiency, as evidenced by hypotension that resolved with steroids. She has been started on hydrocortisone and will be weaned to maintenance dose as tolerated in consultation with an endocrinologist. 

The patient is volume overloaded, with hypernatremia and metabolic alkalosis. Lasix boluses will be given to address the volume overload, and Diamox will be used until the bicarbonate level is less than 30. 

The patient has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is now therapeutic on coumadin. The goal INR is 2-15, and the heparin gtt will be stopped.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with a traumatic T-spine fracture, K. oxytoca pneumonia (PNA), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been intubated since the end of the month, underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is currently experiencing fever, hypotension, poor oxygen saturation, and large oral secretions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient's fever and large oral secretions may suggest aspiration pneumonitis, which can lead to lung inflammation and infection.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP, a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are on mechanical ventilation.
3. Delirium: The patient's sedation issues with intermittent hypotension, tachycardia, and hypertension may indicate delirium, which is common in critically ill patients.
4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hypotension that resolved with steroids suggests possible primary adrenal insufficiency. This condition requires further evaluation and management.
5. Volume Overload: The patient has hypernatremia with TBW deficit and metabolic alkalosis, indicating volume overload. Care should be taken to manage fluid balance and electrolytes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse presenting with mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture, K. oxytoca pneumonia, and ARDS. She has been intubated since the end of [Month] and has undergone tracheostomy and PEG placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further respiratory complications.

2. Fever: The patient has been experiencing fevers, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis. Antibiotics have been initiated while waiting for sputum culture results.

3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has shown signs of hypotension that resolved with steroids, suggesting possible primary adrenal insufficiency. Hydrocortisone has been started, and consultation with endocrinology is recommended.

4. Volume overload: The patient is volume overloaded, as indicated by hypernatremia and metabolic alkalosis. Fluid management should be carefully monitored.

5. Falling Hct: The patient's hematocrit levels are decreasing, which may be due to dilutional effects. This should be monitored, and further evaluation may be required.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with K. oxytoca PNA, and
   ARDS, intubated since the end of [**Month (only) **] now s/p trach and PEG
   placement.
   # Recent Aspiration of tube feeds.  Given prolonged hospitalization and
   tenuous respiratory status will treat with antibiotics while cultures
   pending
   - Levoflox for 48 hours while waiting for sputum results.
   - restart tube feeds slowly
   - Follow cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.  S/P Trach
   and PEG on [**10-2**].
   -          wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -          attempt wean PS today and hopeful for trach mask trial
   # Sedation: Continue to have issues with pain/delirium causing
   tachycardia and hypertension with intermittent hypotension.  On Haldol
   5 TID, Fentanyl 75 mcg TP, Diazapam 10 QID; Haldol, midazolam and
   morphine PRN.  Had good response to morphine, minimal response to
   haldol bolus.
   -          Reduce diazepam to 5 q 8hrs.
   -          d/c standing Haldol
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Hypotension that resolved with steroids,
   returned as they came off and is now improved again.  Possible primary
   adrenal insufficency.  Appreciate endocrine recommendations. Hydrocort
   started on [**9-30**].
   -          10 q am and 5 q pm prednisone day 2 of 3, will wean to
   maintenance dose as tolerated, in consultation with endo.
   # Volume overloaded in setting of hypernatremia
 Goal even today.
   - Off diamox
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - Free water flushes with tube feeds.
   # Falling Hct:  Likely dilutional.  Concern given elevated INR. Stable
   today.
   -          monitor
   -          maintain active type and screen
   # RUE DVT: INR now therapeutic on coumadin.  Goal [**2-15**]
   - will start coumadin 2.5 mg QHS once INR < 3
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - Brace for OOB
   - report from full trauma series from OSH is in chart.  No evidence of
   other fracture and no need for further spinal imaging based on this
   report and ortho note.
   # Tracheomalacia: Discussed with IP.  Stenting unlikely to help for
   trachiomalacia as airways have poor structure diffusely.
   - Outpatient f/u once off pressure support to assess for possible
   stenting

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who presented following a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has been intubated since the end of last month and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. 

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure due to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP, and volume overload. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned off FiO2 and PSV.
2. Recent aspiration of tube feeds, for which antibiotics have been started while awaiting sputum culture results.
3. Adrenal insufficiency, suggested by hypotension that responded to steroids. Hydrocortisone has been started, and the plan is to wean to maintenance dose as tolerated.
4. Hypernatremia and volume overload, with ongoing efforts to achieve fluid balance.
5. Falling hemoglobin concentration (Hct), likely due to dilutional effects.
6. Right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), for which warfarin has been initiated with a goal INR of 2-15.
7. Spine fracture, with neurological integrity preserved below the level of the lesion. No surgical intervention is planned, and a spine brace has been recommended.
8. Tracheomalacia, which is unlikely to benefit from airway stenting.
9. Thyroid nodule seen on CT, requiring outpatient follow-up.
10. Malnutrition, for which tube feeds will be reintroduced slowly.
11. Glycemic control, well-managed.
12. Lines (PICC line placed on 9/27).
13. Prophylactic medications (ranitidine, colace, senna, MiraLax, bisacodyl).

Overall, the patient's condition remains complex, with ongoing management of respiratory failure, infection, fluid balance, adrenal insufficiency, and other comorbidities. Potential medical complications include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pressure ulcers, and nosocomial infections. Close monitoring and individualized care are essential for this patient's recovery."

","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse presenting with mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture, K. oxytoca PNA, and ARDS. She has been intubated since the end of [Month (only)] and underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP, and volume overload. There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of K. oxytoca PNA and is currently on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy accordingly is important.

2. Tracheomalacia: The patient has tracheomalacia, which may require intervention. Stenting is unlikely to help in this case as the airways have poor structure diffusely. Outpatient follow-up is planned to assess for possible stenting.

3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has hypotension that resolved with steroids, indicating a possible primary adrenal insufficiency. Endocrine recommendations should be followed, and hydrocortisone has been started.

4. Volume overload: The patient is volume overloaded, as indicated by hypernatremia and fluid balance data. Goal is to manage fluid balance carefully and address any underlying causes of fluid retention.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse, presenting with a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has been intubated since the end of [Month] and underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement. The patient recently aspirated tube feeds and was given antibiotics while awaiting culture results. She is also being treated for respiratory failure related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP, and volume overload. The patient has ongoing issues with pain and delirium, for which she is being sedated. She also has a possible diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and is being treated with steroids. The patient is volume overloaded and has hypernatremia. Her hematocrit levels are falling, which may be due to dilutional causes. She has a past medical history of RUE DVT and a spine fracture, both of which are being managed conservatively. The patient also has tracheomalacia and a thyroid nodule that will require outpatient follow-up. Her nutritional status is replete, and she will gradually reintroduce tube feeds. The patient's glycemic control is well-managed. She has multiple lines in place and is on various prophylactic medications. The patient's disposition is ICU, being screened for vent facilities. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been exposed to multiple organisms due to her prolonged hospitalization and respiratory status. There is a risk of developing further"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of EtOH abuse, presenting after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She also has K. oxytoca pneumonia and ARDS, and has been intubated since the end of September. She recently underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement.
- The patient recently aspirated tube feeds and was given antibiotics while waiting for culture results. Levofloxacin was started for 48 hours, and tube feeds were held.
- The patient continues to struggle with respiratory failure due to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP, and volume overload. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place.
- The patient's sedation regimen includes Haldol, Fentanyl, and Diazepam. Morphine is given PRN.
- There is a concern for possible primary adrenal insufficiency, as hypotension resolved with steroids and then returned when they were stopped. Hydrocortisone was started on 9/30, and steroids were eventually stopped per endocrine recommendation.
- The patient is volume overloaded, with hypernatremia, and is being closely monitored for urine output.
- The patient has a history of RUE DVT and is on Coumadin. However, the INR continues to rise, likely due to nutritional and antibiotic factors. Coumadin dosage will be adjusted once the INR is below 3.
- The patient has"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse who is currently admitted to the ICU for mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. The patient also has known Klebsiella oxytoca pneumonia (PNA) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation since the end of September. She has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient's recent events include aspiration of tube feeds, which resulted in a fever spike to 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit. She was given Tylenol and antibiotics while awaiting culture results. The patient is being treated with Levofloxacin for 48 hours while waiting for sputum results. Tube feeds are being restarted slowly, and cultures are being followed.

The patient's respiratory status is still tenuous, and she continues to experience respiratory failure related to ARDS, tracheomalacia, and resolved ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has volume overload and is intubated since September 12th. The goal is to wean FiO2 as tolerated, attempt weaning PS today, and hopeful for tracheostomy mask trial.

Regarding sedation, the patient has issues with pain and delirium causing tachycardia and hypertension with intermittent hypotension. She is on Haloperidol 5 times a day, Fentanyl 75 mcg per dose, and Diazepam"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old woman with history of EtOH abuse presenting following
   mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture with K. oxytoca PNA, and
   ARDS, intubated since the end of [**Month (only) **] now s/p trach and PEG
   placement.
   # Recent Aspiration of tube feeds.  Given prolonged hospitalization and
   tenuous respiratory status will treat with antibiotics while cultures
   pending
   - Levoflox for 48 hours while waiting for sputum results.
   - hold tube feeds
   - Follow cultures
   - check tube placement
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.  S/P Trach
   and PEG on [**10-2**].
   -          wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -          attempt wean PS today and hopeful for trach mask trial
   # Sedation: Continue to have issues with pain/delirium causing
   tachycardia and hypertension with intermittent hypotension.  On Haldol
   5 TID, Fentanyl 75 mcg TP, Diazapam 10 QID; Haldol, midazolam and
   morphine PRN.  Had good response to morphine, minimal response to
   haldol bolus.
   - tolerating current regimen well, no changes today
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Hypotension that resolved with steroids,
   returned as they came off and is now improved again.  Possible primary
   adrenal insufficency.  Appreciate endocrine recommendations. Hydrocort
   started on [**9-30**].
   -          stopped steroids as per endocrine today
   # Volume overloaded in setting of hypernatremia
 Goal even today.
   - monitor urine output
   # RUE DVT: INR super-therapeutic on coumadin.  Goal [**2-15**]. Hasn
   received coumadin in days yet INR continues to rise. Likely
   contributors are nutritional and antibiotics.
   - will start coumadin 2.5 mg QHS once INR < 3
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - Brace for OOB
   - report from full trauma series from OSH is in chart.  No evidence of
   other fracture and no need for further spinal imaging based on this
   report and ortho note.
   # Tracheomalacia: Discussed with IP.  Stenting unlikely to help for
   trachiomalacia as airways have poor structure diffusely.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with traumatic T spine fracture, K. oxytoca pneumonia, and ARDS. She has been intubated since the end of [Month] and has undergone tracheostomy and PEG placement. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure related to ARDS, tracheomalacia, resolved VAP, and volume overload. She is also experiencing issues with pain/delirium causing tachycardia and hypertension with intermittent hypotension. The patient is being treated with antibiotics while cultures are pending and is receiving sedation with Haldol, Fentanyl, and Diazepam. There are concerns about possible primary adrenal insufficiency, volume overload, and a DVT. The patient's INR is super-therapeutic on Coumadin, and there are plans to start Coumadin 2.5 mg QHS once INR < 3. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and there is a risk of further respiratory failure due to ARDS, tracheomalacia, and volume overload.
2. Infection: The patient has K. oxytoca pneumonia and is currently on antibiotics while cultures are pending. There is a risk of developing other infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can lead"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of a papular rash over the entire back, bilaterally, in multiple dermatomal distributions, along with opaque vesicles on an erythematous base. The rash is nonpainful but possibly pruritic. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa (sulfonamides). Antibiotics that have been discontinued include aztreonam, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (139 bpm) and low blood pressure (97/61 mmHg). The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 0 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR set at 0, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and RSBI of 245. The ABG results indicate a respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.30.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,362 mL since 12 AM, with outputs totaling 1,203 mL. The patient's weight has increased from 94.2 kg at admission to 106 kg currently.

The lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 240 K/u"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old alcoholic with a history of traumatic spine fracture, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) who continues to experience respiratory failure. The patient requires tracheostomy mask support for breathing and has been unable to sustain it for extended periods. A new pathogen, Klebsiella, has been identified in the sputum on day 4. The patient also has tachycardia, likely due to agitation, and is being treated with Valium. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently on Coumadin, but the INR is elevated due to the interaction with levofloxacin. The patient is also being evaluated for adrenal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure requires ongoing support with the tracheostomy mask. There is a risk of further complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may be attributed to agitation, but it needs to be monitored closely. If the tachycardia persists or worsens, it could indicate an underlying cardiac issue.

3. Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is currently being treated with Coumadin. However, the elevated INR due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old alcoholic who has undergone a traumatic spine fracture, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) with persistent respiratory failure. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask and requires assistance for breathing. A new pan Klebsiella infection in the sputum has been identified, and a speech consultation is needed for potential tracheostomy ventilation evaluation. Pulmonary rehabilitation is being held off until after the stent placement. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to agitation, and benzodiazepines may be increased to help manage this. The patient has an elevated INR on Coumadin and quinolone therapy, indicating a need for adjustment in anticoagulation. The patient also has a history of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Proper steroid stimulation was administered this morning, and the patient is now off steroids. ICU care includes repletion with fiber, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old alcoholic who has undergone a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for persistent respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes a traumatic spine fracture. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, for which they are on a tracheostomy mask with intermittent need for support. The patient also has a new pan Klebsiella infection in their sputum. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.9°C, heart rate 143 bpm, blood pressure 153/89 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. The patient's recent laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and a slightly low platelet count. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but there is a slight decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure is a significant concern. The presence of a new pan Klebsiella infection in the sputum suggests a potential worsening of the respiratory condition. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygenation and ventilation status is essential.

2. Hemodynamics: The patient's tachycardia may be due to agitation and the aggressive tapering of Valium. It may be necessary to increase the dosage of benzodiazepines to manage agitation and improve hemodynamic stability."

   55yoF with history of EtOH abuse presenting following mechanical fall
   and traumatic T spine fracture with K. oxytoca PNA, and ARDS, intubated
   since the end of [**Month (only) **] now s/p trach and PEG placement.
# Recent Aspiration on Tube Feeds. Cultures growing Klebsiella Oxytoca and Klebs
iella Pneumoniae. Pt received developed rash on Levofloxacin, switched to Ceftri
axone overnight. Will treat for potential HAP for 8 days.
   - Continue Ceftriaxone  day [**10-8**] #1.
   - Tube Feeds restarted with goal of 60/hr
   - Follow cultures
   - check tube placement
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.  S/P Trach
   and PEG on [**10-2**].
   -   Weaning FiO2 as tolerated
   -   Will attempt trach collar today
   # Sedation: Pt has pain/delirium causing tachycardia and hypertension
   with intermittent hypotension.  On Haldol 5 TID, Fentanyl 75 mcg TP,
   Diazapam 10 QID; Haldol, midazolam and morphine PRN.  Had good response
   to morphine, minimal response to haldol bolus.
   - tolerating current regimen well, no changes today
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Hypotension that resolved with steroids,
   returned as they came off and is now improved again.  Possible primary
   adrenal insufficency.  Appreciate endocrine recommendations. Hydrocort
   started on [**9-30**].
   -          stopped steroids as per endocrine today
   # Volume overloaded in prior setting of hypernatremia
 Goal even
   today.
   - monitor urine output
   # RUE DVT: INR was super-therapeutic on coumadin.  Goal [**2-15**]. Hasn
   received coumadin in days yet INR continues to rise. Likely
   contributors are nutritional and antibiotics.
   - will start coumadin 2.5 mg QHS once INR < 3
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - Brace for OOB
   - Report from full trauma series from OSH is in chart.
   - No evidence of other fracture and no need for further spinal imaging
   based on this report and ortho note.
   # Tracheomalacia: Discussed with IP.  Stenting unlikely to help for
   trachiomalacia as airways have poor structure diffusely.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse. She presented with a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She also has Klebsiella oxytoca pneumonia (K. oxytoca PNA) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for which she was intubated. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

Recent events include aspiration on tube feeds and development of a rash due to Levofloxacin, which was switched to Ceftriaxone. The patient is being treated for potential hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) for 8 days.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and volume overload. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy. The patient's sedation regimen includes Haloperidol, Diazepam, and Morphine, which seems to be well-tolerated.

There is a suspicion of adrenal insufficiency, as the patient experienced hypotension that improved with steroids but returned when they were stopped. It is suggested that primary adrenal insufficiency might be the cause. The patient has been started on Hydrocortisone.

The patient has been monitored for volume overload, and efforts are being"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple medical conditions and allergies. He developed a papular rash over his entire back, with opaque vesicles on an erythematous base that are non-painful but possibly pruritic. The patient has a known allergy to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa (sulfonamides).

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were aztreonam on 10/10/2167 at 03:42 AM, vancomycin on 10/10/2167 at 09:40 AM, levofloxacin on 10/10/2167 at 11:15 PM, and ceftriaxone on 10/11/2167 at 07:50 PM.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of haloperidol (Haldol) on 10/12/2167 at 10:26 AM, diazepam (Valium) on 10/12/2167 at 11:33 AM, and morphine sulfate on 10/12/2167 at 02:30 PM.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dry mouth and no chest pain, tachypnea, abdominal pain, or nausea.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F) at maximum and 37.1 C (98.7 F) currently, heart rate of 129 bpm with a range of 113-148 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/40 mmHg to 171/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute with a range of 9-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's weight is currently 106 kg, and height is 67 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,362 mL and output of 1,203 mL since 12 AM.

Respiratory support includes delivery through a tracheostomy mask with standby ventilator mode, set tidal volume of 0 mL, spontaneous tidal volume ranging from 244-504 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 245, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 70%.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, pupils dilated, clear breath sounds, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and a thoracic brace on. The patient has a vesicular rash on the inferior back, which was not assessed by the nurse.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 240 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) of 7.9 g/dL, normal glucose level of 100 mg"

   Assessment and Plan
   55yoF with history of EtOH abuse presenting following mechanical fall
   and traumatic T spine fracture with K. oxytoca PNA, and ARDS, intubated
   since the end of [**Month (only) **] now s/p trach and PEG placement.
# Recent Aspiration on Tube Feeds. Cultures growing Klebsiella Oxytoca and Klebs
iella Pneumoniae. Pt received developed rash on Levofloxacin, switched to Ceftri
axone overnight. Will treat for potential HAP for 8 days.
   - Continue Ceftriaxone  day [**10-8**] #1.
   - Tube Feeds restarted with goal of 60/hr
   - Follow cultures
   - check tube placement
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.  S/P Trach
   and PEG on [**10-2**].
   -   Weaning FiO2 as tolerated
   -   Will attempt trach collar today
   # Tachycardia: Pt in ST for most of the day 120
s to 140s. Etiology
   remains unclear although she has been tachy since admission. Etiologies
   include pain (especially when sitting upright with thoracic brace on),
   infection (pt with known klebsiella, possibly acquired HAP). DDx also
   includes PE, hyperthyroidism.
   -          Will keep pt
s INR therapeutic
   -          TSH 2.4 on early [**Month (only) 779**], will check free T3, T4.
   -          Continue Pain Control
   -          Treat underlying infection
   # Sedation: Pt has pain/delirium causing tachycardia and hypertension
   with intermittent hypotension.  On Haldol 5 TID, Fentanyl 75 mcg TP,
   Diazapam 10 QID; Haldol, midazolam and morphine PRN.  Had good response
   to morphine, minimal response to haldol bolus.
   - tolerating current regimen well, no changes today
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Hypotension that resolved with steroids,
   returned as they came off and is now improved again.  Possible primary
   adrenal insufficency.  Appreciate endocrine recommendations. Hydrocort
   started on [**9-30**].
   -          stopped steroids as per endocrine today
   # Volume overloaded in prior setting of hypernatremia
 Goal even
   today.
   - Monitoring urine output
   # RUE DVT: INR was super-therapeutic on coumadin.  Goal [**2-15**]. Hasn
   received coumadin in days yet INR continues to rise. Likely
   contributors are nutritional and antibiotics.
   - will start coumadin 2.5 mg QHS once INR < 3
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - Brace for OOB
   - Report from full trauma series from OSH is in chart.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks
   # Tracheomalacia: Discussed with IP.  Stenting unlikely to help for
   trachiomalacia as airways have poor structure diffusely.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU with mechanical fall-related injuries, including a traumatic T-spine fracture, and was found to have Klebsiella oxytoca pneumonia and ARDS. She has undergone tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. The patient has developed a rash on her back, possibly due to an allergic reaction to levofloxacin, and has been switched to ceftriaxone. She is currently being treated for potential hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, ranging from 120 to 140 beats per minute. Possible etiologies include pain, infection, pulmonary embolism (PE), or hyperthyroidism. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated due to ARDS and trachiomalacia. Weaning off FiO2 and attempting tracheal collar placement will be attempted today.
3. Volume overload: The patient has been identified as having volume overload, which may be contributing to her hypotension.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient experienced hypotension that resolved with steroids, but returned when the steroids were stopped. This suggests possible primary adrenal insufficiency. Endocrine recommendations are being sought.
5. Right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse presenting after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has undergone tracheostomy (trach), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and placement of a tracheostomy tube. The patient is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused by Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, GNR, and GP Cocci. She has developed a rash due to levofloxacin and switched to ceftriaxone. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 at 50%, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, and RSBI of 56.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing prolonged respiratory failure, requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation support. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and tracheomalacia due to prolonged intubation.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently elevated, ranging from 120 to 150 beats per minute. The cause of tachycardia is unclear, but potential etiologies include hypovolemia, pain, and infection (known Klebsiella infection). Differential diagnosis also includes pulmonary embolism (PE).
3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient may be at risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old overweight/obese male with a history of allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 118 bpm and low blood pressure ranging from 90/37-48 mmHg. His respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 95%. The patient has a history of recent antibiotic use, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone. He is also receiving medications such as haloperidol, diazepam, and morphine sulfate.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, but the patient is noted to be overweight/obese. Pupils are dilated, and breath sounds are clear. The patient has a thoracic brace on and a vesicular rash on the inferior back. Neurologic examination is incomplete.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a peak of 240 K/uL and decreased hemoglobin level at 7.9 g/dL. Blood glucose levels have been stable within normal range. Other lab parameters, including kidney function and liver enzymes, are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there"

   Assessment and Plan
   55yoF with history of EtOH abuse presenting following mechanical fall
   and traumatic T spine fracture with K. oxytoca PNA, and ARDS, intubated
   since the end of [**Month (only) **] now s/p trach and PEG placement.
# Recent Aspiration on Tube Feeds. Cultures growing Klebsiella Oxytoca and Klebs
iella Pneumoniae. Pt received developed rash on Levofloxacin, switched to Ceftri
axone overnight. Will treat for potential HAP for 8 days.
   - Continue Ceftriaxone  day [**10-8**] #1.
   - Tube Feeds restarted with goal of 60/hr
   - Follow cultures
   - check tube placement
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Related to ARDS, trachiomalacia, resolved VAP,
   volume overload.  Intubated on [**9-12**] for resp decompensation.  S/P Trach
   and PEG on [**10-2**].
   -   Weaning FiO2 as tolerated
   -   Will attempt trach collar today
   # Tachycardia: Pt in ST for most of the day 120
s to 140s. Etiology
   remains unclear although she has been tachy since admission. Etiologies
   include pain (especially when sitting upright with thoracic brace on),
   infection (pt with known klebsiella, possibly acquired HAP). DDx also
   includes PE, hyperthyroidism.
   -          Will keep pt
s INR therapeutic
   -          TSH 2.4 on early [**Month (only) 779**], will check free T3, T4.
   -          Continue Pain Control
   -          Treat underlying infection
   # Sedation: Pt has pain/delirium causing tachycardia and hypertension
   with intermittent hypotension.  On Haldol 5 TID, Fentanyl 75 mcg TP,
   Diazapam 10 QID; Haldol, midazolam and morphine PRN.  Had good response
   to morphine, minimal response to haldol bolus.
   - tolerating current regimen well, no changes today
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Hypotension that resolved with steroids,
   returned as they came off and is now improved again.  Possible primary
   adrenal insufficency.  Appreciate endocrine recommendations. Hydrocort
   started on [**9-30**].
   -          stopped steroids as per endocrine today
   # Volume overloaded in prior setting of hypernatremia
 Goal even
   today.
   - Monitoring urine output
   # RUE DVT: INR was super-therapeutic on coumadin.  Goal [**2-15**]. Hasn
   received coumadin in days yet INR continues to rise. Likely
   contributors are nutritional and antibiotics.
   - will start coumadin 2.5 mg QHS once INR < 3
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.
   - Brace for OOB
   - Report from full trauma series from OSH is in chart.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks
   # Tracheomalacia: Discussed with IP.  Stenting unlikely to help for
   trachiomalacia as airways have poor structure diffusely.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. The patient also has Klebsiella pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for which she was intubated. She underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS and trachiomalacia. There was a previous episode of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) that has since resolved.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently in the 120-140 range, which is considered tachycardia. The cause of tachycardia is unclear but could be due to pain, infection, or other underlying conditions such as pulmonary embolism (PE), hyperthyroidism.

3. Sedation: The patient is on various sedatives including haloperidol, diazepam, and morphine for pain and delirium. However, the patient had a minimal response to a haloperidol bolus and showed a good response to morphine.

4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient experienced hypotension that resolved with steroids and returned again when the steroids were stopped. This suggests possible primary adrenal insufficiency. The patient"

   and PEG on [**10-2**].
   -   Weaning FiO2 as tolerated
   -   Will attempt trach collar today
   # Tachycardia: Pt in ST for most of the day 120
s to 140s. Etiology
   remains unclear although she has been tachy since admission. Etiologies
   include pain (especially when sitting upright with thoracic brace on),
   infection (pt with known klebsiella, possibly acquired HAP). DDx also
   includes PE, hyperthyroidism.
   -          Will keep pt
s INR therapeutic
   -          TSH 2.4 on early [**Month (only) 779**], will check free T3, T4.
   -          Continue Pain Control
   -          Treat underlying infection
   # Sedation: Pt has pain/delirium causing tachycardia and hypertension
   with intermittent hypotension.  On Haldol 5 TID, Fentanyl 75 mcg TP,
   Diazapam 10 QID; Haldol, midazolam and morphine PRN.  Had good response
   to morphine, minimal response to haldol bolus.
   - tolerating current regimen well, no changes today
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Hypotension that resolved with steroids,
   returned as they came off and is now improved again.  Possible primary
   adrenal insufficency.  Appreciate endocrine recommendations. Hydrocort
   started on [**9-30**].
   -          stopped steroids as per endocrine today
   # Volume overloaded in prior setting of hypernatremia

   today.
   - Monitoring urine output
   # RUE DVT: INR was super-therapeutic on coumadin.  Goal [**2-15**]. Hasn
   received coumadin in days yet INR continues to rise. Likely
   contributors are nutritional and antibiotics.
   - will start coumadin 2.5 mg QHS once INR < 3
   # Spine fracture: Neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Prior
   notes from MMC neurosurgeons indicated no surgical procedure needed and
   would continue with spine brace.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse, presenting with mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has Klebsiella oxytoca pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intubated since the end of last month, and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Recent aspiration on tube feeds, cultures positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae, and developed rash on Levofloxacin, switched to Ceftriaxone. Currently, she is being treated for potential hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) for 8 days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. The underlying cause of ARDS needs to be addressed.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has been tachycardic since admission, with a heart rate ranging from 120 to 150 beats per minute. Possible etiologies include pain, infection, pulmonary embolism (PE), or hyperthyroidism.
3. Infection: The patient has a known Klebsiella infection and may have acquired HAP. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is essential to prevent further complications.
4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient experienced hypotension that resolved with steroids, suggesting possible primary adrenal insufficiency. Endocrine recommendations should be sought.
5. Volume Overload: The patient is volume overloaded, which should be addressed to prevent complications like fluid accumulation and increased pressure on the heart.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a right lower extremity DVT. Anticoagulation therapy should be continued, and efforts should be made to prevent further clot formation.
7. Spine Fracture: The patient has a traumatic T spine fracture, but neurologically intact distal to the lesion. Conservative management with a spine brace is being pursued.
8. Tracheomalacia: The patient has tracheomalacia, which may require further evaluation for potential stenting options.
9. Thyroid Nodule: A thyroid nodule was noted on CT, but outpatient follow-up is planned.
10. Nutrition: The patient is currently receiving full nutrition support.
11. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels are well-controlled.

These potential medical complications require close monitoring and appropriate management to ensure the patient's well-being and prevent further deterioration."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU with a traumatic T spine fracture and mechanical fall. She underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient developed a rash on Levofloxacin and was switched to Ceftriaxone. She is currently on day #6 of an 8-day course of Ceftriaxone for HAP. The patient is also being weaned off the ventilator, with tolerance to PMV and FiO2. She is experiencing tachycardia with a heart rate ranging from 120 to 150 beats per minute, which may be due to hypovolemia, pain, or infection. Other issues include respiratory failure, sedation, adrenal insufficiency, fluid overload, right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), spine fracture, tracheomalacia, thyroid nodule, nutrition, glycemic control, and lines. The patient is set to undergo an MRI at a later date for evaluation of pituitary function. She is also scheduled for follow-up appointments with various specialists. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of right upper extrem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholism who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) after experiencing a traumatic spine fracture. Despite these interventions, the patient continues to require respiratory support, with occasional periods of being able to breathe on his own.

24-hour events include attempts at spontaneous breathing mode (PMV) being unsuccessful due to secretions, and the patient being placed on a tracheostomy mask for five hours. The patient has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were levofloxacin and ceftriaxone.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 135 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/37 mmHg to 202/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's weight has increased from 94.2 kg at admission to 106 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,451 mL and output of 834 mL.

The patient is currently receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy mask, with a standby ventilator mode. The tidal volume (Vt) is set at 354 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.2 C (100.8 F), heart rate in the mid 150's, blood pressure 125/55 mmHg, respiratory rate in the high 30's, and oxygen saturation 97%. The patient is receiving warfarin, Valium, and Tylenol. The patient has not shown any improvement despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is very high, indicating respiratory distress, which may progress to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating inadequate perfusion of vital organs, which can lead to organ damage if not corrected.
4. Thromboembolism: The patient's immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots, which can potentially lead to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU after a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She underwent tracheostomy, PEG placement, and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient continues to have fevers and new sputum production, but the respiratory status is good, making significant pneumonia unlikely. The patient's tachycardia persists, with heart rates in the mid-150s. The etiology of the tachycardia remains unclear, with possible causes including hypovolemia, pain, and infection. Other diagnoses to consider include pulmonary embolism (PE), mucus plugging, and spinal injury. The patient's INR is subtherapeutic, and she is restarting Coumadin. Her TSH level is low, and further evaluation for thyroid dysfunction is recommended. Pain control and assessment for PE with CTPA and UE ultrasound are also planned. The patient's sedation regimen is being weaned, and she may require stress dosed steroids if she undergoes major stressors such as surgery or sepsis. Fluid status is being monitored due to previous hypernatremia, and the patient has mild hypernatremia. She has a history of right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is restarting Coumadin. The spine fracture is stable, and a brace will be discussed with Neurosurgery"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old alcoholic who has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of traumatic spine fracture, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Despite being on a tracheostomy and PEG, the patient still requires support for breathing. The patient's recent sputum culture showed the presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient has been experiencing fevers, and potential causes include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), line infection, or another source of infection. The patient's heart rate is persistently elevated, and there are concerns about possible blood clots in the upper extremities. The patient's coagulation status needs to be closely monitored due to the use of Coumadin and quinolone antibiotics. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 137 bpm, blood pressure of 125/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure persists despite being on a tracheostomy and PEG. There is a need for ongoing respiratory support, and the presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum suggests a possible hospital-acquired infection.
2. Fevers:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old alcoholic with a history of traumatic spine fracture, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). They have persistent respiratory failure and are currently on a tracheostomy mask. The patient can do a few hours of spontaneous breathing per day but requires mechanical support at night. A new pan- Klebsiella infection in the sputum was identified on day 5-21. The patient is awaiting pulmonary rehabilitation before considering a stent placement. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 137 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 125/55 to 202/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight has increased from 94.2 kg at admission to 106 kg currently. 

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,934 mL (including 497 mL IV fluids) and an output of 530 mL (including 240 mL urine). The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 318 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 50%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, and slightly abnormal liver enzymes. Other lab values are within normal ranges."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old alcoholic who has undergone a traumatic spine fracture, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) with persistent respiratory failure. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask and can only breathe independently for a few hours per day. The patient's sputum culture showed the presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is a type of bacteria. The patient has been experiencing fevers and has not shown improvement despite previous antibiotic treatment. The patient's vital signs indicate sinus tachycardia and slightly decreased urine output. The patient is also at risk for upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility. The patient's coagulation status is being monitored closely due to the use of Coumadin and quinolones, which can affect blood clotting levels. The patient is also suspected to have adrenal insufficiency, as indicated by the need for proper stimulation in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may lead to further complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Fevers: The patient's recurrent fevers could indicate an ongoing infection or sepsis. It is important to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Hemodynamics: The patient's persistent sinus tachycardia and slightly decreased urine output may suggest potential cardiovascular or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old alcoholic who has experienced a traumatic spine fracture, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient continues to have persistent respiratory failure and is currently on a tracheostomy mask with intermittent need for mechanical ventilation support. The patient has developed a new pan Klebsiella infection in their sputum. Hemodynamic monitoring shows tachycardia with slightly decreased urine output (UOP). The patient also has an upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and requires anticoagulation, but their international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated due to the use of coumadin and quinolone. The patient is being weaned off steroids for adrenal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates a potential complication related to their tracheostomy and ventilation support. The presence of a new pan Klebsiella infection in the sputum suggests a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can further worsen respiratory function.
2. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's tachycardia and slightly decreased UOP suggest hemodynamic instability. This may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion or fluid balance, potentially leading to organ dysfunction.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR due to the combination of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has undergone tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Cultures grew Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, GNR, and GP cocci. The patient continues to have fevers, and new sputum shows gram-positive cocci, indicating a possible new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheal colonization. She will be monitored closely, and treatment for HAP will be continued for another 8 days.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is improving but still requires respiratory support. Weaning off the ventilator will be gradual.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, and the cause is unclear. Possible etiologies include hypovolemia, pain, infection, pulmonary embolism, mucus plugging, or spinal injury.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of right upper extremity DVT, increasing the risk of pulmonary embolism.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient may require stress dosed steroids during major stressors such as surgery or sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 135 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 106-185/41-128 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on tracheostomy mask with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient has been diagnosed with a small, nonobstructing clot in the axillary vein of the left arm. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE), although the study was limited by movement artifact. The patient's Coumadin dose was increased to 5 mg last night.

The patient experienced an episode of emesis with gastric tube fluids extruding from the tracheostomy site around the tube. Tube feeds were temporarily held. The patient's peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities could not be assessed. The patient's skin, neurologic status, and other physical examinations were not assessed.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 306 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, sodium of 134 mg/dL, potassium of 0.6 mg"

   Assessment and Plan
   55yoF with history of EtOH abuse presenting following mechanical fall
   and traumatic T spine fracture, now  s/p trach,  PEG,  placement being
   treated for HAP.
# HAP vs Aspiration PNA: Cultures grew, Klebsiella Oxytoca, Klebsiella Pneumonia
e, GNR, GP Cocci. Has completed 8 day course of Ceftriaxone. Has had occasional
low grade fevers, but has continued to improve clinically. Had a sputum gram sta
in from [**10-14**] w/ GPC p/c. a new VAP/HAP w/ staph possible, but given no clear inf
iltrate on CXR and good respiratory status, significant PNA is unlikely, coloniz
ation of tracheostomy tube is more likely, as is contamination of sputum.  Given
 improving clinical picture, will wait until CX data or change in clinical statu
s or CXR to initiate HAP/VAP treatment.
   - D/c Ceftriaxone
   - Continue to f/u cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Improving status. Will continue to increase
   time on trach mask as tolerated.
   -   PMV with suctioning.
   -   Weaning FiO2 as tolerated
   # Tachycardia: Pt in ST 120
s to 150s. Etiology remains unclear and
   include hypovolemia,  pain,  infection (pt with known klebsiella), and
   incrased work of breathing from secretions and tracheomalacia, . DDx
   also includes PE  given hx of RUE DVT, mucus plugging given large
   amount of secretions, and spinal injury. Tachycardia is unresponsive to
   IVF, Pt has had a negative CT-PA and has not had sig response to pain
   meds. Has completed treatment for her HAP. Thyroid function was checked
   and had normal TSH and T3 and  free T4. Had been on albuterol q4 and
   atrovent , she has not been wheezing, and perhaps she is sensitive to
   the B-agonist.
   -          Continue Pain Control
   -          Change albuterol to PRN
   -          Test if HR decreases when placed on higher pressure support
   for period of time.
   # Sedation: Has had inconsistent response to sedation, unclear what is
   best regime. Will continue to wean overall
   - Change to haldol 2.5 PRN, Fentanyl 75 mcg TP, Morphine [**1-16**] PRN,
   Benadryl, Valium 5mg PRN
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Followed up with endocrine that suggested if
   the patient under goes major stressors such as major surgery, sepsis,
   she may need stress dosed steroids.
   - Will consider MRI at later date for evaluation of pituitary
   # Fluid Status: Volume overloaded in prior setting of Hypernatremia
   - Monitoring urine output
   - increasse Free H20, for mild hypernatremia 200cc Free bolus PEG, and
   - 500cc D5W at 125.
   - PM lytes to assess hypernatremia
   # UE DVT: right has resolved, new non occlusive in left axillary. INR
   1.5
   -continue coumadin
   -follow INR
   - D/c Left PICC line, and place peripheral IVs. If unable, can place a
   R PICC.
   # Spine fracture: Stable
   - Brace for OOB, will discuss with Neurosurgery if current brace is
   optimal for stabilization given her mobility.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks
   # Tracheomalacia?: Was initially addressed with IP and they wanted to

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who presented following a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She underwent tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's condition has improved clinically, but she continues to experience low-grade fevers. A sputum gram stain from 10/14 showed gram-positive cocci, indicating possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or colonization of the tracheostomy tube. However, due to the patient's improving clinical picture, no immediate treatment for HAP/VAP is planned.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is improving and will continue to increase time on tracheostomy mask as tolerated.
2. Tachycardia: The etiology of tachycardia remains unclear, but potential causes include hypovolemia, pain, infection (klebsiella), increased work of breathing from secretions and tracheomalacia, and pulmonary embolism (PE). A negative CT-PA rules out PE.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The right upper extremity DVT has resolved, but there is a new nonocclusive thrombus in the left axillary vein. INR is within therapeutic range, and Coumadin will be continued.
4. Spine fracture: The fracture is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old alcoholic who underwent treatment for a traumatic spine fracture, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) with persistent respiratory failure. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask and requires ventilation support. A new strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae has been identified in the sputum. The patient continues to experience fevers, but cultures have been negative so far. Persistent sinus tachycardia is also noted. A CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, which came back negative. The patient has developed a new left external deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Additionally, the patient has been experiencing vomiting, and the healthcare team is considering transitioning from a tracheostomy tube to a feeding tube (J-tube). The patient's condition remains unstable, and ICU care is being provided. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates ongoing difficulty in breathing and oxygenation. This can lead to further deterioration in lung function, pneumonia, or other respiratory complications.
2. Fevers: The presence of fevers despite negative cultures suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. If not properly managed, it can lead to sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
3. Hemodynamics: Persistent sinus tachycardia may indicate underlying hemodynamic instability. If"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old alcoholic who underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) after a traumatic spine fracture. The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure and requires support for ventilation. There is a new presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum. The patient also has persistent sinus tachycardia and a new left external deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient has been vomiting, and it is planned to advance feeding through a jejunostomy tube. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates a potential risk of further deterioration in lung function and the need for continued ventilatory support.
2. Infection: The presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum suggests a possible lung infection, which could worsen the respiratory status and potentially lead to sepsis.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The new diagnosis of left external DVT indicates a risk of pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
4. Vomiting: The ongoing emesis may compromise nutrition and hydration, leading to further weakness and complications related to malnutrition.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The persistent sinus tachycardia suggests ongoing hemodynamic stress, which could be due to sepsis, hypoxia, or other underlying conditions.

   w/ staph possible, but given no clear infiltrate on CXR and good
   respiratory status, significant PNA is unlikely, colonization of
   tracheostomy tube is more likely, as is contamination of sputum.  Given
   improving clinical picture, will wait until CX data or change in
   clinical status or CXR to initiate HAP/VAP treatment.
   - D/c Ceftriaxone

   # Tachycardia: Pt in ST 120
s to 150s. Etiology remains unclear and
   include hypovolemia,  pain,  infection (pt with known klebsiella), and
   incrased work of breathing from secretions and tracheomalacia, . DDx
   also includes PE  given hx of RUE DVT, mucus plugging given large
   amount of secretions, and spinal injury. Tachycardia is unresponsive to
   IVF, Pt has had a negative CT-PA and has not had sig response to pain
   meds. Has completed treatment for her HAP. Thyroid function was checked
   and had normal TSH and T3 and  free T4. Had been on albuterol q4 and
   atrovent , she has not been wheezing, and perhaps she is sensitive to
   the B-agonist.
   -          Continue Pain Control
   -          Change albuterol to PRN
   -          Test if HR decreases when placed on higher pressure support
   for period of time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the ICU following a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's recent progress notes indicate that she has completed an 8-day course of ceftriaxone and continues to improve clinically. However, she still experiences occasional low-grade fevers. Her current vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 139 bpm, blood pressure of 133/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 70%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheomalacia: The patient has tracheomalacia, which may lead to airway collapse and compromise breathing, especially during weaning from mechanical ventilation.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Despite completing treatment for HAP, there is a risk of developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and colonization of the tracheostomy tube.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of right upper extremity DVT, which has partially resolved. She now has a new non-occlusive DVT in the left ax"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, but developed respiratory failure secondary to tracheomalacia and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient completed an 8-day course of ceftriaxone and has shown improvement clinically. However, she continues to have occasional low-grade fevers. A sputum gram stain from 10/14 showed gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting possible staphylococcal infection. However, there is no clear infiltrate on chest X-ray, and the patient's respiratory status is good, making significant pneumonia unlikely. It is more likely that the sputum is contaminated or the colonization of the tracheostomy tube.

The patient's tachycardia is attributed to runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and stress from respiratory failure. Metoprolol has been started at 12.5 mg TID and will be uptitrated as tolerated. Pain control and monitoring on telemetry will continue.

Sedation management is inconsistent, and it is unclear what the best regime is. Haldol will be discontinued, and valium will be tapered to 2.5 mg PRN TID, followed by discontinuation.

Adrenal insufficiency was discussed with endocrinology, and the patient may require"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old alcoholic who has undergone a traumatic spine fracture, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient continues to experience persistent respiratory failure and requires support for several hours per day. The patient has completed the prescribed treatment for pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species. Due to technical difficulties, an IP stent is not planned to be placed in the airway.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates a potential complication related to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of respiratory support, such as tracheostomy and CPAP/PSV ventilation, will be necessary.

2. Hemodynamics: The patient is experiencing persistent sinus tachycardia and occasional supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The addition of a low-dose beta-blocker is planned to manage these cardiac rhythm abnormalities. Close monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) at night is recommended since the patient tends to run low.

3. New Left External DVT: The patient has developed a new left extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The PICC line has been removed, and the patient is being started on Coumadin for anticoagulation.

4. Emesis: The patient is experiencing emesis, and Reglan will be initiated to manage this symptom. It is important to monitor the patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old alcoholic who underwent a traumatic craniectomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to a spinal fracture. The patient continues to experience respiratory failure and requires support for several hours per day, especially at night (QHS). The patient has completed the prescribed antibiotics for a Klebsiella pneumonia infection. The patient is also experiencing persistent sinus tachycardia with occasional runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which will be managed with a low-dose beta-blocker. The patient has developed a new left external deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and a PICC line has been removed with the initiation of Coumadin therapy. The patient has also been experiencing emesis, and Reglan has been started to address this issue. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 137 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/66 mmHg to 183/129 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a tracheostomy mask with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has undergone tracheostomy and PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) placement. The patient is currently in respiratory failure secondary to tracheomalacia and has a history of HAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia). Her heart rate has been consistently high, with occasional runs of SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), and she is on a low dose of b-blocker. She also has a negative CTA (computed tomography angiography) and normal thyroid function. The patient's blood pressure has been around 65 mmHg. She is being closely monitored on telemetry and receiving pain control. Her sedation regimen is being weaned overall, with Olanzapine at bedtime and a decrease in haldol and diazepam. The patient had emesis overnight, and her TFs (tube feedings) are currently held. She has been started on Reglan. Nutrition will be restarted as tolerated. There are concerns about adrenal insufficiency, fluid status, and DVT (deep vein thrombosis). The patient's spine fracture is stable, and she will follow up with neurosurgery for further evaluation and potential brace optimization. Tracheomalacia will be addressed with an IP (interventional procedure) for stent placement. The patient also has a thyroid nodule on"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to tracheomalacia and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She has a history of mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture, and she underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient's current condition shows improvement in respiratory status, with plans to increase time on tracheostomy mask as tolerated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to tracheomalacia and HAP. Although her status is improving, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if she does not tolerate weaning off ventilator support or if she develops new respiratory infections.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient had cultures positive for Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, GNR, and GP cocci. She completed an 8-day course of ceftriaxone and has shown improvement. However, there is a possibility of developing new VAP or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) due to potential colonization of the tracheostomy site.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing sinus tachycardia with heart rates ranging from 115 to 135. This could be due to various factors such as pain, stress, or underlying infection. Close monitoring"

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt was agitated during the day with no response to PRN zyprexa.
   Her sodium was increased to 150 yesterday, and she was given 500cc D5W
   bolus and her FW flushes for her tube feeds were increases from 100 to
   150.
   Overnight, pt received zyprexa, valium, and was placed back on the
   ventilator, after which she was more sedated and her SBP dropped to the
   70s and HR remained 120-130s. Her BP came back up to 110s-120s when she
   was woken up.
   She was agitated again until approx 5am when she was given her
   Metoprolol and 2.5 mg valium, after which her HR dropped to the 80s and
   stayed there for 2+ hours.
   Careful examination of telemetry revealed that she has likely been in
   an SVT and that after getting her BB, converted back to a sinus rhythm.

   Assessment and Plan
   55yoF s/p mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture, now  s/p
   trach,  PEG,  placement no with respiratory failure secondary to
   tracheomalacia , resolving HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Slowly Improving.  Now remaining on trach mask
   for most of the day and night, with periods of pressure support of [**10-18**]
   over night.
   -  Continue to increase time on trach mask as tolerated.
   -  PMV with suctioning again today.
   .
   # HAP vs Aspiration PNA:  Afebrile without leukocytosis
   - Completed course of ceftriaxone
   - Continue to f/u cultures
   - Continue trach mask as tolerated
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously was assessed as sinus tach with occasional
   runs of SVT and sources such as hypovolemia, PE, infection, and pain
   were assessed as possibly etiologies. But, now appears to be SVT for
   much of time, rhythm,/rate nonresponsive to carotid massage. HR
   decreased to 80s w/ stable BPs for approx 2 hour period overnight that
   seems to be associated with administration of her BB and valium. Rhythm
   strip shows conversion from a narrow complex non-sinus tachycardia to
   normal sinus rhythm.
   - Increase Metroprolol from 25mg TID to 25mg QID
   - Consider further adjustment of BB as tolerated by BP.
   - If not sufficient for rhythm conversion, consult cardiology for
   management.
   .
   # Sedation: Inconsistent response to sedation, unclear what is best
   regime. Will continue to wean overall. Possibly improved level of
   agitation when rhytm returned to sinus.
   -  Continue w Olanzapine QHS
   -  DC
d haldol and taper valium to 2.5 mg PRN TID w/ 2.5 mg PRNs.
   # Nutrition:  Tube feeds have been restarted and pt started on raglan.
   Has been tolerating feeds well so far.
   - Continue TFs, w/ FW flushes
   - Nutrition recs appreciated.
   .
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Endocrine following. Pt does not appear to be
   adrenally insufficient at baseline.  Suggesting if the patient under
   goes major stressors such as major surgery, sepsis, she may need stress
   dosed steroids.
   .
   # Fluid Status: Likely approaching euvolemia, though still has
   hypernatramia which may suggest is still intravascularly depleated.
   - Monitoring urine output
   - FW flushes at 100/hr w/ tube feeds
   - PM lytes to trend Na
   .
   # UE DVT and elevated INR: DVT in right UE has resolved, new
   non-occlusive in left axillary vein. INR supratherapeutic today
   - COumadin held, will restart at low dose when INR approaches
   therapeutic range.
   - follow INR
   .
   # Spine fracture: Stable
   - Brace for OOB, will discuss with Neurosurgery if current brace is
   optimal for stabilization given her mobility.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks
   .
   # Tracheomalacia.  Was initially addressed with IP and they wanted to
   follow up as outpatient.
   - Consult IP for stent placement given improved clinical status, will
   readdress

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She underwent tracheostomy, PEG placement, and respiratory failure secondary to tracheomalacia. The patient also had a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia (APNA). She was treated with ceftriaxone and is now afebrile without leukocytosis.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on tracheostomy with periods of pressure support. The plan is to continue increasing time on tracheostomy as tolerated.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing sinus tachycardia with occasional runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The etiology is still being evaluated, but hypovolemia, pulmonary embolism (PE), infection, and pain are possible causes. The patient's heart rate decreased to the 80s with stable blood pressures for approximately 2 hours overnight, which seems to be associated with the administration of her beta-blocker (Metoprolol) and valium. The rhythm strip shows conversion from a narrow complex non-sinus tachycardia to normal sinus rhythm. The plan is to increase Metoprolol to 25 mg QID and consider further adjustment of beta-blockers as tolerated by blood pressure. If not sufficient for rhythm conversion,"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old female who has undergone mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture, and is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to tracheomalacia. She also has a history of HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia), which is now resolving. The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, HAP vs aspiration pneumonia, tachycardia, sedation, nutrition, adrenal insufficiency, fluid status, UE DVT (upper extremity deep vein thrombosis), spine fracture, tracheomalacia, and thyroid nodule.

Respiratory failure: The patient is slowly improving but still requires pressure support at night. Tracheostomy and tracheal mask should be continued as tolerated.

HAP vs aspiration pneumonia: The patient has completed a course of ceftriaxone and cultures are being followed up. Tracheal mask should be continued as tolerated.

Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia with occasional runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) has been observed. Low-dose beta-blocker has been started, and the heart rate has decreased overnight. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the tachycardia.

Sedation: The patient has an inconsistent response to sedation, so weaning of overall sedation will be continued. Olanzapine has been started at bedtime, and haloperidol and valium will be tapered off.

Nutrition: The patient had emesis overnight, so tube feeds are currently held. Reglan has been given, and nutrition will be restarted as tolerated.

Adrenal insufficiency: Endocrine follow-up is planned. If the patient undergoes major stressors such as major surgery or sepsis, she may need stress dosed steroids.

Fluid status: The patient was volume overloaded in the previous setting of hypernatremia. Free water and D5W have been given, and electrolytes will be monitored.

UE DVT: The right upper extremity DVT has resolved, but a new non-occlusive DVT has developed in the left axillary vein. Coumadin dosage will be decreased to the home dose of 2.5mg, and INR will be followed.

Spine fracture: The fracture is stable, and a brace will be provided. Neurosurgery consultation will be sought to discuss the optimal stabilization given the patient's mobility.

Tracheomalacia: Initial management with inpatient (IP) treatment was considered, but it will be readdressed after consulting with IP for stent placement.

Thyroid nodule: Outpatient follow-up is planned.

Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels are well controlled.

Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been provided.

Overall, the patient requires careful monitoring and management of her multiple medical complications in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   55yoF s/p mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture, now  s/p
   trach,  PEG,  placement no with respiratory failure secondary to
   tracheomalacia , resolving HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Slowly Improving.  Now remaining on trach mask
   for most of the day and night, with periods of pressure support of [**10-18**]
   over night. Last night required MMV and was not breathing well while
   asleep, likely oversedated with Benadryl, Morhpine, and Valium
   administered in the early morning. Pt awake and alert at rounds,
   interactive, and breathing comfortably on trach mask
   -  Continue to increase time on trach mask as tolerated.
   -  Decrease sedation and valium use see Sedation below
   -  PMV with suctioning again today.
   .
   # HAP vs Aspiration PNA:  Afebrile without leukocytosis
   - Completed course of ceftriaxone
   - good O2 saturation on trach mask
   - Continue to f/u cultures
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously was assessed as sinus tach with occasional
   runs of SVT and sources such as hypovolemia, PE, infection, and pain
   were assessed as possibly etiologies. But, now appears to be SVT for
   much of time, rhythm/rate nonresponsive to carotid massage. HR
   occaisonaly decreases to 70s-80s w/ stable BPs at times that might be
   associated with administration of her BB and valium. Rhythm strip shows
   conversion from a narrow complex SVT to normal sinus rhythm and then
   back. Metroprolol was increased from 25mg TID to QID yesterday, without
   any affect on the SVT.
   - EP consulted for conversion of SVT, appreciate recs
   .
   # Sedation: Inconsistent response to sedation, unclear what is best
   regime. Will continue to wean overall.
   -  Continue w Olanzapine QHS
   -  D/d valium to 2.5 mg TID and leave just valium 2.5 mg PRN.
   # Nutrition:  Pt has had several episodes of vomiting  up her TFs,
   reglan started to increase GI motility, but pt had another episode of
   vomiting last night.
   - Hold TFs
   - Thoracic surgery recs: 1) oral/nasal tube in post-piloric position,
   or 2) IR to place a pediatric feeding tube through her PEG site to a
   post-piloric position.
   - Will attempt to coordinate thoracic surgery and IR for tube placement
   tomorrow.
   .
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Endocrine following. Pt does not appear to be
   adrenally insufficient at baseline.  Suggesting if the patient under
   goes major stressors such as major surgery, sepsis, she may need stress
   dosed steroids.
   .
   # Fluid Status: Likely approaching euvolemia, though still has mild
   hypernatramia which may suggest is still intravascularly depleated.
   - Monitoring urine output
   - FW flushes w/ tube feeds held due to vomitting
   - will provide D5W IVF as need for hypernatremia and follow lytes
   .
   # UE DVT and elevated INR: DVT in right UE has resolved, new
   non-occlusive in left axillary vein. INR supratherapeutic today
   - COumadin held, will restart at low dose when INR approaches
   therapeutic range.
   - INR 4.2 today, will check PM coags and consider restarting at a low
   dose tonight or tomorrow morning.
   .
   # Spine fracture: Stable
   - Brace for OOB, will discuss with Neurosurgery if current brace is
   optimal for stabilization given her mobility.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female who has undergone mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She is currently on a tracheostomy (trach), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and has respiratory failure secondary to tracheomalacia. The patient's current condition shows that she is slowly improving and is now remaining on a trach mask for most of the day and night with periods of pressure support. She requires minimal ventilatory support and is awake and alert during rounds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to tracheomalacia. It is important to continue monitoring her respiratory status and ensure proper ventilation support as needed.
2. HAP (Hospital-acquired pneumonia) vs Aspiration PNA: Although the patient has completed a course of ceftriaxone, it is necessary to follow up with cultures and continue monitoring for any signs of infection.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently elevated, and she appears to have supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Conversion of SVT should be considered, and further evaluation by an electrophysiologist (EP) is recommended.
4. Sedation: The patient's response to sedation is inconsistent, and it is unclear what the best regime is. Weaning overall sedation should be continued, and the use of valium should be reduced.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is vomiting tube feeds while receiving free water flushes. The patient's O2 saturation levels are stable at 99-100% with no increased O2 requirement. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate of 113 bpm and low blood pressure of 78/45 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal range at 12 breaths per minute. 

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. The patient is currently on several medications including diazepam (Valium), furosemide (Lasix), and morphine sulfate. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent vomiting episode. The patient's flow sheet data shows a slight increase in temperature, decreased blood pressure, and stable heart rate and respiratory rate. The patient's weight has increased from 94.2 kg at admission to 106 kg currently. 

The patient has received a total of 3,165 mL of fluids, with 1,574 mL given through IV fluids. The patient's urine output is 1,470 mL, which is within normal range. The patient's blood product transfusion was 1,670 mL, and the NG output is 200 mL.

   Assessment and Plan
   55yoF s/p mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture, now  s/p
   trach,  PEG,  placement no with respiratory failure secondary to
   tracheomalacia , resolving HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Slowly Improving.  Now remaining on trach mask
   for most of the day and night, with periods of pressure support of [**10-18**]
   over night.
   -  Continue to increase time on trach mask as tolerated.
   -  PMV with suctioning again today.
   .
   # HAP vs Aspiration PNA:  Afebrile without leukocytosis
   - Completed course of ceftriaxone
   - Continue to f/u cultures
   - Continue trach mask as tolerated
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously was assessed as sinus tach with occasional
   runs of SVT and sources such as hypovolemia, PE, infection, and pain
   were assessed as possibly etiologies. But, now appears to be SVT for
   much of time, rhythm,/rate nonresponsive to carotid massage. HR
   decreased to 80s w/ stable BPs for approx 2 hour period overnight that
   seems to be associated with administration of her BB and valium. Rhythm
   strip shows conversion from a narrow complex non-sinus tachycardia to
   normal sinus rhythm.

   - Consider further adjustment of BB as tolerated by BP.
   - If not sufficient for rhythm conversion, consult cardiology for
   management.

","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of emesis while on mechanical ventilation (MMV). The patient has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. The patient has received various infusions and other ICU medications including diazepam, furosemide, morphine sulfate, and pantoprazole.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 105/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 106 kg, and the height is 67 inches.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,165 mL and total output of 1,670 mL since 12 AM. The patient has received 1,574 mL of IV fluids and 1,665 mL of IV fluids previously. The patient's urine output is 1,470 mL and NG output is 200 mL.

The patient is on respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube and is being ventilated on MMV mode with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 20 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 38 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 5.2 to 7.1 thousand/mm3, hematocrit (Hct) ranging from 26.0% to 29.7%, platelet (Plt) count ranging from 35,000 to 467,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 101 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.5 to 0.8 mg/dL, glucose of 100 to 134 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels including sodium (Na+) of 135 to 145 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 3.4 to 6.9 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 101 mEq/L, and magnesium (Mg++) of 2.3 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include tachycardia, respiratory failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), coagulopathy, feeding tube issues, and hypernatremia. The patient is being treated with medications such as beta-blockers, antibiotics, anticoagulants, and proton pump inhibitors. The patient is also receiving nutrition through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and is being monitored for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines, including a 20-gauge line placed on 10/19/2167 at 12:00 AM. The patient is on prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's communication status is being addressed, and the patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU for further evaluation and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   55yoF s/p mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture, now  s/p
   trach, PEG  placement now with respiratory failure secondary to
   tracheomalacia , resolved HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Slowly Improving.  Now remaining on trach mask
   for most of the day, with periods of pressure support of [**10-18**] over
   night. This am on MMV. Previously likely oversedated with Benadryl,
   Morhpine, and Valium which were held overnight. Pt awake and alert at
   rounds, interactive, and breathing comfortably on trach mask
   -  Continue to increase time on trach mask as tolerated.
   -  Decrease sedation and valium use
   -  PMV with suctioning
   .
   # HAP vs Aspiration PNA:  Afebrile without leukocytosis
   - Completed course of ceftriaxone
   - good O2 saturation on trach mask
   - Continue to f/u cultures
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously was assessed as sinus tach with occasional
   runs of SVT and sources such as hypovolemia, PE, infection, and pain
   were assessed as possibly etiologies. Per Cardiology, most likely AT
   given transient response to Adenosine. HR occasionally decreases to
   70s-80s w/ stable BPs at times that might be associated with
   administration of her BB and valium. Cards recommended titating up her
   beta blocker as tolerated. Dose increased to 37.5 yesterday but still
   tachycardic.
   - EP consulted for conversion of SVT, appreciate recs
   - Increase metoprolol to 50 PO QID with holding parameters
   .
   # Sedation: Inconsistent response to sedation, unclear what is best
   regime. Will continue to wean overall.
   -  Continue w Olanzapine QHS
   -  Just valium 2.5 mg PRN.
   # Nutrition/Vomiting:  Pt has had several episodes of vomiting  up her
   TFs, reglan started to increase GI motility, but pt had another episode
   of vomiting this am, not improved with zofran or reglan. Pateint also
   had hypoactive BS on exam, concern for obstruction given persistent
   vomiting, inability to tolerate tube feeds.
   - Hold TFs
   - Thoracic surgery recs: 1) oral/nasal tube in post-piloric position,
   or 2) IR to place a pediatric feeding tube through her PEG site to a
   post-piloric position.
   - Will attempt to coordinate thoracic surgery and IR for tube placement
   ; will d/w thoracics. IR will not do further intervention due to disk
   on G tube
   - CT scan to evaluate for obstruction, etiology of persistent emesis,
   consider tube study as well
   .
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Endocrine following. Pt does not appear to be
   adrenally insufficient at baseline.  Suggesting if the patient under
   goes major stressors such as major surgery, sepsis, she may need stress
   dosed steroids.
   .
   # Fluid Status: Likely approaching euvolemia, though still has mild
   hypernatramia which may suggest is still intravascularly depleated.
   - Monitoring urine output
   - FW flushes w/ tube feeds held due to vomitting
   - will provide D5W IVF as need for hypernatremia and follow lytes
   .
   # UE DVT and elevated INR: DVT in right UE has resolved, new
   non-occlusive in left axillary vein. INR supratherapeutic today and
   trending upward. INR most likely continuing to rise [**2-14**] nutritional
   deficiencies given lack of PO intake
   - Cumadin held, will restart at low dose when INR approaches
   therapeutic range.
   - INR 5.5 today, will check PM coags and follow
   .
   # Spine fracture: Stable
   - Brace for OOB, will discuss with Neurosurgery if current brace is
   optimal for stabilization given her mobility.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks
   .
   # Tracheomalacia.  Was initially addressed with IP and they wanted to
   follow up as outpatient. IP reevaluated and does not believe that a
   stent would be feasible.
   .
   #. Thyroid Nodule on CT
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # Glycemic control: SSI, well controlled
   # PIV x 1

   Assessment and Plan
   55yoF s/p mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture, now  s/p
   trach,  PEG,  placement no with respiratory failure secondary to
   tracheomalacia , resolving HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Slowly Improving.  Now remaining on trach mask
   for most of the day and night, with periods of pressure support of [**10-18**]
   over night. Last night required MMV and was not breathing well while
   asleep, likely oversedated with Benadryl, Morhpine, and Valium
   administered in the early morning. Pt awake and alert at rounds,
   interactive, and breathing comfortably on trach mask
   -  Continue to increase time on trach mask as tolerated.
   -  Decrease sedation and valium use see Sedation below
   -  PMV with suctioning again today.
   .
   # HAP vs Aspiration PNA:  Afebrile without leukocytosis
   - Completed course of ceftriaxone
   - good O2 saturation on trach mask
   - Continue to f/u cultures
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously was assessed as sinus tach with occasional
   runs of SVT and sources such as hypovolemia, PE, infection, and pain
   were assessed as possibly etiologies. But, now appears to be SVT for
   much of time, rhythm/rate nonresponsive to carotid massage. HR
   occaisonaly decreases to 70s-80s w/ stable BPs at times that might be
   associated with administration of her BB and valium. Rhythm strip shows
   conversion from a narrow complex SVT to normal sinus rhythm and then
   back. Metroprolol was increased from 25mg TID to QID yesterday, without
   any affect on the SVT.
   - EP consulted for conversion of SVT, appreciate recs
   .
   # Sedation: Inconsistent response to sedation, unclear what is best
   regime. Will continue to wean overall.
   -  Continue w Olanzapine QHS
   -  D/d valium to 2.5 mg TID and leave just valium 2.5 mg PRN.
   # Nutrition:  Pt has had several episodes of vomiting  up her TFs,
   reglan started to increase GI motility, but pt had another episode of
   vomiting last night.
   - Hold TFs
   - Thoracic surgery recs: 1) oral/nasal tube in post-piloric position,
   or 2) IR to place a pediatric feeding tube through her PEG site to a
   post-piloric position.
   - Will attempt to coordinate thoracic surgery and IR for tube placement
   tomorrow.
   .
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Endocrine following. Pt does not appear to be
   adrenally insufficient at baseline.  Suggesting if the patient under
   goes major stressors such as major surgery, sepsis, she may need stress
   dosed steroids.
   .
   # Fluid Status: Likely approaching euvolemia, though still has mild
   hypernatramia which may suggest is still intravascularly depleated.
   - Monitoring urine output
   - FW flushes w/ tube feeds held due to vomitting
   - will provide D5W IVF as need for hypernatremia and follow lytes
   .
   # UE DVT and elevated INR: DVT in right UE has resolved, new
   non-occlusive in left axillary vein. INR supratherapeutic today
   - COumadin held, will restart at low dose when INR approaches
   therapeutic range.
   - INR 4.2 today, will check PM coags and consider restarting at a low
   dose tonight or tomorrow morning.
   .
   # Spine fracture: Stable
   - Brace for OOB, will discuss with Neurosurgery if current brace is
   optimal for stabilization given her mobility.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks
   .
   # Tracheomalacia.  Was initially addressed with IP and they wanted to
   follow up as outpatient. IP reevaluated and does not believe that a
   stent would be feasible.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to tracheomalacia. She also has a history of traumatic T-spine fracture, PEG placement, and HAP. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy tube and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 111/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is primarily supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), but she occasionally has periods of normal sinus rhythm.

The patient's recent medical history includes episodes of vomiting, leading to the decision to hold tube feeds and explore alternative methods for nutrition, such as an oral/nasal tube in a post-pyloric position or placement of a pediatric feeding tube through her PEG site. The patient's fluid status is being monitored due to mild hypernatremia, which may indicate intravascular depletion. Her sedation regimen is being weaned, and she is currently on olanzapine at bedtime and valium as needed. The patient's coagulation status is being managed with Coumadin, and her INR is currently supratherapeutic.

The patient's spine fracture is stable and requires ongoing management, including the use of a brace. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has a history of penicillin, tetracycline, and sulfa allergies. The patient underwent cardioversion and defibrillation on 10/19/2167 at 11:50 AM. He tolerated the procedure well. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 131/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is receiving high-flow oxygen through a tracheostomy tube and is on mechanical ventilation with settings including tidal volume (VT) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and creatinine levels, as well as low sodium and potassium levels. The patient's condition is complicated by tachycardia, persistent nausea/vomiting with poor bowel sounds, respiratory failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), coagulopathy, hypernatremia, and potential gastric outlet obstruction.

   Assessment and Plan
   55yoF s/p mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture, now s/p
   trach, PEG  placement now with respiratory failure secondary to
   tracheomalacia , resolved HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Slowly Improving. Intermittently on trach mask
   for most of the day, with periods of pressure support of [**10-18**] over
   night. This am on MMV. Previously likely oversedated but Benadryl,
   Morhpine, and Valium held now. Pt awake and alert at rounds,
   interactive, and breathing comfortably on trach mask
   -  Continue to increase time on trach mask as tolerated.
   -  Decrease sedation and valium use
   -  PMV with suctioning
   .
   # HAP vs Aspiration PNA:  Afebrile without leukocytosis
   - Completed course of ceftriaxone
   - good O2 saturation on trach mask
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously was assessed as sinus tach with occasional
   runs of SVT and sources such as hypovolemia, PE, infection, and pain
   were assessed as possibly etiologies. Per Cardiology, most likely AT
   given transient response to Adenosine. HR occasionally decreases to
   70s-80s w/ stable BPs at times that might be associated with
   administration of her BB and valium. Cards recommended titrating up her
   beta blocker as tolerated. Dose increased to 50 yesterday and
   intermittently responded but then had to hold PO meds given need to
   hold PO. Changed PO to IV lopressor.
   - EP consulted for SVT, appreciate recs, will change metoprololt o IV
   and hopefully will be able to restart PO meds soon once able to
   tolerate
   - IV metoprolol 5 mg IV q 4
   .
   # Sedation: Inconsistent response to sedation, unclear what is best
   regime. Will continue to wean overall.
   -  Continue w Olanzapine QHS
   -  Just valium 2.5 mg PRN.
   # Nutrition/Vomiting:  Pt has had several episodes of vomiting  up her
   TFs, reglan started to increase GI motility, but pt had another episode
   of vomiting this am, not improved with zofran or reglan. Patient also
   had hypoactive BS on exam, concern for obstruction given persistent
   vomiting, inability to tolerate tube feeds.
   - Hold TFs
   - Thoracic surgery recs: 1) oral/nasal tube in post-piloric position,
   or 2) IR to place a pediatric feeding tube through her PEG site to a
   post-piloric position.
   - Will attempt to coordinate thoracic surgery and IR for tube placement
   ; will d/w thoracics
   - CT scan did not reveal evidence of obstruction. Attempted to
   coordinate tube study or UGI btu per Radiology would not be useful
   studies since no obstruction or dysmotility evident on CT
   - Reglan DCd since not helping
   - Will decrease narcotics for possible cause of decreased motility
   .
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Endocrine following. Pt does not appear to be
   adrenally insufficient at baseline.  Suggesting if the patient under
   goes major stressors such as major surgery, sepsis, she may need stress
   dosed steroids.
   .
   # Fluid Status: Likely approaching euvolemia, though still has mild
   hypernatramia which may suggest is still intravascularly depleated.
   - Monitoring urine output
   - will provide D5W IVF as need for hypernatremia and follow lytes
   .
   # UE DVT and elevated INR: DVT in right UE has resolved, new
   non-occlusive in left axillary vein. INR supratherapeutic today and
   trending upward. INR most likely continuing to rise [**2-14**] nutritional
   deficiencies given continued lack of PO intake
   - Cumadin stopped.
   - INR 10.5 today, up from 5.5, will give Vitamin K IV and reassess will
   check PM coags and follow
   - vitamin K IV x 1. Will likely need to continue with SC, follow coags
   .
   #Hematemesis: Pt had small amt Hematemesis this am. Concerning in
   setting of elevated INR. Will give IV Vitamin K and may need continued
   dosing
   -          Vit K IV x 1
   -
   # Spine fracture: Stable
   - Brace for OOB, will discuss with Neurosurgery if current brace is
   optimal for stabilization given her mobility.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks
   .
   # Tracheomalacia.  Was initially addressed with IP and they wanted to
   follow up as outpatient. IP reevaluated and does not believe that a
   stent would be feasible.
   .
   #. Thyroid Nodule on CT
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # Glycemic control: SSI, well controlled
   # PIV x 1
   # Ppx: supratherapeutic INR, Ranitidine, Bowel Regimen PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture, who is currently in the ICU. She has undergone tracheostomy and PEG placement, and is experiencing respiratory failure secondary to tracheomalacia. She has also had an episode of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) but is now improving. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been on a tracheostomy mask for most of the day, with periods of pressure support overnight. Her sedation has been weaned and she is awake and alert at rounds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to tracheomalacia, which is causing breathing difficulties. The plan is to continue increasing time on tracheostomy mask as tolerated and decrease sedation.
2. HAP vs Aspiration PNA: The patient had an episode of HAP, but currently does not show signs of infection. The course of ceftriaxone has been completed and she is maintaining good oxygen saturation on the tracheostomy mask.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, which was initially thought to be sinus tachycardia with occasional runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Cardiology recommends atrial tachycardia (AT) as the likely cause, given the transient response to adenosine."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with an unknown primary diagnosis admitted to the ICU. The patient presented with multiple vomiting episodes that were not improved with zofran and was unable to tolerate anything through her PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy). She had an abdominal CT with contrast but vomited up most of the contrast, resulting in a limited study. The preliminary read showed no obstruction and confirmed the presence of a PEG in place. The nurse observed coffee grounds emesis and later an episode of clear emesis with some small blood when suctioning the posterior pharynx. Tube feeds were held.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa (sulfonamides). She received infusions and other ICU medications, but no antibiotics were administered since the last dose.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 110 bpm (76-136), blood pressure ranging from 98/63 mmHg to 149/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute (12-33), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently 106 kg, with a height of 67 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,241 mL and output of 1,860 mL, resulting in a balance of 381 mL. The patient is on ventilatory support through a tracheostomy tube with the mode set to MMV/PSV/AutoFlow. The FiO2 is 50%.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, neurologic assessment not assessed, and other assessments not documented. Lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly decreased Hct, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal. Imaging studies are not provided.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines placement, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. Code status is full code, and disposition is pending further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of coffee grounds emesis and small blood in the vomit suggests possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for pneumonia due to being on mechanical ventilation and having an altered respiratory status.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased venous return can increase the risk of developing DVT.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating and sometimes below the normal range, indicating possible hypotension.
6. Fluid imbalance: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   55yoF s/p mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture, now  s/p
   trach, PEG  placement now with respiratory failure secondary to
   tracheomalacia , resolved HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Slowly Improving.  Now remaining on trach mask
   for most of the day, with periods of pressure support of [**10-18**] over
   night. This am on MMV. Previously likely oversedated with Benadryl,
   Morhpine, and Valium which were held overnight. Pt awake and alert at
   rounds, interactive, and breathing comfortably on trach mask
   -  Continue to increase time on trach mask as tolerated.
   -  Decrease sedation and valium use
   -  PMV with suctioning
   .
   # HAP vs Aspiration PNA:  Afebrile without leukocytosis
   - Completed course of ceftriaxone
   - good O2 saturation on trach mask
   - Continue to f/u cultures
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously was assessed as sinus tach with occasional
   runs of SVT and sources such as hypovolemia, PE, infection, and pain
   were assessed as possibly etiologies. Per Cardiology, most likely AT
   given transient response to Adenosine. HR occasionally decreases to
   70s-80s w/ stable BPs at times that might be associated with
   administration of her BB and valium. Cards recommended titating up her
   beta blocker as tolerated. Dose increased to 37.5 yesterday but still
   tachycardic.
   - EP consulted for conversion of SVT, appreciate recs
   - Increase metoprolol to 50 PO QID with holding parameters
   .
   # Sedation: Inconsistent response to sedation, unclear what is best
   regime. Will continue to wean overall.
   -  Continue w Olanzapine QHS
   -  Just valium 2.5 mg PRN.
   # Nutrition/Vomiting:  Pt has had several episodes of vomiting  up her
   TFs, reglan started to increase GI motility, but pt had another episode
   of vomiting this am, not improved with zofran or reglan. Pateint also
   had hypoactive BS on exam, concern for obstruction given persistent
   vomiting, inability to tolerate tube feeds.
   - Hold TFs
   - Thoracic surgery recs: 1) oral/nasal tube in post-piloric position,
   or 2) IR to place a pediatric feeding tube through her PEG site to a
   post-piloric position.
   - Will attempt to coordinate thoracic surgery and IR for tube placement
   ; will d/w thoracics. IR will not do further intervention due to disk
   on G tube
   - CT scan to evaluate for obstruction, etiology of persistent emesis,
   consider tube study as well
   .
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Endocrine following. Pt does not appear to be
   adrenally insufficient at baseline.  Suggesting if the patient under
   goes major stressors such as major surgery, sepsis, she may need stress
   dosed steroids.
   .
   # Fluid Status: Likely approaching euvolemia, though still has mild
   hypernatramia which may suggest is still intravascularly depleated.
   - Monitoring urine output
   - FW flushes w/ tube feeds held due to vomitting
   - will provide D5W IVF as need for hypernatremia and follow lytes
   .
   # UE DVT and elevated INR: DVT in right UE has resolved, new
   non-occlusive in left axillary vein. INR supratherapeutic today and
   trending upward. INR most likely continuing to rise [**2-14**] nutritional
   deficiencies given lack of PO intake
   - Cumadin held, will restart at low dose when INR approaches
   therapeutic range.
   - INR 5.5 today, will check PM coags and follow
   .
   # Spine fracture: Stable
   - Brace for OOB, will discuss with Neurosurgery if current brace is
   optimal for stabilization given her mobility.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks
   .
   # Tracheomalacia.  Was initially addressed with IP and they wanted to
   follow up as outpatient. IP reevaluated and does not believe that a
   stent would be feasible.
   .
   #. Thyroid Nodule on CT
   - Outpatient follow up

   # Glycemic control: SSI, well controlled

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has undergone tracheostomy and PEG placement. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure secondary to tracheomalacia, which has been resolved. She also had a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) but is now afebrile without leukocytosis and has completed her course of ceftriaxone. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial tachycardia, and cardiology recommends titrating up her beta-blocker as tolerated. She is still tachycardic despite an increased dose of metoprolol. The patient's sedation regimen is inconsistent, and overall sedation will continue to be weaned. She has had several episodes of vomiting, and her bowel sounds are hypoactive on examination. There are concerns for obstruction given persistent vomiting and inability to tolerate tube feeds. Her fluid status is likely approaching euvolemia, although she still has mild hypernatremia, which may suggest intravascular depletion. She has a history of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and an elevated INR, which is supratherapeutic today and trending upward. The patient's spine fracture is stable, and she will be braced for out-of-bed mobility. She will follow up with neurosurgery to discuss optimal stabilization given her mobility. The patient also has tr"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing various medical complications. The note details the patient's symptoms, treatment, vital signs, lab results, and overall health status.

The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. However, there have been significant events over the past 24 hours. The patient's Metoprolol dosage was increased to 7.5 IV q 4. A tube study was performed in the morning, followed by the placement of a J-tube by the interventional radiology (IR) team via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Afterward, the patient received tube feeds at 10/hr but promptly vomited, and tube feeding was temporarily held.

The patient was agitated and given Haldol. The patient was then placed back on pressure support. The sodium level was measured at 148, although the patient had not yet received D5W. The INR was recorded at 2.3 after receiving 10 IV Vit K.

The patient has several allergies, including penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa (sulfonamides). The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2167-10-21**] at 08:30 AM. The patient is currently receiving infusions of Pantoprazole (Protonix) and Diazepam (Valium).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with an unknown primary diagnosis. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and required intubation. She has been receiving mechanical ventilation support since then. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's vital signs have been unstable. Her heart rate has been elevated, ranging from 107 to 140 beats per minute. Blood pressure has been low, with readings between 55/40 mmHg and 85/45 mmHg. Respiratory rate has been around 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation has remained at 100%.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including metoprolol, pantoprazole, and diazepam. She also has an allergy to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications.

Her laboratory results show abnormal values for sodium, potassium, chloride, and glucose levels. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, but her hematocrit and platelet count have been fluctuating. Renal function tests indicate a slight decrease in creatinine levels, while liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's nutritional status is being monitored through tube feeds, but she has experienced vomiting after receiving feeds. She has been placed on pressure support ventilation and given haloperidol to manage agitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   55yoF s/p mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture, now s/p
   trach, PEG  placement now with respiratory failure secondary to
   tracheomalacia , resolved HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Slowly Improving. Intermittently on trach mask
   for most of the day, with periods of pressure support of over night.
   This am on MMV. Previously likely oversedated but Benadryl, Morhpine,
   and Valium held now. Pt awake and alert at rounds, interactive, and
   breathing comfortably on trach mask
   -  Continue to increase time on trach mask as tolerated.
   -  Decrease sedation and valium use
   -  PMV with suctioning
   # Nutrition/Vomiting:  Has had several days of vomiting up TFs but had
   a normal CT abdoment. Yesterday she had a pediatric feeding tube placed
   by GI through her PEG tube into her jejunum, and was given TFs last
   night, which she vomited. Pt had a tube study this am that showed
   dysmotility of her jejunum. GI continuing to follow study during the
   day with KUBs. Unclear etiology of her ileus; pt has hx of GI problems
   and chronic N/V and this may be her chronic baseline. Alternatively pt
   has had long course of opiates during MICU stay, however, her opiates
   have been decreased steady for the past week and she has had periods
   where she tolerated TFs. Will need to provide parenteral nutrition at
   this point.
   - Hold TFs
   - GI consulted
   - F/u results of Tube study
   - PICC line placement  for parenteral nutrition
   -.
   # HAP vs Aspiration PNA:  Afebrile without leukocytosis
   - Completed course of ceftriaxone
   - good O2 saturation on trach mask
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously was assessed as sinus tach with occasional
   runs of SVT and sources such as hypovolemia, PE, infection, and pain
   were assessed as possibly etiologies. Per Cardiology, most likely AT
   given transient response to Adenosine. HR occasionally decreases to
   70s-80s w/ stable BPs at times that might be associated with
   administration of her BB and valium. Cards recommended titrating up her
   beta blocker as tolerated. Dose increased to 50 yesterday and
   intermittently responded but then had to hold PO meds given need to
   hold PO. Changed PO to IV lopressor.
   - EP consulted for SVT, appreciate recs, will change metoprololt o IV
   and hopefully will be able to restart PO meds soon once able to
   tolerate
   - Changed to IV metoprolol 10mg q4hr during the day and 7.5mg q4 hours
   at night.
   - Per EP, after good trial on PO BB and recovery from current
   hospitalization, would consider EP study or short course of
   amiodarone..
   .
   # Sedation: Inconsistent response to sedation, unclear what is best
   regime. Will continue to wean overall.
   -  Continue w Olanzapine QHS
   -  d/c all opiates given GI dysmotlitiy
   .
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Endocrine following. Pt does not appear to be
   adrenally insufficient at baseline.  Suggesting if the patient under
   goes major stressors such as major surgery, sepsis, she may need stress
   dosed steroids.
   .
   # Fluid Status: Likely approaching euvolemia, though still has mild
   hypernatramia which may suggest is still intravascularly depleated.
   - Monitoring urine output
   - will provide D5W IVF as need for hypernatremia and follow lytes
   .
   # UE DVT and elevated INR: DVT in right UE has resolved, new
   non-occlusive in left axillary vein. INR supratherapeutic yesterday at
   10.5 despite having stopped coumadin the day before. INR increase is
   most likely continuing to rise [**2-14**] nutritional deficiencies given
   continued lack of PO intake. Pt was given Vitamin K IV yesterday, and
   today INR is 1.3.
   -          Restart coumadin after PICC line placement today
   -          Continue to follow INR closely to reach therapeutic INR.
   .
   #Hematemesis: Pt had small amt Hematemesis, after vomiting, yesterday.
   None today.
   -Will follow HCT.
   - Guaiac stools
   # Spine fracture: Stable
   - Brace for OOB, will discuss with Neurosurgery if current brace is
   optimal for stabilization given her mobility.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks
   .
   # Tracheomalacia.  Was initially addressed with IP and they wanted to
   follow up as outpatient. IP reevaluated and does not believe that a
   stent would be feasible.
   .
   #. Thyroid Nodule on CT
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # Glycemic control: SSI, well controlled
   # ACCESS: PIV x 1, PICC placement
   today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a history of a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement and is currently experiencing respiratory failure secondary to tracheomalacia. The patient also had a resolved hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is improving but still requires intermittent use of the tracheostomy mask and pressure support overnight. She is currently on minimal mandatory ventilation (MMV) and sedation has been reduced. The plan is to continue increasing time on the tracheostomy mask as tolerated and decrease sedation further.

2. Vomiting: The patient has been experiencing vomiting of tube feeds (TFs) despite having a normal CT abdomen. A tube study showed dysmotility of the jejunum. The etiology of her ileus is unclear, but it may be related to her history of gastrointestinal problems or chronic use of opiates. The patient is currently receiving parenteral nutrition due to intolerance to TFs.

3. HAP vs Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient completed a course of ceftriaxone and is afebrile without leukocytosis. Her oxygen saturation is good on the tracheostomy mask, suggesting that she is recovering from the HAP.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing sinus"

   trach, PEG  placement now with respiratory failure secondary to
   tracheomalacia , resolved HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Slowly Improving. Intermittently on trach mask
   for most of the day, with periods of pressure support of [**10-18**] over
   night. This am on MMV. Previously likely oversedated but Benadryl,
   Morhpine, and Valium held now. Pt awake and alert at rounds,
   interactive, and breathing comfortably on trach mask
   -  Continue to increase time on trach mask as tolerated.
   -  Decrease sedation and valium use
   -  PMV with suctioning
   .
   # HAP vs Aspiration PNA:  Afebrile without leukocytosis
   - Completed course of ceftriaxone
   - good O2 saturation on trach mask
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously was assessed as sinus tach with occasional
   runs of SVT and sources such as hypovolemia, PE, infection, and pain
   were assessed as possibly etiologies. Per Cardiology, most likely AT
   given transient response to Adenosine. HR occasionally decreases to
   70s-80s w/ stable BPs at times that might be associated with
   administration of her BB and valium. Cards recommended titrating up her
   beta blocker as tolerated. Dose increased to 50 yesterday and
   intermittently responded but then had to hold PO meds given need to
   hold PO. Changed PO to IV lopressor.
   - EP consulted for SVT, appreciate recs, will change metoprololt o IV
   and hopefully will be able to restart PO meds soon once able to
   tolerate
   - IV metoprolol 5 mg IV q 4
   .
   # Sedation: Inconsistent response to sedation, unclear what is best
   regime. Will continue to wean overall.
   -  Continue w Olanzapine QHS
   -  Just valium 2.5 mg PRN.
   # Nutrition/Vomiting:  Pt has had several episodes of vomiting  up her
   TFs, reglan started to increase GI motility, but pt had another episode
   of vomiting this am, not improved with zofran or reglan. Patient also
   had hypoactive BS on exam, concern for obstruction given persistent
   vomiting, inability to tolerate tube feeds.
   - Hold TFs
   - Thoracic surgery recs: 1) oral/nasal tube in post-piloric position,
   or 2) IR to place a pediatric feeding tube through her PEG site to a
   post-piloric position.
   - Will attempt to coordinate thoracic surgery and IR for tube placement
   ; will d/w thoracics
   - CT scan did not reveal evidence of obstruction. Attempted to
   coordinate tube study or UGI btu per Radiology would not be useful
   studies since no obstruction or dysmotility evident on CT
   - Reglan DCd since not helping
   - Will decrease narcotics for possible cause of decreased motility
   .
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Endocrine following. Pt does not appear to be
   adrenally insufficient at baseline.  Suggesting if the patient under
   goes major stressors such as major surgery, sepsis, she may need stress
   dosed steroids.
   .
   # Fluid Status: Likely approaching euvolemia, though still has mild
   hypernatramia which may suggest is still intravascularly depleated.
   - Monitoring urine output
   - will provide D5W IVF as need for hypernatremia and follow lytes
   .
   # UE DVT and elevated INR: DVT in right UE has resolved, new
   non-occlusive in left axillary vein. INR supratherapeutic today and
   trending upward. INR most likely continuing to rise [**2-14**] nutritional
   deficiencies given continued lack of PO intake
   - Cumadin stopped.
   - INR 10.5 today, up from 5.5, will give Vitamin K IV and reassess will
   check PM coags and follow
   - vitamin K IV x 1. Will likely need to continue with SC, follow coags
   .
   #Hematemesis: Pt had small amt Hematemesis this am. Concerning in
   setting of elevated INR. Will give IV Vitamin K and may need continued
   dosing
   -          Vit K IV x 1
   -
   # Spine fracture: Stable
   - Brace for OOB, will discuss with Neurosurgery if current brace is
   optimal for stabilization given her mobility.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks
   .
   # Tracheomalacia.  Was initially addressed with IP and they wanted to
   follow up as outpatient. IP reevaluated and does not believe that a
   stent would be feasible.
   .
   #. Thyroid Nodule on CT
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # Glycemic control: SSI, well controlled
   # PIV x 1
   # Ppx: supratherapeutic INR, Ranitidine, Bowel Regimen PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with a history of mechanical fall, traumatic T-spine fracture, tracheomalacia, and resolved hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She is currently on mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, HAP, tachycardia, sedation, nutrition/vomiting, adrenal insufficiency, fluid status, upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), elevated INR, hematemesis, spine fracture, tracheomalacia, thyroid nodule, and glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a history of tracheomalacia. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. HAP vs Aspiration PNA: Although the patient has completed a course of ceftriaxone, there is still a possibility of recurrent or persistent pneumonia.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to various causes such as hypovolemia, pulmonary embolism (PE), infection, pain, or atrial tachycardia (AT). It is important to monitor the heart rate and adjust beta-blocker dosages as tolerated.
4. Sedation: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU and has had several medical events and complications. The patient's allergies include penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa. The patient is currently on various medications including diazepam (Valium), and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 36.7°C, current temperature (Tcurrent) of 35.6°C, heart rate (HR) of 118 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 153/58 to 82/39 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. The patient has a history of sinus tachycardia. The patient's weight is currently 106 kg, and his height is 67 inches. The patient has received a total of 3,808 mL of fluids, with an output of 1,650 mL of blood products and 1,590 mL of urine. The patient is on respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube, using CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 243 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 67. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending. The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab results are also provided. The patient's assessment and plan include tachycardia, persistent nausea/vomiting, respiratory failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypernatremia. The patient is receiving TPN for nutrition and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the respiratory support is not optimized or if there is an underlying infection.

2. Nausea/Vomiting: The persistent nausea/vomiting could lead to further dehydration and malnutrition if not managed appropriately.

3. DVT: The patient's history of immobility and hypercoagulability increases the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT). If a DVT forms, it could potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if a clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.

   Assessment and Plan
   55yoF s/p mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture, now s/p
   trach, PEG  placement now with respiratory failure secondary to
   tracheomalacia , resolved HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Slowly Improving. Intermittently on trach mask
   for most of the day, with periods of pressure support of over night.
   This am on MMV. Previously likely oversedated but Benadryl, Morhpine,
   and Valium held now. Pt awake and alert at rounds, interactive, and
   breathing comfortably on trach mask
   -  Continue to increase time on trach mask as tolerated.
   -  Decrease sedation and valium use
   -  PMV with suctioning
   # Nutrition/Vomiting:  Has had several days of vomiting up TFs but had
   a normal CT abdoment. Yesterday she had a pediatric feeding tube placed
   by GI through her PEG tube into her jejunum, and was given TFs last
   night, which she vomited. Pt had a tube study this am that showed
   dysmotility of her jejunum. GI continuing to follow study during the
   day with KUBs. Unclear etiology of her ileus; pt has hx of GI problems
   and chronic N/V and this may be her chronic baseline. Alternatively pt
   has had long course of opiates during MICU stay, however, her opiates
   have been decreased steady for the past week and she has had periods
   where she tolerated TFs. Will need to provide parenteral nutrition at
   this point.
   - Hold TFs
   - GI consulted
   - F/u results of Tube study
   - PICC line placement  for parenteral nutrition
   -.
   # HAP vs Aspiration PNA:  Afebrile without leukocytosis
   - Completed course of ceftriaxone
   - good O2 saturation on trach mask
   .
   # Tachycardia: Previously was assessed as sinus tach with occasional
   runs of SVT and sources such as hypovolemia, PE, infection, and pain
   were assessed as possibly etiologies. Per Cardiology, most likely AT
   given transient response to Adenosine. HR occasionally decreases to
   70s-80s w/ stable BPs at times that might be associated with
   administration of her BB and valium. Cards recommended titrating up her
   beta blocker as tolerated. Dose increased to 50 yesterday and
   intermittently responded but then had to hold PO meds given need to
   hold PO. Changed PO to IV lopressor.
   - EP consulted for SVT, appreciate recs, will change metoprololt o IV
   and hopefully will be able to restart PO meds soon once able to
   tolerate
   - Changed to IV metoprolol 10mg q4hr during the day and 7.5mg q4 hours
   at night.
   - Per EP, after good trial on PO BB and recovery from current
   hospitalization, would consider EP study or short course of
   amiodarone..
   # Sedation: Inconsistent response to sedation, unclear what is best
   regime. Will continue to wean overall.
   -  Continue w Olanzapine QHS
   -  d/c all opiates given GI dysmotlitiy
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Endocrine following. Pt does not appear to be
   adrenally insufficient at baseline.  Suggesting if the patient under
   goes major stressors such as major surgery, sepsis, she may need stress
   dosed steroids.
   .
   # Fluid Status: Likely approaching euvolemia, though still has mild
   hypernatramia which may suggest is still intravascularly depleated.
   - Monitoring urine output
   - will provide D5W IVF as need for hypernatremia and follow lytes
   # UE DVT and elevated INR: DVT in right UE has resolved, new
   non-occlusive in left axillary vein. INR supratherapeutic yesterday at
   10.5 despite having stopped coumadin the day before. INR increase is
   most likely continuing to rise [**2-14**] nutritional deficiencies given
   continued lack of PO intake. Pt was given Vitamin K IV yesterday, and
   today INR is 1.3.
   -          Restart coumadin after PICC line placement today
   -          Continue to follow INR closely to reach therapeutic INR.
   .
   #Hematemesis: Pt had small amt Hematemesis, after vomiting, yesterday.
   None today.
   -Will follow HCT.
   - Guaiac stools
   # Spine fracture: Stable
   - Brace for OOB, will discuss with Neurosurgery if current brace is
   optimal for stabilization given her mobility.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks
   .
   # Tracheomalacia.  Was initially addressed with IP and they wanted to
   follow up as outpatient. IP reevaluated and does not believe that a
   stent would be feasible.
   .
   #. Thyroid Nodule on CT
   - Outpatient follow up

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has undergone tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to tracheomalacia, but her condition is slowly improving. She is intermittently on a tracheal mask for most of the day, with periods of pressure support at night.

The patient has had several days of vomiting up tube feedings (TFs), but a normal CT abdomen was performed. Yesterday, a pediatric feeding tube was placed by GI through her PEG tube into her jejunum, and she was given TFs last night, which she vomited. A tube study this morning showed dysmotility of her jejunum. GI is continuing to follow the study during the day with kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) evaluation. The etiology of her ileus is unclear; she has a history of GI problems and chronic nausea/vomiting, which may be her chronic baseline. Alternatively, the patient has had a long course of opiates during her MICU stay, but her opiates have been decreased steadily for the past week, and she has had periods where she tolerated TFs. At this point, parenteral nutrition will be provided.

The patient has completed a course of ceftriaxone and is afebrile without leukocytosis, suggesting that she may no longer"

   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Slowly improving, spending most of the day on
   trach mask with short periods of rest  on PSV at night and setbacks
   from increased secretions [**2-14**] to vomiting/aspiration events and her
   self-decanulations.
   -  Continue to increase time on trach mask as tolerated.
   -  Discontinue all orders for sedation except for Zyprexa QHS.
   -  PMV with suctioning as tolerated
   # Nutrition/Vomiting:  Normal CT-abdomen, had FT placed via peg into
   jejunum, but continued to vomit. Tube study yesterday showed
   dysmotility in small bowel, but no obstruction, no retrograde flow.
   Awaiting GI recs.
   - Hold TFs
   - GI consult, appreciate recs
   - PICC line placement  for parenteral nutrition this am
   - Nutrition recs to start TPN today
   # HAP vs Aspiration PNA:  Had been afebrile for last several days, now
   with new fever last night after having decanulated herself. Likely had
   some aspiration. Chemical pneumonitis versus new aspiration PNA.
   - CXR today
   - F/u cx data
   - If remains febrile, send sputum cx.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Pt in and out of SVT and sinus, increased BB seems to
   help, but pt does not stay in sinus. Cards rec to start Amiodarone IV
   drip, and then convert to PO, 200mg TID. Would consider EPS if
   amiodarone not successful, though would wait until pt more stable for
   GA.
   - Changed to IV metoprolol to 10mg IV q4hr during the day and 7.5mg q4
   hours at night.
   - Amiodarone 0.5mg/min IV drip x 18 hours.
   - Cards c/s, appreciate recs
   # Sedation/Anxiolysis/AlteredMS: unclear etiology of her confusion and
   agitation. Has had long hospital course and multiple psychotropic
   medications as well as hx of EtOH abuse.

   likely [**2-14**] to poor nutrition, resonded quickly to Vitamin K IV, but now
   subtherapeutic again. Kept subtherapeutic today for PICC line placement
   (for TPN), will restart w/ 2mg Coumadin after line placement.
   -          Restart coumadin after PICC line placement today
   -          Continue to follow INR closely to reach therapeutic INR.

   #Hematemesis: Pt had small amt Hematemesis, after vomiting, 2 days ago.
   None today. HCT stable.
   -Will follow HCT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female who has undergone a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has been placed on a tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for respiratory failure secondary to tracheomalacia. The patient also had resolved hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She continues to experience respiratory failure, with intermittent periods of rest on pressure support ventilation (PSV) at night. The patient is also dealing with ongoing vomiting and dysmotility in the small bowel, resulting in aspiration events and self-decanulations.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is slowly improving but is still dependent on a trach mask with short periods of rest on PSV at night. Setbacks occur due to increased secretions and aspiration events.
2. Vomiting/Aspiration Events: The patient continues to vomit despite having a feeding tube (TF) placed via PEG into the jejunum. A tube study yesterday showed dysmotility in the small bowel, but no obstruction or retrograde flow. A gastrointestinal (GI) consult is appreciated for recommendations.
3. HAP vs Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient had been afebrile for several days but developed a new fever after decanulating herself. This suggests some aspiration. A chest X-ray today will be followed by further data and sputum culture if the patient remains febrile"

","The patient presented with respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU. The patient had an unplanned extubation, where she pulled out her tracheostomy tube, which was promptly replaced. She also developed a fever of 101.4°F.

The patient's vital signs showed a maximum temperature of 38.6°C (101.4°F) and a current temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F). Her heart rate was 116 bpm, with a range of 84-142 bpm. Blood pressure readings were between 96/39 mmHg and 181/113 mmHg. Respiratory rate was 23 breaths per minute, with a spontaneous rate of 13-27 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation remained at 99%. The patient's rhythm was sinus tachycardia.

The patient's weight had increased from 94.2 kg at admission to 106 kg currently. Fluid balance showed a total input of 2,127 mL and output of 995 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,132 mL. The patient was receiving medications through IV infusions of amiodarone and metoprolol. Other medications included in the plan were tPA and antibiotics.

The patient's review of systems remained unchanged from admission except for the respiratory distress. The physical examination revealed that the patient was alert and responsive, with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. She was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient experienced unplanned extubation and had her tracheostomy tube replaced. She also developed a fever with a maximum temperature of 101.4°F.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. She is currently receiving amiodarone infusion and metoprolol. Other medications and medical history remain unchanged from admission.

Vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/39 mmHg to 181/113 mmHg, respiratory rate between 13-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight has increased from 94.2 kg at admission to 106 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,127 mL and output of 994 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,132 mL. Respiratory support includes CPAP/PPS mode with a set tidal volume of 0 mL, spontaneous tidal volume of 360 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

Physical examination reveals the patient lying in bed, alert, and responsive to questions."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. She has been admitted to the ICU and has experienced several medical complications. These include unplanned extubation, fever, bradycardia, profound desaturation, tachycardia, agitation, persistent nausea/vomiting, respiratory failure, DVT, coagulopathy, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing runs of tachycardia, which may be due to underlying stress or an arrhythmia. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes should be checked, and an electrophysiology (EP) consult should be obtained.
2. Persistent Nausea/Vomiting: The patient has persistent nausea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. The cause needs to be determined, and appropriate treatment should be initiated. A gastrointestinal (GI) consult should be called to discuss the possibility of an endoscopic examination (EGD).
3. Agitation: The patient is agitated and experiencing delirium. It is important to minimize narcotics as they may contribute to agitation. A psychiatric consult should be obtained to further evaluate and manage the patient's mental status.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires careful monitoring and management. Tracheostomy trials and pressure support ventilation (PSV) should be continued. Nonin"

   Assessment and Plan
   55yoF s/p mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture, now s/p
   trach, PEG  placement now with respiratory failure secondary to
   tracheomalacia , resolved HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Slowly improving, spending most of the day on
   trach mask with short periods of rest  on PSV at night and setbacks
   from increased secretions [**2-14**] to vomiting/aspiration events and her
   self-decanulations.
   -  Continue to increase time on trach mask as tolerated.
   -  Discontinue all orders for sedation except for Zyprexa QHS.
   -  PMV with suctioning as tolerated
   # Nutrition/Vomiting:  Normal CT-abdomen, had FT placed via peg into
   jejunum, but continued to vomit. Tube study yesterday showed
   dysmotility in small bowel, but no obstruction, no retrograde flow.
   Awaiting GI recs.
   - Hold TFs
   - GI consult, appreciate recs
   - PICC line placement  for parenteral nutrition this am
   - Nutrition recs to start TPN today
   # HAP vs Aspiration PNA:  Had been afebrile for last several days, now
   with new fever last night after having decanulated herself. Likely had
   some aspiration. Chemical pneumonitis versus new aspiration PNA.
   - CXR today
   - F/u cx data
   - If remains febrile, send sputum cx.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Pt in and out of SVT and sinus, increased BB seems to
   help, but pt does not stay in sinus. Cards rec to start Amiodarone IV
   drip, and then convert to PO, 200mg TID. Would consider EPS if
   amiodarone not successful, though would wait until pt more stable for
   GA.
   - Changed to IV metoprolol to 10mg IV q4hr during the day and 7.5mg q4
   hours at night.
   - Amiodarone 0.5mg/min IV drip x 18 hours.
   - Cards c/s, appreciate recs
   # Sedation/Anxiolysis/AlteredMS: unclear etiology of her confusion and
   agitation. Has had long hospital course and multiple psychotropic
   medications as well as hx of EtOH abuse.
   -  Continue w Olanzapine QHS
   -  d/c all benzos, d/c all opiates given GI dysmotlitiy
   - Psychiatry consulted, appreciate recs
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Endocrine following. Pt does not appear to be
   adrenally insufficient at baseline.  Suggesting if the patient under
   goes major stressors such as major surgery, sepsis, she may need stress
   dosed steroids.
   .
   # Fluid Status: Likely approaching euvolemia, though still has mild
   hypernatramia which may suggest is still intravascularly depleated.
   - Monitoring urine output
   - will provide D5W IVF as need for hypernatremia and follow lytes
   # UE DVT and elevated INR: DVT in right UE has resolved, new
   non-occlusive in left axillary vein. INR had risen quickly on coumadin,
   likely [**2-14**] to poor nutrition, resonded quickly to Vitamin K IV, but now
   subtherapeutic again. Kept subtherapeutic today for PICC line placement
   (for TPN), will restart w/ 2mg Coumadin after line placement.
   -          Restart coumadin after PICC line placement today
   -          Continue to follow INR closely to reach therapeutic INR.
   .
   #Hematemesis: Pt had small amt Hematemesis, after vomiting, 2 days ago.
   None today. HCT stable.
   -Will follow HCT.
   - Guaiac stools
   # Spine fracture: Stable
   - Brace for OOB, will discuss with Neurosurgery if current brace is
   optimal for stabilization given her mobility.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks
   .
   # Tracheomalacia.  Was initially addressed with IP and they wanted to
   follow up as outpatient. IP reevaluated and does not believe that a
   stent would be feasible.
   .
   #. Thyroid Nodule on CT
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # Glycemic control: SSI, well controlled
   # ACCESS: PIV x 1, PICC placement
   today.
   # Ppx: subtherapeutic INR restarting coumadin today, Ranitidine, Bowel
   Regimen PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to tracheomalacia, resolved HAP, and other medical complications. The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including tracheostomy (trach) placement, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and initiation of total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to tracheomalacia. The trach mask should continue to be used as tolerated, and efforts should be made to minimize increased secretions that can lead to vomiting and aspiration events.

2. HAP vs Aspiration PNA: The patient has a history of HAP, and recent fever after decannulation suggests possible aspiration pneumonia. Further evaluation is needed, including a chest X-ray and follow-up of culture data.

3. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing episodes of SVT and sinus tachycardia. Amiodarone IV drip and then conversion to PO, 200mg TID, have been recommended by Cardiology. Metoprolol IV has also been initiated. If amiodarone is not successful, EPS may be considered.

4. Sedation/Anxiolysis/Altered Mental Status: The patient's confusion and agitation may be attributed to multiple psychotropic medications and"

   Assessment and Plan
   55yoF s/p mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture, now s/p
   trach, PEG  placement now with respiratory failure secondary to
   tracheomalacia , resolved HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Slowly improving, spending most of the day on
   trach mask with short periods of rest  on PSV at night and setbacks
   from increased secretions [**2-14**] to vomiting/aspiration events and her
   self-decanulations.
   -  Continue to increase time on trach mask as tolerated.
   -  Discontinue all orders for sedation except for Risperdal QHS.
   -  PMV with suctioning as tolerated
   # Nutrition/Vomiting:  Normal CT-abdomen, had FT placed via peg into
   jejunum, but continued to vomit. Tube study showed dysmotility in small
   bowel, but no obstruction, no retrograde flow. GI recs Reglan 20mg IV Q
   8 hours and restart meds via G-J tube, if tolerated slowly restart TFs.
   PICC line placed yesterday and TPN started.
   - GI consult, appreciate recs
   - Small volume TFs start today
   - Continue TPN today
   # HAP vs Aspiration PNA:  Had been afebrile for last several days, now
   with new fever two nights ago after having decanulated herself. Likely
   had some aspiration. Chemical pneumonitis versus new aspiration PNA.
   Now Afebrile for past 24 hours.
   - f/u daily CXR
   - F/u cx data
   - If remains febrile, send sputum cx, otherwise hold on abx.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Pt in and out of SVT and sinus, increased BB seems to
   help, but pt does not stay in sinus. Cards rec to start Amiodarone IV
   drip, and then convert to PO, 200mg TID. Would consider EPS if
   amiodarone not successful, though would wait until pt more stable for
   general anesthesia.
   - Changed to IV metoprolol to 10mg IV q4hr.
   - Completed amiodarone 0.5mg/min IV drip x 18 hours, and converted to
   200mg PO TID..
   - Cards c/s, appreciate recs
   # Sedation/Anxiolysis/AlteredMS: unclear etiology of her confusion and
   agitation. Has had long hospital course and multiple psychotropic
   medications as well as hx of EtOH abuse.
   -  d/c all benzos. opiates, and antihistamines
   - Psychiatry consulted, appreciate recs
   - started Risperdal 0.5mg PO BID, d/c zyprexa.
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Endocrine following. Pt does not appear to be
   adrenally insufficient at baseline.  Suggesting if the patient under
   goes major stressors such as major surgery, sepsis, she may need stress
   dosed steroids.
   .
   # Fluid Status: Likely approaching euvolemia, though still has mild
   hypernatramia which may suggest is still intravascularly depleated.
   - Monitoring urine output
   - will provide D5W IVF as need for hypernatremia and follow lytes
   # UE DVT and elevated INR: DVT in right UE has resolved, new
   non-occlusive in left axillary vein. INR has been volatile, likely from
   drug interactions and poor nutritional status. Have been unable to keep
   her appropariately therapeutic.
   - d/c coumadin
   - start Lovenox, maintain until GI issues resolved and can restart
   coumadin
   .
   #Hematemesis: Pt had small amt Hematemesis, after vomiting, last week.
   None today. HCT stable.
   -Will follow HCT.
   - Guaiac stools
   # Spine fracture: Stable
   - Brace for OOB, will discuss with Neurosurgery if current brace is
   optimal for stabilization given her mobility.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 924**]
s note above and I
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  I would only add/emphasize
   the following:  Ms [**Known lastname 510**] has done well of late on a trache collar,
   able to go all night without the vent.  The active issues now are
   chiefly GI, cardiac, and pychiatric.  Her hypomotility may be a bit
   better now that she is on high dose Reglan, and we will gingerly start
   feedings via her J in G tube, while continuing TPN for the present. Her
   SVT has for now converted to NSR on Amiodarone and Metoprolol.  Her
   delirium is being addressed with the help of psychiatry, and we
   started Risperdal at their suggestion.  Once these issues are stable
   she should be able to move to a resp rehab facility.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old female who experienced a mechanical fall, traumatic T-spine fracture, tracheomalacia, and resolved hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- She has been in the ICU with respiratory failure, requiring tracheostomy and PEG placement.
- The patient's current issues include vomiting, aspiration events, self-decanulations, tachycardia, altered mental status, potential adrenal insufficiency, fluid status, elevated INR, and a history of hematemesis.
- The patient's spine fracture is stable, and she will be braced for out-of-bed mobility.
- There is also a thyroid nodule on CT, but it will be followed up as an outpatient.
- The patient's glycemic control is well-managed.
- She has received TPN without lipids since 10/23/2167 at 06:00 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to ongoing issues with increased secretions, vomiting/aspiration events, and self-decanulations. Continuous monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Gastrointestinal (GI) Dysfunction: The patient continues to experience vomiting and dysmotility in the small bowel, which may lead to further complications such as aspiration pneumonia or malnutrition if not managed properly.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and"

   Pt decannulated herself x2 yesterday, the 1st episode she desatted to
   the 80s, the second episode she desated and her heart rate decreased to
   39-40, before the trach could be replaced.
   PICC line placed by IR, called to notify that there was clot in both
   arms, placed in L arm more proximally than small Bacillis vein clot.
   Coumadin restarted after PICC placement with 2mg
   Per GI Recs: Reglan restarted at 20mg IV q 8 hours, and meds were
   restarted via tube. No vomitting.
   Per PSYCH recs: d/c'd all benzoes, (also requested d/c reglan if GI
   ok), added Risperdal 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] (and can add 0.5mg PRN, and titrate up
   to total daily dose of 2-3mg if helping)
   Per Cards recs: after 18hr of amiodaron drip. Start PO amiodarone 200mg

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure secondary to tracheomalacia. This condition is slowly improving, but the patient continues to have setbacks from increased secretions and self-decanulations.

2. HAP vs Aspiration PNA: The patient had a recent fever after decannulating herself, suggesting possible aspiration. Chemical pneumonitis versus new aspiration pneumonia needs to be monitored and managed accordingly.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has been in and out of SVT and sinus tachycardia. Amiodarone IV drip was started, followed by conversion to PO, which seems to help control the heart rate. If amiodarone is not successful, EPS may be considered.

4. Sedation/Anxiolysis/Altered Mental Status: The etiology of the patient's confusion and agitation is unclear. The patient has had a long hospital course and has been on multiple psychotropic medications, as well as a history of EtOH abuse. Benzodiazepines have been discontinued, and Risperdal has been started.

5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient does not appear to be adrenally insufficient at baseline. However, if the patient undergoes major stressors such as major surgery or sepsis, she may need stress-dosed steroids.

6. Fluid Status: The patient is likely approaching euvolemia"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1538**]
s note above and
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  I would emphasize that Ms
   [**Known lastname 510**] has done well, and is off the ventilator now for over 36
   straight hours.  Today she is awake, animated, but unable to talk as
   PMV is not in place due to secretions.  Tube feeds had been held due to
   possible aspiration, but without clear cut evidence of such.  So with
   the need for enteral nutrition and good bowel sounds, we will restart
   TFs today.  For her emotional benefit, we will keep her well suctioned
   and allow her short periods on the PMV so that she can communicate and
   be less frustrated.   The goal will be to have her remain stable so
   that transfer to pulm rehab can occur early this work week.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture.
- She has been intubated and placed on a tracheostomy (trach) after resolving respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- The patient's current vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate ranging from 64-104 bpm, blood pressure between 116/51-151/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%.
- The patient is alert and awake, mouthing words but unable to communicate effectively due to the presence of secretions. She has a past medical history of EtOH abuse.
- The patient's abdomen is described as obese, soft, mildly distended with bowel sounds present.
- Laboratory results show mild hypernatremia with a sodium level of 33 mEq/L and slightly elevated white blood cell count at 9.5 K/uL.
- The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her upper extremity and an elevated INR.
- She is currently receiving Lovenox (enoxaparin) for DVT prophylaxis and D5W IV fluids for hypernatremia.
- The patient's tracheomalacia was initially addressed with an IP stent but was deemed not feasible, and a tracheostomy was performed instead.
- The patient's glycemic control is well-managed, with an average blood glucose level of 129 mg/dL.
- The patient has a thyroid nodule on CT scan, which will require outpatient follow-up.
- The patient's disposition is planned for ICU care with screening for potential ventilator facilities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of resolving respiratory failure and ongoing need for tracheostomy suggests a risk of recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Tracheomalacia: The patient's tracheomalacia may lead to airway collapse and compromise, especially if the tracheostomy site becomes obstructed or if the patient experiences increased secretions.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of DVT and elevated INR indicate an increased risk of clot formation and potential complications such as pulmonary embolism.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's mild hypernatremia requires careful monitoring and management to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's recent HAP increases the risk of recurrent infections and pneumonia-related complications.
6. Spine Fracture: The patient's traumatic T-spine fracture may lead to spinal cord compression or instability, which can result in neurological deficits.
7. Glycemic Control: The patient's well-managed glycemic control needs to be maintained to prevent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia-related complications.
8. Thyroid Nodule: The presence"

   # Respiratory failure:  36hrs off vent, now on trach mask. No further
   self-decanulations overnight.
   -  Tach mask as tolerated.
   -  Holding sedation with exception of Risperidal 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
   -  PMV with suctioning as tolerated

   # Nutrition/Vomiting:  TFs restarted yesterday while patient was not in
   optimal positioning. One large BM in past 24 hrs to indicate potential
   improvement in ileus.
   - Cont Reglan 20mg IV Q 8 hours and restart meds via G-J tube,
   - Slowly restarting TFs and will increase as tolerated.
   - PICC line in place with TPN given when pt not tolerating.
   - GI consult, appreciate recs
   .
   # Tachycardia: One episode of SVT overnight with improved HR max of
   100
s versus 160s previously. Pt now on PO Amiodarone 200 TID, and IV
   metoprolol
   - Will change IV metoprolol to metoprolol 25mg PO TID
   - f/u Cards recs
   # Sedation/Anxiolysis/AlteredMS: Improved alertness. Long hospital
   course and multiple psychotropic medications as well as hx of EtOH
   abuse.
   - - started Risperdal 0.5mg PO BID
   -  continue to hold all benzos. opiates, and antihistamines
   - f/u psych recs.

   # Fluid Status: Mild hypernatramia with good UOP.
   - providing D5W IVF PRN and follow lytes
   # UE DVT and elevated INR: Decision made to d/c Coumadin given her
   labile INR, and start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **]. L Picc difficult to flush this AM.
   - Will flush L PICC with TPA
   .
   # Spine fracture: Stable
   - Brace for OOB, will discuss with Neurosurgery if current brace is
   optimal for stabilization given her mobility.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks
   .
   # Tracheomalacia.  Was initially addressed with IP and they wanted to
   follow up as outpatient. IP reevaluated and does not believe that a
   stent would be feasible.

   Assessment and Plan
   55yoF s/p mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture, now s/p
   trach, PEG  placement now with respiratory failure secondary to
   tracheomalacia , resolved HAP.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Slowly improving, spending most of the day on
   trach mask with short periods of rest  on PSV at night and setbacks
   from increased secretions [**2-14**] to vomiting/aspiration events and her
   self-decanulations.
   -  Continue to increase time on trach mask as tolerated.
   -  Discontinue all orders for sedation except for Risperdal QHS.
   -  PMV with suctioning as tolerated
   # Nutrition/Vomiting:  Normal CT-abdomen, had FT placed via peg into
   jejunum, but continued to vomit. Tube study showed dysmotility in small
   bowel, but no obstruction, no retrograde flow. GI recs Reglan 20mg IV Q
   8 hours and restart meds via G-J tube, if tolerated slowly restart TFs.
   PICC line placed yesterday and TPN started.
   - GI consult, appreciate recs
   - Small volume TFs start today
   - Continue TPN today
   # HAP vs Aspiration PNA:  Had been afebrile for last several days, now
   with new fever two nights ago after having decanulated herself. Likely
   had some aspiration. Chemical pneumonitis versus new aspiration PNA.
   Now Afebrile for past 24 hours.
   - f/u daily CXR
   - F/u cx data
   - If remains febrile, send sputum cx, otherwise hold on abx.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Pt in and out of SVT and sinus, increased BB seems to
   help, but pt does not stay in sinus. Cards rec to start Amiodarone IV
   drip, and then convert to PO, 200mg TID. Would consider EPS if
   amiodarone not successful, though would wait until pt more stable for
   general anesthesia.
   - Changed to IV metoprolol to 10mg IV q4hr.
   - Completed amiodarone 0.5mg/min IV drip x 18 hours, and converted to
   200mg PO TID..
   - Cards c/s, appreciate recs
   # Sedation/Anxiolysis/AlteredMS: unclear etiology of her confusion and
   agitation. Has had long hospital course and multiple psychotropic
   medications as well as hx of EtOH abuse.
   -  d/c all benzos. opiates, and antihistamines
   - Psychiatry consulted, appreciate recs
   - started Risperdal 0.5mg PO BID, d/c zyprexa.
   # Adrenal Insufficency: Endocrine following. Pt does not appear to be
   adrenally insufficient at baseline.  Suggesting if the patient under
   goes major stressors such as major surgery, sepsis, she may need stress
   dosed steroids.
   .
   # Fluid Status: Likely approaching euvolemia, though still has mild
   hypernatramia which may suggest is still intravascularly depleated.
   - Monitoring urine output
   - will provide D5W IVF as need for hypernatremia and follow lytes
   # UE DVT and elevated INR: DVT in right UE has resolved, new
   non-occlusive in left axillary vein. INR has been volatile, likely from
   drug interactions and poor nutritional status. Have been unable to keep
   her appropariately therapeutic.
   - d/c coumadin
   - start Lovenox, maintain until GI issues resolved and can restart
   coumadin
   .
   #Hematemesis: Pt had small amt Hematemesis, after vomiting, last week.
   None today. HCT stable.
   -Will follow HCT.
   - Guaiac stools
   # Spine fracture: Stable
   - Brace for OOB, will discuss with Neurosurgery if current brace is
   optimal for stabilization given her mobility.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**4-19**] weeks
   .
   # Tracheomalacia.  Was initially addressed with IP and they wanted to
   follow up as outpatient. IP reevaluated and does not believe that a
   stent would be feasible.
   .
   #. Thyroid Nodule on CT
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # Glycemic control: SSI, well controlled
   # ACCESS: PIV x 1, PICC placement yesterday.
   # Ppx: subtherapeutic INR restarting coumadin today, Ranitidine, Bowel
   Regimen PRN

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 55-year-old female who has had a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement due to respiratory failure secondary to tracheomalacia. The patient also had a resolved hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is slowly improving but still requires the use of a tracheostomy mask with short periods of rest on pressure support ventilation (PSV) at night. There have been setbacks due to increased secretions, vomiting/aspiration events, and self-decanulations. The plan is to continue increasing time on the tracheostomy mask as tolerated and discontinue all orders for sedation except for Risperdal QHS.
2. Nutrition/Vomiting: Despite having a feeding tube placed via PEG into the jejunum, the patient continues to vomit. A tube study showed dysmotility in the small bowel but no obstruction or retrograde flow. The patient has been started on Reglan 20mg IV Q8 hours and will restart medications via a G-J tube if tolerated slowly. Small volume oral feeds will be started today, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) will continue.
3. HAP vs Aspiration PNA: The patient had a new fever two nights ago after decanulating herself, suggesting likely aspiration"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided. I have reviewed the note above and agree with
   the findings and plan of care. I would add the following:
   Ms [**Known lastname 510**] remains stable, on her trache mask, off the vent for 3 days.
   Secretions improved and she is using the PMV  to talk in short spells.
   Her ileus seems better, with a good BM and good bowel sounds and no
   clear cut emesis.  So TFs will be restarted and advanced.  She remains
   on high dose raglan.
   We will rediscuss her case with psychiatry as her mentation varies from
   very alert to more somnolent  and she is still confused.
   All in all, however, she is close to being able to go to resp rehab
   facility and we
ll talk to case manager tomorrow.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient has resolved respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She remains intubated but is tolerating the tracheostomy mask well and has good oxygen saturation. 

The patient's nutrition has been supplemented with total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and she had a large bowel movement indicating improvement in ileus. Medications include risperidone for agitation, amiodarone for tachycardia, metoprolol for blood pressure control, pantoprazole, and lovenox for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

The patient's labs show mild hypernatremia, anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. Her electrolytes are being closely monitored. The patient's spine fracture is stable, and she is advised to follow up with neurosurgery before discharge.

Other medical issues include tracheomalacia, a thyroid nodule, and glycemic control. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse. 

Plan:
The patient's current plan includes continued aggressive care with daily follow-ups, speech and swallow evaluation, and consideration for transfer to a long-term acute care hospital (LTAC) for further rehabilitation."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female who has experienced multiple medical complications. Here are the summarized information and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- The patient has a history of a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture.
- She underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement with resolving respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- She is currently intubated with a tracheostomy tube and receiving TPN.
- The patient is experiencing agitation, tachycardia, and altered mental status.
- She has anemia, hypernatremia, and a history of ethanol abuse.
- The patient has a spinal fracture, tracheomalacia, thyroid nodule, and poor glycemic control.
- She is on multiple medications including anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics, and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, as indicated by the need for intubation and tracheostomy. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the tracheostomy tube becomes blocked or dislodged.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of HAP, which increases the risk of developing other infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of UE DVT and elevated IN"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted after a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement, and her respiratory failure has improved from being ventilator-dependent to being on a tracheostomy mask with FiO2 70%. The patient still experiences episodes of agitation and tachycardia, which are likely due to her long hospital course and multiple psychotropic medications. She also has hypernatremia and hypervolemia, for which she is receiving D5W IVF PRN and being monitored for electrolyte imbalances. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and has been on TPN/TF. She has been diagnosed with a UE DVT and an elevated INR, but her INR has normalized after discontinuing Coumadin and starting Lovenox. The patient's spine fracture is stable, and she will be braced and followed up with Neurosurgery for further evaluation and stabilization. The patient also has tracheomalacia, which was initially addressed with IP, but further evaluation by the IP determined that a stent would not be feasible. Additionally, the patient has a thyroid nodule on CT, which will be followed up on an outpatient basis. The patient's glycemic control has been well-managed. She has two central lines, including a PIV and an L PICC. She is currently receiving Lovenox, PPi, and bowel regimen PR"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 56-year-old female who suffered a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and is resolving respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask with FiO2 set at 70% and tolerating it well with good oxygen saturation. She is also on total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- She had a large bowel movement in the past 24 hours, indicating potential improvement in ileus.
- The patient's tachycardia has improved from a maximum of 160 beats per minute to 120 beats per minute. She is on oral amiodarone 200 mg three times a day and metoprolol 25 mg three times a day.
- She is experiencing agitation, likely secondary to her long hospital course and multiple psychotropic medications, as well as a history of ethanol abuse. Risperdal was given overnight.
- Her hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 28% to 24%, possibly related to variation or blood loss. A repeat HCT check is planned.
- The patient has mild hypernatremia with good urine output (hypervolemic hypernatremia). She is receiving D5W intravenous fluids and free water flushes with tube feed"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient had resolving respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She is currently on a tracheostomy mask with FiO2 70%, tolerating well with good O2 saturation. Her sedation is being held with the exception of Risperidone 0.5 mg.

The patient's nutrition is being provided through total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She had one large bowel movement in the past 24 hours, indicating potential improvement in ileus. Medications are being administered via a G-J tube. A speech and swallow evaluation is planned.

The patient has tachycardia, which has improved from a maximum of 160 beats per minute previously to 120 beats per minute. She is on oral amiodarone 200 mg three times a day and oral metoprolol 25 mg three times a day. The current medication regimen will be continued, and amiodarone will be given for three weeks before switching to once daily.

The patient is agitated and continues to be agitated, likely secondary to a long hospital course and multiple psychotropic medications as well as a history of EtOH abuse. Risperidone 0.5 mg twice daily has been started.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has a history of respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask with FiO2 70%, holding sedation except for Risperdal 0.5mg. She is also on PMV with suctioning as tolerated.

The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, with an episode of SVT overnight, and is now on PO Amiodarone 200 TID. Her IV metoprolol will be changed to metoprolol 25mg PO TID. She has mild hypernatremia but good urine output.

The patient has a history of substance abuse and is currently receiving psychotropic medications. Her fluid status is stable, but she has an elevated INR. She has been started on Lovenox instead of Coumadin due to labile INR. Her spine fracture is stable, and she will be braced and followed up with Neurosurgery. She also has tracheomalacia, which was initially addressed with an IP but did not require a stent. She has a thyroid nodule on CT and will be followed up outpatient.

The patient's glycemic control is well-managed, and she has access to PIV x 1 and L PICC. She is on Lovenox, PPi, and bowel regimen PR"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female who experienced a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has undergone tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, resolving respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask with 50% FiO2, tolerating well with good oxygen saturation. She continues to be at risk for aspiration due to an opening defect in the posterior vocal cord space and recent history of vomiting during tube feed trials. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/Aspiration Risk: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to the opening defect in the posterior vocal cord space and recent history of vomiting during tube feed trials. She is currently on a tracheostomy mask with 50% FiO2, which she is tolerating well.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate has improved from previous readings but remains elevated. She is currently on PO amiodarone 200 TID and PO metoprolol 37.5mg TID.
3. Hypernatremia/Fluid Status: The patient has mild hypernatremia, which is resolving with free water administration. She is receiving D5W IV at 125cc/hr and TF with free water flushes.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) is stable at 25"

   FiO2 70%. Tolerating well with good O2 sat. No further
   self-decanulations overnight.
   -  Tach mask as tolerated.
   -  Holding sedation with exception of Risperidal 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - F/u CXR tomorrow
   .
   # Nutrition/Vomiting:  Currently receiving TPN;. One large BM in past
   24 hrs to indicate potential improvement in ileus.
   - Cont Reglan 20mg IV Q 8 hours; meds via G-J tube,
   - Will obtain recommendations from Nutrition re TPN before starting TPN
   tomorrow
   - TF as tolerated
   - Speech and Swallow eval
   - PICC line in place with TPN given when pt not tolerating TF
   - GI consult, appreciate recs
   .
   # Tachycardia: Improved HR max of 120
s versus 160s previously;
   elevated this am secondary to agitation. Pt now on PO Amiodarone 200
   TID and PO metoprolol 25mg TID
   - Continue current med regimen. Will continue amiodarone 200 TID for
   three weeks and then switch to qday.
   - Will schedule f/u in 4wks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1724**] upon d/c/transfer.
   - f/u Cards recs
   # Sedation/Anxiolysis/AlteredMS: Agitation O/N, continues to be
   agitated most likely secondary to long hospital course and multiple
   psychotropic medications as well as hx of EtOH abuse. Risperdal given
   O/N.
   -  started Risperdal 0.5mg PO BID
   -  continue to hold all benzos. opiates, and antihistamines
   -  Appreciate psych. Will call and f/u psych recs.
   #Anemia: Decrease in HCT from 28
24; tachycardia. No known etiology of
   blood loss, most likely related to variaton
   -Will repeat HCT check this afternoon.
   # Hypernatremia/Fluid Status: Mild hypernatramia with good UOP
   (hypervolemic hypernatremia). On TPN/TF.
   - providing D5W IVF, free water flushes with TF
   -Will f/u lytes (Na) this afternoon at 5pm.
   # UE DVT and elevated INR: Decision made to d/c Coumadin given her
   labile INR, and start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **]. Current INR 1.2.
   - Will flush L PICC with TPA if does not flush
   .
   # Spine fracture: Stable
   - Brace for OOB, need to discuss with Neurosurgery before d/c if
   current brace is optimal for stabilization given her mobility.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy mask, tolerating well with good oxygen saturation. Her respiratory failure has resolved, but she still requires FiO2 50%. She is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has had one large bowel movement in the past 24 hours, indicating potential improvement in ileus. The patient's tachycardia has improved from a maximum heart rate of 160 to 120 beats per minute. She is on oral medications including amiodarone 200 mg twice daily and metoprolol 25 mg three times daily. The patient's sedation and agitation have resolved overnight. She has been prescribed risperidone 0.5 mg orally twice daily for agitation. Anemia and hypernatremia are being monitored, and the patient's fluid status is stable with good urine output. The patient has a history of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and an elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR), for which she is receiving low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox). Her spine fracture is stable, and she is wearing a brace. The patient also has tracheomalacia and a thyroid nodule on CT scan"

   Agree with assessment and plan in MSIV note as detailed above.
   Briefly, 56 F s/p fall with T spine fracture, respiratory failure now
   s/p trach/PEG.  Now on trach mask.  Patient s/p bronch with IP today;
   ENT to see and follow for ?intervention.  Nutrition issues continue;
   will receive TPN today plus possible restart of tube feeds as tolerated
   (later today), continue reglan.  Appreciate psych recs; continuing
   risperidone for agitation. Etiology of delirium/agitation still
   unclear. Likely eventual dispo to rehab facility directly from ICU
   given high nursing requirements.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female who underwent a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has since been intubated, extubated, and placed on a tracheostomy (trach) with a PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy). The patient's respiratory failure has improved, but she remains at risk for aspiration due to an opening defect in the posterior vocal cord space. The patient is currently on a trach mask with 50% FiO2 and tolerating it well. An ENT consultation has been requested for evaluation of the larynx and possible intervention. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) dosing has been increased for aspiration prophylaxis.

Regarding nutrition, the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has had two bowel movements in the past 24 hours, indicating possible improvement in ileus. Tube feeds have been tolerated overnight without emesis. Medications include Reglan 20mg IV Q8 hours, administered through a G-J tube. Nutrition recommendations will be obtained today, and TF (tube feeds) will be provided as tolerated.

The patient's tachycardia has improved, with a maximum heart rate of 120 compared to previous readings of 160. The patient is currently on oral amiodarone 200mg TID and oral metoprolol 37.5mg TID. The current medication regimen will continue, with amiodar"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to tracheobronchomalacia and possible elevated right hemidiaphragm. The patient requires ongoing care, including aspiration precautions, and maintaining a tracheostomy with SaO2 levels above 90%.

2. Vocal cord dysfunction: The patient has an inability of the posterior portion of vocal cords to adduct, which may be causing difficulty in speaking or breathing. An ENT service consultation is recommended to evaluate and address this issue.

3. Right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on anticoagulation therapy with lovenox to prevent further clot formation in the DVT.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient had elevated sodium levels but has shown improvement with free water repletion. Monitoring of the patient's sodium levels is necessary to prevent complications associated with imbalances.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is being rate-controlled on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. Regular monitoring of heart rhythm and cardiac function is required to manage this condition.

6. Delirium: The patient is currently sedated from a procedure and exhibits delirium. The etiology of the delirium is unclear, but concerns include medications and ICU psychosis. Psychiatry has been consulted, and adjustments to the respiratory support dosages are"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube due to chronic respiratory failure. Underlying tracheobronchomalacia and possible elevated right hemidiaphragm may contribute to the respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and maintaining it above 90% is important.

2. Vocal Cord Dysfunction: The patient has an inability of the posterior portion of vocal cords to adduct. This issue should be evaluated by the ENT service.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a right upper extremity DVT, for which anticoagulation with Enoxaparin (Lovenox) has been initiated.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient previously had hypernatremia, which has improved with free water repletion. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is being rate-controlled on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. Monitoring of heart rate is essential.

6. Delirium: The patient remains delirious, and the etiology is unclear. Medications and ICU psychosis are possible causes. Psychiatry has been consulted, and the respiratory dosage is being adjusted.

7. Nutritional Support: The patient requires nutritional support, and there are plans to transition total parenteral nutrition ("

   PGY2 addendum:
   Agree with assessment and plan in MSIV note as detailed above.
   Briefly, 56 F s/p fall with T spine fracture, respiratory failure now
   s/p trach/PEG.  Now on trach mask.  Patient s/p bronch with IP today;
   ENT to see and follow for ?intervention.  Nutrition issues continue;
   will receive TPN today plus possible restart of tube feeds as tolerated
   (later today), continue reglan.  Appreciate psych recs; continuing
   risperidone for agitation. Etiology of delirium/agitation still
   unclear. Likely eventual dispo to rehab facility directly from ICU
   given high nursing requirements.
","The patient is a 56-year-old female who has had a mechanical fall resulting in a traumatic T spine fracture. She has also had respiratory failure and has undergone a tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient continues to be at risk for aspiration due to an opening defect in the posterior vocal cord space, as well as recent history of vomiting with tube feed trials.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 146/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a tracheostomy mask.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and slightly elevated potassium levels. The patient's creatinine and glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient's plan includes continued use of a tracheostomy mask, low-dose sedation with Risperdal as needed, and holding all other sedatives and antihistamines. The patient is also receiving TPN and may restart tube feeds at 20cc/hr. Amiodarone is being administered for tachycardia, and metoprolol will be continued upon discharge. The patient's hypernatremia is resolving with free water administration.

The patient's previous concerns include anemia, hypernatremia/fluid status, upper extremity deep"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU for multiple medical issues. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note.

From the note, it appears that the patient underwent a bronchoscopy and was found to have severe diffuse tracheobronchomalacia with a large gap posterior commissure above the cords, which could be the etiology of recurrent aspiration. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask with FiO2 50% and tolerating well with good O2 saturation. The patient also has a PEG tube in place.

The patient has a history of a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture, and is now s/p trach/PEG with resolving respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is at risk for aspiration due to the new finding of an opening defect in the posterior vocal cord space and recent history of vomiting during tube feed trials. ENT consultation has been obtained for evaluation of the larynx and possible intervention.

The patient's nutrition is being managed with TPN and may receive tube feeds as tolerated. She is also on reglan for gastrointestinal motility. The patient has hypernatremia, which is resolving with free water administration. Her urine output is good.

The patient has a history of tachycardia, for which she is on amiodarone and metoprolol. She has resolved delirium and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female who has experienced multiple medical complications following a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. The patient has had respiratory failure, which led to intubation and subsequent tracheostomy placement. She also has tracheobronchomalacia, an opening defect in the posterior vocal cord space, and has undergone bronchoscopy. The patient is at risk for aspiration and requires close monitoring and suctioning. She is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and may restart tube feeds as tolerated. The patient's sedation/anxiolysis/altered mental status has improved with the use of risperdal. She has a history of ethanol abuse and has been prescribed amiodarone for tachycardia. Her hypernatremia is resolving with free water administration, and she has mild anemia with a hematocrit level of 23.7%. The patient has been diagnosed with a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her upper extremities and has a history of labile INR. She has been started on Lovenox and will have daily coagulation assessments. The patient's spine fracture is stable, and she will follow up with neurosurgery for further evaluation and potential brace optimization. She has a thyroid nodule on CT that will require outpatient follow-up. Her glycemic control is well-managed. The patient's code status is full, and her disposition is to remain in the"

   PGY2 addendum:
   Agree with assessment and plan in MSIV note as detailed above.
   Briefly, 56 F s/p fall with T spine fracture, respiratory failure now
   s/p trach/PEG.  Now on trach mask.  Patient s/p bronch with IP today;
   ENT to see and follow for ?intervention.  Nutrition issues continue;
   will receive TPN today plus possible restart of tube feeds as tolerated
   (later today), continue reglan.  Appreciate psych recs; continuing
   risperidone for agitation. Etiology of delirium/agitation still
   unclear. Likely eventual dispo to rehab facility directly from ICU
   given high nursing requirements.
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical issues. She underwent a bronchoscopic examination, which revealed severe diffuse tracheobronchomalacia and a large gap in the posterior commissure above the true vocal cords. This finding suggests a possible etiology of recurrent aspiration. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask and is tolerating it well with good oxygen saturation. She requires PMV (possibly tracheostomy mask ventilation) precautions and should only be extubated with close supervision.

The patient's recent history includes a mechanical fall leading to a traumatic T-spine fracture, resolving respiratory failure, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. She also underwent a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedure.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to the tracheobronchomalacia and recent vomiting during tube feed trials. She should continue to be monitored closely, and ENT recommendations should be followed.
2. Feeding: The patient is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and had previously attempted tube feeds, which resulted in vomiting. It is recommended to restart TF (tube feeds) at a slow rate and monitor for any complications.
3. Sedation/Anxiolysis/Altered Mental Status: The patient's delirium and agitation have resolved, possibly due to the use of risperidone. Risper"

   Assessment and Plan
   Delerium.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- chronic, persistent.  Tracheotomy tube in place,
   with tach collar/mask.  Use Passe-Muir valve as tolerated.
   INCREASED SPUTUM production -- concern for evolving LLL pneumonia.
   Monitor closely.  COntinue frequent suctioning.
   T-SPINE Fx -- Back brace.  Up in chair as tolerated.  Ortho to F/U.
   TRACHEOBRONCHOMALAcIA -- no immediate plans for intervention at this
   time.
   VOCAL CORD DYSFUNCTION -- poor adduction of posterior portions of vocal
   cords --> ENT to further assess.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF via PEG at low rate.  ALso receiving TPN.
   DELERIUM -- likely due to medications and ICU.  Possible contribution
   of EtOH withdraw/DT.   Improved on Respiradol.

   Total time spent: 55 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, as indicated by the need for an endotracheal tube and tracheotomy. The patient is also experiencing increased sputum production, which may indicate evolving lower left lobe pneumonia. The patient has a history of T-spine fracture and is using a back brace for support. Tracheobronchomalacia is present but no immediate intervention is planned. Vocal cord dysfunction has been observed, with poor adduction of the posterior vocal cords, and an ENT evaluation is recommended. The patient is receiving nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and tube feeding via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Delirium is suspected to be caused by medications and ICU stay, possibly exacerbated by ethanol withdrawal/DT. The patient has been receiving respiratory support and is on low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. A rehabilitation evaluation is planned for transfer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure poses a significant risk. Monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters should be closely monitored, and adjustments to ventilator settings may be necessary.
2. Evolving Lower Left Lobe Pneumonia: The increased sputum production suggests the possibility of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and worsening oxygenation, is essential."

   Assessment and Plan
   Delerium.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- chronic, persistent.  Tracheotomy tube in place,
   with tach collar/mask.  Use Passe-Muir valve as tolerated.
   INCREASED SPUTUM production -- concern for evolving LLL pneumonia.
   Monitor closely.  COntinue frequent suctioning.
   T-SPINE Fx -- Back brace.  Up in chair as tolerated.  Ortho to F/U.
   TRACHEOBRONCHOMALAcIA -- no immediate plans for intervention at this
   time.
   VOCAL CORD DYSFUNCTION -- poor adduction of posterior portions of vocal
   cords --> ENT to further assess.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF via PEG at low rate.  ALso receiving TPN.
   DELERIUM -- likely due to medications and ICU.  Possible contribution
   Improved on Respiradol.
   DVT -- lovenox

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they have undergone a bronchoscopy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 122/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool O2 delivery device.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), enoxaparin (Lovenox), and other ICU medications. They are also receiving tube feeds via PEG at a low rate and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids.

The patient has a tracheotomy tube in place and is being monitored closely for increased sputum production, which may indicate evolving left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient's vocal cord dysfunction is also being assessed by ENT, and there are no immediate plans for intervention for tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient's nutritional support includes repletion with fiber and TPN with lipids. The patient is also receiving prophylactic measures such as DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention with head of bed elevation and mouth care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, pneumonia, further deterioration of vocal cord dysfunction, and potential complications from long-term tube feeding.

The patient's overall condition remains critical"

s. Pt continues to be
   at risk for aspiration given recent history of vomiting with tube feed
   trials and increased secretions. ENT believes that the posterior gap is
   not a risk factor for aspiration as this is a common finding in females

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female who experienced a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She was transferred to the hospital for evaluation, but her hospitalization was complicated by respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She also had episodes of atrial tachycardia, ileus, and delirium/agitation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to increased secretions and edema. She is currently on a tracheostomy mask with supplemental oxygen. The posterior gap is not considered a risk factor for aspiration. The ENT recommends following up with Dr. [Last Name (STitle)] in two weeks.
2. Delirium: The patient continues to be slightly agitated with paranoia and disorientation. Delirium and agitation are likely secondary to the long hospital course and multiple psychotropic medications, as well as a history of EtOH abuse. Risperdal 0.25mg PO qam is prescribed, and all benzos, opiates, and antihistamines are being held. Raglan and scopolamine will be decreased or discontinued.
3. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate increased to a maximum of 120 beats per minute. She is currently on PO amiodarone 200 TID and PO increased metop"

   Tolerating well with good O2 sat in mid-high 90
s. Pt continues to be
   at risk for aspiration given recent history of vomiting with tube feed
   trials and increased secretions. ENT believes that the posterior gap is
   not a risk factor for aspiration as this is a common finding in females
   and that her increased secretions and edema pose a greater aspiration
   threat; no intervention was recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU after a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She has a history of respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. She is currently on a tracheostomy mask with FiO2 50% and tolerating it well.

The patient's recent events include an increase in tube feed goals from 30cc to 60cc/hr without any issues related to vomiting. The dose of Risperdal was decreased from 0.5mg to 0.25mg qam. The patient experienced three runs of asymptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), peaking at 110-120 beats per minute. Metoprolol was increased from TID to QID and the first daily dose was given early after the runs, which resulted in a decrease in heart rate to 80 bpm.

The patient also had loose, brown, malodorous stools overnight. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) cultures were sent. The patient is allergic to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa (sulfonamides). Her last dose of antibiotics was an infusion of enoxaparin (Lovenox).

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37°C (98."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-inch tall, 106 kg individual admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa (sulfonamides). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5 C (97.7 F), heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/54 mmHg to 167/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently 106 kg, with a decrease from admission weight of 94.2 kg. The patient received tube feed goals increase, and there were three runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with peak heart rates reaching 110s.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels ranging from 7.3 to 8.7 K/uL, decreased hematocrit (Hct) levels ranging from 23.7% to 28.7, and platelet (Plt) levels ranging from 203 to 346. Creatinine (Cr) levels have been stable at 0.5 mg/dL, and glucose levels have fluctuated between 105 mg/dL and 149 mg/dL. Other lab values include normal potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) levels. The patient's blood gases indicate a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 108 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 35 mmHg. 

The patient has received infusions of enoxaparin (Lovenox) and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the recent events mentioned. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,952 mL with outputs totaling 2,430 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 522 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through aerosol-cool oxygen delivery and has an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's peripheral vascular pulses and skin were not assessed. Neurological assessment is also incomplete.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The elevated WBC count suggests a possible infection. However, further evaluation is needed to determine the source and severity of the infection.
2. Fluid imbalance: The positive fluid balance indicates that the patient may be retaining fluids, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The fluctuating platelet levels indicate a possible decrease in platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: Although"

   Assessment and Plan
   56yoF s/p mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 **] for TBM eval with hospitalization complicated by
   respiratory failure and HAP, s/p trach/PEG, atrial tachycardia, ileus,
   and delirium/agitation.
   .
   # Respiratory:  s/p intubation/extubation, now on trach mask, FiO2 50%.
   Tolerating well with good O2 sat in mid-high 90
s. Pt continues to be
   at risk for aspiration given recent history of vomiting with tube feed
   trials and increased secretions. ENT believes that the posterior gap is
   not a risk factor for aspiration as this is a common finding in females
   and that her increased secretions and edema pose a greater aspiration
   threat; no intervention was recommended.
   - Appreciate ENT and S&S input.
   - ENT recs to f/u in 2wks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1779**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1820**]) for an
   outpatient/clinic re-evaluation.
   - ppi [**Hospital1 **] for aspiration prophylaxis, PMV precautions: [**Male First Name (un) **]
t use w/o
   supervision, frequent suctioning
   - TM as tolerated.
   - d/c
ed scopolamine as it was a cause for delirium.
   - Holding sedation with exception of Risperidal 0.25mg qam PRN
   # Delirium/Anxiolysis/AlteredMS: Resolving although pt continues to be
   slightly agitated. Previous delirium and agitation most likely
   secondary to long hospital course and multiple psychotropic medications
   as well as hx of EtOH abuse.
   -  Risperdal 0.25mg PO qam.
   -  continue to hold all benzos. opiates, and antihistamines. Will
   decrease or d/c raglan and scopolamine.
   -  Appreciate psych. Will call and f/u psych recs.
   -Follow EKG to assess for QTc prolongation (last EKG [**10-27**]; QTc 457).
   #Loose Stools: Multiple, loose stools O/N; afebrile, tachycardia,
   without abdominal pain
   -F/u stool c.dif cultures
   -f/u WBC and vital signs daily
   -Hold bowel regimen
   # Atrial Tachycardia: Compared to recent b/l, HR increased to max of
   120
s. Pt now on PO Amiodarone 200 TID and PO increased metoprolol
   37.5mg QID.
   - Will continue amiodarone 200 TID for three weeks and then switch to
   qday for 1week and then d/c amiodarone.
   - Will need to schedule f/u in 4wks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1724**] upon d/c/transfer.
   #Anemia: HCT low compared to b/l. No known etiology of blood loss.
   -Will continue to follow HCT daily.
   - Guaiac stools.
   # Hypernatremia/Fluid Status: Mild hypernatramia resolving with free
   water administration. On TPN/TF. Good UOP. Free water deficit of 2.8L
   - increase D5W IVFx 1L from 10cc/hr to 150cc/hr, free water flushes
   with TF
   -Will f/u lytes in afternoon (5pm)
   # UE DVT and h/o labile INR: Decision made to d/c Coumadin given her
   labile INR, and start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **].  INR at 1.1
   -          Will flush L PICC with TPA if does not flush
   -          Daily coags
   .
   # Spine fracture: Stable. T5-T8.
   - Brace for OOB.
   - Pt to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1252**] in [**Month (only) 1780**].
   .
   # Tracheomalacia.  Reevaluation bronchoscopy by IP as written above;
   patient not a candidate for stent; pt to follow up as outpatient. No
   new issues.
   .
   #. Thyroid Nodule on CT
   - Outpatient follow up
   .
   # Glycemic control: SSI, well controlled
   # FEN:  Currently receiving TF at 50cc/hr, w/o issue.
   - Appreciate GI input and S&S eval
   -D/c Reglan for emesis precaution as pt is tolerating TF without
   vomiting and Reglan increases agitation/delirium risk.

   above.  Briefly, 56 F s/p fall with T spine fracture (T5-T8),
   respiratory failure now s/p trach/PEG.  Now on trach mask.  Patient s/p
   bronch with IP yesterday.  Nutrition issues continue; have discontinued
   TPN today and will continue tubefeeding to goal of 60cc/hr per
   Nutrition.  Will continue reglan until at goal feedings, and decrease
   and d/c as able given potential for delirium.  Appreciate psych recs;
   continuing risperidone for agitation. Etiology of delirium/agitation
   still unclear but likely [**2-14**] prolonged hospital course, illness and
   multiple medications.  Currently discussing with CM about potential
   placement to rehab tomorrow.
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She has since developed respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and is now being treated for atrial tachycardia, ileus, and delirium. The patient is currently on a tracheal mask, tolerating tube feeds well, but at risk for aspiration. Her recent medical history includes EtOH abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: Due to the patient's increased secretions, edema, and history of vomiting with tube feed trials, she is at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
2. Delirium: The patient continues to experience agitation and delirium, likely secondary to a prolonged hospital course, multiple psychotropic medications, and history of EtOH abuse.
3. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has been diagnosed with atrial tachycardia, which requires close monitoring and management with medications such as amiodarone and metoprolol.
4. Loose Stools: The patient has developed multiple loose stools overnight, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection has been suspected. Stool cultures are pending, and the patient's white blood cell count and vital signs will be followed daily.
5. Anemia: The patient's hem"

","The patient is a 56-year-old female who is currently admitted to the ICU for several reasons. She has a history of a mechanical fall and a traumatic T-spine fracture with resolving respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She also underwent a tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient has been intubated and extubated, and now she is on a tracheostomy mask with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. She tolerates the oxygen well, but she is at risk for aspiration due to a new finding of an opening defect in the posterior vocal cord space and recent history of vomiting during tube feed trials. The healthcare team is waiting for ENT and S&S input for possible intervention.

The patient is on prophylactic medication for aspiration, including a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and a medication called TM as tolerated. She also has a scopolamine patch every 72 hours for secretions and is being held on sedation with the exception of risperidal 0.5 mg PO BID PRN. The patient's altered mental status (delirium and agitation) is likely secondary to a long hospital course and multiple psychotropic medications, as well as a history of EtOH abuse.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female who has had a mechanical fall and a traumatic T-spine fracture. She was transferred to the hospital for traumatic brain management evaluation and has since experienced respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She also had atrial tachycardia, ileus, and delirium with agitation. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask with FiO2 50% and tolerating it well. However, she is still at risk for aspiration due to increased secretions and edema. The posterior gap is not considered a risk factor for aspiration. The patient's recent history of vomiting during tube feed trials and increased secretions pose a greater aspiration threat. No intervention was recommended by ENT.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to increased secretions and edema. She is on a tracheostomy mask with FiO2 50% and tolerating it well.
2.

   respiratory failure now s/p trach/PEG.  Now on trach mask.  Patient s/p
   bronch with IP yesterday.  Nutrition issues continue; have discontinued
   TPN today and will continue tubefeeding to goal of 60cc/hr per
   Nutrition.  Will continue reglan until at goal feedings, and decrease
   and d/c as able given potential for delirium.  Appreciate psych recs;
   continuing risperidone for agitation. Etiology of delirium/agitation
   still unclear but likely [**2-14**] prolonged hospital course, illness and
   multiple medications.  Currently discussing with CM about potential
   placement to rehab tomorrow.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female who has had a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She also has a history of respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She is currently intubated but now on a tracheostomy mask, tolerating well with good oxygen saturation in the mid-high 90s.

The patient continues to be at risk for aspiration due to a new finding of an opening defect in the posterior vocal cord space and recent history of vomiting with tube feed trials. The physician plans to follow ENT recommendations and is awaiting input for possible intervention. The patient is also on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for aspiration prophylaxis, and she will continue to have passive motion (TM) as tolerated.

The patient's atrial tachycardia was compared to recent bilateral (bilateral) readings, with a maximum heart rate of 120 beats per minute. She is now on oral amiodarone 200 mg three times a day (TID) and increased metoprolol 37.5 mg four times a day (QID). The plan is to continue amiodarone for three weeks and then switch to once a day (qday) for one week before discontinuing it. An appointment will be scheduled in four weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (Title)"

   Assessment and Plan
   T-spine fracture, delerium.
   DELERIUM -- persistent.  Etiology may be related to prior EtOH use,
   contribution of medications.  Intermittently oriented.  Continue
   respiradol.   Avoid medications that have psych complications or side
   effects.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- s/p trach.  Maintain trach for pulmonary
   toilet/frequent suctioning.
   TACHYCARDIA -- SVT.  Continue amiodarone.  Continue beta-blocker, with
   extra doses prn if needed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF via PEJ approaching goal.
   T-SPINE FRACTURE -- s/p fall.  Tolerating back brace as per ortho
   service.  Activity as tolerated (up in chair).
   ASPIRATION RISK -- poor adduction of vocal cords (post. portion).
   Eventually may require intervention.
   TRANCHEOBRONCHOMALACIA -- no interventions planned at present.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of delirium. They have experienced episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and are currently on respiratory support. The patient has a t-spine fracture from a fall and is tolerating a back brace as per the orthopedic service. There is an aspiration risk due to poor adduction of vocal cords, and they may require intervention in the future. The patient also has tracheobronchomalacia but no interventions are planned at present. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs and fluid balance are within normal limits. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, but all other values are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium: The patient's persistent delirium can lead to complications such as increased risk of falls, pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary complications.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications related to the tracheostomy or if weaning from mechanical ventilation fails.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's SVT could progress to a more serious arrhythmia if not properly managed.

4. T-spine Fracture: The patient's t"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU after experiencing a mechanical fall and traumatic T-spine fracture. She underwent evaluation for tracheobronchomalacia and had a tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. The patient also had respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and was started on mechanical ventilation. She is currently agitated, delirious, and disoriented, with paranoia and hallucinations. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 128/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's HCT level is decreasing, indicating anemia. There are no signs of infection or blood loss, so further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she is still at risk for aspiration due to increased secretions and edema. The ENT team does not recommend any intervention for tracheomalacia. The patient's atrial tachycardia is stable, and she is on amiodarone and metoprolol for management. Her sodium levels are resolving after free water administration. The decision was made to discontinue Coumadin due to a labile INR and start Lovenox. The patient has a stable spine fracture and will require brace immobilization. She will follow up with a spine specialist for further evaluation. The"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 56-year-old female who underwent a mechanical fall and suffered a traumatic T-spine fracture. She was transferred to the hospital for further evaluation, but her hospitalization was complicated by respiratory failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She subsequently underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, developed atrial tachycardia, ileus, and delirium with agitation.

The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask with FiO2 at 50% and tolerating it well with good oxygen saturation in the mid-90s. She is at risk for aspiration due to increased secretions and edema, although the posterior gap is not considered a risk factor. ENT recommended no intervention and scheduled a follow-up in two weeks.

The patient is also experiencing loose stools overnight, with no fever, tachycardia, or abdominal pain. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) have been ordered, and vital signs and white blood cell count will be monitored daily. The bowel regimen has been held.

Atrial tachycardia is present, with a maximum heart rate of 120 beats per minute. The patient is on oral amiodarone 200mg three times a day and increased metoprolol 37.5mg every four hours."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a chief complaint of vocal cord adductor dysfunction. She has been admitted to the ICU and has experienced several events over the past 24 hours. The ENT team believes that the vocal cord dysfunction is not a risk for aspiration but rather her increased secretions put her at risk for aspiration. They plan to follow up with the patient in two weeks.

Psychiatry recommendations include considering a head CT if the patient does not improve off scopolamine and metoclopramide, addressing anemia and erratic blood pressure, and increasing the dose of risperdal. Monitoring of [**Name (NI) 818**] is also mentioned.

The patient's allergies include penicillins, rash; blisters; tetracycline, rash; and sulfa (sulfonamides), rash. The last dose of antibiotics received by the patient was on [**2167-10-29**] at 08:00 PM.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data as of [**2167-10-30**] 05:28 AM shows vital signs including temperature (Tmax: 36.6°C), heart rate (HR: 77 bpm), blood pressure (BP: 128/40 mmHg), respiratory rate (RR: 23 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation (SpO2: 100%). The patient's weight is currently 106 kg, with a height of 67 inches. Fluid balance shows a total in of 1,726 mL, with 595 mL going through the nasogastric tube, 1,388 mL through the feeding tube, and 249 mL through the intravenous fluids. Total output is 1,666 mL, including 836 mL of urine.

   from OSH to [**Hospital1 **] for TBM eval with hospitalization complicated by
   respiratory failure and HAP, s/p trach/PEG, atrial tachycardia, ileus,
   and delirium/agitation.
   .
   # Delirium: Pt continues to be agitated with paranoia and
   disorientation with paranoia and hallucinations. Delirium and agitation
   most likely secondary to long hospital course and multiple psychotropic
   medications as well as hx of EtOH abuse; yet could also be due to
   anemia. Other lab values (lytes, past LFTs within normal limits). CT of
   head at OSH negative. d/c
ed Reglan and scopolamine.
   -  Consider CT of head with contrast if mental status does not improve
   this am.
   -  U/A
   -  Risperdal 0.25mg PO qam. Consider increasing per psych recs to 0.5mg
   if continues to be agitated.

   # Respiratory:  s/p trach on trach mask, FiO2 50%. Tolerating well with
   good O2 sat in mid-high 90
s. Pt continues to be at risk for aspiration
   given recent history of vomiting with tube feed trials and increased
   secretions. ENT believes that the posterior gap is not a risk factor
   for aspiration as this is a common finding in females and that her
   increased secretions and edema pose a greater aspiration threat; no
   intervention was recommended.
   - Appreciate ENT and S&S input.
   - ENT recs to f/u in 2wks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1779**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1820**]) for an

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital for a traumatic T spine fracture and subsequently developed respiratory failure, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), tracheostomy (trach), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), atrial tachycardia, ileus, and delirium. She has a history of mechanical fall, EtOH abuse, and multiple psychotropic medications. The patient's current condition includes agitation, paranoia, disorientation, hallucinations, anemia, mild hypernatremia, risk for aspiration, tracheomalacia, thyroid nodule, and a T5-T8 spine fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient continues to be agitated, paranoid, disoriented, and hallucinating. This could be secondary to the long hospital course, multiple psychotropic medications, or EtOH abuse.
2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) is decreasing, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate replacement. No known etiology of blood loss has been identified.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to increased secretions and edema. She also has tracheomalacia and a history of respiratory failure.
4. Hypernatremia/Fluid Status: The patient has mild hypernatremia that is resolving with free water administration. There is a need to monitor electrolyte levels and ensure adequate hydration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with an unspecified chief complaint. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa (sulfonamides). The patient is currently receiving infusions of enoxaparin (Lovenox) and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/63 to 186/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's weight is currently 106 kg, with a height of 67 inches. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,197 mL and total output of 867 mL.

Physical examination findings include normal peripheral pulses, skin not assessed, and neurologic status not assessed. Laboratory results indicate slightly elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. Other lab results show normal levels of creatinine, glucose, and cardiac markers.

Assessment and plan:
The patient is being managed with ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is not mentioned.

Potential medical complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The slightly elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant intake-output discrepancy, which could lead to fluid overload or dehydration.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's lab results indicate imbalances in sodium, potassium, and chloride levels, which may require close monitoring and correction.
4. Thrombosis: The patient is receiving enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis, indicating a risk of blood clot formation.
5. Poor nutritional status: The patient's weight and lack of specific dietary information suggest a potential need for nutritional support.
6. Neurological impairment: The patient's neurologic status was not assessed during the physical examination, indicating a potential risk for neurological complications.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further assessment and evaluation by a healthcare professional are necessary to determine the patient's actual condition and potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   56yoF s/p mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 **] for TBM eval with hospitalization complicated by
   respiratory failure and HAP, s/p trach/PEG, atrial tachycardia, ileus,
   and delirium/agitation.
   .
   # Delirium: Pt continues to be agitated with paranoia, disorientation
   and hallucinations. Most likely secondary to long hospital course and
   recent multiple psychotropic medications. Other lab values (lytes, past
   LFTs within normal limits), infections processes negative on culture.
   CT of head at OSH negative. d/c
ed Reglan and scopolamine.
   - Appreciate psych. Will call and f/u psych recs.
   -Consider CT of head with contrast if mental status does not improve
   this am.
   -  Risperdal 0.25mg PO qam. Consider increasing per psych recs to 0.5mg
   if continues to be agitated. Will d/w psych re any additional meds we
   could use for night time agitation.
   -  continue to hold all benzos. opiates, and antihistamines.
   -Follow EKG to assess for QTc prolongation (last EKG [**10-27**]; QTc 457).
   #Anemia: HCT continues to decrease, currently at 22.8 from 23.7 with
   b/l in high 20
s. No known etiology of blood loss.
   -Will continue to follow HCT
   - Guaiac stools.
   # Respiratory:  s/p trach on trach mask, FiO2 50%. Tolerating well with
   good O2 sat in mid-high 90
s. Pt continues to be at risk for aspiration
   given recent history of vomiting with tube feed trials and increased
   secretions. ENT believes that the posterior gap is not a risk factor
   for aspiration as this is a common finding in females and that her
   increased secretions and edema pose a greater aspiration threat; no
   intervention was recommended.
   - Appreciate ENT and S&S input.
   - Pt to f/u on [**11-10**]^th  at 3:30pm with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1779**]

   - Will continue amiodarone 200 TID for three weeks (start [**10-22**]) and
   then switch to qday for 1week and then d/c amiodarone.
   - Will need to schedule f/u in 4wks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1724**] upon d/c/transfer.
   # Hypernatremia/Fluid Status:  resolving after free water
   administration. On TPN/TF. Free water deficit of 1.6L
   - increase NS at 10cc/hr, water flushes with TF
   -Will f/u lytes [**Doctor First Name 600**]
   # UE DVT and h/o labile INR: Decision made to d/c Coumadin given her
   labile INR, and start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **].  INR at 1.1

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for a mechanical fall and traumatic T spine fracture. She underwent tracheostomy and gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and was diagnosed with respiratory failure, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), atrial tachycardia, ileus, and delirium. The patient's medical history includes a thyroid nodule, DVT, labile INR, and anemia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, and her vital signs are stable. The patient's recent lab results show normal WBC count, Hct levels, electrolytes, and liver function tests, but slightly elevated creatinine, blood glucose, and LDH levels. The patient's mental status remains agitated with paranoia, disorientation, and hallucinations, and she is being treated with risperidone. Other ongoing concerns include anemia, respiratory status, potential aspiration, loose stools, atrial tachycardia, hypernatremia, and a history of labile INR. The patient is also scheduled for a follow-up with various specialists.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's increased secretions and edema pose a greater risk for aspiration, especially since she is on mechanical ventilation.
2. Delirium: The patient continues to exhibit symptoms of delirium, including agitation, paranoia, disorientation, and hallucinations.
