   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Dr. [**Known lastname 976**] is a 84 y/o with a h/o of suspected renal cell ca, L eye
   melenoma s/p enucleation, and recent dx of GBM s/p temozolomide
   chemo-irradiation on [**2183-11-18**], bevacizumab on [**2183-11-24**] who was admitted
   on [**11-27**] from onc clinic with gait instability, dyspahagia, diarrhea,
   and left sided weakness now being transferred to the ICU with declining
   mental status and worsening hyponatremia.
   .
   #. GBM: Presenting with evidence of frontal lobe dysfunction, magnetic
   gait and slowed speech, and worsening left sided weakness now with
   progressive decline in responsiveness this pm while on the floor.
   Neurologic decline concerning in the setting of XRT and may be result
   of increasing brain edema; now s/p increase in IV decadron dose.  [**11-27**]
   MRI also showed new findings in right lateral ventricle concerning for
   infectious process and given facial skin lesions, he has been receiving
   empiric acyclovir.
   -increased ICP precautions, head bed > 30 degrees
   -q1h neuro checks
   -zofran prn
   -autoreg bp
   -continue IV decadron at higher dose of 6mg IV q6h as per neuro onc
   attending
   -continue seizure prophylaxis with keppra
   -will continue temozolomide currently with further discussion with onc
   in am
   -appreciate palliative care involvement and recommendations
   .
   #. Mental status decline:  Differential includes edema [**3-1**] XRT,
   infectious encephalopathy (specifically herpes), hyponatremia,
   infection, medication induced.   Does appear to be more hypertensive
   than previously with SBPs 160s; not bradycardic
concerning for
   increasing ICP.  He has been afebrile (although on decadron and had low
   grade temp to 99.8 this pm).  He does have leukocytosis stable since
   [**11-19**] (noted prior to this admission while on decadron as outpatient).
   No clear localizing sx of infection beyond diarrhea and dMS although
   most recent CXR with perhaps slight hazy opacity RML which may
   represent developing infiltrate vs. atelectasis alone.  Bacterial CNS
   infections also possible, but seem less likely given known GBM and
   herpetic facial lesions.  Subclinical seizures possible, however less
   likely given EEG [**11-28**] demonstrating encephalopathy without clear
   epileptoform activity.  Although he is hyponatremic, seems unlikely
   causing acute decline in his mental status as it appears sodium has
   drifted down less acutely prior to this admission (139 on [**11-8**]-->130
   on [**11-24**]-->126 on [**11-28**].  He has been receiving ativan for hiccups, but
   it appears that he had tolerated this well PTA without significant
   decline in mental status.
   -repeat head CT now
   -hold ativan for now; will restart if uncomfortable with hiccups as
   this reportedly was helping
   -continue management for GBM as above, specifically with increased dose
   of decadron IV
   -management of hyponatremia as outlined below
   -continue empiric acyclovir
   -consider ctx/vanco empirically given bx; although lower suspicion
   given peri-bx abx and bx performed [**11-5**] so seems far out
   -f/u cultures including urine, blood, stool given diarrhea
   -can repeat CXR if resp status declines, fever, rising WBC count to
   eval for blossoming right sided pneumonia
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: By history and on exam, would suggest hypovolemic
   hyponatremia in setting of poor PO (now NPO) and diarrhea.  However,
   given active intracranial process and urine lytes (Uosm 879, UNa 85),
   appears more c/w SIADH.
   -Continue hypertonic saline as per renal
   -will follow lytes q2-4 and adjuest hypertonic saline as appropriate
   with goal correction to 138 over next 24 hours
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Unclear when exactly decadron started as outpatient
   (? [**11-14**]), however WBC count was normal on [**11-8**] and no WBC count
   checked until [**11-24**] at which time WBC was elevated.  Thus, may be
   secondary to steroids alone.  In the setting of diarrhea and recent
   hospitalization mid [**Month (only) 1148**], c. diff is possible.  Diarrhea, however,
   may be result of poor PO and temozolomide and unrelated to elevated WBC
   count.
   -continue to monitor
   -empiric acyclovir
   -pan culturing
   -awaiting c. diff; if diarrhea persists will start empiric
   metronidazole
   .
   #. Hyperglycemia:  Predates this admission and likely at least impaired
   glucose tolerance.  Now elevated in the setting of steroids.
   -continue ISS
   .
   #. Diarrhea:  Duration unclear, worrisome for c.diff given recent
   admission and abx.
   -sending stool studies, c. diff
   .
   #. Anemia:  Low grade anemia beginning with diagnosis of GBM and
   suspect likely AOCD.  Normal MCV and RDW.  No iron studies in our
   system.  B12 low (not on supplementation?), folate normal.
   - guaiac stools
   - checking iron studies
   .
   #. Facial lesions: Likely herpetic, has been on acyclovir
   -continue acyclovir
   .
   #. Hiccups: Currently stable and given declining mental status, will
   hold ativan for now and reinstitute prn.
   .
   #. PPX: On SC heparin tid.  PPI while on steroids and given CNS
   malignancy.
   #. FEN: Free water fluid restriction of 1500cc, NPO, aspiration risk
   witnessed choking on water.  Holding TFs currently d/t worsened hiccups
   and residuals on the floor.
   -reassess residuals in am
   .
   #. Code: DNR/DNI.  Will continue ongoing discussions with family and
   palliative care if clinically status continues to decline.
   # Contact: wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3194**], Dtr [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3195**], son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3196**].

The patient is an 84-year-old individual with a recent diagnosis of GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) and declining mental status. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for possible meningitis with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir. Empiric treatment for Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) has also been initiated due to a high white blood cell count and loose stool. A lumbar puncture (LP) was not performed as it would not change the treatment plan.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/72 to 160/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on room air and receiving oxygen through an aerosol-cool device. The patient's general appearance is described as unresponsive and thin. Surgical pupils are noted, and the patient has irregular heart sounds with crackles at the bases of the lungs.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of WBC (white blood cell count), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelets (Plt), along with slightly elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and glucose. The patient's electrolytes are within normal ranges, except for a slightly low potassium level.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old with a recent diagnosis of GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) who has been admitted to the ICU with declining mental status. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Mental Status Decline: The etiology of the patient's mental status decline is unclear, but it is most likely secondary to GBM. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected meningitis and has been empirically treated for Clostridium difficile infection due to high white blood cell count and loose stools. A lumbar puncture was not performed since it would not change the treatment plan.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient had hyponatremia, which has now been resolved. Hypertonic saline was discontinued.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which is likely due to the use of steroids for GBM treatment. The patient will continue to receive insulin sliding scale with adjustments for better fasting blood sugar control.

4. Anemia: The patient has a low-grade anemia that started with the diagnosis of GBM. It is suspected to be associated with anemia of chronic disease (AOCD). The patient's mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and red cell distribution width (RDW) are normal, but vitamin B12 levels are low (not on supplementation). Folate levels are normal.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of suspected renal cell carcinoma, left eye melanoma, and recent diagnosis of GBM who was admitted from the oncology clinic with gait instability, dysphagia, diarrhea, and left-sided weakness. The patient is now being transferred to the ICU with declining mental status and worsening hyponatremia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 119/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool delivery device. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin build, surgical pupils, normocephalic head, no endotracheal tube or NG tube, asymmetric crackles at the bases of the lungs, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin without rash, and unresponsive neurologic status with no movement or tone assessed. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.9 K/uL, elevated glucose levels, increased platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. The patient's renal function tests indicate a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, while liver function tests show slightly elevated ALT and AST levels. 

The patient's medical history includes suspected renal cell carcinoma, left eye melanoma, and recent diagnosis of GBM for which he has been undergoing chemotherapy and irradiation. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including metoprolol, pantoprazole, flagyl, and others for various conditions such as atrial fibrillation, potential aspiration, and seizure prophylaxis.

The patient's current issues include mental status decline, GBM, hyponatremia, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, anemia, facial lesions, and hiccups. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the family has declined palliative care at this time.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's mental status, development of further electrolyte imbalances, progression of GBM with associated symptoms like increased intracranial pressure, infections due to immunosuppression from chemotherapy, and complications related to the patient's comorbidities such as renal cell carcinoma and melanoma."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions and complications. They are currently in the ICU and have been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which is being rate-controlled with lopressor. The patient also has altered mental status, likely due to various factors, and is receiving empiric antibiotics for a possible infection. The patient has a history of GBM (likely glioblastoma multiforme) and was scheduled for radiation therapy, but it is currently on hold. Additionally, the patient is experiencing diarrhea and is being treated with metronidazole, with plans to test for Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated heart rate. Fluid balance and respiratory support are being monitored. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and DNI (do not intubate), indicating their preference not to undergo CPR or be placed on a ventilator. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, some potential medical complications that could arise for this patient include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and ongoing use of lopressor, there is a risk of developing further cardiac arrhythmias.

2. Infection: The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics, suggesting a concern for infection. If the antibiotics are not effective or if the patient develops resistance, it could lead to a worsening infection and potentially"

   I met with Dr. [**Known lastname 976**]
s son [**Name (NI) 129**] as he returned from [**State 3283**] this
   afternoon.  We discussed that antibiotics had been discontinued this
   morning given negative cultures and the low likelihood that his
   unrepsonsiveness is due to a systemic infection or bacterial
   meningitis.  The decision was made earlier in the course to not pursue
   an LP.  We discussed that continuing the acyclovir for herpes
   meningitis is not unreasonable even though the likelihood of this is
   small. Continues maintenance fluids.  He has remained comfortable from
   a respiratory standpoint  on morphine.  Family aware of poor prognosis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old individual with a recent diagnosis of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), presenting with declining mental status. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, unresponsiveness to stimuli, and the need for comfort measures only. Antibiotics have been discontinued due to negative cultures, and morphine has been initiated for respiratory distress. The family is aware of the patient's poor prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and unresponsiveness to stimuli may lead to respiratory failure if adequate ventilation is not maintained. Continuous monitoring of respiratory function and appropriate interventions, such as mechanical ventilation if necessary, should be considered.
2. Infection: Although antibiotics have been discontinued due to negative cultures, there is still a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections or opportunistic infections due to the patient's immunocompromised state. Frequent assessment of vital signs, wound care, and proper hand hygiene can help reduce the risk of infection.
3. Meningitis: Although the likelihood is small, the patient is still being treated with acyclovir for herpes meningitis. Regular monitoring for signs and symptoms of meningitis, including neck stiffness, headache, fever, and altered mental status, is essential.
4. Hydration and Nutrition: Maintenance fluids are being administered to ensure proper hydration. However, the patient's nutritional needs should also be considered, especially if they are unable to tolerate oral intake. Nutritional"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old with a recent diagnosis of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) and declining mental status. They are currently in the ICU for suspected meningitis, but the etiology of the mental status decline remains unclear. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and empiric treatment for Clostridium difficile. The decision was made not to perform a lumbar puncture as it would not change the treatment plan. The patient's hyponatremia has resolved, and they are scheduled for brain radiation therapy today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Carcinomatous meningitis: There is a potential for GBM to spread to the meninges, which could result in carcinomatous meningitis. However, the decision was made not to tap the patient, indicating that no intervention is planned at this time.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient is on Flagyl for coverage of possible aspiration during altered mental status. This suggests a concern for the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of impaired glucose tolerance and elevated blood glucose levels in the setting of steroids. This may require close monitoring and management.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low-grade anemia beginning with the diagnosis of GBM, suspecting likely AOCD. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.
5. Herpetic lesions: The facial lesions are questioned as herpetic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on several medications including vancomycin, metronidazole, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, ampicillin, and pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 160/65-93/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool delivery device. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an appropriate fluid balance. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has a normal ABG result.

Physical examination reveals no significant findings as peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic assessments were not performed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.9 K/uL, decreased hematocrit (Hct) levels ranging from 37.2-38.2%, and normal platelet (Plt) count. Blood chemistry results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and glucose, while other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), kidney function markers (Alk Phos/T Bili), electrolytes (Na+/K+/Cl-/"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old individual with a recent diagnosis of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) and declining mental status. The patient is currently in the ICU and has experienced respiratory distress, with a reported temperature of 101.1°F (Tmax) and a heart rate of 140 bpm. The patient is on a morphine drip for comfort and has been placed on DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate) status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's age, decreased mental status, and respiratory distress increase the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated temperature and white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. Acyclovir has been added back to the treatment plan, indicating a possible concern for viral infection such as herpes simplex virus.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,207 mL and output of 580 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,627 mL. This could indicate inadequate fluid resuscitation or ongoing fluid losses.
4. Bleeding risk: The patient's prolonged PT/INR values suggest an increased risk of bleeding. This is particularly concerning given the patient's use of anticoagulant medications.
5. Organ dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in various parameters, including elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST),"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old individual diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), a type of brain tumor. The patient's mental status has been declining recently. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is experiencing fever, respiratory distress, and a change in mental status. The patient is on multiple medications including morphine, Tylenol, Keppra, and Ativan. The patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate of 140 bpm, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high flow nebulization. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.9 K/uL, low hemoglobin level of 12.9 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 61 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Infection: The presence of fever suggests the possibility of an infection. Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to GBM treatment and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, it is crucial to monitor for signs of infection and adjust treatment accordingly.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and increased respiratory rate may progress to respiratory failure if not properly managed. Continuous monitoring and appropriate respiratory support, such as mechanical ventilation, may be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old with a recent diagnosis of GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) and declining mental status. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress, with rhonchi bilaterally and a respiratory rate above 30. The patient is on a morphine drip for comfort and the plan previously discussed with the family will be followed.

The patient's change in mental status remains unclear but is likely secondary to GBM status post chemoradiation. As per the family's wishes, Acyclovir will be continued, and maintenance fluids will be continued as well. Lumbar puncture (LP) has been put on hold since it will not change the management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress indicates a potential complication related to their GBM diagnosis or aspiration pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and management of the patient's airway and breathing is crucial.

2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of fever suggest a possible infection. Further investigation and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be necessary.

3. Organ dysfunction: The patient's lab results show abnormalities in various parameters such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, electrolytes, and liver enzymes. These findings indicate potential organ dysfunction, which needs to be closely monitored and managed accordingly.

4. Seizure activity: The patient is on Keppra,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Fever: The patient has a fever of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, indicating an infection or inflammatory process in the body.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is experiencing an increased ventricular rate due to AFib. This irregular heart rhythm can lead to inadequate blood flow and potentially result in cardiac complications.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient is showing signs of increased respiratory effort and has been progressively more tachypneic over the course of the morning. This could indicate respiratory failure or an underlying pulmonary condition.

4. Altered mental status: The patient continues to be unresponsive, which may be due to their critically ill condition or the effects of medication.

5. Pressure-related changes: The patient has early signs of pressure-related changes, particularly at the heels. These changes suggest the possibility of developing pressure ulcers if not managed appropriately.

6. Increased infection risk: The patient's critically ill state and presence of fever suggest an increased risk of infections. Monitoring for any signs of infection, such as worsening fever or changes in vital signs, is essential.

7. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet indicates a positive fluid balance, suggesting fluid overload. This could lead to pulmonary edema or other complications associated with fluid overload.
