   In brief this is a 45 yo man with cirrhosis c/b known varices, ascites,
   encephalopathy, is being transfered from St Josephs after presenting
   there with shortness of breath and being found to have leukocytosis,
   bacteremia, anemia and rising creatinine.
   .
   # Leukocytosis, bacteremia: Infective etiologies include most likely
   SBP. PNA is less likely given report of normal CXR. No evidence of SIRS
   at this time, but will monitor closely. Source of mixed bacteremia is
   unlcear, possible sources include SBP, PNA, UTI. No evidence of
   peritonitis on exam. WBCs improving with abx.

   - diagnostic para (although he has already received abx and the
   diagnostic information will be limited. If MS change, fever, or
   worsening leuks then dx para.
   - empiric broad spectrum abx with vancomycin (given GPC and recent
   hospitalization) and zosyn, then tailor appropriately.
   .
   # Anemia: concerning for GIB given history of cirrhosis with esophageal
   varices. No evidence of hematemsis or hematochezia.

   diuretics), HRS, intrinsic renal etiologies.   Urine lytes consistent
   with pre-renal and SIADH given elevated osmolality
   - renal ultrasound to eval hydronephrosis
   - hold diuretics
   - IVF/albumin trial as well as octreotide/midodrine
   - renal reccs
   .
   # Hyponatremia, hypervolemic: likely related to cirrhosis and volume
   overload.
   - Fluid restriction 1 lt
   - continue hypertonic saline cautiously and monitor sodium closely

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis presenting with leukocytosis, bacteremia, anemia, and rising creatinine. He has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), potential gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute renal failure (ARF), hyponatremia, and ascites. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Progression of SBP: The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but if the infection spreads or if the causative organism is resistant to the current antibiotics, it may lead to worsening of the patient's condition.
2. GIB: The patient's history of cirrhosis and esophageal varices increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. If the bleeding occurs, it could result in hemodynamic instability and require urgent intervention.
3. ARF: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels. If left untreated, ARF can progress to end-stage renal disease or require dialysis.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of encephalopathy, which is a potentially life-threatening complication of cirrhosis. If not managed properly, it can lead to worsening of neurological symptoms and increased risk of infections.
5. Variceal hemorrhage: The patient's esophageal varices are at risk of bleeding. If bleeding"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, presenting with shortness of breath and leukocytosis, bacteremia, anemia, and rising creatinine. The patient has known varices, ascites, and encephalopathy. The patient's leukocyte count is improving with antibiotic treatment. The source of mixed bacteremia is unclear, but possible sources include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), pneumonia (PNA), or urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's anemia is concerning for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) given the history of cirrhosis with esophageal varices. The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) and oliguria may be due to volume depletion, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), or intrinsic renal etiologies. The patient's hyponatremia and hypervolemia are likely related to cirrhosis and volume overload. The patient has a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis but also has positive smooth muscle antibody and elevated IgG. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Leukocytosis and Bacteremia: The patient's leukocyte count is improving with antibiotic treatment, indicating a potential improvement in the infection. However, the source of mixed bacteremia is still unclear, and further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Anemia: The patient's"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of etoh cirrhosis. He presented to the hospital with acute renal failure (ARF), severe anemia, and polymicrobial bacteremia. The bacteremia is likely secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), although fluid was never sampled. The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics and appears to be responding well, as indicated by decreased leukocytosis and fever curve.

The patient has been transferred to another hospital for further monitoring. His current medications include proton pump inhibitor (PPI), rifaximin, midodrine, octreotide, and lactulose. He is also receiving hypertonic saline for hyponatremia, with a target sodium level of 120.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/50 to 125/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress noted on general appearance. Physical examination findings include icteric conjunctivae, normocephalic head, and symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds. Abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender, distended abdomen, and lower extremity edema of 3+ on both sides. Neurologic examination shows asterixis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of ethanol (etoh) cirrhosis. He presented to the hospital with acute renal failure (ARF), severe anemia, and polymicrobial bacteremia. The patient was transferred to another hospital for further monitoring. He is currently on antibiotics and showing improvement, with decreased leukocytosis and fever curve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient's presentation includes oliguric ARF and liver cirrhosis, which are consistent with HRS. This condition can lead to progressive renal dysfunction and requires prompt management.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient's bacteremia is likely secondary to SBP, although fluid was not sampled for analysis. SBP is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis and can lead to sepsis if left untreated.
3. Variceal bleeding: The patient has a history of varices but no hematemesis at present. Variceal bleeding is a significant risk in patients with portal hypertension and can be life-threatening.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has severe hyponatremia, which needs to be corrected carefully to avoid complications like central pontine myelinolysis.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient may be experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, as indicated by asterixis and altered mental status. It is essential to manage this"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo man with cirrhosis c/b known varices, ascites, encephalopathy, is
   being transfered from St Josephs after presenting there with shortness
   of breath and being found to have leukocytosis, bacteremia, anemia and
   rising creatinine.
   # Leukocytosis, bacteremia: Infective etiologies include most likely
   SBP. PNA is less likely given report of normal CXR. No evidence of SIRS
   at this time, but will monitor closely. Source of mixed bacteremia is
   unlcear, possible sources include SBP, PNA, UTI. No evidence of
   peritonitis on exam. WBCs improving with abx.
   - f/u Bcx sensitivities, repeat CXR, Bcx, UA/Ucx
   - diagnostic para (although he has already received abx and the
   diagnostic information will be limited. If MS change, fever, or
   worsening leuks then dx para.
   - empiric broad spectrum abx with vancomycin (given GPC and recent
   hospitalization) and zosyn, then tailor appropriately.
   # Anemia: concerning for GIB given history of cirrhosis with esophageal
   varices. No evidence of hematemsis or hematochezia.
   - monitor stool guaiac, HCT, VS
   - EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] to further eval
   - pIVx3, HCT>30, PLT>50, INT<1.5
   - HCT q 8hrs
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI, octreotide ggt
   # ARF and oligouria: Ddx includes volume depletion (given recent
   diuretics), HRS, intrinsic renal etiologies.   Urine lytes consistent
   with pre-renal and SIADH given elevated osmolality
   - renal ultrasound to eval hydronephrosis
   - hold diuretics
   - IVF/albumin trial as well as octreotide/midodrine
   - renal reccs
   # Hyponatremia, hypervolemic: likely related to cirrhosis and volume
   overload.
   - Fluid restriction 1 lt
   - continue hypertonic saline cautiously and monitor sodium closely
   # Cirrhosis c/b known varices, encephalopathy and ascites: Likely etoh
   cirrhosis but also has positive smoth mm ab and elevated IgG.
   - Ascites: monitor abdominal exam, if worsens then therapeutic tap
   - Encephalopathy: only mild asterixis on exam, oriented. Continue
   lactulose/rifaximin.
   - Varices: stable. Will monitor guaiacs.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with known cirrhosis and associated complications such as varices, ascites, and encephalopathy. The patient was transferred from another hospital due to shortness of breath and was found to have leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), bacteremia (presence of bacteria in the blood), anemia (low red blood cell count), and rising creatinine levels indicating possible kidney dysfunction.

During the 24-hour period, the patient underwent an endoscopy that showed no evidence of active bleeding. A paracentesis was also performed, revealing no signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient received a blood transfusion to address the anemia. Sodium levels improved from 117 to 119 without the use of hypertonic saline. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) was performed, showing no evidence of active bleeding. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were discontinued, and the patient's right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed cirrhosis with ascites, a partially occlusive main portal vein thrombosis extending into the left portal vein, and a distended gallbladder without signs of acute cholecystitis.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including leukocytosis, bacteremia, anemia, acute kidney injury, hyponatremia (low sodium levels), hypervolemia (excess fluid volume), and complications related to"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old man with cirrhosis who has been transferred to the ICU due to shortness of breath and presentation of leukocytosis, bacteremia, anemia, and rising creatinine. The patient underwent an endoscopy, paracentesis, and ultrasound.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has bacteremia caused by Clostridium perfringens, likely secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Antibiotics have been initiated, and further culture data is pending. The patient also has anemia, which is being monitored along with vital signs and stool guaiac. The patient is also being treated for acute renal failure (ARF) due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), as indicated by the lack of response to intravenous fluids (IVF) bolus and failure to improve. The patient is responding to octreotide/midodrine therapy. 

Additionally, the patient has hyponatremia and hypervolemia, likely related to cirrhosis and volume overload. Fluid restriction has been implemented. The patient's cirrhosis, encephalopathy, and ascites are also being managed with lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy and monitoring of guaiacs for varices. 

In summary, the patient's potential medical complications include SBP, anemia, ARF/HRS, hyponatremia, and hyp"
