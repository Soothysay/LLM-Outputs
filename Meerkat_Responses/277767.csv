","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with an unknown medical history found down and experiencing tonic-clonic seizures. He was intubated for airway protection and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient has a high lactic acidosis level, indicating possible metabolic acidosis. He also has elevated liver enzymes, suggesting liver dysfunction and chronic alcohol abuse. There is a suspicion of gastrointestinal bleeding, as he reportedly had bright red nasogastric tube drainage in the emergency department. The patient's blood tests show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and troponin T levels. His kidney function is normal, but electrolyte imbalances are present. An MRI and EEG are planned for further neurological evaluation. The patient is receiving multiple medications including midazolam (versed), fentanyl, octreotide, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 124/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient's history of seizures and elevated liver enzymes suggest chronic alcohol abuse. Alcohol withdrawal can lead to complications such as delirium tremens, agitation, hallucinations, and seizures.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a critical and unknown medical history. He was found down and experienced tonic-clonic seizures, leading to intubation. The patient has high lactic acidosis and is currently on respiratory support. The initial assessment suggests alcohol withdrawal, respiratory failure, seizure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluations are needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient may experience symptoms such as tremors, agitation, hallucinations, and seizures due to sudden cessation of alcohol intake.
2. Respiratory Failure: As the patient is already intubated, there is a risk of further respiratory compromise if the ventilator settings are not adjusted properly or if there are complications related to the endotracheal tube.
3. Seizure Recurrence: Given the history of seizures, there is a possibility of recurrent seizures, especially during alcohol withdrawal or if the underlying cause of the seizures is not addressed.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient may continue to experience bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and shock if not managed appropriately. Variceal bleeding is a common cause in patients with liver disease.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The high lactate levels indicate a metabolic acidosis, which could be due to factors like thiamine deficiency, sepsis, or other metabolic disturbances. Monitoring and addressing this condition is crucial.
6. Liver Disease: The elevated liver enzymes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male found down with a history of hypertension, tachycardia, low-grade fever, and unresponsiveness. He was intubated for airway protection and received ceftriaxone and vancomycin in the emergency department. Upon admission to the ICU, the patient's blood alcohol level was 87, lactate level was 13.6, and lumbar puncture results were normal. The patient was started on fentanyl and versed drip and sent to the ICU.

Since admission, the patient experienced bloody output from the nasogastric (NG) tube, and octreotide, ciprofloxacin, and pantoprazole were initiated. The patient's hemoglobin concentration decreased from 36% to 28%, but continued to show hemodynamic stability. The patient is now sitting up in bed, showing tremors and tachycardia when sedation is decreased, and has small ulcers but no varices.

The patient is currently receiving invasive ventilation, with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 18 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 13 cmH2O, and compliance of 75.3 cmH2"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male found down with a history of hypertension, tachycardia, low-grade temperature, and unresponsiveness. He was intubated for airway protection. Initial labs showed an ethanol level of 87 and lactate 13.6. The patient received ceftriaxone and vancomycin in the emergency department. Post-intubation, his blood gases were 7.49/44/390. He was placed on fentanyl and versed drip and sent to the ICU.

24-hour events include bloody output from the NG tube, which led to the initiation of octreotide, ciprofloxacin, and pantoprazole IV. The patient's hemoglobin concentration decreased from 36% to 28%. The patient has been hemodynamically stable. He is currently sitting up in bed, but becomes tremulous and tachycardic when sedation is decreased. Small ulcers without varices were noted.

Medications include fentanyl, midazolam (versed), octreotide, and pantoprazole. Other ICU medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), MVI, Hep Sq, RISS, thiamine 100IV Qday, folic acid, chlorhexidine, ciprofloxacin 500 Q12, and others.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for bloody output from the NG tube. Vital signs include a maximum"

   Seizure can result in elevated lactate, although it would be somewhat
   unusual to be so high. Severe thiamine deficiency/beri beri can also
   often lead to extremely high lactate. Finally, sepsis is less likely as
   no localizing source of infection; however, still remains on
   differential. Lactate and HCO3 improved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with a seizure and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of unknown alcohol abuse and was found down with tonic-clonic seizures. He was intubated due to airway protection and has been receiving respiratory support. The patient has a high lactic acidosis level and is suspected to have alcohol withdrawal, gastrointestinal bleeding, metabolic acidosis, and possible liver disease. He is being treated with various medications and interventions, including sedation, seizure precautions, antibiotics, and prophylactic medications. Further tests and evaluations are planned, such as an MRI, EEG, EGD, blood cultures, and liver function tests.

Potential medical complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient may experience symptoms such as agitation, tremors, hallucinations, and seizures if not managed properly.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: There is a risk of continued bleeding, which can lead to hypotension, shock, and organ failure.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's high lactate levels indicate a potential for worsening acidosis, which can affect vital organ function.
4. Liver disease: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and history of alcohol abuse suggest possible liver dysfunction, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
5. Infection: Despite no obvious source of infection, the patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest a possible infection, which can quickly escalate into"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of seizure. The patient was extubated without any problems and was found to have a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) with subdural hematoma (SDH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), although not seen on admission CT scan. The patient is currently on antiepileptic medication, Keppra, and seizure precautions have been initiated. An MRI and EEG are needed for further evaluation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature within normal range and heart rate slightly elevated. Blood pressure is within normal limits, respiratory rate is within normal range, and oxygen saturation is 94%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL and spontaneous Vt of 524 mL. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is set at 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 40%, and plateau pressure is 13 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show low potassium levels, which are being repleted. Liver function tests are stable, and renal function tests are within normal limits. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly low, hemoglobin and hematocrit are within normal range, and platelet count is slightly low. Other lab results, including electrolytes, enzymes"

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with an unknown medical history who presented to the ICU with a seizure. He has been extubated without any problems and merged with another patient named [**Name2 (NI) **] who has a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The patient was found to have a history of TBI with subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage, although it was not seen on admission computed tomography (CT) scan. The neurologist started the patient on Keppra for seizure management and seizure precautions, along with an MRI and EEG as recommended. 

The patient is currently on Ativan for CIWA after extubation. His blood counts have been stable over the past four days, and his potassium levels are persistently low but being repleted. Liver function tests are stable, showing signs of alcoholic liver disease with elevated liver enzymes and an increased MELD score. The patient also has evidence of portal hypertension with flow reversal in the left portal vein, as seen on RUQ ultrasound. 

The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 13 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. His blood gases show a pH of 7.30.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male of European descent with an unknown medical history who presented to the ICU after being found down and experiencing tonic-clonic seizures. He was intubated due to respiratory failure and high lactic acidosis. The patient has a history of head trauma with subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage, but this was not evident on admission. He also has a possible meningioma on CT head, with no evidence of infection on lumbar puncture.

The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed two ulcers, one of which was clipped. The EGD also showed portal hypertensive gastropathy. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating possible alcoholic liver disease. His Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is 16, and discriminant function is 23 on admission.

The patient is currently being treated with antiepileptic medication (Keppra), seizure precautions, and prophylactic antibiotics (Cipro). His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate between 81-105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109-148 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. His neurological examination is normal, but he has mild right upper quadrant tenderness.

   Seizure can result in elevated lactate, although it would be somewhat
   unusual to be so high. Severe thiamine deficiency/beri beri can also
   often lead to extremely high lactate. Finally, sepsis is less likely as
   no localizing source of infection; however, still remains on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with critical and unknown medical history. He was found down and experienced tonic-clonic seizures, leading to intubation. The patient has a high lactic acidosis level and other significant findings including gastrointestinal bleeding, elevated liver function tests, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has persistent low potassium levels and needs repletion. Other electrolyte imbalances, such as magnesium and phosphorus, should also be monitored and corrected if necessary.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal (including Delirium Tremens, Seizures): The patient may be experiencing alcohol withdrawal, which can cause seizures and delirium tremens. Appropriate management includes benzodiazepines for sedation and seizure prophylaxis.
3. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient was intubated for airway protection due to respiratory failure. Weaning off FiO2 and switching to pressure support ventilation (PSV) when able is recommended.
4. Seizure, Without Status Epilepticus: The seizures are likely related to alcohol withdrawal, although a known seizure history is unknown. An MRI and EEG are needed per neurology recommendations.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Other (GI Bleed, GIB): The patient had a significant amount of bright red blood drainage through the nasogastric tube. Octreotide, pant"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, there are several important findings and assessments made throughout the note.

The patient underwent an EEG, ultrasound, and endoscopy on [**2127-5-19**]. They were previously on invasive ventilation but it was stopped on [**2127-5-19**] at 03:51 PM.

The patient has no known drug allergies and received a dose of ciprofloxacin on [**2127-5-20**] at 05:21 AM. They are currently receiving various medications including diazepam, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and lorazepam.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for specific notes. Their vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 106 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 135/106 to 148/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 6,728 mL with outputs totaling 3,450 mL, resulting in a balance of 3,278 mL. They are receiving IV fluids and have received blood products as well.

Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, spontaneous Vt of 524 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and plateau pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O. Their arterial blood gas (ABG) results are ///30/ with a ventilation rate (Ve) of 8.8 L/min.

Physical examination findings are not fully assessed due to various reasons such as pulse assessments and skin assessment. Neurologic examination is also not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.9 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 88 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.6 mg/dL, troponin T of 0.01 mg/dL, and glucose levels ranging from 106 to 216 mg/dL. Other lab values are provided in the note.

Assessment and plan include electrolyte and fluid disorder, alcohol withdrawal, respiratory failure, seizure, and gastrointestinal bleed. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male found down with a seizure and an ethanol level of 87. There is suspicion of an ethanol-related seizure and withdrawal, especially considering the patient's history of traumatic brain injury. The patient has been receiving various medications including diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), ciprofloxacin, pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium, MVI, Hep Sq, RISS, thiamine, folic acid, cholesterol, ciprofloxacin, and keppra.

24-hour events include invasive ventilation being stopped, an EEG and ultrasound performed, endoscopy conducted, and the initiation of several medications. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin on 05/20/2127 at 05:21 AM.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate between 81-106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/80 mmHg to 148/108 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-25 inspiratory movements per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 6,728 mL with outputs of 3,450 mL (blood products) and 1,380 mL (urine). The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, spontaneous tidal volume of 524 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Physical examination reveals PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), tongue ulceration, regular heart sounds, clear to auscultation lungs, soft abdomen, no calf pain or swelling, and appropriate neurologic responses. The patient's labs indicate evidence of portal hypertension on RUQ US, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated leukocyte count, normal platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and various electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's WBC count has been fluctuating between 6.2 and 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin levels between 27.2 and 31.0 g/dL, platelet count between 71 and 88 K/uL, and creatinine levels between 0.5 and 0.6 mg/dL. Other lab results show elevated levels of troponin-T, CK, CKMB, ALT, AST, Alk Phos, T Bili, LDH, and lactate.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is suspected to have an ethanol-related seizure and withdrawal, along with a history of traumatic brain injury. The plan includes continuing valium/Ativan based on the CIWA scale, administering MVI"

   50 y/o M EU critical and unknown history found down and witness tonic
   clonic seizures now intubated with high lactic acidosis
   .
   #. Resp support: He was intubated for airway protection. CXR without
   infiltrate and no hypoxia.
   - wean FiO2 and switch to PSV when able
   - cont Fentanyl / Versed for sedation
   - RSBI and SBT after EGD
   .
   #. Seizure: These are most likely EtOH withdrawal related, although it
   is unknown if he has known seizure hx.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - will need MRI and EEG per neuron
   - consider Lactulose if not
   .
   # GIB: In ED, he reportdedly had >600 cc bright red NGT drainage. In
   the ICU overnight continued to have some mild bleeding, but currently
   appears to be suctioning bilious fluid
   - appreciate Liver recs
   - continue octreotide, PPI [**Hospital1 7**], cipro for presumed variceal bleed
 can
   stop Cipro if EGD negative
   - Liver to scope this AM
   - Q6-8H Hct
   - guaiac all stools
   - place NGT after EGD
   .
   #. Metabolic acidosis: He has very high lactate. Interestingly, Bicarb
   is only 24 despite AG 28 suggesting a second metabolic alkalosis.
   Seizure can result in elevated lactate, although it would be somewhat
   unusual to be so high. Severe thiamine deficiency/beri beri can also
   often lead to extremely high lactate. Finally, sepsis is less likely as
   no localizing source of infection; however, still remains on
   differential. Lactate and HCO3 improved.
   - osmolar gap (including EtoH) = 313-311 = 2.
   - replete thiamine, vitamins
   - blood cx, urine cx, stool cx, f/u CSF cx
   - he received Vanc/CTX in ED, but would hold on further abx at this
   time as no obvious infectious source
   .
   # Fever: he has had low grade temps in ED, which may be related to
   seizure and EtOH withdrawal. No obvious site of infection except
   elevated LFTs
   - will hold on abx tonight
   .
   # Abnormal LFTs: His LFTs are suggestive of mild hepatitis and c/w
   chronic EtOH abuse. Lipase also mildly elevated concerning for
   pancreatitis
   - will need to obtain further hx re: liver disease.
   - trend LFTs
   - NPO overnight
   - check albumin
   .
   #. ?EtOH withdrawal: We do not have clear hx; however, EtOH level,
   AST>ALT, elevated Tbili are strongly suggestive of chronic EtOH and
   liver disease. Discriminant function is 23.
   - versed gtt for now while intubated
   - will need further hx
   - continue thiamine/folate/MVI- once extubated, will use PO valium for
   CIWA>10
   .
   # Left gaze preference: This was noted by neuro in ED. Head CT prelim
   neg for intracranial bleed. Will eval for evidence of stroke
   - apprec neuro recs
   - MRI and EEG (when able)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with critical and unknown medical history. The patient was found down and experienced tonic-clonic seizures, leading to intubation. The patient has high lactic acidosis and several potential medical complications.

1. Respiratory support: The patient was intubated for airway protection. A chest X-ray showed no infiltrate and no hypoxia. The plan is to wean FiO2 and switch to pressure support ventilation (PSV) when able, continue fentanyl/versed for sedation, and perform a rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) after an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

2. Seizure: The seizures are most likely related to ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal, although it is unknown if the patient has a known seizure history. The plan is to appreciate neurologic recommendations, perform an MRI and EEG, and consider lactulose if not.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): In the emergency department (ED), the patient reportedly had >600 cc bright red nasogastric tube (NGT) drainage. In the ICU overnight, the patient continued to have some mild bleeding but currently appears to be suctioning bilious fluid.

   IMPRESSION: This is a normal routine EEG in the waking and sleeping
   states. The generalized low voltage fast beta rhythms may be seen with
   medication side effects (e.g. benzodiazepines and barbiturates) or may
   be seen with anxiety. No focal slowing, epileptiform discharges or
   electrographic seizures were recorded.
   .
   Assessment and Plan:  50M found down and witness tonic clonic seizures
   felt to be secondary to alcohol withdrawal.
   # EtOH withdrawal:  Massive benzo requirements yesterday.
   - IV ativan 4mg q10 minutes, valium 20mg per CIWA
   - Continue thiamine/folate/MVI
   # Seizure: Thought secondary to EtoH withdrawal. Has history of head
   bleed but none seen here. He does have a possible meningioma on CT
   head. No evidence for infection on LP.
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - MRI head per neuro recs
 delay until benzo requirements decrease
   - Continue keppra
 can give IV if unable to take PO
   - Continue seizure precautions
   # GIB:  In ED, he reportdedly had >600 cc bright red NGT drainage.
   Underwent EGD with ulcers -> clipped. Scope also suggestive of  portal
   hypertensive gastropathy. Hct currently stable.
   - Continue PPI; change to PO
   - Discontinue cipro
   - Follow Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Maintain PIV x2, active T+S, transfuse hct>25

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a chief complaint of alcohol withdrawal. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing delirium tremens with fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. The patient has received a total of 260 mg of benzodiazepines in the past 24 hours and is being treated with lorazepam (Ativan) for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. His liver function tests indicate likely cirrhosis, and he also has signs of portal hypertension. The patient has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, likely due to esophageal varices, and has undergone an endoscopy with clipping of the bleeding site. He is currently stable, but his hematocrit levels need to be monitored closely. The patient also has a history of seizures and a possible meningioma on CT head. An MRI of the head is recommended once the patient's benzodiazepine requirements decrease. The patient is at risk for head and neck cancer due to a tongue lesion, which requires dental follow-up. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal seizures: The patient has a history of head bleed but no seizure activity observed here. However, there is a possibility of recurrent seizures due to alcohol withdrawal.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's likely cirrhosis and portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy may develop, leading to altered mental status and other neurological symptoms.
3. Upper gastrointestinal"

   unusual to be so high. Severe thiamine deficiency/beri beri can also
   often lead to extremely high lactate. Finally, sepsis is less likely as

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with critical and unknown medical history who was found down and experienced tonic-clonic seizures. He was intubated for airway protection and is currently on respiratory support. The patient has a high lactic acidosis and evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. He is suspected to have alcohol withdrawal, respiratory failure, seizure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient has imbalances in sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient may experience symptoms such as agitation, tremors, hallucinations, and seizures due to cessation of alcohol intake.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. Complications can arise from prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
4. Seizure: The patient has had tonic-clonic seizures, which can lead to complications like brain injury or postictal state.
5. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has had bright red blood drainage from the nasogastric tube and continued bleeding. Complications can include hypotension, shock, and infection.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a high lactate level, which can be caused by seizures, thiamine deficiency, or sepsis.
7. Abnormal liver function tests: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, suggesting possible liver disease or damage.
8. Left gaze preference: The patient exhibits a"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and was admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 123/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, lorazepam for agitation, pantoprazole, diazepam for seizures, and heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

The patient's physical examination reveals sinus tachycardia and hypotension. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and there is no skin assessment performed. The neurologic examination is also not complete.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.2 g/dL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 88 K/uL, elevated BUN and creatinine levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypomagnesemia. The patient's glucose levels are within normal range, but there are abnormalities in other lab values such as elevated troponin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male found down with a seizure and an ethanol level of 87. He has a history of traumatic brain injury and is suspected to have experienced an etoh seizure and withdrawal. The patient has been in the ICU and received a total of 260 diazepam, 20mg IV ativan, ciprofloxacin, and other medications. He has shown improvement in his tremulousness and is now oriented to person. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 103-172 mmHg, heart rate of 104-134 bpm, respiratory rate of 17-42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 2L. The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes and abnormal electrolyte levels. The assessment and plan include continuing valium PO and IV ativan, administering MVI/Thiame/Folate, changing PPI, waiting for EEG and MRI results, monitoring phosphate levels, following up with hep serologies, and monitoring liver function tests. The patient will continue to receive ICU care, including nutrition advancement, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and he will remain in the ICU until his benzodiazepine requirements decrease.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal, seizure, and possible gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient's medical history includes a possible meningioma on CT head, history of head bleed, and likely cirrhosis with portal hypertension. The patient has been receiving treatment for alcohol withdrawal, including IV ativan and valium. He is also on thiamine/folate/MVI supplementation, keppra for seizure, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for GIB. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 138/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), low albumin, and slightly elevated creatinine. The patient's blood glucose levels have been well-controlled. The patient has a history of head bleed but no evidence of infection on lumbar puncture. An MRI head is recommended to assess the possible meningioma. The patient's Hct is currently stable, and he is being monitored closely for any signs of bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient may experience symptoms such as tremors, agitation, seizures, hallucinations, and delirium tremens if not properly managed.
2. Seizure: There is a risk of recurrent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, found down with a seizure and an EtOH level of 87. He presented with bloody emesis and is suspected to have experienced an alcohol seizure and withdrawal. The patient has received a total of 60mg of Valium overnight and no Ativan. His withdrawal symptoms have improved.

Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is at risk for developing complications related to alcohol withdrawal, such as seizures, delirium tremens, and autonomic instability.
2. Seizure: The patient has already experienced a seizure, which may recur if not properly managed.
3. Traumatic brain injury: The patient's history of traumatic brain injury puts him at risk for neurological complications, including intracranial hemorrhage, edema, and increased intracranial pressure.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of bloody emesis raises concerns for gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and shock.
5. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to alcohol abuse, increasing his susceptibility to infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the ICU setting.
6. Malnutrition: Prolonged alcohol abuse can lead to malnutrition and deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals.
7. Liver dysfunction: Chronic alcohol abuse can cause liver damage, resulting in elevated liver enzymes and potential liver failure.
8. Electrolyte imbalances: The"
