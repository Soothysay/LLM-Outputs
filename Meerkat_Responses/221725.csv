   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 62 yo man with h/o ESLD [**2-10**] ETOH
   cirrhosis and coagulopathy, who initially presented with anemia in the
   setting of large hematoma and was transferred to the MICU today for
   observation s/p embolization of intracostal artery.
   #. Axillary Hematoma:  IR saw the patient yesterday and performed
   embolization of T9 intercostal artery.  His Hct has remained stable
   since the procedure, and the femoral sheath remains in place.  He
   received 1 Unit of cryo and 3 Units of FFP overnight.
   -  Continue to monitor Hct [**Hospital1 **]
    - Transfuse for Hct < 23 or evidence of bleeding
    - Maintain active T&S and reserve 2 U PRBCs
    - Maintain 2 PIVs.
    - Morphine prn for pain
    - Keep sheath in place with continuous saline irrigation and check
   distal and femoral pulses with doppler q1h.
    - Give 3 U FFP at 5 am and recheck INR at 6 am.  Pull sheath if
   possible this morning.
   #. Diarrhea: The patient recently developed diarrhea in the setting of
   lactulose, bowel regimen, and antibiotic use.  CDiff was negative x2.
    - Repeat CDiff today for third negative culture
    - Hold bowel regimen and Lactulose, as patient doesn't have a known
   history of encephalopathy.
   .
   # EtOH cirrhosis:  Patient was seen by hepatology on this admission and
   is planning to undergo transplant evaluation upon discharge at [**Hospital1 7684**].  Paracentesis was negative for SBP, and the patient doesn't
   have a known history of encephalopathy/varices.  Spironolactone and
   Furosemide were discontinued today in the setting of acute bleed.
    - Restart Lasix and Spironolactone in the morning if hemodynamically
   stable.
   .
   # Anemia:  The patient has a history of anemia s/p extensive workup at
   [**Hospital1 966**] in [**1-17**].  Recent colonoscopy/EGD did not demonstrate source, though
   the patient was reportedly guaiac positive in the hospital.  DDx
   includes acute hematoma v. underlying liver disease v. diverticulosis,
   v. portal gastropathy etc.
    - Continue to guaiac stools
    - Daily coags/bili
    - PO PPI
    - F/[**Location **] GI recommendations. Needs GI f/u outpatient.
   .
   #. UTI: The patient was found to have a UTI on [**8-10**] and is currently on
   Day #10 of Cipro.  No fever spikes and WBC is trending down.
    - Stop Cipro as 10 day course was completed.
   .
   # ARF:  The patient presented with Cr of 3.7 at OSH, from baseline of
   1.0.  His Cr returned to [**Location 838**] with IVFs, most likely [**2-10**] pre-renal
   from hypovolemia.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of HTN, for which he takes Lasix and
   Aldactone at home.
    - Restart BP (liver) meds tomorrow if hemodynamically stable.
   .
   # ETOH abuse. Reports longstanding sobriety. No withdrawal symptoms
   during hospitalization.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to EtOH (alcohol) cirrhosis and coagulopathy.
- He initially presented with anemia and a large hematoma, and was transferred to the MICU (medical intensive care unit) for observation after undergoing embolization of the T9 intercostal artery.
- The patient fell prior to admission and developed a large axillary hematoma. He underwent repeat embolization by interventional radiology (IR).
- His hematocrit (Hct) dropped this morning, and he had increased bleeding at the site.
- The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/54 mmHg to 125/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count, but decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and sodium levels.
- The patient's physical examination findings include a right axillary hematoma and absent peripheral pulses in the upper extremities.
- The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including axillary hematoma, diarrhea, EtOH cirrhosis, anemia, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute kidney failure (ARF), hypertension (HTN), and alcohol abuse.
- The plan includes continuing to monitor the patient's hematocrit levels and transfusing if below 23 or with evidence of bleeding.
- The patient will receive morphine for pain, maintain active twice-weekly surveillance (T&S) with reserved 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), maintain two peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines, and keep the sheath in place with continuous saline irrigation while checking distal and femoral pulses with Doppler once per hour.
- The patient will also receive 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) at 5 am and have an INR recheck at 6 am.
- Other plans include repeating Clostridium difficile (C. diff) testing tomorrow for the third negative culture, holding bowel regimen and lactulose, restarting spironolactone and furosemide in the morning if hemodynamically stable, and arranging for a transplant evaluation upon discharge.
- The patient's code status is full code, and he will be admitted to the MICU for observation."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to alcohol cirrhosis and coagulopathy. He presented initially with anemia and a large hematoma, for which he underwent embolization of the T9 intercostal artery. The patient remained hemodynamically stable after the procedure but developed increased bleeding at the site, leading to a repeat embolization. He is currently in the MICU (medical intensive care unit) for observation.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including an axillary hematoma, diarrhea, alcohol cirrhosis, anemia, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute renal failure (ARF), hypertension (HTN), and ethanol abuse.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with advanced liver disease who presented to the ICU after falling and experiencing severe anemia due to a large hematoma in the right axilla. He underwent re-embolization by interventional radiology (IR) last night and is currently being observed. The patient has a history of allergies to codeine, which caused a rash. He has been receiving various medications, including morphine sulfate, furosemide (Lasix), and pantoprazole (Protonix). His medical and family history, review of systems, and physical examination are unchanged from admission except for the presence of anemia and coagulopathy.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 81 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 100/41 mmHg to 125/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient appears comfortable with no signs of pain or distress.

Flowsheet data shows a fluid balance of -380 mL total in and -378 mL total out over the past 24 hours. Hemodynamic monitoring, oxygen delivery, and respiratory support are all within normal limits. The patient's blood products transfused amount to a total of 987 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ESLD and ETOH cirrhosis who presented with anemia and a large hematoma. He was transferred to the MICU for observation after undergoing embolization of the intercostal artery. His hematocrit (Hct) continues to decrease, and he has been receiving fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate transfusions. He also has diarrhea, possibly related to lactulose use, and is being evaluated for liver transplantation. The patient has a history of anemia, with no identifiable source of bleeding despite extensive workup. He has had a recent colonoscopy and EGD without findings of significant bleeding. His liver function tests show elevated liver enzymes, with an INR of 2.0, which is above the recommended level. The patient's cardiac echo reveals no structural abnormalities in the heart valves.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability due to ongoing bleeding or low hematocrit levels.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy due to ESLD and lactulose use.
3. Infection, including urinary tract infection (UTI) or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or renal failure, indicated by the presence of renal dysfunction.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by guaiac positive stool and history of anemia.
6. Hypert"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of ESLD and ETOH cirrhosis who presented initially with anemia and a large hematoma. He underwent embolization of the intracostal artery and was transferred to the MICU for observation. The patient received 2 pRBCs, 1 cryo, and 3 FFP overnight. His hematocrit (Hct) has been stable since the procedure, but he experienced two episodes of acute bleeding from the right groin site after the sheath was pulled. He is currently on bed rest.

The patient also has a history of diarrhea in the setting of lactulose, bowel regimen, and antibiotic use. CDiff was negative twice. The diarrhea is being managed by holding the bowel regimen and lactulose, as the patient does not have a known history of encephalopathy.

The patient is planning to undergo a transplant evaluation upon discharge at Hospital1. He is negative for para and has no history of encephalopathy or varices.

The patient's anemia has been extensively worked up at Hospital1 in January, and recent colonoscopy/EGD did not reveal the source of bleed. The differential diagnosis includes acute hematoma versus underlying liver disease versus diverticulosis versus portal gastropathy, etc. The patient has guaiac positive stool. The plan is to continue monitoring the HCT, start PO PPI, and obtain GI"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to alcohol (ETOH) cirrhosis and coagulopathy. He presented initially with anemia and a large hematoma, leading to his transfer to the MICU (medical intensive care unit) for observation after undergoing embolization of the intracostal artery. 

The patient has received 2 pRBCs (pack red blood cells), 1 cryo (cryoprecipitate), and 3 FFP (fresh frozen plasma) overnight. His Hct (hematocrit) remains stable since the procedure. The femoral sheath remains in place. 

The patient is also experiencing diarrhea, possibly related to lactulose use, antibiotic use, and bowel regimen. CDiff (Clostridium difficile) was negative twice. 

The patient has a history of ETOH cirrhosis and is planning to undergo a transplant evaluation upon discharge at a specific hospital. He has no known history of encephalopathy or varices. Lasix and Spironolactone, which are diuretics, are being held. 

Anemia is another concern, with no identified source of bleeding despite extensive workup at a previous hospital. The differential diagnosis includes acute hematoma versus underlying liver disease versus diverticulosis versus portal gastropathy, etc. The patient's gu"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of right flank hematoma. The patient has a history of liver transplant and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/62 to 146/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on bed rest due to two episodes of acute bleeding from the right groin site after the sheath was pulled. The patient also has a new rub noted on exam, and an EKG was ordered without any acute changes. The patient's Hct is stable, and the liver enzymes are elevated. The patient is on multiple medications including pantoprazole, lactulose, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of liver transplant, which increases the risk of coagulopathy. The elevated liver enzymes and low fibrinogen level indicate a potential bleeding tendency.
2. Bleeding: The patient experienced acute bleeding episodes from the right groin site, which suggests a possible bleeding disorder.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient was restarted on lactulose for encephalopathy, indicating a potential risk of hepatic encephalopathy due to liver dysfunction.
4. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics,"

 COAGULOPATHY
   62M with advanced liver disease, coagulopathy, presented after
   mechanical fall with very larger R chest hematoma. Pt admitted to micu
   after an IR procedure given high risk of bleeding from the groin. After
   being stable for the last 24 hrs, pt just had another significant
   rebleed from the right groin. One of the concerning issues is that the
   patient didn't notice the bleeding (he was sleeping). We are dealing

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with advanced liver disease and coagulopathy. The patient presented to the ICU after a mechanical fall with a large right chest hematoma. The patient underwent an interventional radiology (IR) procedure and was admitted to the medical ICU due to a high risk of bleeding from the groin.

The patient experienced another significant rebleeding from the right groin, which is concerning as the patient did not notice the bleeding while sleeping. The ICU team is closely monitoring the patient's vital signs and laboratory values, including complete blood count (CBC), coagulation profile, and blood glucose levels. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is being transfused as needed to manage the acute bleeding.

The patient's abdominal distension is likely due to ileus secondary to opiates. The ICU team is waiting for the final read of an abdominal x-ray to further evaluate this condition. 

Other chronic issues, such as potential complications related to advanced liver disease, are being monitored and managed by the ICU team. The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers are also being addressed.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include ongoing bleeding from the groin, development of liver-related complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or hepatorenal syndrome, worsening coagulopathy, and potential infections due to prolonged ICU stay and"

   after an IR procedure given high risk of bleeding from the groin. After
   being stable for the last 24 hrs, pt just had another significant

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with advanced liver disease and coagulopathy who presented after a mechanical fall with a large right-sided chest hematoma. He was admitted to the medical ICU after undergoing an interventional radiology (IR) procedure due to a high risk of bleeding from the groin. The patient has been stable for the past 24 hours but experienced another significant rebleeding from the right groin while asleep. The main concern is the patient's lack of awareness of the bleeding. The acute bleeding is being managed by monitoring the patient's complete blood count (CBC), coagulation profile, and transfusing fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as necessary. The interventional radiologist will reassess the groin. Considering this acute change, it is reasonable to continue monitoring the patient in the ICU until the groin bleeding resolves and becomes stable.

Other chronic issues are mentioned in the resident notes. The patient's distended abdomen is likely caused by ileus secondary to opioids. The final read of the abdominal X-ray is pending. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition is being managed, and his blood sugar levels are well-controlled. The patient has two central venous catheters placed on August 19th. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots and systemic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and ETOH (etohol) cirrhosis, coagulopathy, and large hematoma. He was initially admitted with anemia and was transferred to the MICU for observation after undergoing embolization of an intracostal artery. The patient has experienced multiple episodes of bleeding, including groin bleeding, and has received blood products. His hematocrit (Hct) levels have been decreasing, and his international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated at >2.0. The patient is currently receiving fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions to maintain INR <1.4 until Hct is stable for 24 hours. The patient's abdominal distension has worsened, and he has a history of anemia with no identified source of bleeding. Other medical conditions include diarrhea (negative for Clostridium difficile), etoh cirrhosis, hypertension, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute renal failure (ARF), and hepatitis C. The patient is awaiting a liver transplant evaluation upon discharge. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Continued bleeding and difficulty in controlling the bleeding due to coagulopathy.
2. Development of hepatic encephalopathy due to worsening liver function.
3. Further complications related to the liver transplant evaluation and surgery.
4. Possible infections or"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a middle-aged man who presented to the ICU with a right axillary hematoma. He has experienced bleeding from the sheath site on two occasions, requiring pressure and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to control the bleeding. The patient also has increasing abdominal distension, with dilated loops of bowel observed on KUB (kidney, ureter, and bladder) imaging.

Vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/52 mmHg to 126/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on respiratory support with an ABG showing normal values. His physical examination reveals scleral icterus, ungal icterus, clear oropharynx, supple neck, no jugular venous distension (JVD), clear lungs, regular heart rhythm with a loud S1, and no murmurs. The abdomen is diffusely distended with a positive fluid wave, non-tender, and with positive bowel sounds. There is no evidence of a Foley catheter in place, and the patient has 2+ edema in both legs. His extremities are well perfused with dopplerable pulses.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to EtOH (alcohol) cirrhosis and coagulopathy. He presented initially with anemia in the setting of a large hematoma and was transferred to the MICU (medical intensive care unit) for observation after undergoing embolization of the intracostal artery.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions:

1. Right axillary hematoma: The patient had two episodes of bleeding from the sheath site, and there is increasing abdominal distension with positive fluid wave. He received 4 units of blood products yesterday and continues to bleed from the groin site three times over the past 24 hours. His hemoglobin (Hct) level is decreasing, indicating ongoing blood loss.

2. Diarrhea: The patient has diarrhea, which is most likely due to lactulose use. He had a negative Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test twice. Lactulose was restarted due to increased confusion overnight.

3. EtOH cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis. He is planning to undergo a transplant evaluation upon discharge at a specific hospital. His abdomen is increasingly distended, and he received a significant amount of blood products over the past 48 hours.

4. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, which was worked up at another"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with advanced EtOH cirrhosis who presented with a larger right chest wall hematoma after a mechanical fall and recurrent bleeding from the right groin after interventional radiology procedures. The patient has also experienced increasing abdominal distension. The patient has a history of allergies to codeine and rash, as well as previous antibiotic use. He is currently receiving various medications, including morphine sulfate.

24-hour events include recurrent bleeding twice yesterday, with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) administered and interventional radiology procedures without new recommendations other than pressure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/65 mmHg to 93/23 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

Physical examination findings include general appearance of being thin, cardiovascular system with normal heart sounds and a systolic murmur, respiratory system with clear breath sounds, abdomen that is soft with bowel sounds present and distended, tender to touch minimally, peripheral edema in both lower extremities, and jaundice on the skin. Neurologic assessment is incomplete due to the patient's inability to respond or move.

Laboratory results show low hemoglobin levels, elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, low album"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ESLD due to ETOH cirrhosis and coagulopathy. He initially presented with anemia and a large hematoma and was transferred to the MICU for observation after embolization of the intracostal artery. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/59 mmHg to 131/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. 

The patient has been receiving blood products and FFP to manage his coagulopathy and maintain hemodynamic stability. However, he continues to experience groin bleeding episodes, indicating ongoing bleeding risk. 

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR). The presence of Staphylococcus, coagulase-negative, in the urine culture suggests a possible urinary tract infection.

Assessment and plan:
1. Axillary hematoma: The patient underwent embolization of the T9 intercostal artery, but continues to have declining hemoglobin levels and episodes of groin bleeding. It is recommended to give another 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) now, as the INR is > 2"

         STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML
   Assessment and Plan
   62 year-old man with h/o ESLD [**2-10**] ETOH cirrhosis and coagulopathy, who
   initially presented with anemia in the setting of large hematoma and
   was transferred to the MICU today for observation s/p embolization of
   intracostal artery.
   # Right groin bleed/Axillary Hematoma:  s/p  embolization of T9
   intercostal artery ([**8-19**]) with large chest/back hematoma.  Has had at
   least four episodes of groin bleeding since removal of femoral artery
   sheath, for which he has received multiple units of of FFP.  IR and
   vascular surgery following but poor operative candidate.  Amicar
   started on [**8-22**] and bleeding now stabilized with fem stop yesterday
   (pressure device) and dressing.  Heme-onc recommends factor VII if
   re-bleeds.
   - will hold on FFP now, as INR is 2.0 but Hct stable
   - will hold on PRBC for now
   - Vascular Surgery reccs
   - Continue dressing on groin site
   - Continue to monitor Hct daily, no need for TID
   - Morphine prn for pain
   - F/U Transplant surgery and IR reccs
   - will restart amicar infusion if re-bleeds
   - heme onc reccs
   # Diarrhea/Constipation:  Initially had diarrhea most likely [**2-10**]
   lactulose use.  Cdiff negative x2.   Lactulose was restarted two days
   ago in the setting of increased confusion overnight.  Was constipated
   afterward but now with normal BMs.
   - Continue Lactulose daily
   - F/U Cdiff culture
   - F/U KUB read
   # EtOH cirrhosis:  Patient was seen by hepatology on this admission and
   is planning to undergo transplant evaluation upon discharge at [**Hospital1 7684**].  Negative para and negative history of
   encephalopathy/varices.   His abdomen is increasingly distended, [**2-10**]
   blood products given over the past 48 hours.  Hepatology is following
   - Continue lasix, spironolactone
   - f/u hepatology reccs
   # Anemia:  h/o  anemia s/p extensive workup at [**Hospital1 966**] in [**1-17**].  Recent
   colonoscopy/EGD without source of bleed.  DDx includes acute hematoma
   v. underlying liver disease v. diverticulosis, v. portal gastropathy
   etc.  Reportedly guaiac positive stool.
   - Continue to guaiac stools, monitor HCT
   - PO PPI
   - F/[**Location **] GI recommendations. Needs GI f/u as outpatient.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need repeat endoscopy as outpt or if hct worsens
   # UTI: completed Cipro.  No fever spikes and WBC is trending down.  Had
   repeat positive urine cx possible in setting of foley; asymptomatic.
    - F/U Urine culture from today
s U/A.
   # ARF:  Resolved.
   # HTN: The patient has a history of HTN, for which he takes Lasix and
   Aldactone at home.
    - Restarted BP (liver) meds.
   # h/o ETOH: Reports longstanding sobriety. No withdrawal symptoms
   during hospitalization.

","The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of ESLD due to ETOH cirrhosis and coagulopathy. He initially presented with anemia and a large hematoma, and was transferred to the MICU for observation after embolization of the intracostal artery. The patient has had multiple episodes of groin bleeding since the removal of the femoral artery sheath, for which he received multiple units of FFP. Vascular surgery recommended pressure dressing on the hematoma and possible surgery if groin bleeds. Amicar was started on 8/22 and bleeding is now stabilized with the use of a fem stop device. The patient's Hct is stable, but will continue to monitor it daily. Morphine is given as needed for pain.

The patient also has a history of diarrhea and constipation, which was initially thought to be caused by lactulose use. However, the patient's bowel movements have returned to normal after restarting lactulose. Lactulose will be continued, and Cdiff culture will be followed up.

The patient has ETOH cirrhosis and is planning to undergo a transplant evaluation upon discharge at Hospital1. His abdomen is increasingly distended, likely due to blood products given over the past 48 hours. Hepatology is following up on this.

The patient has a history of anemia, with extensive workup at Hospital1 in 1/17. Recent colonoscopy and EGD did not"
