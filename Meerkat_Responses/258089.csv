   24 Hour Events:
   -BP 70s/40s on Right arm->fixed cuff and came up to 90s/50s (baseline
   from admission 110s/70s). Gave 500cc bolus.
   -Weaned off vent
   -Became hypoxic and wouldnt keep O2 on. Got Zyprexa and restraints. CXR
   showed increased pulm edema so gave 20mg IV lasix
   - Head CT negative
   - TTE with new RV dilation (?PAH vs inferior MI) and severe AS (valve =
   0.7cm2) compared to TTE [**2160**] but poor image quality on both.
   - LENIs ordered because family said has had swollen/red LE for 2 weeks
   but u/s wouldnt come up to do them til tomorrow am.
   - Tachycardic to 110s and HTN to 150s so re-started metoprolol.
   - delirious overnight. Got Zydis 5mg X 2 and had to have restraints

   Ca++:8.2 mg/dL, Mg++:1.8 mg/dL, PO4:3.4 mg/dL
   Imaging: Head CT:  1. Right corona radiata hypodensity is age
   indeterminate. This likely an old infarct and chronic microvascular
   disease but MR is more sensitive in establishing acuity.
   2. Unchanged prominence of the left Sylvian fissure with possible
   encephalomalacia in the left MCA territory.
   TTE: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30%). The septum is nearly akinetic and
   the other basal segments moderately hypokinetic. The apex has
   relatively preserved function. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic
   valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
   severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
   (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
   pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with severe septal hypokinesis, moderate
   hypokinesis of the basal to mid segments and relative preservation of
   the apical segments. The degree of aortic stenosis is probably severe
   (velocity falsely LOW due to reduced systolic function). Dilated and
   hypokinetic right ventricle. Mild mitral and moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-18**], direct
   comparison is difficult as both studies are suboptimal. Overall LV
   systolic function is probably similar. The right ventricle now appears
   dilated and hypokinetic. The degree of aortic stenosis has increased.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG, AS, afib with ppm, and CHF was
   admitted s/p cardiac arrest of unclear etiology.
   1. Cardiac Arrest
   Etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, unlikely to be true cardiac
   arrest given interrogation of the pacemaker.  Most likely a mechanical
   fall.  Could possibly be a PE, or syncope from severe AS.
   - Appreciate EP recs. PPM functioning appropriately. Afib when not
   paced but rate only ~100.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - cultures pending
   - head CT negative
   - LENIs today
   - Follow up as O/P with Cards in 1 month
   2. ? PTX
   Patient's CXR had a questionable PTX after intubation. Thoracic surgery
   was consulted in the ED and recommended a follow-up chest X ray X2, no
   evidence of PTX following.
   - Monitor respiratory status
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Resolved.  Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest.
   Patient does not seem to have a clear diagnosis of baseline pulmonary
   disease and there is no clear evidence of new infiltrates or pulmonary
   edema.
   - now weaned off sedation and satting well on face mask (when keeps it
   on)
   - Possible etiology may be CHF given TTE findings and improvement in
   oxygenation with lasix. Conservative diuresis given AS may help
   respiratory status
   4. AS: patient has severe AS on TTE worse than yesterday.  Medical
   management only for now, consider surgical intervention in the future.
   -  [**Month (only) 11**] be cause of syncope and fall
   5. Congestive Heart Failure
   Patient has a history of CHF and had depressed EF on TTE yesterday
   - continue beta blocker and digoxin for now
   - check digoxin level
   - unclear why patient is not on an [**Name (NI) 3291**] but restarted Cozaar yesterday
   - diuresis today
   6. CAD
   Patient has a history of of CAD s/p CABG. No clear history of chest
   pain and ECG looks relatively unchanged from prior.
   - continue aspirin, statin, and beta blocker
   - restarted on [**Last Name (un) 284**]
   7. Depression and Dementia
   Stable
   - continue citalopram, aricept, and Namenda
   7. Hypothyroidism
   Stable
   - continue levothyroxine
   8. GERD
   Stable
   - continue prilosec
   9. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is s/p ppm placement.
   Unclear if he has been anticoagulated in the past. As above EP was
   consulted, interrogated the PPM and found AFib when patient was not
   paced.
   - Will clarify anticoagulation status
   10. Lower Extremity Swelling: With RV dilation on TTE new from prior
   concern for PAH from PE
   - LENIs were ordered for yesterday but not done. Will be done today.
   11. Acidosis
   Resolved.  Patient's acidosis appears most likely related to
   respiratory acidosis in the setting recent intubation and possibly
   hypoventilation, as well as metabolic acidosis in the setting of renal
   failure, slightly elevated lactate, and elevated BUN.
   - consider weaning sedation to allow increased ventilation
   12. Renal Failure
   Unclear of the chronicity of patient's renal failure. Patient has had
   creatinines in the range of 1.3-2 in the past 5-6 years. Etiology
   appears most likely related to hypertension and vascular disease
   - avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - avoid contrast

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 3146**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s). CCU team.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   Doing well. Extubated.  Still somewhat deliriuos.  Echo with severe AS,
   depressed RV function.  I spoke to him and his son [**Name (NI) 117**] - pt would not
   want a second sternotomy and AVR +/- redo-CABG.  He was previously on
   warfarin, but was taken off because he was ""too old for it"", ass to the
   son.  [**Name (NI) **] has not had a lot of falls recently other than his presenting
   episode.
   Plan:
   1. Restart warfarin.
   2. MedRx for CAD.
   3. Avoid vasodilation other [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 284**].
   4. Transfer to stepdown.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), severe aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation with pacemaker placement, congestive heart failure (CHF), depression, dementia, hypothyroidism, GERD, and lower extremity swelling. The patient was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest of unclear etiology.

During the stay in the ICU, the patient's condition has been unstable. There were several significant events including hypotension in the right arm, hypoxia, increased pulmonary edema, new right ventricular (RV) dilation, severe AS, and delirium. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure but has now been successfully extubated.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, and it is likely a mechanical fall rather than a true cardiac arrest. The patient may have experienced syncope from severe AS.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's chest X-ray showed a questionable pulmonary thromboembolism (PTX) after intubation. However, subsequent imaging did not confirm PTX.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure but has since been weaned off sedation and is maintaining oxygenation on a face mask.
4. Severe Aortic Stenosis:"

   Imaging: Head CT:  1. Right corona radiata hypodensity is age
   indeterminate. This likely an old infarct and chronic microvascular
   disease but MR is more sensitive in establishing acuity.
   2. Unchanged prominence of the left Sylvian fissure with possible
   encephalomalacia in the left MCA territory.
   TTE: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30%). The septum is nearly akinetic and
   the other basal segments moderately hypokinetic. The apex has
   relatively preserved function. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic
   valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
   severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
   (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
   pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with severe septal hypokinesis, moderate
   hypokinesis of the basal to mid segments and relative preservation of
   the apical segments. The degree of aortic stenosis is probably severe
   (velocity falsely LOW due to reduced systolic function). Dilated and
   hypokinetic right ventricle. Mild mitral and moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-18**], direct
   comparison is difficult as both studies are suboptimal. Overall LV
   systolic function is probably similar. The right ventricle now appears
   dilated and hypokinetic. The degree of aortic stenosis has increased.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG, afib with ppm, and CHF was
   admitted s/p cardiac arrest of unclear etiology.
   1. Cardiac Arrest
   Etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear. Differential diagnosis
   includes arrhythmia, pacemaker malfunction, arrest secondary to an
   additional medical complication such as sepsis. No clear localizing
   symptoms from prior to event and no localizing signs on exam.
   - EP consult for evaluation of pacemaker
   - ICU monitoring for now
   - broadly culture for now with urine and blood cultures
   - consider head CT once patient is more hemodynamically stable
    - follow-up at [**Hospital3 2469**] regarding patient's clinical status in
   the 24-48 hours prior to admission
   2. ? PTX
   Patient's CXR had a questionable PTX after intubation. Thoracic surgery
   was consulted in the ED and recommended a follow-up chest X ray this
   morning and this afternoon. If there is in fact development of PTX,
   would consider either chest tube or pigtail catheter placement.
   - CXR this morning and this afternoon
   - follow-up with thoracics regarding follow-up CXRs and need for
   pigtail or chest tube
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest. Patient does
   not seem to have a clear diagnosis of baseline pulmonary disease and
   there is no clear evidence of new infiltrates or pulmonary edema.
   - follow-up CXR read
   - consider weaning sedation and vent settings over the course of today
   to consider extubation later today or tomorrow morning
   4. Congestive Heart Failure
   Patient has a history of CHF, although he currently appears euvolemic.
   - continue beta blocker and digoxin for now
   - check digoxin level
   - unclear why patient is not on an [**Name (NI) 3291**]
   5. CAD
   Patient has a history of of CAD s/p CABG. No clear history of chest
   pain and ECG looks relatively unchanged from prior.
   - continue aspirin, statin, and beta blocker
   - unclear why patient is not on an [**Name (NI) 3291**]
   - check ECG on arrival to the floor
   6. Depression and Dementia
   Stable
   - continue citalopram, aricept, and Namenda
   7. Hypothyroidism
   Stable
   - continue levothyroxine
   8. GERD
   Stable
   - continue prilosec
   9. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is s/p ppm placement.
   Unclear if he has been anticoagulated in the past. As above EP was
   consulted, interrogated the PPM and found AFib when patient was not
   paced.
   10. Lower Extremity Swelling: With RV dilation on TTE new from prior
   concern for PAH from PE
   - LENIs were ordered for yesterday but not done. Will be done today.
   11. Severe AS: Patient had TTE showing severe AS (valve area 0.7) worse
   than prior TTE dated [**2160**]. This could have been cause of his fall as he
   could have syncopized from severe AS.
   12. Acidosis
   Patient's acidosis appears most likely related to respiratory acidosis
   in the setting recent intubation and possibly hypoventilation, as well
   as metabolic acidosis in the setting of renal failure, slightly
   elevated lactate, and elevated BUN.
   - re-check ABG
   - consider weaning sedation to allow increased ventilation
   13. Renal Failure
   Unclear of the chronicity of patient's renal failure. Patient has had
   creatinines in the range of 1.3-2 in the past 5-6 years. Etiology
   appears most likely related to hypertension and vascular disease
   - avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - avoid contrast for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation with pacemaker placement, congestive heart failure (CHF), and other medical conditions such as depression, dementia, hypothyroidism, GERD, and renal failure. The patient was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest of unclear etiology.

24-hour events include:
1. Hypotension in the right arm, which improved with the use of a cuff.
2. The patient was weaned off the ventilator but subsequently became hypoxic and uncooperative with oxygen use. He was given Zyprexa and restraints. A chest X-ray showed increased pulmonary edema, so he was given 20mg IV lasix.
3. A head CT was negative for any acute findings. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed new right ventricular dilation, suggesting possible pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or inferior myocardial infarction. The patient also has severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.7 cm2) compared to a prior TTE.
4. The patient has had lower extremity swelling for two weeks, and longitudinal imaging studies (LENIs) were ordered to evaluate for possible pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate were elevated, so metoprolol was restarted.
6. The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and lactate levels.
7. The patient's vital signs have fluctuated, with a maximum temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 77 to 136 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 126/68 to 159/95 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 23 to 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
8. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 3713 mL and an output of 1640 mL.
9. The patient is receiving various medications, including lansoprazole, heparin sodium, furosemide (lasix), and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, and further evaluation is needed.
2. Possible Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's lower extremity swelling and right ventricular dilation on TTE raise suspicion for PE.
3. Severe Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which could have caused syncope and contribute to heart failure.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated during cardiac arrest, and there is a need to assess and manage his respiratory function.
5. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a history of"

   Ca++:8.2 mg/dL, Mg++:1.8 mg/dL, PO4:3.4 mg/dL
   Imaging: Head CT:  1. Right corona radiata hypodensity is age
   indeterminate. This likely an old infarct and chronic microvascular
   disease but MR is more sensitive in establishing acuity.
   2. Unchanged prominence of the left Sylvian fissure with possible
   encephalomalacia in the left MCA territory.
   TTE: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30%). The septum is nearly akinetic and
   the other basal segments moderately hypokinetic. The apex has
   relatively preserved function. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic
   valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
   severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
   (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
   pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with severe septal hypokinesis, moderate
   hypokinesis of the basal to mid segments and relative preservation of
   the apical segments. The degree of aortic stenosis is probably severe
   (velocity falsely LOW due to reduced systolic function). Dilated and
   hypokinetic right ventricle. Mild mitral and moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-18**], direct
   comparison is difficult as both studies are suboptimal. Overall LV
   systolic function is probably similar. The right ventricle now appears
   dilated and hypokinetic. The degree of aortic stenosis has increased.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG, AS, afib with ppm, and CHF was
   admitted s/p cardiac arrest of unclear etiology.
   1. Cardiac Arrest
   Etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear. Differential diagnosis
   includes arrhythmia, AS, PE, arrest secondary to an additional medical
   complication such as sepsis. Family reports leg swelling 2 weeks prior
   to event
 no other localizing symptoms
   - Appreciate EP recs. PPM functioning appropriately. Afib when not
   paced but rate only ~100.
   - ICU monitoring for now
   - cultures pending
   - head CT negative
   2. ? PTX
   Patient's CXR had a questionable PTX after intubation. Thoracic surgery
   was consulted in the ED and recommended a follow-up chest X ray X2. If
   there is in fact development of PTX, would consider either chest tube
   or pigtail catheter placement.
   - F/U final read of CXRs today
   - follow-up with thoracics regarding follow-up CXRs and need for
   pigtail or chest tube if PTX really there
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest. Patient does
   not seem to have a clear diagnosis of baseline pulmonary disease and
   there is no clear evidence of new infiltrates or pulmonary edema.
   - follow-up CXR read
   - now weaned off sedation and satting well on face mask (when keeps it
   on)
   - Possible etiology may be CHF given TTE findings and improvement in
   oxygenation with lasix. Conservative diuresis given AS may help
   respiratory status
   4. AS: patient has severe AS on TTE worse than yesterday.
   -
   5. Congestive Heart Failure
   Patient has a history of CHF and had depressed EF on TTE yesterday
   - continue beta blocker and digoxin for now
   - check digoxin level
   - unclear why patient is not on an [**Name (NI) 3291**] but restarted Cozaar yesterday
   6. CAD
   Patient has a history of of CAD s/p CABG. No clear history of chest
   pain and ECG looks relatively unchanged from prior.
   - continue aspirin, statin, and beta blocker
   - unclear why patient is not on an [**Name (NI) 3291**]
   - check ECG on arrival to the floor
   7. Depression and Dementia
   Stable
   - continue citalopram, aricept, and Namenda
   7. Hypothyroidism
   Stable
   - continue levothyroxine
   8. GERD
   Stable
   - continue prilosec
   9. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is s/p ppm placement.
   Unclear if he has been anticoagulated in the past. As above EP was
   consulted, interrogated the PPM and found AFib when patient was not
   paced.
   10. Lower Extremity Swelling: With RV dilation on TTE new from prior
   concern for PAH from PE
   - LENIs were ordered for yesterday but not done. Will be done today.
   11. Severe AS: Patient had TTE showing severe AS (valve area 0.7) worse
   than prior TTE dated [**2160**]. This could have been cause of his fall as he
   could have syncopized from severe AS.
   12. Acidosis
   Patient's acidosis appears most likely related to respiratory acidosis
   in the setting recent intubation and possibly hypoventilation, as well
   as metabolic acidosis in the setting of renal failure, slightly
   elevated lactate, and elevated BUN.
   - re-check ABG
   - consider weaning sedation to allow increased ventilation
   13. Renal Failure
   Unclear of the chronicity of patient's renal failure. Patient has had
   creatinines in the range of 1.3-2 in the past 5-6 years. Etiology
   appears most likely related to hypertension and vascular disease
   - avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - avoid contrast for now

   Ca++:8.2 mg/dL, Mg++:1.8 mg/dL, PO4:3.4 mg/dL
   Imaging: Head CT:  1. Right corona radiata hypodensity is age
   indeterminate. This likely an old infarct and chronic microvascular
   disease but MR is more sensitive in establishing acuity.
   2. Unchanged prominence of the left Sylvian fissure with possible
   encephalomalacia in the left MCA territory.
   TTE: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30%). The septum is nearly akinetic and
   the other basal segments moderately hypokinetic. The apex has
   relatively preserved function. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic
   valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
   severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
   (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
   pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with severe septal hypokinesis, moderate
   hypokinesis of the basal to mid segments and relative preservation of
   the apical segments. The degree of aortic stenosis is probably severe
   (velocity falsely LOW due to reduced systolic function). Dilated and
   hypokinetic right ventricle. Mild mitral and moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-18**], direct
   comparison is difficult as both studies are suboptimal. Overall LV
   systolic function is probably similar. The right ventricle now appears
   dilated and hypokinetic. The degree of aortic stenosis has increased.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG, AS, afib with ppm, and CHF was
   admitted s/p cardiac arrest of unclear etiology.
   1. Cardiac Arrest
   Etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, unlikely to be true cardiac
   arrest given interrogation of the pacemaker.
   - Appreciate EP recs. PPM functioning appropriately. Afib when not
   paced but rate only ~100.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - cultures pending
   - head CT negative
   2. ? PTX
   Patient's CXR had a questionable PTX after intubation. Thoracic surgery
   was consulted in the ED and recommended a follow-up chest X ray X2, no
   evidence of PTX following.
   - Monitor respiratory status
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest. Patient does
   not seem to have a clear diagnosis of baseline pulmonary disease and
   there is no clear evidence of new infiltrates or pulmonary edema.
   - follow-up CXR read
   - now weaned off sedation and satting well on face mask (when keeps it
   on)
   - Possible etiology may be CHF given TTE findings and improvement in
   oxygenation with lasix. Conservative diuresis given AS may help
   respiratory status
   4. AS: patient has severe AS on TTE worse than yesterday.
   -
   5. Congestive Heart Failure
   Patient has a history of CHF and had depressed EF on TTE yesterday
   - continue beta blocker and digoxin for now
   - check digoxin level
   - unclear why patient is not on an [**Name (NI) 3291**] but restarted Cozaar yesterday
   6. CAD
   Patient has a history of of CAD s/p CABG. No clear history of chest
   pain and ECG looks relatively unchanged from prior.
   - continue aspirin, statin, and beta blocker
   - unclear why patient is not on an [**Name (NI) 3291**]
   - check ECG on arrival to the floor
   7. Depression and Dementia
   Stable
   - continue citalopram, aricept, and Namenda
   7. Hypothyroidism
   Stable
   - continue levothyroxine
   8. GERD
   Stable
   - continue prilosec
   9. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is s/p ppm placement.
   Unclear if he has been anticoagulated in the past. As above EP was
   consulted, interrogated the PPM and found AFib when patient was not
   paced.
   10. Lower Extremity Swelling: With RV dilation on TTE new from prior
   concern for PAH from PE
   - LENIs were ordered for yesterday but not done. Will be done today.
   11. Severe AS: Patient had TTE showing severe AS (valve area 0.7) worse
   than prior TTE dated [**2160**]. This could have been cause of his fall as he
   could have syncopized from severe AS.
   12. Acidosis
   Patient's acidosis appears most likely related to respiratory acidosis
   in the setting recent intubation and possibly hypoventilation, as well
   as metabolic acidosis in the setting of renal failure, slightly
   elevated lactate, and elevated BUN.
   - re-check ABG
   - consider weaning sedation to allow increased ventilation
   13. Renal Failure
   Unclear of the chronicity of patient's renal failure. Patient has had
   creatinines in the range of 1.3-2 in the past 5-6 years. Etiology
   appears most likely related to hypertension and vascular disease
   - avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - avoid contrast for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation with pacemaker placement, congestive heart failure (CHF), and other comorbidities. He was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest of unclear etiology. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He is currently in the ICU and is being treated for various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but it is unlikely to be a true cardiac arrest since the pacemaker was functioning appropriately. The patient should be monitored on telemetry, and cultures should be pending.
2. Possible Pulmonary Thromboembolism (PTX): The patient's chest X-ray showed a questionable PTX after intubation. Thoracic surgery recommended a follow-up chest X-ray, which did not show evidence of PTX. The patient should be monitored for respiratory status.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated during the cardiac arrest. There is no clear evidence of new infiltrates or pulmonary edema, but the patient may have respiratory failure due to CHF, as indicated by TTE findings and improvement in oxygenation with Lasix. Conservative diuresis should be continued to help respiratory status.
4. Severe Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe AS"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous cardiac arrest, severe aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure, was admitted for cardiac arrest of unclear etiology. 

During the past 24 hours, the patient experienced several events. His blood pressure in the right arm was low, but improved with fluid administration. He was weaned off the ventilator but became hypoxic and uncooperative, requiring restraints and oxygen supplementation. A chest X-ray showed increased pulmonary edema, so Lasix was given. A head CT was negative for any acute abnormalities. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed right ventricular dilation, severe aortic stenosis, and signs of heart failure. Lower extremity swelling was also noted.

The patient has multiple medical conditions and complications, including possible pulmonary thromboembolism, respiratory failure, severe aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, depression, dementia, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease, atrial fibrillation, and renal failure.

Plan:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The cause of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but mechanical fall is suspected. Monitor on telemetry and follow up with cardiology in one month.
2. Possible Pulmonary Thromboembolism (PTX): The patient's chest X-ray showed a questionable PTX after intubation. No evidence of PTX was seen on a follow-up chest X-ray. Monitor respiratory status.
3. Respiratory Failure: Resolved. The patient was intubated due to cardiac arrest. There is no clear diagnosis of baseline pulmonary disease and no new infiltrates or pulmonary edema.
4. Severe Aortic Stenosis: Medical management only for now, considering surgical intervention in the future.
5. Congestive Heart Failure: Continue beta-blocker and digoxin for now, check digoxin level, and consider diuresis.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: Continue aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker therapy.
7. Depression and Dementia: Stable. Continue citalopram, aricept, and Namenda.
8. Hypothyroidism: Stable. Continue levothyroxine.
9. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: Stable. Continue prilosec.
10. Atrial Fibrillation: Will clarify anticoagulation status and consult electrophysiology.

   Imaging: Head CT:  1. Right corona radiata hypodensity is age
   indeterminate. This likely an old infarct and chronic microvascular
   disease but MR is more sensitive in establishing acuity.
   2. Unchanged prominence of the left Sylvian fissure with possible
   encephalomalacia in the left MCA territory.
   TTE: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30%). The septum is nearly akinetic and
   the other basal segments moderately hypokinetic. The apex has
   relatively preserved function. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic
   valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
   severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
   (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
   pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with severe septal hypokinesis, moderate
   hypokinesis of the basal to mid segments and relative preservation of
   the apical segments. The degree of aortic stenosis is probably severe
   (velocity falsely LOW due to reduced systolic function). Dilated and
   hypokinetic right ventricle. Mild mitral and moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-18**], direct
   comparison is difficult as both studies are suboptimal. Overall LV
   systolic function is probably similar. The right ventricle now appears
   dilated and hypokinetic. The degree of aortic stenosis has increased.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. He presented to the hospital with complaints of chest pain and was found to have an acute inferior myocardial infarction (MI) with right ventricular involvement. He underwent emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the right coronary artery. The patient initially improved but then developed hemodynamic instability and required intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) for stabilization. However, he continued to deteriorate and required emergent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). The patient was successfully resuscitated and intubated but remained in cardiac arrest for approximately 45 minutes. After return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the patient was transferred to the ICU for further management.

Since admission to the ICU, the patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) mode. His initial vital signs were stable with blood pressure in the 110s systolic and 70s diastolic range. However, over the past 24 hours, the patient has experienced several significant events. 

Firstly, his blood pressure dropped to the 70s systolic and 40s diastolic range, prompting the administration of a 500cc bolus of intravenous fluids. He was also weaned off the ventilator but subsequently became hypoxic and"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG, afib with ppm, and CHF was
   admitted s/p cardiac arrest of unclear etiology.
   1. Cardiac Arrest
   Etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear. Differential diagnosis
   includes arrhythmia, pacemaker malfunction, arrest secondary to an
   additional medical complication such as sepsis. No clear localizing
   symptoms from prior to event and no localizing signs on exam.
   - EP consult for evaluation of pacemaker
   - ICU monitoring for now
   - broadly culture for now with urine and blood cultures
   - consider head CT once patient is more hemodynamically stable
    - follow-up at [**Hospital3 2469**] regarding patient's clinical status in
   the 24-48 hours prior to admission
   2. ? PTX
   Patient's CXR had a questionable PTX after intubation. Thoracic surgery
   was consulted in the ED and recommended a follow-up chest X ray this
   morning and this afternoon. If there is in fact development of PTX,
   would consider either chest tube or pigtail catheter placement.
   - CXR this morning and this afternoon
   - follow-up with thoracics regarding follow-up CXRs and need for
   pigtail or chest tube
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest. Patient does
   not seem to have a clear diagnosis of baseline pulmonary disease and
   there is no clear evidence of new infiltrates or pulmonary edema.
   - follow-up CXR read
   - consider weaning sedation and vent settings over the course of today
   to consider extubation later today or tomorrow morning
   4. Congestive Heart Failure
   Patient has a history of CHF, although he currently appears euvolemic.
   - continue beta blocker and digoxin for now
   - check digoxin level
   - unclear why patient is not on an [**Name (NI) 3291**]
   5. CAD
   Patient has a history of of CAD s/p CABG. No clear history of chest
   pain and ECG looks relatively unchanged from prior.
   - continue aspirin, statin, and beta blocker
   - unclear why patient is not on an [**Name (NI) 3291**]
   - check ECG on arrival to the floor
   6. Depression and Dementia
   Stable
   - continue citalopram, aricept, and Namenda
   7. Hypothyroidism
   Stable
   - continue levothyroxine
   8. GERD
   Stable
   - continue prilosec
   9. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is s/p ppm placement.
   Unclear if he has been anticoagulated in the past.
   - EP consult in the AM to evaluate ppm function
   10. Acidosis
   Patient's acidosis appears most likely related to respiratory acidosis
   in the setting recent intubation and possibly hypoventilation, as well
   as metabolic acidosis in the setting of renal failure, slightly
   elevated lactate, and elevated BUN.
   - re-check ABG
   - consider weaning sedation to allow increased ventilation
   11. Renal Failure
   Unclear of the chronicity of patient's renal failure. Patient has had
   creatinines in the range of 1.3-2 in the past 5-6 years. Etiology
   appears most likely related to hypertension and vascular disease
   - avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - avoid contrast for now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), atrial fibrillation with pacemaker placement, congestive heart failure (CHF), and other comorbidities, was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest of unclear etiology. The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with fluctuations in blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.

The patient underwent various interventions including intubation, administration of medications such as Zyprexa, lasix, and metoprolol, and insertion of a chest tube for suspected pneumothorax. Imaging studies including a head CT and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) were performed, showing evidence of chronic microvascular disease, encephalomalacia in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory, dilated left and right atria, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with preserved apical function, severe aortic stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear. Differential diagnosis includes arrhythmia, pacemaker malfunction, or arrest secondary to an additional medical complication such as sepsis. Monitoring in the ICU, evaluation of pacemaker function, and cultures have been ordered.

   FINDINGS: Since yesterday, interstitial edema increased and lung
   volumes are
   lower. Bibasilar opacities are unchanged, likely atelectasis. Bilateral
   pleural effusions are also increased, now small-to-moderate. Wires of
   sternotomy are intact. Single-chamber pacemaker ends in the right
   ventricle.
   There is no pneumothorax. The aorta is tortuous with deviation of the
   trachea. Narrowing of the transverse diameter of the trachea at the
   level of
   the thoracic inlet could be due to post-intubation edema or
   tracheomalacia.

   Negative for DVT
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG, AS, afib with ppm, and CHF was
   admitted s/p cardiac arrest of unclear etiology.
   1. Cardiac Arrest
   Etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, unlikely to be true cardiac
   arrest given interrogation of the pacemaker.  Most likely a mechanical
   fall.  Could possibly be a PE, or syncope from severe AS.
   - Appreciate EP recs. PPM functioning appropriately. Afib when not
   paced but rate only ~100. F/U device clinic in 1 month.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - cultures pending
   - LENIs negative
   - Follow up as O/P with Cards in 1 month
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Resolved.  Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest.
   Patient does not seem to have a clear diagnosis of baseline pulmonary
   disease and there is no clear evidence of new infiltrates or pulmonary
   edema.
   - now weaned off sedation and satting well on face mask (when keeps it
   on)
   - Possible etiology may be CHF given TTE findings and improvement in
   oxygenation with lasix. Conservative diuresis given AS may help
   respiratory status
   - Ctes to have tracheal edema from intubation on CXR which may
   contribute to decreased sats. This should continue to improve over next
   few days. Advance diet slowly given risk of choking.
   4. Congestive Heart Failure
   Patient has a history of CHF and had depressed EF on TTE
   - continue beta blocker, coxaar and digoxin for now
   - With elevated sodium and creatinine likely slightly over-diuresed
   yesterday. Hold off further diuresis today and encourage PO free water
   intake as able.
   5. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is s/p ppm placement.
   Unclear if he has been anticoagulated in the past. As above EP was
   consulted, interrogated the PPM and found AFib when patient was not
   paced.
   - Started warfarin yesterday for CVA ppx after discussing with family
   risks/benefits of coumadin. INR 1.2 today. No need for
   heparin->coumadin bridge
   6. Lower Extremity Swelling: With RV dilation on TTE new from prior
   concern for PAH from PE
   - LENIs negative. Possible etiology may be knee replacement on that
   side.
   7. Hypernatremia: Likely [**1-2**] over-diuresis and poor PO intake with
   delirium and recent intubation.
   - Will encourage PO fluid intake.
   - Will be cautious with IVF given severe AS and CHF but if necessary
   will give some fluid
   8. Renal Failure
   Unclear of the chronicity of patient's renal failure. Patient has had
   creatinines in the range of 1.3-2 in the past 5-6 years. 2.2
   today->likely from over-diuresis as above combined with poor PO intake.
   -          Encourage POs
   -          Renally dose medications
   -          Avoid contrast

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous cardiac artery bypass graft (CABG), aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker placement, and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest of unclear etiology. The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, and he has been weaned off sedation. His congestive heart failure is being managed with beta blockers, coxar, and digoxin. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was started on warfarin for CVA prophylaxis. There is concern for pulmonary embolism (PE) and right ventricular (RV) dilation on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient has lower extremity swelling, hypernatremia, and renal failure. He is expected to be transferred to the rehabilitation unit soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but it is unlikely to be true cardiac arrest given the functioning pacemaker. Possible causes may include mechanical fall, pulmonary embolism (PE), or syncope from severe AS.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had respiratory failure that has since resolved. However, there may be a possible etiology of CHF given TTE findings and improvement in oxygenation with lasix. Conservative diuresis is being used due to"

   - Possible etiology may be CHF given TTE findings and improvement in
   oxygenation with lasix. Conservative diuresis given AS may help
   respiratory status
   - Ctes to have tracheal edema from intubation on CXR which may
   contribute to decreased sats. This should continue to improve over next
   few days. Advance diet slowly given risk of choking.

   7. Hypernatremia: Likely [**1-2**] over-diuresis and poor PO intake with
   delirium and recent intubation.
   - Will encourage PO fluid intake.
   - Will be cautious with IVF given severe AS and CHF but if necessary
   will give some fluid

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous cardiac artery bypass grafting (CABG), aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation with pacemaker placement (PPM), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest of unclear etiology.

The patient has shown improvement in respiratory failure, as he has been weaned off sedation and is maintaining oxygenation on a face mask. However, there are concerns regarding tracheal edema from intubation, which may contribute to decreased saturation levels. The patient's congestive heart failure (CHF) is being managed with beta-blockers, coxar, and digoxin. 

The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been started on warfarin for anticoagulation prophylaxis after discussing the risks and benefits with the family. His INR level is currently at 1.2.

Lower extremity swelling is present, and there is concern for possible pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) due to a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to over-diuresis and poor oral intake.

Renal failure is also noted, with a creatinine level of 2.2 today. This may be attributed to over-diuresis combined with poor oral intake. The patient's renal function will be closely monitored, and medications will"

   lower. Bibasilar opacities are unchanged, likely atelectasis. Bilateral
   pleural effusions are also increased, now small-to-moderate. Wires of
   sternotomy are intact. Single-chamber pacemaker ends in the right
   ventricle.
   There is no pneumothorax. The aorta is tortuous with deviation of the
   trachea. Narrowing of the transverse diameter of the trachea at the
   level of
   the thoracic inlet could be due to post-intubation edema or
   tracheomalacia.

   Negative for DVT
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG, AS, afib with ppm, and CHF was
   admitted s/p cardiac arrest of unclear etiology.
   1. Cardiac Arrest
   Etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, unlikely to be true cardiac
   arrest given interrogation of the pacemaker.  Most likely a mechanical
   fall.  Could possibly be a PE, or syncope from severe AS.
   - Appreciate EP recs. PPM functioning appropriately. Afib when not
   paced but rate only ~100. F/U device clinic in 1 month.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - cultures pending
   - LENIs negative
   - Follow up as O/P with Cards in 1 month
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Resolved.  Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest.
   Patient does not seem to have a clear diagnosis of baseline pulmonary
   disease and there is no clear evidence of new infiltrates or pulmonary
   edema.
   - now weaned off sedation and satting well on face mask (when keeps it
   on)
   - Possible etiology may be CHF given TTE findings and improvement in
   oxygenation with lasix. Conservative diuresis given AS may help
   respiratory status
   - Ctes to have tracheal edema from intubation on CXR which may
   contribute to decreased sats. This should continue to improve over next

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male with a chief complaint of delirium/confusion. He has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions, including warfarin initiation, diet advancement, and respiratory support. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate between 71-84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/61-147/100 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-28 breaths per minute, and SpO2 at 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated. Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems, but there is evidence of right elbow ecchymoses and skin tear. Laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's condition remains unchanged since admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's chief complaint is delirium/confusion, which can be associated with various underlying causes such as infections, medication effects, metabolic imbalances, or organ dysfunction.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The presence of right elbow ecchymoses and skin tear suggests potential impaired skin integrity, which may be due to trauma, pressure injury, or compromised blood clotting.
3. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS): The patient requires respiratory support, indicating acute respiratory failure. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying"

   CXR
   FINDINGS: Since yesterday, interstitial edema increased and lung
   volumes are
   lower. Bibasilar opacities are unchanged, likely atelectasis. Bilateral
   pleural effusions are also increased, now small-to-moderate. Wires of
   sternotomy are intact. Single-chamber pacemaker ends in the right
   ventricle.
   There is no pneumothorax. The aorta is tortuous with deviation of the
   trachea. Narrowing of the transverse diameter of the trachea at the
   level of
   the thoracic inlet could be due to post-intubation edema or
   tracheomalacia.
   LENI (R)
   Negative for DVT
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG, AS, afib with ppm, and CHF was
   admitted s/p cardiac arrest of unclear etiology.
   1. Cardiac Arrest
   Etiology of the cardiac arrest is unclear, unlikely to be true cardiac
   arrest given interrogation of the pacemaker.  Most likely a mechanical
   fall.  Could possibly be a PE, or syncope from severe AS.
   - Appreciate EP recs. PPM functioning appropriately. Afib when not
   paced but rate only ~100.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - cultures pending
   - head CT negative
   - LENIs today
   - Follow up as O/P with Cards in 1 month
   2. ? PTX
   Patient's CXR had a questionable PTX after intubation. Thoracic surgery
   was consulted in the ED and recommended a follow-up chest X ray X2, no
   evidence of PTX following.
   - Monitor respiratory status
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Resolved.  Patient was intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest.
   Patient does not seem to have a clear diagnosis of baseline pulmonary
   disease and there is no clear evidence of new infiltrates or pulmonary
   edema.
   - now weaned off sedation and satting well on face mask (when keeps it
   on)
   - Possible etiology may be CHF given TTE findings and improvement in
   oxygenation with lasix. Conservative diuresis given AS may help
   respiratory status
   4. AS: patient has severe AS on TTE worse than yesterday.  Medical
   management only for now, consider surgical intervention in the future.
   -  [**Month (only) 11**] be cause of syncope and fall
   5. Congestive Heart Failure
   Patient has a history of CHF and had depressed EF on TTE yesterday
   - continue beta blocker and digoxin for now
   - check digoxin level
   - unclear why patient is not on an [**Name (NI) 3291**] but restarted Cozaar yesterday
   - diuresis today
   6. CAD
   Patient has a history of of CAD s/p CABG. No clear history of chest
   pain and ECG looks relatively unchanged from prior.
   - continue aspirin, statin, and beta blocker
   - restarted on [**Last Name (un) 284**]
   7. Depression and Dementia
   Stable
   - continue citalopram, aricept, and Namenda
   7. Hypothyroidism
   Stable
   - continue levothyroxine
   8. GERD
   Stable
   - continue prilosec
   9. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is s/p ppm placement.
   Unclear if he has been anticoagulated in the past. As above EP was
   consulted, interrogated the PPM and found AFib when patient was not
   paced.
   - Will clarify anticoagulation status
   10. Lower Extremity Swelling: With RV dilation on TTE new from prior
   concern for PAH from PE
   - LENIs were ordered for yesterday but not done. Will be done today.
   11. Acidosis
   Resolved.  Patient's acidosis appears most likely related to
   respiratory acidosis in the setting recent intubation and possibly
   hypoventilation, as well as metabolic acidosis in the setting of renal
   failure, slightly elevated lactate, and elevated BUN.
   - consider weaning sedation to allow increased ventilation
   12. Renal Failure
   Unclear of the chronicity of patient's renal failure. Patient has had
   creatinines in the range of 1.3-2 in the past 5-6 years. Etiology
   appears most likely related to hypertension and vascular disease
   - avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - avoid contrast

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of cardiac artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker placement (PPM), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted after experiencing a cardiac arrest of unclear etiology. 

On the current day, the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/61 to 147/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient is intubated and sedated. 

Physical examination reveals an elderly male lying in bed, with no abnormal findings in the genitourinary or musculoskeletal systems. Chest examination shows clear lungs without any wheezes or crackles. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (1.7-2.2 mg/dL), potassium (4.6-5.1 mEq/L), and BUN (28-41 mg/dL). Other lab values are within normal limits. 

Chest X-ray indicates interstitial edema, lower lung volumes, bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis, small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, and no pneumothorax. The trachea is deviated"
