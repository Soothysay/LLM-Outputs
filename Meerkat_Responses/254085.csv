   Chief Complaint:  fever, hypotension, respiratory distress
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient initially tried on bipap with continuing hypoxemia, almost
   intubated then she was put on a nonrebreather with improvement in her
   sats, put her back on her home CPAP, the night went well after that
   point
   - concern for possible PE, started heparin gtt, if patient needs CT
   scan will have to go to [**Hospital Ward Name **] due to weight
   - had some hematuria while on her heparin gtt, urine still passing
   without difficulty, will try to keep patient on lower end of
   therapeutic range
   - BNP 4800, good urine output to 20 mg IV lasix overnight, breathing
   improved, another 20 mg IV lasix given this AM
   - heparin started at [**2134**]/hr
 1650 u/hr.  Heparin held briefly this AM
   for PTT > 150 now 1150 u/hr

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 65yo female with multiple medical problems
   including Type 2 Diabetes mellitus, morbid obesity, COPD, and pulmonary
   embolism was admitted with fevers that appear to be d/t R panniculitis
   who is now being transfered to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # respiratory failure: on presentation, Ph 7.27, Co2 55. Patient with
   waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] mental status. Given hx COPD, wheezing and cough,
   etiology of hypercarbia/hypoixia is likely combination of COPD/reactive
   airways disease in context of potential URI, restrictive ventilatory
   defect by PFTs in past. Past ECHO suggestive of component of diastolic
   dysfunction and CXR with mild pulm edema and cardiomegaly, so likely
   component of CHF.  There is also likely as component of obstructive
   sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation.
   - prednisone 60mg daily.  Rapid taper by end of weekend
   - cont azithromycin for atypical coverage
   - continue nebs
   - BiPap as needed throughout the day with trials off.  Adjust O2
   delivery as needed for O2 sats >90.
   - TBB negative 2 L yesterday and another 1-2L this AM.  Will hold
   further lasix for now and allow her to regulate, especially in context
   of decreased PO intake.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to adjust O/P lasix regimen.
   .
   # h/o Pulmonary Embolism: Patient is currently anticoagulated, although
   is now subtherapeutic. Patient has been on 2.5mg q M Fr and 5mg the
   other days of the week. Received 5mg x 1 on admission, now 2.3.
   Although clinical suspicion for PE was low, given hx of PE on coumadin
   and some tachycardia, decided to bridge back to therapeutic INR with
   heparin drip.
   - will give 2.5 mg daily due to possible interaction with abx and
   follow INR daily
   - continue heparin gtt for goal overlap with therapeutic INR of 24
   hours.  Titrate to PTT 60-80.  If INR therapeutic tomorrow AM, can d/c
   heparin.
   .
   # Panniliculitis:
   - on Vanc, Clindamycin
   - appreciate ID reccs and will discuss with ID final course of abx.
   Will likely need PICC for continued vancomycin dosing.
   .
   ## Gout: Stable; continue allopurinol per home regimen
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Stable. continue statin
   .
   # Depression: Stable. continue citalopram and anxiety
   .
   # Urinary Incontinence: Stable.
   - continue home regimen with fesoterodine, vesicare
   - continue nitrofurantoin for urinary tract infection prophylaxis
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Stable, continue home regimen of levothyroxine
   supplementation
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, controlled and without complications:
   Stable
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Chronic Pain: Stable. continue MS contin, percocet, and tylenol prn
   .
   # GERD: Stable. Continue home regimen with PPI and H2 blocker
   .
   # Seasonal Allergies: Stable
   - continue loratadine and benadryl
   .
   # Cholelithiasis: Stable. Continue ursodiol
   .
   # Skin Tears: Patient has evidence of active skin fungal infections
   given her pannus.
   - miconazole powder
   - skin care consult
   .
   # FEN: clears for now, will advance as tolerated throughout day
   depending on how does off mask.
   - continue multivitamin, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D, vitamin C,
   calcium, and iron

s respiratory status improved with diuresis, net negative
   over 3L since admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], would continue to monitor I/O for
   now, and if auto-diuresing no need for further lasix at this time.
   Would give patient breaks from CPAP to see how she does on RA, also
   trials on NC to see what she can tolerate as her oxygenation is
   improving.  Agree with rapid steroid taper.  For panniculitis, ID is
   following, seems to be improving on vanc/clinda, will f/u with ID about
   abx course, will need PICC placement for abx course.  Additionally,
   recent hematuria, likely related to recent foley trauma and
   supratherapeutic PTT, is already clearing, will continue to monitor.
   If respiratory status continues to improve likely call out this
   afternoon.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, morbid obesity, COPD, and pulmonary embolism. She was admitted with fevers and is now being transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status has improved with diuresis, and her oxygenation is improving. She is currently on CPAP and will be given breaks to see how she does on RA. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates a potential complication related to her underlying COPD and possible obstructive sleep apnea.
2. Panniculitis: The patient has active skin fungal infections on her pannus, which may require further treatment and management.
3. Gout: Although stable, the patient has a history of gout and should continue her home regimen of allopurinol.
4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is stable and should continue with her home regimen of statin medication.
5. Depression and Anxiety: The patient's depression and anxiety are stable and should continue with her current medications.
6. Urinary Incontinence: The patient's urinary incontinence is stable and should continue with her home regimen of fesoterodine and vesicare.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is stable and should continue with her"

   - TBB negative 2 L yesterday and another 1-2L this AM.  Will hold
   further lasix for now and allow her to regulate, especially in context
   of decreased PO intake.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to adjust O/P lasix regimen.

   # h/o Pulmonary Embolism: Patient is currently anticoagulated, although
   is now subtherapeutic. Patient has been on 2.5mg q M Fr and 5mg the
   other days of the week. Received 5mg x 1 on admission, now 2.3.
   Although clinical suspicion for PE was low, given hx of PE on coumadin
   and some tachycardia, decided to bridge back to therapeutic INR with
   heparin drip.
   - will give 2.5 mg daily due to possible interaction with abx and
   follow INR daily
   - continue heparin gtt for goal overlap with therapeutic INR of 24
   hours.  Titrate to PTT 60-80.  If INR therapeutic tomorrow AM, can d/c
   heparin.
   .
   # Panniliculitis:
   - on Vanc, Clindamycin
   - appreciate ID reccs and will discuss with ID final course of abx.
   Will likely need PICC for continued vancomycin dosing.

   Would give patient breaks from CPAP to see how she does on RA, also
   trials on NC to see what she can tolerate as her oxygenation is
   improving.  Agree with rapid steroid taper.  For panniculitis, ID is
   following, seems to be improving on vanc/clinda, will f/u with ID about

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  65 F w/ morbid obesity, OSA, DM2, h/o PE on
   coumadin, asthma, p a-fib and recurrent panniculiitis admitted [**9-29**] w/
   fever, leukocytosis/bandemia w/ panniculitis as well as hacking
   cough. Transferred to ICU for hypercarbic and hypoxemix resp failure.
   Her respiratory status improved with diuresis and O2 requirements
   decreased, still on autoset-CPAP.  We are bridging with heparin gtt
   given suptheraprutic INR on transfer and hx PE.
   AF 131/73  70-117  19  100% CPAP auto + 6L  Remains alert and
   comfortable in NAD. BS are distant but wheeze is improved. RR, obese
   soft NT abd, erythema over R panus improving,
   Labs reviewed: 7.38/47/86 (high flow neb), BNP 4800, wbc 10.2, K+ 5.0,
   cr 1.3 glu 252, INR 2.3.  CXR continues to show full hillar vessels and
   mild interstitial edema.
   A/p: Respiratory status is much improved after diuresis. Suspect pulm
   edema/volume overload is etiology of her presentation though we
   continue to cover with heparin drip given hx of PE and subtherapeutic
   INR.  Her u/o remains excellent without additional lasix.  Agree with
   plan to monitor I/Os for goal neg 1-2 L fluid balance, using lasix if
   needed.  Can transition to humidified NC O2 to maintain sats 90-92%,
   using cpap intermittently.  Will continue azithro as suspect some
   contribution from reactive airways to viral or bacterial bronchitis,
   but would taper steroids quickly over next few days. Her panniculitis
   is improving on vanco and clinda. D/w ID length of course as she will
   likely need picc placement.  We continue hep bridge/overlap today.  Her
   INR will need to be followed closely in setting of antibx. We will
   tighten her SSI.  Her blood sugar control should improve as we decrease
   the steroids.  She is full code.
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note. Full code, PIVs,
   PPI/H2B.
   Will watch in ICU, though if can likely return to floor later today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with multiple medical problems including type 2 diabetes mellitus, morbid obesity, COPD, and pulmonary embolism. She was admitted with fevers, which appear to be due to right panniculitis, and is now being transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has waxing and waning mental status, alternating between alertness and drowsiness. She is on CPAP with improved oxygenation but still requires intermittent use of nonrebreather mask. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and adjustment of ventilatory support will be necessary.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is currently anticoagulated with heparin. It is important to monitor her INR levels closely and ensure therapeutic anticoagulation to prevent further clot formation.
3. Panniculitis: The patient has right panniculitis, which may require further evaluation and treatment by an infectious disease specialist. She is currently receiving antibiotics but may need a change in antibiotic regimen based on culture results.
4. Diabetic Complications: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, and her blood sugar control should be monitored closely, especially as steroid therapy is tapered.

","The patient's medical history includes a previous attempt at using BiPAP due to hypoxemia, which resulted in almost intubation. She was then placed on a nonrebreather mask and showed improvement in her oxygen saturation levels before being put back on her home CPAP. There is also a concern for possible pulmonary embolism (PE), and she has been started on heparin. However, the patient experienced hematuria while on heparin, and her urine output has been normal. The medical team is trying to keep her on the lower end of the therapeutic range for heparin.

In terms of allergies, the patient is allergic to ciprofloxacin, Bactrim, levofloxacin, sertraline, adhesive tape, and keflex. She carries a bee sting kit due to an anaphylactic reaction in the past.

The patient received doses of vancomycin, azithromycin, and clindamycin on October 1st. She is currently receiving a heparin infusion and has been prescribed furosemide (Lasix) as well.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted events. The flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant measurements. The patient's temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate are within normal ranges. She is currently on CPAP support and her oxygen saturation is at"

   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Ph 7.27, Co2 55. Patient with waxing
   and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] mental status. Given hx COPD, wheezing and cough, etiology
   of hypercarbic is likely secondary to COPD - although PFT's show
   restrictive ventilatory defect. There is also likely as component of
   obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation.
   - prednisone 60mg daily
   - cont azithromycin

   - BiPap
   .
   # Intermittent hypoxia: Patient's saturations range from 84-96%on Fi02
   50%. Desaturations seem to correspond to airway occlusion and mask leak
   suggesting obstructive sleep apnea. PE is also possible given hx PE and
   subterapeutic INR; however, patient's clinical presentation with
   wheezing and cough seems more c/w with COPD exacerbation at this time.
   Of note, pt r/o for flu.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including Type 2 Diabetes mellitus, morbid obesity, COPD, and pulmonary embolism. She was admitted with fevers that appear to be due to right panniculitis and is now being transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes intermittent hypoxia, possible pulmonary embolism, panniculitis, gout, hyperlipidemia, depression, urinary incontinence, hypothyroidism, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, chronic pain, GERD, history of pulmonary embolism, seasonal allergies, cholelithiasis, and skin tears.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's pH is 7.27, and CO2 level is 55. Given her history of COPD, wheezing, and cough, the etiology of hypercarbic is likely secondary to COPD - although PFT's show restrictive ventilatory defect. There is also likely a component of obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation.

   failure.
   .
   # respiratory failure: on presentation, Ph 7.27, Co2 55. Patient with
   waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] mental status. Given hx COPD, wheezing and cough,
   etiology of hypercarbia/hypoixia is likely combination of COPD/reactive
   airways disease in context of potential URI, restrictive ventilatory
   defect by PFTs in past. Past ECHO suggestive of component of diastolic
   dysfunction and CXR with mild pulm edema and cardiomegaly, so likely
   component of CHF.  There is also likely as component of obstructive
   sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation.
   - prednisone 60mg daily.  Rapid taper by end of weekend
   - cont azithromycin for atypical coverage
   - continue nebs
   - BiPap as needed throughout the day with trials off.  Adjust O2
   delivery as needed for O2 sats >90.
   - TBB negative 2 L yesterday and another 1-2L this AM.  Will hold
   further lasix for now and allow her to regulate, especially in context
   of decreased PO intake.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to adjust O/P lasix regimen.

   Although clinical suspicion for PE was low, given hx of PE on coumadin
   and some tachycardia, decided to bridge back to therapeutic INR with
   heparin drip.
   - will give 2.5 mg daily due to possible interaction with abx and
   follow INR daily
   - continue heparin gtt for goal overlap with therapeutic INR of 24
   hours.  Titrate to PTT 60-80.  If INR therapeutic tomorrow AM, can d/c
   heparin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with multiple medical problems including Type 2 Diabetes mellitus, morbid obesity, COPD, and pulmonary embolism. She was admitted with fevers, suspected to be due to right panniculitis, and is now being transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can be caused by exacerbations of underlying lung conditions such as COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of fever and respiratory distress raises concern for a possible pneumonia, especially considering the patient's recent use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and potential aspiration risk.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: Although the clinical suspicion for PE was low, the patient has a history of PE and is currently anticoagulated. Monitoring for signs of recurrent PE is essential.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's high glucose level of 252 mg/dL indicates hyperglycemia, which needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent the development of DKA.
5. Gout: The patient has a history of gout, and it is important to monitor for any signs of acute gout flare-up due to medications or changes in"

   embolism was admitted with fevers that appear to be d/t R panniculitis
   who is now being transfered to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure.

   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Ph 7.27, Co2 55. Patient with waxing
   and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] mental status. Given hx COPD, wheezing and cough, etiology
   of hypercarbic is likely secondary to COPD - although PFT's show
   restrictive ventilatory defect. There is also likely as component of
   obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation.

   # Intermittent hypoxia: Patient's saturations range from 84-96%on Fi02
   50%. Desaturations seem to correspond to airway occlusion and mask leak
   suggesting obstructive sleep apnea. PE is also possible given hx PE and
   subterapeutic INR; however, patient's clinical presentation with
   wheezing and cough seems more c/w with COPD exacerbation at this time.

","The patient's chief complaint is fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient initially tried on bipap with continuing hypoxemia, almost intubated, then put on a nonrebreather with improvement in her sats, put her back on her home CPAP, the night went well after that point.

The patient has a concern for possible pulmonary embolism (PE), so sheparin gtt was started. If the patient needs a CT scan, she will have to go to [**Hospital Ward Name**] due to weight.

The patient has hematuria while on her heparin gtt, but urine is still passing without difficulty. The plan is to try to keep the patient on a lower end of therapeutic range.

BNP is 4800, good urine output to 20 mg IV lasix overnight, breathing improved, another 20 mg IV lasix given this AM.

   embolism was admitted with fevers that appear to be d/t R panniculitis
   who was transfered to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure
   currently improving with decreasing O2 requirements.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: on presentation,. Given hx COPD, wheezing and
   cough, etiology of hypercarbia/hypoixia is likely combination of
   COPD/reactive airways disease in context of potential URI, restrictive
   ventilatory defect by PFTs in past. Past ECHO suggestive of component
   of diastolic dysfunction and CXR with mild pulm edema and cardiomegaly,
   so likely component of CHF.  There is also likely a component of
   obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD, which makes her more prone to respiratory failure. Her current condition with hypercarbia and hypoxia suggests a combination of COPD, reactive airways disease, potential URI, restrictive ventilatory defect by PFTs in the past, diastolic dysfunction, mild pulmonary edema, and cardiomegaly.

2. Panniculitis: The patient has been diagnosed with panniculitis, which is an inflammation of the subcutaneous fat. She is currently receiving Vanc 1 gram IV q 12 hours and Clindamycin IV 900 mg q 8 hours. Further discussion with ID is recommended for the final course of antibiotic treatment.

   # Respiratory failure: on presentation,. Given hx COPD, wheezing and
   cough, etiology of hypercarbia/hypoixia is likely combination of
   COPD/reactive airways disease in context of potential URI, restrictive
   ventilatory defect by PFTs in past. Past ECHO suggestive of component
   of diastolic dysfunction and CXR with mild pulm edema and cardiomegaly,
   so likely component of CHF.  There is also likely a component of
   obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation.

   given hx of PE on coumadin and some tachycardia, decided to bridge back
   to therapeutic INR with heparin drip. Has been on heparin bridge with
   coumadin for 24 hours.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including morbid obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary embolism. She was admitted with fevers due to right panniculitis and is currently improving with decreasing oxygen requirements. The patient has a history of COPD, wheezing, and cough, and her respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of COPD, reactive airways disease, potential upper respiratory infection (URI), restrictive ventilatory defect by pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in the past, component of diastolic dysfunction, mild pulmonary edema, and cardiomegaly. There is also a likely component of obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to a combination of COPD, reactive airways disease, potential URI, restrictive ventilatory defect by PFTs in the past, component of diastolic dysfunction, mild pulmonary edema, and cardiomegaly.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is currently anticoagulated. There is a concern for a possible interaction between antibiotics and anticoagulants, which may require adjustment of medication doses.
3. Panniculitis: The patient has panniculitis, which is an inflammation of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of sleep apnea, possible asthma, restrictive lung disease, obesity, and recurrent panniculitis. She presented initially with panniculitis and developed hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She is now improved on intermittent PAP. The patient has allergies to ciprofloxacin, Cortisporin, Bactrim, levofloxacin, sertraline, cephalic, adhesive tape, and keflex. She received antibiotics including clindamycin, vancomycin, and azithromycin.

The patient is currently in the ICU with the following vital signs: temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103 to 148/62 to 99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 84%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient has a history of being well-nourished, but is now overweight/obese. Peripheral pulses and skin assessment were not performed. Neurological assessment was also not conducted.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count and hematocrit levels, as well as abnormal potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose levels. The patient's troponin-T level is within normal range. The platelet count is within normal range"
