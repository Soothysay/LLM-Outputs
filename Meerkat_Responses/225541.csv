","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension. They have a history of allergies to certain medications and have been experiencing nausea and vomiting. The patient's vital signs show fluctuations in blood pressure, with readings ranging from 73/35 mmHg to 84/47 mmHg. The heart rate is relatively stable between 78-102 bpm. The respiratory rate is within normal limits at 19-33 breaths per minute. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 38.2 degrees Celsius. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 93% through a nasal cannula. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the current hypotension. The flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, with a total intake of 2,938 mL and total output of 1,975 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient has received various infusions, including norepinephrine, famotidine, hydromorphone, and heparin sodium.

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, slightly decreased platelet count, and elevated glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range. The assessment indicates the patient is experiencing hypotension but not in shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is on multiple antibiotics, indicating a possible ongoing infection. The growing budding yeast in the blood culture suggests a fungal infection, for which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a significant medical history of [Location (un) 2455] syndrome, post-colectomy, and multiple small bowel resections, resulting in short gut syndrome. She is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has had multiple episodes of line-associated bacteremia. The patient presents with fevers and hypotension, indicating septic shock. Her blood cultures are growing budding yeast, for which micafungin has been started.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's multiple admissions for sepsis secondary to line infections and the presence of fevers and hypotension suggest ongoing septic shock. The lack of access for line exchange and the possibility of a pseudoaneurysm near the insertion of the superior vena cava into the right atrium further complicate the situation.
2. Abscess or pseudoaneurysm: The findings from the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showing a soft tissue density adjacent to the insertion of the SVC into the right atrium with flow suggestive of a possible abscess or pseudoaneurysm need to be addressed promptly.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels above baseline indicate ARF, likely secondary to hypovolemia from fevers and nausea/vomiting.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a significant medical history of short gut syndrome due to multiple small bowel resections and a colectomy. She presents with hypotension and fevers. 

The patient has had multiple admissions for sepsis secondary to line infections, including coag-negative Staphylococcus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Each time, her line has been exchanged over a wire due to lack of access. The current line is nontender and nondraining, but there is a possible abscess or pseudoaneurysm near the insertion site of the superior vena cava into the right atrium, as shown by a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).

The patient's blood cultures are growing budding yeast, so she has been started on micafungin. She has multiple allergies, including to Demerol, Compazine, Reglan, Betadine, iodine, morphine, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 73/35 mmHg and tachycardia with a heart rate of 80 bpm. Her temperature is elevated at 38.2 degrees Celsius. She is receiving norepinephrine infusion at 0.15 mcg/kg/min to maintain blood pressure.

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, indicating an ongoing infection. Her creat"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a significant medical history of [Location (un) 2455] syndrome, post-colectomy, and multiple small bowel resections resulting in short gut syndrome. The patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has had multiple episodes of line-associated bacteremia. 

The patient presents with fevers and hypotension, indicating possible septic shock. The patient's blood culture is growing budding yeast, so micafungin has been started. The patient has a history of allergies to Demerol, Compazine, Reglan, Betadine Surgi-Prep, iodine, morphine, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 73/35 to 84/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, and stable kidney function with a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. Other lab values such as glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and electrolytes are within normal range.

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of multiple episodes of line-associated bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis. Given her current fevers and hypotension, there is a high risk of ongoing or recurrent sepsis.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's chronic left lower quadrant pain and the ultrasound findings of a focal thrombus within the right common femoral vein indicate a potential risk of developing DVT.
3. Abscess or pseudoaneurysm"

   # Septic shock:
   Pt has had multiple admission for sepsis secondary to line infections,
   most recently coag neg Staph with linezolid and Klebseilla pneumoniae
   with CTX.  Each time, her line has been exchanged over a wire due to
   lack of access.  Per notes, next option would be transhepatic access.
   Site itself is nontender, nondraining.  Pt also has chronic LLQ pain.
   CT abdomen did not reveal a source of infection though it was
   noncontrast.  Of note, at baseline, BP runs 80-90/60s at baseline.  In
   addition, pt had a TEE in [**11-1**] showing a ""~1.7 cm wide region of soft
   tissue density adjacent to the insertion of the superior vena cava
   (SVC) into the right atrium with flow into the SVC suggestive of
   possible abscess or pseudoaneurysm.""
   - Continue daptomycin and cefepime, pending culture data

   - Consult with IR as to line options either temporary or permanent
   - Plan for removing the tunneled line, followed by 48hours of only
   peripheral access with antibiotic treatment, followed by IR placement
   of new central access. Also, would discuss with ID/pharm re: possible
   abx choices which could be given via IM in the case she cannot get
   peripheral access; also look in to possibility of intraosseous option
   for temporary access.
   - has back pain which has been imaged and is not felt to be a chronic
   osteo (as a potential source of recurrent infection) given that each
   infection seems to grow a new pathogen.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a significant medical history of [Location (un) 2455] syndrome, multiple small bowel resections, and short gut syndrome. She is currently in the ICU due to septic shock and has had multiple admissions for sepsis secondary to line infections.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Fever of 102.1 degrees Fahrenheit
- Hypotension with blood pressure readings ranging from 64/46 mmHg to 85/57 mmHg
- Respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation of 96%
- Sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute
- Dry oral mucosa
- Supple neck with no lymphadenopathy
- Clear lung sounds with crackles at the base of the lungs
- Soft abdomen with an ostomy bag containing liquid stool
- No tenderness or erythema at the line site

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Septic shock: The patient has a history of recurrent line-associated bacteremia, including infections with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This increases the risk of septic shock.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The ultrasound revealed a focal thrombus within the right common femoral vein, indicating the presence of a DVT. This increases the risk of pulmonary emb"

The patient is a [age]-year-old female admitted to the ICU with [underlying medical conditions]. She has been experiencing fevers and has positive blood cultures for yeast. The patient started on Micafungin for the fungal infection in her blood cultures on [date]. There was a discussion regarding line access, and the patient does not want to remove the current line or change it over a wire. She understands the risks of serious infection and death if the line is infected and does not come out. The patient also refuses total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to concerns about infection.

On [date], an attempt was made to obtain venipuncture blood cultures, but it was unsuccessful. An ultrasound of the left upper extremity central line was performed. The patient's temperature is 102.1 degrees Fahrenheit, and she has a history of allergies to Demerol, Compazine, Reglan, Betadine, morphine, vancomycin, and iodine. The last doses of antibiotics given to the patient were Micafungin on [date], cefipime on [date], and daptomycin on [date]. The patient is currently receiving infusions of norepinephrine and other ICU medications such as famotidine, heparin sodium, and hydromorphone.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a female with a chief complaint of a Hickman line infection. She has been in the ICU and started on Micafungin for yeast in her blood cultures. The patient is refusing to remove the current line and also does not want it changed over a wire. She understands the risks of serious infection and death if the line is infected and does not come out.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 102.1 and her maximum temperature was 38.9 degrees Celsius. Her blood pressure is low, ranging from 64-71 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is elevated at 27 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 96%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4579 mL and output of 5050 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 471 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes delivery of oxygen through a nasal cannula.

Physical examination findings include dry oral mucosa, supple neck, clear lung sounds, and no murmurs or gallops on cardiac auscultation. The abdomen is soft with an ostomy bag containing liquid stool. There is no evidence of swelling or tenderness at the line site.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 6.7-8.5 thousand/mL. Hemoglobin levels are low at 8.4 g/dL, as well as hematocrit at"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a significant medical history of [**Location (un) 2455**] syndrome, previous colectomy, and multiple small bowel resections resulting in short gut syndrome. She is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has had multiple episodes of line-associated bacteremia. The patient presents with fevers and hypotension, indicating septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient has a history of multiple admissions for sepsis secondary to line infections, including coag-negative Staphylococcus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Her current presentation with fevers and hypotension suggests ongoing septic shock.
2. Line infections: The patient has had multiple episodes of line-associated bacteremia, which can be a serious complication requiring prompt treatment and possibly line removal.
3. Abscess or pseudoaneurysm: A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed a region of soft tissue density adjacent to the insertion of the superior vena cava (SVC) into the right atrium, suggestive of a possible abscess or pseudoaneurysm.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated above baseline, likely secondary to hypovolemia from fevers and nausea/vomiting.

","Summary:
The patient is a [age] year-old [male/female] admitted to the ICU with septic shock, acute kidney injury, and deep vein thrombosis. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired infections, including Enterococcus and yeast. The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with hypotension and tachycardia. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and glucose levels. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a nasogastric tube and central line in place. The patient's pain management and glycemic control are also noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's initial presentation of septic shock indicates a severe infection that has led to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and organ function is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest AKI, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased risk of infection, and potential need for dialysis.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's diagnosis of DVT indicates a blood clot in the lower extremity. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism and requires anticoagulation therapy.
4. Hospital-Acquired Infections: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and multiple antibiotic treatments raise concerns for hospital-acquired"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a significant medical history of [**Location (un) 2455**] syndrome, post-colectomy and multiple small bowel resections, resulting in short gut syndrome. She is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has had multiple episodes of line-associated bacteremia. The patient presented with fevers and hypotension, leading to a diagnosis of septic shock.

The patient's current treatment includes antibiotics to cover Enterococcus and [**Female First Name (un) 188**] albicans. Alternate antibiotics are being administered through each line port daily until the line is removed. Ongoing infectious disease (ID) consultation input is appreciated, and a consultation with interventional radiology (IR) is planned for line options. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) from this morning is also pending, along with pending blood cultures.

In addition to the septic shock diagnosis, the patient has a new right superficial femoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT), for which Lovenox anticoagulation will be started following the procedures for line removal and re-site.

The patient's underlying [**Location (un) 2455**] syndrome requires ongoing management, including starting parenteral nutrition (PNP) today and continuing the fentanyl patch. Titration of Dilaudid as needed will also be continued.

The patient's kidney function is normalized"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of [Location (un) 2455] syndrome, who has undergone colectomy and multiple small bowel resections. She now presents with short gut syndrome and is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient has been admitted multiple times for sepsis secondary to line infections, including coag negative Staphylococcus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. She is currently experiencing fevers and hypotension, indicating septic shock. 

Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient has had multiple admissions for sepsis due to line infections. Her current line is nontender and nondraining, but there is a concern for a possible abscess or pseudoaneurysm near the insertion site of the superior vena cava into the right atrium, as seen on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). 
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): A new right femoral clot was identified on ultrasound. The plan is to start Lovenox after sorting out the line issues.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated above baseline, likely due to hypovolemia from fevers and nausea. IV fluid boluses are being given as needed.
4. Short gut syndrome: The patient has short gut syndrome following multiple small bowel resections. She is currently on"

   ECHO [**2146-2-28**]: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve is
   mildly thickened but without discrete vegetation. There is mild to
   moderate [[**11-26**]+] tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-2-11**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher (and was normal
   on [**2145-9-23**]). The tricuspid valve morphology is similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo F with PMHx sig. for [**Location (un) 2455**] syndrome s/p colectomy and
   multiple small bowel resections now with short gut syndrome on TPN and
   multiple episodes of line-associated bacteremia presented with fevers
   and hypotension.
   # Septic shock:
   Pt has had multiple admissions for sepsis secondary to line infections,
   most recently coag neg Staph treated with linezolid and Klebseilla
   pneumoniae treated with ceftriaxone.  Each time, her line has been
   exchanged over a wire due to lack of access.  Per notes, next option
   would be transhepatic access.  Line siite itself is non-tender,
   non-erythematous, non-draining.  Pt also has chronic LLQ pain as well
   as back pain. CT abdomen did not reveal a source of infection though it
   was noncontrast.  Of note, at baseline, BP runs 80-90/60s. Current
   culture data from OSH and initial blood cultures here show enterococcus
   and [**Female First Name (un) 188**] albicans. On ampicillin and fluconazole. Ophthalmology
   evaluation without current evidence of fungal involvement. . Is c.diff
   negative and urine culture negative to date.
   - Continue ampicillin to cover enterococcus and fluconazole to cover
   [**Female First Name (un) 188**] albicans.
   - Alternate antibiotics through each line port daily until line is
   removed
   - Ongoing ID consultation input is appreciated
   - Consult with IR as to line options either temporary or permanent
   - f/u pending blood cultures
   - IVF boluses PRN hypotension as well as replacement of ostomy losses
   # DVT:
   New right superficial femoral DVT seen on ultrasound.
   - Plan to start Lovenox anticoagulation following procedures for line
   removal and re-site
   # [**Location (un) 2455**] syndrome s/p colectomy and multiple small bowel resections,
   now with short gut syndrome:
   - cont PPN
   - Cont. fentanyl patch
   - Titrate Dilaudid as needed
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Pt had elevated Cr above baseline at admission; however, is at 0.5 and

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a significant past medical history of [Location (un) 2455] syndrome, who has undergone colectomy and multiple small bowel resections resulting in short gut syndrome. She is currently admitted to the ICU with septic shock secondary to line infections, including coag negative Staph and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient has had multiple admissions for sepsis and her line has been exchanged over a wire due to lack of peripheral access. She is currently on ampicillin and fluconazole, and alternate antibiotics are being administered through each line port daily. Ongoing ID consultation input is appreciated. The patient also has chronic LLQ pain and back pain, but a CT abdomen did not reveal a source of infection. She has a new right superficial femoral DVT seen on ultrasound and plans are to start Lovenox anticoagulation following procedures for line removal and re-site. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/51 mmHg to 94/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. Physical examination findings include decreased breath sounds at the right base, a mildly thickened septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve without discrete vegetation, and mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation. The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. An ECHO was performed, which showed normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic function. The right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were also normal. The aortic and mitral valves appeared structurally normal with trivial regurgitation. There was mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. A trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion was noted, and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was higher compared to a prior study.

   ECHO [**2146-2-28**]: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve is
   mildly thickened but without discrete vegetation. There is mild to
   moderate [[**11-26**]+] tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-2-11**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher (and was normal
   on [**2145-9-23**]). The tricuspid valve morphology is similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo F with PMHx sig. for [**Location (un) 2455**] syndrome s/p colectomy and
   multiple small bowel resections now with short gut syndrome on TPN and
   multiple episodes of line-associated bacteremia presented with fevers
   and hypotension.
   # Septic shock:
   Pt has had multiple admissions for sepsis secondary to line infections,
   most recently coag neg Staph treated with linezolid and Klebseilla
   pneumoniae treated with ceftriaxone.  Each time, her line has been
   exchanged over a wire due to lack of access.  Per notes, next option
   could be transhepatic access.  Line site itself is non-tender,
   non-erythematous, non-draining.  Pt also has chronic LLQ pain as well
   as back pain. CT abdomen did not reveal a source of infection though it
   was noncontrast.  Of note, at baseline, BP runs 80-90/60s. Current
   culture data from OSH and initial blood cultures here show enterococcus
   and [**Female First Name (un) 188**] albicans. On ampicillin and fluconazole. Ophthalmology
   evaluation without current evidence of fungal involvement. . Is c.diff
   negative and urine culture negative to date. Has been off pressors for
   >24hrs. with good pressures.
   - Continue ampicillin to cover enterococcus and fluconazole to cover
   [**Female First Name (un) 188**] albicans.
   - Alternate antibiotics through each line port daily until line is
   removed
   - Ongoing ID consultation input is appreciated
   - Consult with IR and ID as to line options either temporary for line
   holiday and/or permanent changes to access
   - f/u pending blood cultures
   - IVF boluses PRN hypotension as well as replacement of ostomy losses
   # DVT:
   New right superficial femoral DVT seen on ultrasound.
   - Plan to start anticoagulation soon, will depend on plan for
   procedures for line removal/re-site
   # [**Location (un) 2455**] syndrome s/p colectomy and multiple small bowel resections,
   now with short gut syndrome:
   - cont PPN
   - Cont. fentanyl patch
   - Titrate Dilaudid as needed
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Pt had elevated Cr above baseline at admission; however, is at 0.5 and
   appears to be normalized at this time.

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo F with PMHx sig. for [**Location (un) 2455**] syndrome s/p colectomy and
   multiple small bowel resections now with short gut syndrome on TPN and
   multiple episodes of line-associated bacteremia presented with fevers
   and hypotension.
   # Septic shock:
   Pt has had multiple admissions for sepsis secondary to line infections,
   most recently coag neg Staph treated with linezolid and Klebseilla
   pneumoniae treated with ceftriaxone.  Each time, her line has been
   exchanged over a wire due to lack of access.  Per notes, next option
   would be transhepatic access.  Line siite itself is non-tender,
   non-erythematous, non-draining.  Pt also has chronic LLQ pain as well
   as back pain. CT abdomen did not reveal a source of infection though it
   was noncontrast.  Of note, at baseline, BP runs 80-90/60s. Current
   culture data from OSH and initial blood cultures here show enterococcus
   and [**Female First Name (un) 188**] albicans. On ampicillin and fluconazole. Ophthalmology
   evaluation without current evidence of fungal involvement. . Is c.diff
   negative and urine culture negative to date.
   - Continue ampicillin to cover enterococcus and fluconazole to cover
   [**Female First Name (un) 188**] albicans.
   - Alternate antibiotics through each line port daily until line is
   removed
   - Ongoing ID consultation input is appreciated
   - Consult with IR as to line options either temporary or permanent
   - Follow-up TTE from this AM
   - f/u pending blood cultures
   - IVF boluses prn hypotension as well as replacement of ostomy losses
   # DVT:
   New right superficial femoral DVT seen on ultrasound.
   - Plan to start Lovenox anticoagulation following procedures for line
   removal and re-site
   # [**Location (un) 2455**] syndrome s/p colectomy and multiple small bowel resections,
   now with short gut syndrome:
   - Start PPN today
   - Cont. fentanyl patch
   - Titrate Dilaudid as needed
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Pt had elevated Cr above baseline at admission; however, is at 0.6 and
   appears to be normalized at this time.
