","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage liver disease due to ethanol abuse. He has been admitted with medication noncompliance and has undergone large-volume paracentesis. The patient's chief complaints are abdominal distension and hyponatremia. He has received 1000cc of normal saline, had fluid restriction and diuretics held, and is scheduled for large-volume tapping. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 103/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with a total input of 60 mL and total output of 30 mL. The patient is receiving various medications including heparin, zinc, ciprofloxacin, multivitamins, nadolol, lactulose, and proton pump inhibitor.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for worsening ascites likely due to diuretic noncompliance. The patient's labs show a hematocrit level of 40.4% and platelet count of 144,000/mm³. The liver enzymes ALT and AST are elevated at 58 and 76 units/L, respectively. Imaging reveals a nonocclusive portal vein clot, and the chest X-ray shows small lung volumes.

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) due to alcohol abuse. He presented with abdominal distension and hyponatremia. The patient has been admitted multiple times for noncompliance with medication, and this time he also consumed alcohol with his brother. Upon admission, he received 1000cc of normal saline and had fluid restrictions, with diuretics being held. It is planned to perform a large-volume paracentesis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 103/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving heparin, zinc, ciprofloxacin, multivitamins, nadolol, lactulose, and proton pump inhibitor.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 60 mL in and 60 mL out since midnight. The respiratory support includes oxygen delivery without any device, and the ABG results are pending.

The physical examination reveals a distended abdomen and edema in both lower extremities. The cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds and a systolic murmur. The peripheral vascular examination does not assess the pulses in both radial and dorsal pedal arteries. The neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate a low white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Ascites: reportedly refractory to diuretic therapy at baseline,
   though this could simply be because of ongoing medical noncompliance
   - Paracentesis pulled off 10.5L fluid w/ elevated white count
   consistent with SBP. On ceftriaxone. Cx pending.
   - therapeutic large volume paracentesis yesterday consistent with SBP
   - Given tenderness of abd, falling HCT, and increasing distension s/p
   [**Last Name (LF) 4623**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] have non-contrast CT abd today to evaluate for
   intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
   - will resume diuretics given rapidly increasing ascites and now WNL
   Na.
   - no occlusive portal vein thrombus on ultrasound
   2. Hyponatremia: likely hypervolemic hyponatremia from ongoing fluid
   retention due to cirrhosis and diuretic noncompliance; has been as low
   as 110 on prior admissions
   -  Now WNL
   - fluid restriction to 500 cc
   - hold diuretics until sodium improved
   - no neurologic signs/symptoms to indicate need for hypertonic saline
   - check urine electrolytes, osms; check serum osms
   3. Cirrhosis
   - cont ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis; no signs or symptoms to
   suggest SBP
   - cont nadolol for variceal prophylaxis
   - lactulose to prevent encephalopathy
   4. Hyperkalemia
   - unclear etiology; could be a marker of adrenal insufficiency given
   hyponatremia, though this is hard to appropriately assess in cirrhotics
   - holding spironolactone
   - consider kayexelate
   5. Alcohol abuse/intoxication
   - lorazepam CIWA
   - SW consult
   6. Metabolic acidosis: likely from chronic lactate retention from
   cirrhosis plus alcohol intoxication
   - check VBG and lactate

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of ascites. The patient underwent a paracentesis procedure, during which 10.5L fluid was removed. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has been started on ceftriaxone, an antibiotic used to treat SBP.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a low blood pressure in the 70s/40s, which improved after administration of 500NS and albumin. The patient's urine output has been stable at 30mL/hour, and they are asymptomatic. The morning hematocrit (Hct) was 27.5, with ongoing blood loss. The patient's blood pressure remains in the 80s/50s.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis, which is likely the cause of their ascites. The ascites fluid analysis showed elevated white blood cell count and protein levels, indicating possible infection. The patient's serum albumin level is less than 1.0 g/dL, and total protein is 0.8 g/dL. The W"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, who presented to the ICU with signs of refractory ascites and suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis, which revealed elevated white blood cell count consistent with SBP. He was started on ceftriaxone and other medications for prophylaxis. The patient's sodium levels were low, indicating hyponatremia, and he had hyperkalemia. His liver function tests showed elevated liver enzymes, and his coagulation profile was abnormal with prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. The patient also had metabolic acidosis, which may be related to chronic lactate retention from cirrhosis and alcohol intoxication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy due to the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream that are normally removed by the liver. Symptoms may include confusion, altered mental status, and coma.
2. Infection: The patient has suspected SBP and is already on antibiotics. However, there is a risk of developing other infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.
3. Variceal bleeding: Patients with cirrhosis are at increased risk of developing esophageal varices, which can lead"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Hyponatremia: likely hypervolemic hyponatremia from ongoing fluid
   retention due to cirrhosis and diuretic noncompliance; has been as low
   as 110 on prior admissions
   - fluid restriction to 500 cc
   - hold diuretics until sodium improved
   - no neurologic signs/symptoms to indicate need for hypertonic saline
   - check urine electrolytes, osms; check serum osms
   2. Ascites: reportedly refractory to diuretic therapy at baseline,
   though this could simply be because of ongoing medical noncompliance
   - hold off on resuming diuretics given his hyponatremia
   - therapeutic large volume paracentesis in AM
   - no occlusive portal vein thrombus on ultrasound
   3. Cirrhosis
   - cont ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis; no signs or symptoms to
   suggest SBP
   - cont nadolol for variceal prophylaxis
   - lactulose to prevent encephalopathy
   4. Hyperkalemia
   - unclear etiology; could be a marker of adrenal insufficiency given
   hyponatremia, though this is hard to appropriately assess in cirrhotics
   - holding spironolactone
   - consider kayexelate
   5. Alcohol abuse/intoxication
   - lorazepam CIWA
   - SW consult
   6. Metabolic acidosis: likely from chronic lactate retention from
   cirrhosis plus alcohol intoxication
   - check VBG and lactate

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, currently admitted to the ICU. He underwent a therapeutic paracentesis due to refractory ascites and showed signs of hypotension with low blood pressure in the 70s/40s. The patient's SBP was in the 80s, and he received ceftriaxone for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Corticotropin stimulation test indicated no adrenal insufficiency, so no steroids were started. His blood pressure improved with the administration of 500NS and albumin. The patient has hyponatremia, likely hypervolemic due to cirrhosis and diuretic noncompliance. Fluid restriction has been implemented, along with holding diuretics until sodium improves. There are no neurological signs to indicate hypertonic saline treatment. The patient's WBC count has been increasing, suggesting an ongoing infection. Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, indicating liver dysfunction. The patient also has hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and alcohol abuse/intoxication. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy due to worsening liver function.
2. Infection due to high WBC count and previous SBP.
3. Variceal bleeding if variceal prophylaxis is not effective.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome due to worsening renal function.
5. Hepatic hydrothor"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   1. Hyponatremia: likely hypervolemic hyponatremia from ongoing fluid
   retention due to cirrhosis and diuretic noncompliance; has been as low
   as 110 on prior admissions
   - fluid restriction to 500 cc
   - hold diuretics until sodium improved
   - no neurologic signs/symptoms to indicate need for hypertonic saline
   - check urine electrolytes, osms; check serum osms
   2. Ascites: reportedly refractory to diuretic therapy at baseline,
   though this could simply be because of ongoing medical noncompliance
   - hold off on resuming diuretics given his hyponatremia
   - therapeutic large volume paracentesis in AM
   - no occlusive portal vein thrombus on ultrasound
   3. Cirrhosis
   - cont ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis; no signs or symptoms to
   suggest SBP
   - cont nadolol for variceal prophylaxis
   - lactulose to prevent encephalopathy
   4. Hyperkalemia
   - unclear etiology; could be a marker of adrenal insufficiency given
   hyponatremia, though this is hard to appropriately assess in cirrhotics
   - holding spironolactone
   - consider kayexelate
   5. Alcohol abuse/intoxication
   - lorazepam CIWA
   - SW consult
   6. Metabolic acidosis: likely from chronic lactate retention from
   cirrhosis plus alcohol intoxication
   - check VBG and lactate

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, presenting with recurrent ascites and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis, removing 1250 mL of ascitic fluid. Subsequently, the patient's blood pressure dropped to the 70s/40s, and he received 500 mL of normal saline (NS) and albumin (2nd dose). His blood pressure improved to the 80s, and urine output remained stable at 30 mL/hour. The patient's random cortisol level increased from 37.7 to 45.2 to 50.8 with high-dose ACTH, indicating no adrenal insufficiency and no steroids were started.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and intoxication. He is currently on lactulose for encephalopathy prevention, ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis, and nadolol for variceal prophylaxis. The patient's metabolic profile shows hyponatremia (Na+: 132 K/uL), hyperkalemia (K+: 5.0 mEq/L), and hypoalbuminemia (Albumin: 3.1 g/dL). The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level (Cr: 1.2 mg/dL). Liver function tests reveal elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 58/76) and markedly elevated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent paracentesis, which revealed SBP with 11K WBCs. The patient's Hct dropped from 40 on 7-23 to 32 yesterday and 27 today. Brown stool was also observed. The patient is on various medications including cipro, albumin, nadolol, lactulose, and pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs include Tcurrent: 36.3°C, HR: 90 bpm, BP: 84/51 mmHg, RR: 17 inspirations per minute, and SpO2: 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -9,000 mL. The patient has a history of anemia and has experienced a significant drop in Hct. Physical examination reveals jaundice, distended abdomen with rebound tenderness, and warm skin. Neurologic examination was not assessed. Lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low platelet count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Microbiology results from the paracentesis show 2133 WBCs with 90% neutrophils. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) due to the presence of 11K WBCs in the paracentesis.
2. Hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding due to the brown stool and significant drop in Hct.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy based on the use of lactulose for ETOH cirrhosis.
4. Hypotension and potential sepsis secondary to SBP and/or hemorrhage.
5. Potential hepatorenal syndrome given the low platelet count and elevated liver enzymes.
6. Malnutrition or poor nutritional status indicated by muscle wasting.
7. Risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to chronic liver disease.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further evaluation may be necessary to confirm the potential medical complications."

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis due to alcohol abuse, presenting with abdominal pain and distension. The patient has undergone a paracentesis, which revealed an elevated white blood cell count consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has dropped significantly from 40.4 on 07/23 to 27.4 today, and he is experiencing brown stool. He is currently being treated with ceftriaxone and albumin. The patient also has evidence of hepatic encephalopathy, for which he is receiving lactulose. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 84/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 9,000 mL since 12 AM. Laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 72 K/uL), elevated bilirubin levels, hyponatremia (sodium level of 93 mEq/L), and evidence of renal dysfunction (creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL). The patient is on multiple medications including pantoprazole, zinc, ciprofloxacin, vitamin C, nadolol, albumin, lactulose, and heparin."

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Ascites / SBP: reportedly refractory to diuretic therapy at
   baseline, though this could simply be because of ongoing medical
   noncompliance
   - Paracentesis pulled off 10.5L fluid w/ elevated white count
   consistent with SBP. Cx positive for GNR and budding yeast. Started on
   caspo and ceftriaxone
   - CT showed ascites and sm blood. HCT stable now
   - resumed spironolactone given rapidly increasing ascites and now WNL
   Na.
   - no occlusive portal vein thrombus on ultrasound
   2. Hyponatremia: likely hypervolemic hyponatremia from ongoing fluid
   retention due to cirrhosis and diuretic noncompliance; has been as low
   as 110 on prior admissions
   -  Now WNL
   - fluid restriction to 500 cc
   3. Cirrhosis
   - cont nadolol for variceal prophylaxis
   - lactulose to prevent encephalopathy
   4. Hyperkalemia
   - unclear etiology; could be a marker of adrenal insufficiency given
   hyponatremia, though this is hard to appropriately assess in cirrhotics
   - Now resolved
   5. Alcohol abuse/intoxication
   - No s/s withdrawl. Holding CIWA
   - SW consulted
   6. Metabolic acidosis: likely from chronic lactate retention from
   cirrhosis plus alcohol intoxication

","Based on the provided information, the patient has several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Ascites/SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis): The patient has refractory ascites, which is fluid accumulation in the abdomen, and the ascitic fluid culture is positive for GNR and budding yeast. This suggests an infection called spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The patient has already been started on caspofungin and ceftriaxone.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels in their blood, which may be due to ongoing fluid retention caused by cirrhosis and diuretic noncompliance. It is important to monitor and manage this electrolyte imbalance.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, a chronic liver disease characterized by scarring of the liver tissue. This can lead to complications such as portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is already on medications like nadolol for variceal prophylaxis and lactulose to prevent encephalopathy.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient had high potassium levels, which could be due to various reasons including adrenal insufficiency. It is essential to monitor and treat this condition appropriately.

5. Alcohol abuse/intoxication: Although there are no signs of withdrawal, the patient has a history of alcohol abuse, and it is important to address this issue and provide appropriate support"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Ascites / SBP: reportedly refractory to diuretic therapy at
   baseline, though this could simply be because of ongoing medical
   noncompliance
   - Paracentesis pulled off 10.5L fluid w/ elevated white count
   consistent with SBP. Cx positive for GNR and budding yeast. Started on
   caspo and ceftriaxone
   - CT showed ascites and sm blood. HCT stable now
   - resumed spironolactone given rapidly increasing ascites and now WNL
   Na.
   - no occlusive portal vein thrombus on ultrasound
   2. Hyponatremia: likely hypervolemic hyponatremia from ongoing fluid
   retention due to cirrhosis and diuretic noncompliance; has been as low
   as 110 on prior admissions
   -  Now WNL
   - fluid restriction to 500 cc
   3. Cirrhosis
   - cont nadolol for variceal prophylaxis
   - lactulose to prevent encephalopathy
   4. Hyperkalemia
   - unclear etiology; could be a marker of adrenal insufficiency given
   hyponatremia, though this is hard to appropriately assess in cirrhotics
   - Now resolved
   5. Alcohol abuse/intoxication
   - No s/s withdrawl. Holding CIWA
   - SW consulted
   6. Metabolic acidosis: likely from chronic lactate retention from
   cirrhosis plus alcohol intoxication

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with a chief complaint of ascites re-accumulation in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with cirrhosis and has been experiencing recurrent episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He was started on empirical treatment with caspofungin and ceftriaxone after cultures grew GNR and budding yeast.

The patient's recent events include heavy diarrhea overnight, which is being investigated for possible Clostridium difficile infection. His allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 88/58 mmHg and tachycardia with a heart rate of 85 bpm. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is at 98%.

The patient's physical examination reveals cachexia, jaundice, and distended abdomen with tenderness in both right and left quadrants. There are also obvious veins on the abdomen. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and elevated liver enzymes such as AST and ALT. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes refractory ascites, suspected SBP with positive culture for GNR and budding yeast, hyponatremia, cirrhosis, hyperkalemia, alcohol abuse/intoxication, metabolic acidosis, and heavy diarrhea.

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Ascites / SBP: reportedly refractory to diuretic therapy at
   baseline, though this could simply be because of ongoing medical
   noncompliance
   - Paracentesis pulled off 10.5L fluid w/ elevated white count
   consistent with SBP. Cx positive for GNR and budding yeast. Started on
   caspo and ceftriaxone
   - CT showed ascites and sm blood. HCT stable now
   - resumed spironolactone given rapidly increasing ascites and now WNL
   Na.
   - no occlusive portal vein thrombus on ultrasound
   - Hepatology following, recommend stopping Nadolol
   2. Hyponatremia: likely hypervolemic hyponatremia from ongoing fluid
   retention due to cirrhosis and diuretic noncompliance; has been as low
   as 110 on prior admissions
   -  Now WNL
   - fluid restriction to 500 cc
   3. Cirrhosis
   - stopped Nadolol
   - Holding lactulose due to large volume of diarrhea
   4. Hyperkalemia
   - unclear etiology; could be a marker of adrenal insufficiency given
   hyponatremia, though this is hard to appropriately assess in cirrhotics
   - Now resolved
   5. Alcohol abuse/intoxication
   - No s/s withdrawl. Holding CIWA
   - SW consulted
   6. Metabolic acidosis: likely from chronic lactate retention from
   cirrhosis plus alcohol intoxication
   7. Diarrhea:
   - Hold lactulose for now

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a male with a chief complaint of ascites re-accumulation. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has shown several medical complications. 

The patient's cultures grew GNR and budding yeast, leading to the empirical treatment with caspofungin and ceftriaxone. The patient also experienced heavy diarrhea overnight, which is likely due to lactulose. 

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 76/22 to 88/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows an overall fluid balance of 1,057 mL, with a total intake of 1,657 mL and total output of 600 mL. 

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, distended abdomen with fluid wave and tenderness in both right and left quadrants, and obvious veins on the abdomen. 

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia (white blood cell count of 11.1 K/uL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 87 K/uL), and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST levels of 33/36). Other lab values, including creatinine, glucose, electrolytes, and coagulation profile, are also provided.
