   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration.
   .
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic shock. Hypovolemic shock
   likely induced by poor PO intake prior to presentation. Distributive
   shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well
   as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria
   through ischemic bowel. Cardiogenic shock possible in setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation in patient with unknown systolic
   function as well as cardiomyopathy of acute illness and sepsis.
   - Fluid resuscitate aggressively
   - Vanc/Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora
   - phenylephrine and vasopressin to augment BP; will attempt to wean
   vasopressin again today
   - Follow pending cultures
   - Surveillance blood cultures in daily
   - Maintain ventilation mechanically while giving fluids and awaiting
   likely blossoming of inflammatory response to sepsis in lungs
   .
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   - Appreciate input from surgery team
   - NPO
   - OG tube to wall suction to decompress bowl peri-operative
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Follow lactates and abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy
   tissue
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:
   Developed shortly after arriving in ICU, no clearly visible flutter
   waves, though tough to assess in setting of low-amplitude p-waves at
   baseline. Most likely a-flutter given fixed regular rate of ~150.
   - Continue amiodarone for rate control
   - consider DC cardioversion if limited BP despite maximal vasoactive
   agents
   .
   # Acute kidney injury:
   Creatinine at presentation to the hospital was Cr 2.6, baseline Cr
   1.1-1.3. Likely multifactorial due to ATN from sepsis, hypovolemia
   causing pre-renal azotemia.  Improved this AM, likely secondary to
   dilution from massive fluid resuscitation.
   - Monitor for resolution with trend of creatinine
   - UOP continues to be low but adequate
 40-60 cc/hr, will continue to
   monitor.
   .
   # Elevated troponin:
   In setting of history of CAD with prior MI by history and evidenced in
   EKGs dating back over 15 years. Stress test last performed in [**2107**] and
   was without evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. Patient's last lipid
   panel in [**8-/2121**] revealed HDL 87 and LDL 102. Patient not on statin or
   aspirin at home.
   - troponins neg x 3
   .
   # Mild hypercalcemia:
   First noticed intra-operatively.
   - Trend and replete as needed
   .
   # Hypertension:
   Hold home lisinopril while concern for hypovolemic shock and evolving
   sepsis.
   .
   # COPD:
   Assess ventilator for evidence of airway resistance and initiate
   bronchodilators if indicated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus and subsequent colostomy who presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain. He has been diagnosed with hypotension (likely multifactorial), small bowel obstruction (possibly due to prior surgeries), atrial flutter, acute kidney injury, elevated troponin levels (likely related to a history of coronary artery disease), mild hypercalcemia, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension (shock): The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic shock. This condition can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's symptoms of feculent vomit and LLQ abdominal pain suggest a small bowel obstruction, which may be caused by adhesions from previous surgeries. If not promptly addressed, this can lead to further complications such as ischemia and necrosis of the bowel.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient's development of atrial flutter should be closely monitored, as it can potentially progress to atrial fibrillation, leading to irregular heart rhythm and potential complications like embolic events.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury, likely resulting from sepsis and hypovolemia. If left untreated, this can progress to chronic kidney disease and"

   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)/Tachycardia:
   Developed shortly after arriving in ICU, no clearly visible flutter
   waves, though tough to assess in setting of low-amplitude p-waves at
   baseline. Most likely a-flutter given fixed regular rate of ~150.
   - Continue amiodarone for rate control
   - consider DC cardioversion if limited BP despite maximal vasoactive
   agents
   .
   # Acute kidney injury:
   Creatinine at presentation to the hospital was Cr 2.6, baseline Cr
   1.1-1.3. Likely multifactorial due to ATN from sepsis, hypovolemia
   causing pre-renal azotemia.  Improved this AM, likely secondary to
   dilution from massive fluid resuscitation.
   - Monitor for resolution with trend of creatinine
   - UOP continues to be low but adequate
 40-60 cc/hr, will continue to
   monitor.
   .
   # Elevated troponin:
   In setting of history of CAD with prior MI by history and evidenced in
   EKGs dating back over 15 years. Stress test last performed in [**2107**] and

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus and subsequent colostomy reversal. He presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was diagnosed with hypotension (shock), small bowel obstruction (SBO), atrial flutter, acute kidney injury (AKI), elevated troponin, mild hypercalcemia, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient's condition has been managed aggressively with fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, vasopressors, and supportive care. The arterial and multi-lumen lines were inserted to monitor the patient's condition closely. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding his cardiac function, electrolyte imbalances, and ongoing monitoring of various lab parameters.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension (shock): The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, involving hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic shock. It is important to continue aggressive fluid resuscitation and adjust vasopressor therapy as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient's SBO is likely due to previous abdominal surgeries, including volvulus and colostomy reversal. The current plan includes maintaining NPO status, decompressing the bowel with an OG tube, and aggressive fluid resuscitation. Surgical consultation should be sought for further evaluation and management.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration.
   .
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic shock. Hypovolemic shock
   likely induced by poor PO intake prior to presentation. Distributive
   shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well
   as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria
   through ischemic bowel. Cardiogenic shock possible in setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation in patient with unknown systolic
   function as well as cardiomyopathy of acute illness and sepsis.
   - Fluid resuscitate aggressively
   - Vanc/Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora
   - phenylephrine and vasopressin to augment BP; will attempt to wean
   vasopressin again today
   - Follow pending cultures
   - Maintain ventilation mechanically while giving fluids and awaiting
   likely blossoming of inflammatory response to sepsis in lungs; will try
   PS today given minimal vent settings at present.
   - Vanc level in AM
   .
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   - Appreciate input from surgery team
   - NPO
   - OG tube to wall suction to decompress bowl peri-operative
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   - q8h lytes
   - will address issue of nutrition with surgery today and consider TPN
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:
   Developed shortly after arriving in ICU, no clearly visible flutter
   waves, though tough to assess in setting of low-amplitude p-waves at
   baseline. Most likely a-flutter given fixed regular rate of ~150.
   - Continue amiodarone for rate control (will continue IV given bowel
   resection)
   - consider DC cardioversion if limited BP despite maximal vasoactive
   agents

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus and subsequent colostomy reversal. He presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was diagnosed with small bowel obstruction, likely due to adhesions from prior surgeries. The patient also has hypotension (shock) due to a combination of hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic causes. There is evidence of acute kidney injury, elevated troponin levels, mild hypercalcemia, hypertension, and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient may experience further complications related to the SBO, such as bowel ischemia or perforation.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's kidneys are currently functioning below normal levels, which can be attributed to various factors such as sepsis, hypovolemia, and use of nephrotoxic drugs.
3. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and elevated troponin levels, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock due to compromised heart function.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing or worsening infections due to the presence of an indwelling catheter and compromised immune system.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, especially if there are issues with ventilation or an inability to clear secretions effectively.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with abdominal pain and underwent an emergency laparotomy with resection of a large amount of ischemic small bowel. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has a growing gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 123/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's 24-hour events include the initiation of arterial and multi-lumen lines, as well as the administration of various medications such as cefazolin, vancomycin, piperacillin, fentanyl, midazolam, vasopressin, amiodarone, phenylephrine, famotidine, heparin sodium, and others.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is sedated and intubated, with pupils that are constricted and sluggish. His heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF), and he has right and left lower extremity edema. His abdomen is described as having hypoactive bowel sounds.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelets"

   urine output
   - on zosyn/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] check [**First Name3 (LF) **] level tomorrow morning
   - continue phenylephrine and vasopressin, plan to wean phenylephrine
   - f/u GNR speciation
 SBO/Ischemic bowel
   - s/p resection, stoma looks pink this morning
   - surgery following, if stabilizes long term plan is re-anastomosis in
   the future
   - on bowel rest, will d/w surgery about TPN plan
Renal Failure: likely pre-renal + ATN, lytes stable
   - urine output improved
   - drugs renally dosed
 Mechanical Ventilation/Respiratory Failure
   - on low TV and tolerating well
   - will continue mechanical intubation until able to self-diurese or
   tolerate lasix
 Atrial Flutter: resolved with amiodarone and off of levophed
   - will likely not need amiodarone long term, but will continue for now
   - continue IV drip given poor gut absorption
Coagulopathy: stable, s/p vitamin K, likely [**2-23**] DIC

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 2 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Feel most likely is septic and distributive
   shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well
   as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria
   through ischemic bowel.  Also GNR in blood cultures from ED.
   - Fluid resuscitate aggressively
   - Zosyn empirically to cover bowel [**Last Name (LF) 12253**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be able to DC vancomycin
   today.  Will redose Zosyn as creatinine now improved.
   - Will leave vasopressin on through the day and may be able to wean
   tonight
   - Follow pending cultures
   - Continue current vent settings.  Is significantly fluid positive and
   will likely need diuresis prior to extubation but need to wean all
   pressors first.  No need for SBT in the morning.
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   - Appreciate input from surgery team
   - NPO for now
   - OG tube to wall suction to decompress bowl peri-operative
   - Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   - Check pm lytes
   - can likely trial tube feeds tomorrow if off pressors
   #. ANEMIA: had significant Hct drop since yesteray, likely dilutional
   in setting of getting fluid resuscitation.
   - check repeat Hct
   - Will transfuse to goal >25 per surgery team
   - Active type and screen
   - Guaiac stools but likely will be positive
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped last night
   in the setting of bradycardia.  ECG appears to show wandering atrial
   pacemaker with bradycardia.
   - Repeat 12 lead to assess rhythm
   - Continue to hold amiodarone
   #. Coagulopathy: Was likely in DIC on admission,  but with increased
   fibrinogen due to acute phase reactants.
   - Trend coags
   - Check haptoglobin, consider TTP
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   - Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Elevated troponin:  Has had stable troponins and no evidence of
   ischemic cardiac disease
   # Mild hypercalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   - Trend and replete as needed
   # Hypertension: Hold home lisinopril while hypotensive

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus who underwent colostomy surgery. He presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was diagnosed with small bowel obstruction (SBO). He had significant ischemic bowel removed during surgery.
- The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with poor dentition and poor appearance.
- He is experiencing hypotension and is believed to be in septic and distributive shock due to an inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection.
- The patient has been receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation, antibiotics (Zosyn), and vasopressin. His pressors are being weaned off.
- He is expected to continue on mechanical ventilation, and diuresis may be required prior to extubation.
- The patient's blood cultures show growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR).
- He has a history of prior abdominal surgeries, which likely contributed to the development of SBO.
- He is NPO (nothing by mouth) and has an orogastric tube to decompress the bowel.
- His ostomy tissue appears viable, but there is no bowel movement.
- The patient has experienced a significant drop in hematocrit, likely due to fluid resuscitation, and will require transfusion.
- He has atrial flutter with variable heart rate and bradyc"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a history of volvulus and subsequent colostomy who presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain. He has undergone surgery and is currently in the ICU. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications, including hypotension (shock), small bowel obstruction (SBO), atrial flutter, acute kidney injury, elevated troponin levels, mild hypercalcemia, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

24-hour events include difficulty weaning off pressors, administration of intravenous fluids and albumin to manage hypotension, discontinuation of amiodarone due to bradycardia, and advancements in the endotracheal tube placement. The patient's vital signs and laboratory results are also provided.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension (shock): The patient is likely experiencing septic and distributive shock due to an inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection. Aggressive fluid resuscitation has been initiated, along with the administration of antibiotics and vasopressors to manage blood pressure.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient likely developed SBO due to prior abdominal surgeries. He is being managed with nasogastric tube decompression, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and nutritional support.

3. Atrial Flutter: The patient developed atrial flutter shortly after arriving in the ICU. Amiod"

   -surgery said can start TFs if off pressors.  Would wait until Monday
   at least to start TPN if thats something the family wants.  TF recs
   when can eat: nutren pulmonary at 37/hr as goal
   -pressors: could not come off.  With LR, MAPS from 60s up to 80s and
   could get neo down to 2.5 until late in day when down to 1 at m/n.
   -gave 4L LR throughout day in addition to 1L albumin
   -continued amiodarone at 0.5mg/min until 8pm which was plan, and then
   beyond that as not taking PO yet.
   -CVP 6-7.

   Creatinine at presentation to the hospital was Cr 2.6, baseline Cr
   1.1-1.3. Likely multifactorial due to ATN from sepsis, hypovolemia
   causing pre-renal azotemia.  Improved this AM, likely secondary to
   dilution from massive fluid resuscitation.
   - Monitor for resolution with trend of creatinine
   - UOP continues to be low but adequate
 40-60 cc/hr, will continue to
   monitor.
   .
   # Elevated troponin:
   In setting of history of CAD with prior MI by history and evidenced in
   EKGs dating back over 15 years. Stress test last performed in [**2107**] and
   was without evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. Patient's last lipid
   panel in [**8-/2121**] revealed HDL 87 and LDL 102. Patient not on statin or
   aspirin at home.
   - troponins neg x 3
   .
   # Mild hypercalcemia:
   First noticed intra-operatively.
   - Trend and replete as needed
   .
   # Hypertension:
   Hold home lisinopril while concern for hypovolemic shock and evolving
   sepsis.
   .
   # COPD:
   Assess ventilator for evidence of airway resistance and initiate
   bronchodilators if indicated.

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus status post colostomy reversal, who presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including hypotension (shock), small bowel obstruction, atrial flutter, acute kidney injury, elevated troponin levels, mild hypercalcemia, hypertension, and COPD.

The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, with contributions from hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic shock. The patient has received aggressive fluid resuscitation and is being treated with vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.

The patient's small bowel obstruction is suspected to have developed due to prior abdominal surgeries and volvulus. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and has an orogastric tube in place to decompress the bowel. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is being provided, and the patient's ostomy tissue will be closely monitored.

The patient has developed atrial flutter, which is being managed with amiodarone for rate control. DC cardioversion may be considered if the patient's blood pressure remains low despite maximal vasoactive agents.

The patient's acute kidney injury is believed to be multifactorial, including sepsis and hypovolemia. The patient's creatinine levels have improved with fluid resuscitation.

Elevated troponin levels are likely due to the patient's history of coronary artery disease ("

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 3 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Feel most likely is septic and distributive
   shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well
   as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria
   through ischemic bowel.  Also GNR in blood cultures from ED.
   - Fluid resuscitate prn
   - Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (day 1 [**1-8**])
   - Will continue to attempt to wean vasopressin today
   - Follow pending cultures
   # Respiratory failure:
   - Changed to PS this AM.  Will check gas and reevaluate.  Is
   significantly fluid positive and will likely need diuresis prior to
   extubation but need to wean all pressors first.
   - if stays off pressors, will start active diuresis with prn lasix; if
   BP drops, may use lasix drip
   - bolus sedation with fentanyl
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   - Appreciate input from surgery team
   - will start NG tube feeds slowly if patient remains stable off
   pressors today
   - Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   - Check pm lytes
   #. ANEMIA: had significant Hct drop since yesteray, likely dilutional
   in setting of getting fluid resuscitation.
   - Will transfuse to goal >25 per surgery team
   -f/u PM hct
   - Active type and screen
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  ECG appears to show wandering atrial pacemaker
   with bradycardia.
   - Continue to hold amiodarone
   #. Coagulopathy: Was likely in DIC on admission,  but with increased
   fibrinogen due to acute phase reactants.
   - Trend coags
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   - Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Elevated troponin:  Has had stable troponins and no evidence of
   ischemic cardiac disease
   # Mild hypercalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   - Trend and replete as needed
   # Hypertension: Hold home lisinopril while hypotensive

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus who underwent colostomy reversal. He presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO). On day 3, significant ischemic bowel was removed. The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, respiratory failure, small bowel obstruction, anemia, atrial flutter, coagulopathy, acute kidney injury, elevated troponin, mild hypercalcemia, and hypertension.

The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic and distributive shock caused by an inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection from translocation of bacteria through ischemic bowel. Fluid resuscitation is recommended, and the patient is already on vasopressin and empiric antibiotics.

The respiratory failure is attributed to fluid overload, and the patient has been placed on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to improve oxygenation. Diuretics may be needed to manage fluid balance before considering extubation.

The small bowel obstruction is likely due to previous abdominal surgeries, including volvulus and colostomy. The patient's feeds should be started slowly if they remain stable off pressors today.

The patient's anemia is likely dilutional due to fluid resuscitation. Blood transfusion to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) goal of >25% is recommended.

Atrial flutter is present, and amiodarone has been withheld due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a history of volvulus who underwent colostomy surgery and presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain. He was found to have a small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent surgery to remove a significant amount of ischemic bowel.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypotension (Shock): The patient is likely experiencing septic and distributive shock due to an inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection. This is indicated by the presence of GNR in blood cultures from the emergency department.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient presented with feculent vomiting and left lower quadrant abdominal pain, likely caused by prior abdominal surgeries, volvulus, and colostomy. Measures have been taken to decompress the bowel and prevent further complications.

3. Anemia: The patient had a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration since yesterday, which is likely due to dilutional effects from fluid resuscitation. A blood transfusion is planned to reach a target hemoglobin level of over 25% as recommended by the surgery team.

4. Atrial Flutter (AFLUTTER)/Tachycardia: The patient initially presented with atrial flutter and rapid ventricular response, for which amiodarone was started. However, amiodarone was stopped due to bradycardia. Further evaluation of the rhythm is required.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus and subsequent colostomy reversal. He presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was diagnosed with small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient underwent surgery to remove a significant amount of ischemic bowel. Postoperatively, he is experiencing hypotension, which is believed to be due to septic and distributive shock caused by an inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection from translocation of bacteria through the ischemic bowel. The patient also has an atrial flutter with bradycardia, anemia, coagulopathy, acute kidney injury, elevated troponin levels, mild hypercalcemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): The patient is at risk of experiencing ongoing hypotension and shock due to septic and distributive shock. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic coverage are being provided to manage this condition.

2. SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION: The patient's SBO requires ongoing monitoring for potential complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis. Decompression of the bowel through an OG tube and close follow-up of abdominal exam findings are essential.

3. ANEMIA: The patient's significant drop in hemoglobin concentration indicates anemia, likely due to dilutional effects from fluid resuscitation. Blood transfusion is planned to achieve a target"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. He presented with abdominal pain and underwent emergency laparotomy with resection of ischemic bowel. The patient is now in septic shock with gram-negative bacteremia, which is improving. He has been transitioned to PS 5/5, off vasopressin, and received a unit of packed red blood cells. Antibiotics have been administered, including cefazolin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 95/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 6 mmHg, with fluid balance indicating an intake of 3,055 mL and output of 2,410 mL. The patient's weight has increased from 53 kg at admission to 67.8 kg currently.

Physical examination reveals cool skin, trace edema in both lower extremities, and the presence of bowel sounds. Neurologic assessment is not performed due to the patient's intubation. Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.4 K"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, who presented with abdominal pain after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy with resection of ischemic bowel. He is currently in septic shock due to gram-negative bacteremia and is showing signs of improvement. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned off vasopressors. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 95/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.1, hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 107,000/mm3, and creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. The blood cultures have grown gram-negative rods. 

The patient has several ongoing issues, including shock and hypotension, respiratory failure with significant pulmonary edema and effusions, bowel ischemia following resection, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The plan includes continuing antibiotics for gram-negative bacteremia, attempting diuresis for pulmonary edema, initiating tube feeds when hemodynamically stable, and providing long-term total parenteral nutrition for nutrition. 

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he is currently in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a history of volvulus who underwent surgery to reverse a colostomy. He presented with lower left quadrant abdominal pain and was found to have small bowel obstruction, possibly due to adhesions from previous abdominal surgeries. The patient had ischemic bowel removed during surgery. He is now experiencing hypotension and gram-negative bacteremia, likely septic shock caused by the inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection from translocation of bacteria through the ischemic bowel. 

The patient also has respiratory failure, as he requires assistance with breathing and diuresis. He has a history of small bowel obstruction, likely developed in the setting of prior abdominal surgeries. The patient is anemic, with a significant drop in hematocrit since yesterday, likely due to fluid resuscitation. He also has atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, for which amiodarone was started but then stopped due to bradycardia. 

The patient has acute kidney injury, which has now returned to baseline. He also has mild hypercalcemia and hypertension. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through total parenteral nutrition (TF recs requested). Glycemic control is being maintained with insulin sliding scale. 

The patient's current medications include furosemide, piperacillin-tazobactam, heparin, famotidine, midazolam, fentanyl, and magnesium sulfate."

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus and previous colostomy reversal. He presented with LLQ abdominal pain and was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO), including intussusception and adhesions. On the third day post-operation, he underwent removal of a significant amount of ischemic bowel. The patient is now off of pressors and doing well. He has hypotension (not shock) and GNR bacteremia, which is likely septic and distributive shock due to inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection from translocated bacteria through ischemic bowel. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension may progress to septic shock if the underlying infection is not effectively managed. Close monitoring of vital signs and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics and fluids are crucial.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status needs to be closely monitored due to the risk of respiratory failure. Diuresis should be continued to achieve the goal of a net negative 3L if tolerated.
3. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's SBO can lead to complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, and peritonitis. Continuous monitoring of abdominal exam and follow-up imaging may be necessary.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient had an acute elevation of creatinine on admission, which has now returned to baseline. Close"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who underwent an exploratory laparotomy with resection of ischemic bowel. He is currently in the ICU due to septic shock caused by GNR bacteremia. The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain and remains intubated with respiratory failure. He has been receiving diuretics and increased FiO2 to 50%. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 139/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been receiving various medications including lasix, fentanyl, and famotidine. His laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine and lactate levels. Imaging shows no significant change, but there are bilateral effusions and atelectasis. Microbiology results indicate GNR bacteremia. The patient's ongoing issues include hypotension, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, bowel ischemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite being off pressors indicates ongoing instability in blood pressure control. This could lead to organ perfusion issues and potential organ failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's significant pulmonary edema and effusions pose a barrier"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. He presented with abdominal pain and underwent exploratory laparotomy with resection of ischemic bowel. Postoperatively, he developed septic shock due to Gram-negative bacteremia. Currently, he is in the ICU on minimal ventilatory support (pressure support ventilation) with significant pulmonary edema and effusions. His condition has been improving, and he is expected to be extubated within the next 23 days. He continues to have an ostomy output, and trophic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been initiated to optimize nutritional status. His leukocytosis is stable, and he is being closely monitored for signs of infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still relying on minimal ventilatory support, which indicates ongoing respiratory failure. The significant pulmonary edema and effusions act as barriers to extubation. Fluid mobilization may be contributing to the increase in FiO2 needs. Continuous diuresis should be followed, along with monitoring electrolytes and renal function. The plan is to minimize sedation and aim for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation within the next 23 days, as per the attending physician's discretion.

2. GNR Bacteremia: The patient has ongoing Gram-negative bacteremia, and coverage with Zosyn has been continued. Specificiation and sensitivity from cultures are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a medical history of small bowel obstruction, including intussusception and adhesions, which has led to hypotension and shock. The patient also has atrial flutter. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 117/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 377 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen of 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, HCO3- of 86 mEq/L, Na+ of 142 mEq/L, Cl- of 102 mEq/L, K+ of 4.0 mEq/L, glucose of 92 mg/dL, and lactate of 1.3 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate poor perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, likely secondary to the small bowel obstruction and hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 5 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now
   volume overload.

 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Feel most likely is septic and
   distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to
   surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation
   of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (day 1 [**1-8**]); although WBC is
   elevated, it is stable with no bands
   --Follow pending blood cultures
   # Respiratory failure:
   --Diuresing well, but still needs more taken off
   --Continue to diurese today, goal net negative 2L/day if BP tolerates
   --Check afternoon lytes
   --Will hold off on lasix if patient auto-diureses
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  No longer an acute issue.
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   --Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Mild hypocalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   --Trend and replete as needed
   # Hypertension: Hold home lisinopril while actively diuresing

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus who underwent colostomy surgery. He presented with lower left quadrant abdominal pain and was diagnosed with small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient had an ischemic bowel, which required removal of a significant amount of the bowel. The patient also experienced septic and distributive shock, but is currently stable off of pressors.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The plan is to continue diuresis to reduce fluid overload, monitor electrolyte levels, and hold off on Lasix if the patient auto-diureses.

2. Small bowel obstruction: The patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. It is likely that he developed SBO in the setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and colostomy. The surgical recommendations should be appreciated, and the abdominal exam, including the appearance of ostomy tissue, should be monitored. Lactate levels should be sent if the abdominal exam worsens or the patient deteriorates hemodynamically.

3. Atrial flutter/tachycardia: The patient had a flutter with RVR after arriving in the ICU and was started on amiodarone, which was stopped due to bradycardia. It is no longer an acute issue.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 4 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.

 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Feel most likely is septic and
   distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to
   surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation
   of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   - Fluid resuscitate prn
   - Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (day 1 [**1-8**]), though
   increased WBC diff steady without bands so will continue current
   treatment.
   - Follow pending cultures
   -add on diff given leukocytosis
   -send urine cultures and c.diff
   # Respiratory failure:
   - Diuresing well, but still needs more taken off
   -continue to diurese today, goal net negative 3L if RF tolerates
   -pm lytes
   -lasix gtt if BPs [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **]

 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   - Appreciate input from surgery team
   - cont tube feeds, awaiting TPN recs
   - Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   #. ANEMIA: had significant Hct drop since yesteray, likely dilutional
   in setting of getting fluid resuscitation.
   - stable today, can check daily
   - Active type and screen
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  ECG appears to show wandering atrial pacemaker
   with bradycardia.
   - Continue to hold amiodarone
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   - Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Mild hypocalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   - Trend and replete as needed
   # Hypertension: Hold home lisinopril while actively diuresing

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus and previous colostomy who presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain. He was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent surgery to remove a significant amount of ischemic bowel. The patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing hypotension, suspected to be due to septic shock and distributive shock. He is being treated with fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and diuretics. Other medical conditions include respiratory failure, anemia, atrial flutter, acute kidney injury, mild hypocalcemia, and hypertension. The patient's current care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who presented with abdominal pain following an exploratory laparotomy for resection of ischemic bowel. The patient is currently experiencing septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/51 mmHg to 128/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a volume-controlled mode and minimal support barriers.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is intubated, unresponsive, and now off sedation with spontaneous movement of feet, diminished bowel sounds, and respiratory effort. There is minimal lower extremity edema, warmer skin, and wheezing.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, blood glucose level of 183 mg/dL, sodium level of 142 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Imaging shows slight improvement in lung aeration at the left base, but there are still bilateral pleural effusions. Microbiology results indicate growth of gram-negative rods and bacteroides, with pending results"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who underwent an exploratory laparotomy with resection of ischemic bowel. He presented with abdominal pain and was diagnosed with septic shock caused by GNR bacteremia, which is now improving. The patient remains intubated and on minimal ventilatory support, showing signs of respiratory failure due to significant pulmonary edema and effusions. He is minimally responsive with poor baseline function and has evidence of contraction alkalosis on labs/ABG. The patient continues to have high ostomy output and will be initiated on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to optimize nutritional status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern as he continues to have significant pulmonary edema and effusions. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure and potential need for more aggressive ventilatory support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) if the edema and effusions do not improve.
2. GNR Bacteremia: Although the patient's GNR bacteremia is improving, there is still a risk of recurrent infection or development of antibiotic resistance. Monitoring for signs of worsening infection and regular evaluation of microbiology results are essential.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status and minimally responsive behavior could be attributed to sepsis, medication effects, or other underlying causes. Close monitoring and evaluation"

   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 5 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now
   volume overload.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Feel most likely is septic and
   distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to
   surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation
   of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 7 of 14)
   --Follow pending blood cultures
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Possibly impaired clearance of sedating
   medications.  Concerning for anoxic brain injury given severe
   hypotension during septic shock.  Mental status appears to be slowly
   improving on repeat exams
   - will continue to monitor
 Leukocytosis: Increased today, but no bandemia.  Unclear cause,
   although in the context of hypotension overnight, will pan-culture for
   new sources of infection
    - U/A, Urine Cx
   - Blood cultures today
   - Will send cultures of line tips when a line and CVL are d/c
   - will send C diff if patient passes any stool rectally.
 Respiratory failure:
   --Diuresing well, but still needs more taken off
   --Continue to diurese today, goal net negative 2L/day if BP tolerates
   --Will decrease PS today to see how patient tolerates
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --Recheck  albumin today
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  No longer an acute issue.
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   --Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Mild hypocalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus and subsequent colostomy, who presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was diagnosed with small bowel obstruction (SBO). He underwent surgery to remove a significant amount of ischemic bowel. The patient's course has been complicated by septic and distributive shock, volume overload, altered mental status, leukocytosis, respiratory failure, atrial flutter, acute kidney injury, mild hypocalcemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: The patient may develop hypotension and septic shock due to the inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection caused by translocation of bacteria through ischemic bowel.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status may continue to deteriorate due to impaired clearance of sedating medications or anoxic brain injury caused by severe hypotension during septic shock.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient may have an increased white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. Diuresis and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary.
5. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient may develop complications related to SBO, such as bowel ischemia, perforation, or recurrent obstruction.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 5 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now
   volume overload.
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Possibly impaired clearance of sedating
   medications.  Concerning for anoxic brain injury given severe
   hypotension during septic shock.
   - will continue to monitor
 Leukocytosis: unclear source, but could be reinfected, possibly from
   a line or
    - reculture today

 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Feel most likely is septic and
   distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to
   surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation
   of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (day 1 [**1-8**]); although WBC is
   elevated, it is stable with no bands
   --Follow pending blood cultures
 Respiratory failure:
   --Diuresing well, but still needs more taken off
   --Continue to diurese today, goal net negative 2L/day if BP tolerates
   --Check afternoon lytes
   --Will hold off on lasix if patient auto-diureses
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  No longer an acute issue.
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   --Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Mild hypocalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   --Trend and replete as needed
   # Hypertension: Hold home lisinopril while actively diuresing

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus and subsequent colostomy reversal. He presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was found to have a small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient underwent surgery and removal of ischemic bowel on day 5. Postoperatively, he experienced septic and distributive shock, which is now being managed without the need for pressors.

The patient has altered mental status, which may be attributed to poor baseline mental functioning and severe hypotension during septic shock. There is concern for anoxic brain injury. Leukocytosis is present but the source is unclear.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension (shock)/GNR bacteremia, likely due to septic and distributive shock caused by an inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection. Fluid resuscitation and antibiotics (Zosyn) have been initiated.

Additionally, the patient has respiratory failure, as evidenced by the need for mechanical ventilation and diuresis to manage fluid overload. The goal is to achieve a net negative fluid balance of 2 liters per day.

The patient has a history of small bowel obstruction, likely resulting from prior abdominal surgeries. The ostomy output is large, and Imodium has been started to manage this.

There is also a mention of atrial flutter/tachycardia, which responded to amiodarone but was stopped due to brad"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a chief complaint of small bowel obstruction. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments, including TPN with lipids, nutrition through a nasogastric tube, and medication for stress ulcers and VAP prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 92/43 to 142/66 mmHg, heart rate between 69-81 bpm, respiratory rate of 18-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for hypotension and atrial flutter. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows no evidence of acute hemorrhage or new masses on head CT, but there is a rim calcified lesion in the right periventricular area. Microbiology results indicate the presence of beta lactamase positive Bacteroides fragilis group. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and they are on DNR (do not resuscitate) status.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Small bowel obstruction: This can lead to complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate inadequate perfusion to vital organs."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a history of volvulus and subsequent colostomy reversal. He presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was diagnosed with small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient underwent surgery to remove a significant amount of ischemic bowel. 

The patient's course in the ICU has been complicated by septic and distributive shock, now volume overload. The patient also has altered mental status, possibly due to impaired clearance of sedating medications. There is evidence of leukocytosis, and the patient is being recultured today. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient requires respiratory support, and there is a need to continue monitoring and diuresing. 
2. Small bowel obstruction: The patient has a history of SBO, which may lead to further complications such as intussusception or adhesions.
3. Septic shock: The patient had septic and distributive shock, which could recur if there is an ongoing infection.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient had an acute elevation of creatinine on admission, likely prerenal due to fluid resuscitation.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient has mild hypocalcemia, which should be monitored and repleted as needed.
6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and the lisinopril should be held while actively diuresing.
7. Atrial flutter: The patient had atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, but it is no longer an acute issue.
8. Potential complications from the surgery, such as wound infection or abscess formation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, fluid balance, and laboratory values to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a history of volvulus and colostomy reversal who presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was diagnosed with small bowel obstruction (SBO). He underwent surgery to remove ischemic bowel and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing hypotension and septic shock, which have responded well to fluid resuscitation and antibiotics. He also has respiratory failure and is being weaned off mechanical ventilation. The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to anoxic brain injury or impaired clearance of sedating medications. There is concern for small bowel obstruction recurrence, so the patient's abdominal exam will be monitored closely. Other issues include atrial flutter, acute kidney injury, mild hypocalcemia, and hypertension. The patient is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding and TPN, as well as insulin for glycemic control. He is on prophylactic heparin for DVT and stress ulcer prevention. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of small bowel obstruction: The patient's abdominal exam will be closely monitored to detect any signs of obstruction.
2. Infection: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage, there is a risk of infection due to his compromised immune system and presence of ischemic bowel.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function will need to be closely monitored as he is being weaned off mechanical ventilation.
4. Altered mental status:"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who presented with abdominal pain after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy and resection of ischemic bowel. The patient was diagnosed with septic shock secondary to Gram-negative bacteremia and is currently on mechanical ventilation with volume and pressure-controlled modes due to volume overload and mild airway obstruction.

The patient experienced hypotension overnight, which responded to intravenous fluid boluses. The use of imodium was initiated to manage ongoing bowel output. The patient's leukocytosis is concerning for an evolving infection, although there is no evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). Cultures for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and surveillance cultures are pending. 

The main barriers to extubation include respiratory failure due to edema and effusions. The patient's mental status has shown minimal improvement, and the head CT did not reveal any acute processes. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated for the treatment of Gram-negative bacteremia, and the patient's bowel ischemia has been managed with resection and continued monitoring.

In terms of nutrition, the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and enteral nutrition in the form of Nutren Pulmonary (full formula). Glycemic control is being maintained through regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has arterial and central lines"

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, who presented with abdominal pain post-ex laparotomy and resection of ischemic bowel. He developed septic shock with gram-negative bacteremia but is now improving. However, he remains on mechanical ventilation with volume overload and minimal spontaneous breathing efforts, making extubation challenging.

The patient's recent events include becoming hypotensive overnight, responding to intravenous fluid boluses. He was started on imodium and has ongoing issues with hypotension, likely due to volume given significant ostomy output and autodiuresis. There is also concern for evolving infection, as evidenced by leukocytosis, but the patient remains comfortable on minimal FiO2 and vent support without new secretions.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, requiring minimal vent support (CPAP/PSV) and showing progress in terms of edema/effusions on imaging with autodiuresis. The patient's mental status is minimally responsive, likely due to poor baseline function. Imaging shows no acute process.

The patient has GNR bacteremia caused by bacteroides, for which he is being treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), now on day 7. Leukocytosis is a concern, with no bandemia, and there is a concern for evolving infection, so a pan culture is planned. The patient's bowel ischemia, which was surgically"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS)
 SHOCK, OTHER
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 5 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now
   volume overload.
 Leukocytosis:  Continues to increase without a clear source.  Unclear
   cause, and work-up yesterday was not revealing.  One possibility is
   that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn resistant, or he could have an
   unpenetrable source somewhere in his body.
    - Add sensi
s on to bacteroides culture.
   - lines out yesterday and pan-cultured.  No need to repeat today.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Feel most likely is septic and
   distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to
   surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation
   of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 8 of 14)
   --Follow pending blood cultures
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 Respiratory failure:  Could not try extubation today as BP unstable
   and had hypoxic episode.  Hypoxia likely due to effusions seen on CXR.
   --Diuresing well, but still needs more taken off
   --Continue to diurese today, goal negative 1L/day if BP tolerates.  No
   need for lasix this morning as he is negative while TPN is held.
   --Will decrease PS today to see how patient tolerates
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  No longer an acute issue.
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   --Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Mild hypocalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   --Trend and replete as needed
   # Hypertension: Hold home lisinopril while actively diuresing

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a history of volvulus who underwent colostomy surgery. He presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO), including intussusception and adhesions. The patient underwent removal of significant ischemic bowel on post-operative day (POD) 5.

The patient's course in the ICU has been complicated by septic and distributive shock, volume overload, leukocytosis, hypotension, atrial flutter, acute kidney injury, and mild hypocalcemia. The patient's mental status has also been altered, but this is likely due to slow clearance of sedating medications.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. The hypoxia is likely due to effusions seen on chest X-ray. Diuretics are being used to remove excess fluid, and the plan is to decrease positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to see how the patient tolerates it.

2. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient presented with feculent vomit"

 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 5 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now
   volume overload.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Feel most likely is septic and
   distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to
   surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation
   of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 7 of 14)
   --Follow pending blood cultures
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Possibly impaired clearance of sedating
   medications.  Concerning for anoxic brain injury given severe
   hypotension during septic shock.  Mental status appears to be slowly
   improving on repeat exams
   - will continue to monitor
 Leukocytosis: Increased today, but no bandemia.  Unclear cause,
   although in the context of hypotension overnight, will pan-culture for
   new sources of infection
    - U/A, Urine Cx
   - Blood cultures today
   - Will send cultures of line tips when a line and CVL are d/c
   - will send C diff if patient passes any stool rectally.
 Respiratory failure:
   --Diuresing well, but still needs more taken off
   --Continue to diurese today, goal net negative 2L/day if BP tolerates
   --Will decrease PS today to see how patient tolerates
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --Recheck  albumin today
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  No longer an acute issue.
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   --Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Mild hypocalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   --Trend and replete as needed
   # Hypertension: Hold home lisinopril while actively diuresing

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a history of volvulus who underwent colostomy reversal and presented with LLQ abdominal pain. He was diagnosed with small bowel obstruction (SBO), including intussusception and adhesions. The patient had surgery to remove a significant amount of ischemic bowel. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing septic and distributive shock, volume overload, altered mental status, leukocytosis, respiratory failure, and mild hypocalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. His respiratory status needs close monitoring, and there is a possibility of extubation if his mental status improves and he tolerates decreased pressure support.
2. Hypotension (Shock): The patient had septic and distributive shock, which has improved but still requires careful monitoring and fluid resuscitation as needed.
3. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's SBO needs ongoing assessment for signs of worsening abdominal pain or deterioration. Surgical recommendations will be followed, and the abdominal exam should be monitored.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is improving slowly, but it is important to continue monitoring for any changes or deterioration.
5. Leukocytosis: Although the cause of leukocytosis is unclear, it is important to pan-culture for new sources of infection, especially considering the patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old male who was admitted with ischemic bowel and underwent resection. He has been experiencing respiratory failure and requires ventilator support. There have been episodes of desaturation, which seem to be positional and have resolved. The patient also has hypotension, partly due to medication, but could also be related to an incompletely controlled infection as indicated by rising leukocytosis. The patient is also showing signs of small bowel obstruction and atrial flutter. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient continues to require ventilator support, indicating ongoing difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation. This could potentially lead to further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is partially due to medication, particularly fentanyl, which can cause vasodilation and lower blood pressure. However, the rising leukocytosis raises concerns about an ongoing infection that may not be fully controlled. This could lead to septic shock, a potentially life-threatening condition.

3. Small bowel obstruction: The patient has evidence of small bowel obstruction, possibly due to adhesions or intussusception. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to further complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, or strangulation.

4. Atrial flutter: The patient is experiencing atrial flutter, an abnormal heart rhythm that can"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male who has been admitted with ischemic bowel and underwent resection. The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications.

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient continues to require ventilator support and had brief desaturations this morning, which seemed positional and resolved. Given the high oxygen levels, the patient will be continued on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and will undergo frequent spontaneous breathing tests (SBT) to diurese.

2. Hypotension: The patient appears to be partly hypotensive due to medications, although rising leukocytosis raises the question of incompletely controlled infection. The plan is to try low-dose morphine instead of fentanyl and call the microbiology lab to reassess bacteroides sensitivities and adjust antibiotics as needed.

3. Acute mental status change (AMS): The patient's AMS appears to be improving, possibly related to medications. The rest of the plan will be as per the ICU resident's note.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's requirement for prolonged ventilator support.
- Nosocomial infection or sepsis due to rising leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing or new infection.
- Further deterioration in respiratory function if the patient does not respond to the current ventilator settings or if there is a progression of the underlying condition.
- Possible worsening of hyp"

   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 5 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now
   volume overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously 1.9L negative yesterday but
   effusions persist on CXR.  Respiratory status is improving, with better
   RSBI today.  Interactive and doing well on minimal pressure support,
   may be able to be extubated today, but need to address code status (do
   not re-intubate?) beforehand.
   --Diuresing well, but still needs more taken off
   --Continue to diurese today, goal negative 1L/day if BP tolerates.  No
   need for lasix this morning as he is negative while TPN is held.
   --Will decrease PS today to see how patient tolerates
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 Leukocytosis:  Continues to increase without a clear source.  Unclear
   cause, and work-up yesterday was not revealing.  One possibility is
   that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn resistant, or he could have an
   unpenetrable source somewhere in his body.
    - Add sensitivities on to bacteroides culture.
   - lines out yesterday and pan-cultured.  No need to repeat today.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Feel most likely is septic and
   distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to
   surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation
   of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 8 of 14)
   --Follow pending blood cultures
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  No longer an acute issue.
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   --Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Mild hypocalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus and previous colostomy, who presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO).
- He underwent surgery to remove a significant amount of ischemic bowel on day 5 post-operation (POD 5).
- The patient's course in the ICU has been complicated by septic, distributive shock, and now volume overload.
- Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on minimal pressure support and may be able to be extubated today, pending resolution of code status (do not re-intubate?).
- Diuresis: The patient is diuresing well but still needs more fluid removed.
- Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count continues to increase without a clear source. It is unclear whether this is due to Zosyn-resistant bacteroides or an unpenetrable source in the body.
- Hypotension (shock)/GNR bacteremia: The patient likely experienced septic and distributive shock due to an inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection. He is now doing well off of pressors.
- Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is improving, and a CT scan did not show any clear cause for continued sedation.

   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 5 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now
   volume overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously 1.9L negative yesterday but
   effusions persist on CXR.  Respiratory status was improving, with
   better RSBI in early AM, but then had acute desaturation.  Now
   stabilized again.  Mucus plug and leukocytosis are concerning for
   infection.  Interactive and adequately alert. Still may be able to be
   extubated late today or early tomorrow but need to address code status
   (do not re-intubate?) beforehand.
   --Broaden abx for possible VAP given secretions -> add Vanco and Cipro.
   --Diuresing well without lasix, goal slightly negative today.
   --Wean PS back down to 5/5 with 50% O2 when possible.
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are broadening abx coverage as
   above.  One possibility is that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn
   resistant, or he could have an unpenetrable source somewhere in his
   body.
    - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - culture if spikes or Leukocytosis increases.  Recently Cdiff
   negative.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Was most likely septic and
   distributive shock occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as
   well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of
   bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 9 of 14)
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus who presented with LLQ abdominal pain and was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO). He underwent surgery to remove a significant amount of ischemic bowel on POD 5. The patient's course has been complicated by septic, distributive shock, and now volume overload. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure, acute hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient's respiratory status was improving but then had an acute desaturation event. There is concern for infection given the mucus plug and leukocytosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and management.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing acute hypotension, which could be related to septic shock or the use of certain medications. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid resuscitation or medication adjustments may be necessary.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, which could be due to multiple factors including medication effects, infection, or underlying chronic conditions. Monitoring for any changes in consciousness or cognition is important.
4. Small bowel obstruction: The patient has a history of SBO, and there is concern for potential complications such as intestinal ischemia or perforation. Monitoring for signs of worsening obstruction or complications is essential.
5. Infection: Leukocytosis and the presence of a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension, admitted with ischemic small bowel post-resection. He is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure due to volume overload and mucous plugging. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation but is being weaned off oxygen. The endotracheal tube has been repositioned. Inhalers are being added to improve pulmonary toilet, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated for potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is leukocytosis, likely related to VAP, and the patient is being broadened to cover for this. The patient also has ischemic bowel, for which he is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and antibiotics. Other findings include atrial flutter, hypotension, small bowel obstruction, and chronic pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure is due to volume overload and mucous plugging. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, especially respiratory rate and oxygen saturation, is necessary. Repositioning of the endotracheal tube and improvement in pulmonary toilet are recommended. Weaning off mechanical ventilation should be done gradually based on the patient's respiratory status.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of temperature, white blood cell count, and respiratory symptoms is essential. Broad"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, with removal of significant amount of ischemic bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now volume
   overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously negative yesterday but effusions
   persist on CXR.  Respiratory status improving, with better RSBI in
   early AM yesterdayt but then had acute desaturation.  Now stabilized
   again.  Mucus plug and leukocytosis are concerning for infection.
   Interactive and adequately alert. Can try extubation this AM but need
   to address code status (do not re-intubate?) beforehand.
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro until sputum cx
   neg
   --Diuresing well without lasix, goal slightly negative today.
   --Wean PS back down to 5/5 with 50% O2 when possible.
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are broadening abx coverage as
   above.  One possibility is that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn
   resistant, or he could have an unpenetrable source somewhere in his
   body.
    - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - culture if spikes or Leukocytosis increases.  Recently Cdiff
   negative.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Was most likely septic and
   distributive shock occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as
   well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of
   bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 10 of 14)
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus and subsequent colostomy, who presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO) with removal of ischemic bowel. He experienced septic, distributive shock and is now volume overloaded. The patient also has respiratory failure, with spontaneous negative efforts yesterday but persistent effusions on chest X-ray. His respiratory status is improving, with better respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) in the early morning but then had an acute desaturation event. The patient is now stabilized again, with concerns about mucus plugging and leukocytosis indicating possible infection.

The patient is interactive and adequately alert, with plans to attempt extubation in the morning after addressing code status (do not re-intubate) beforehand. Empiric coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin will be continued until sputum culture is negative. Diuresis is being encouraged without the use of lasix, with the goal of achieving a slightly negative fluid balance today. Weaning of the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) back down to 5 cmH2O with 50% oxygen when possible is planned. Holding the tube feeding (TF) overnight with the intention of performing RSBI and possibly extubating in the morning if mental status improves.

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's vitals show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/45 to 153/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's medical history includes chronic pain and acute pain. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of lactate, D-dimer, and troponin-T. The patient has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antacids, sedatives, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin assessment is not documented, which may indicate potential pressure ulcers or impaired skin integrity due to prolonged immobility.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating acute respiratory failure. However, there is no mention of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
3. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure ranges from 101/45 to 153/61 mmHg, suggesting episodes of hypotension. However, there is no indication of shock.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, with removal of significant amount of ischemic bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now volume
   overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously negative yesterday but effusions
   persist on CXR.  Respiratory status improving, with better RSBI in
   early AM yesterdayt but then had acute desaturation.  Now stabilized
   again.  Mucus plug and leukocytosis are concerning for infection.
   Interactive and adequately alert. Can try extubation this AM but need
   to address code status (do not re-intubate?) beforehand.
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro until sputum cx
   neg
   --Diuresing well without lasix, goal slightly negative today.
   --Wean PS back down to 5/5 with 50% O2 when possible.
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are broadening abx coverage as
   above.  One possibility is that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn
   resistant, or he could have an unpenetrable source somewhere in his
   body.
    - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - culture if spikes or Leukocytosis increases.  Recently Cdiff
   negative.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Was most likely septic and
   distributive shock occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as
   well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of
   bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 10 of 14)
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus and subsequent colostomy, who presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was diagnosed with small bowel obstruction (SBO). He underwent surgery to remove ischemic bowel and developed septic and distributive shock. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, leukocytosis, hypotension/generally bacteremia, altered mental status, and small bowel obstruction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced acute desaturation, which could be due to mucus plugging or infection. Effusions persist on chest X-ray, indicating ongoing respiratory issues.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting an ongoing infection. Broadening antibiotic coverage has been initiated, but the sensitivity of the bacteroides culture needs to be followed up.

3. Hypotension/Septic Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock following surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria through ischemic bowel. Fluid resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy are important in managing this condition.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has poor baseline mental functioning, and continued sedation may be due to slow clearance of sedating medications. Monitoring the patient's mental status is crucial.

5. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient presented with feculent vomit"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, with removal of significant amount of ischemic bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now volume
   overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously negative yesterday but effusions
   persist on CXR.  Respiratory status improving, with better RSBI but
   then acute desaturation following suctioning yesterday and again this
   morning.  Now stabilized again.  Mucus plug and leukocytosis are
   concerning for infection.  Interactive and adequately alert. Can try
   SBT and possible extubation in PM but need to address code status (do
   not re-intubate?) beforehand.
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro until sputum cx
   neg
   --Will continue diuresis with goal 1 L negative today
   --Repeat SBT later today
   - Possible extubation if SBT goes well
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are continuing broad abx coverage
   as above.  One possibility is that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn
   resistant, or he could have an unpenetrable source somewhere in his
   body.
    - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - culture if spikes or Leukocytosis increases.  Recently Cdiff
   negative.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Was most likely septic and
   distributive shock occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as
   well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of
   bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed with prn boluses
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 10 of 14)
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus who underwent colostomy reversal. He presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO), which required removal of ischemic bowel.
- The patient's ICU course was complicated by septic, distributive shock, and now volume overload.
- The patient has respiratory failure, with effusions persisting on chest X-ray. His respiratory status is improving, but he experienced acute desaturation following suctioning yesterday and again this morning. This could be due to mucus plugging and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection.
- The patient is interactive and adequately alert. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and possible extubation may be attempted later today, but code status (do not reintubate) needs to be addressed beforehand.
- Empiric coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin will continue until sputum culture is negative.
- Diuresis will be continued with the goal of achieving 1 liter negative fluid balance today.
- Repeat SBT later today if the patient's condition improves.
- Possible extubation if the SBT goes well.
- Broad antibiotic coverage will be continued due to leukocytosis. The recent negative Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test is a positive finding.
- If the patient's leukocyte"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern about acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but it has been ruled out. The patient's response to synchronized breathing trials (SBT) is important in determining readiness for weaning from the ventilator. 

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This needs to be monitored and managed to ensure adequate perfusion and organ function.

3. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's history of ischemic bowel and subsequent resection suggests the possibility of small bowel obstruction. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, distension, and absence of bowel movements.

4. Shock: The patient is at risk for shock, particularly due to hypotension and potential sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and organ perfusion is essential.

5. Atrial flutter: The patient has been diagnosed with atrial flutter, which is an abnormal heart rhythm. This condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.

6. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. Sputum cultures are pending, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk"

 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously negative yesterday but effusions
   persist on CXR.  Respiratory status improving, with better RSBI but
   then acute desaturation following suctioning for past several days.
   Bronch yesterday showing thick white secretions. Mucus plug and
   leukocytosis are concerning for infection.  Interactive and adequately
   alert.  Need to discuss possibility of trach/reintubation with wife
   today.
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro for now

   secretions with bronch
   --Will discuss with wife possible need for trach and ventilator if
   unable tolerate extubation
   .
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are continuing broad abx coverage
   as above.  Patient could have VAP given thick secretions and
   leukocytosis (also having low grade fevers). Another possibility is
   that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn resistant, or he could have an
   unpenetrable source somewhere in his body.
   - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - continue zosyn (day [**12-5**]) and vanc/Cipro (day 3) for now
   - reculture if spikes
   - send BAL for culture today
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a history of volvulus and subsequent colostomy reversal. He presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO), which required removal of a significant amount of ischemic bowel. His hospital course has been complicated by septic, distributive shock, and now volume overload. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he experienced acute desaturation following suctioning for several days. This indicates the possibility of mucus plug formation and infection. The presence of thick white secretions during bronchoscopy is concerning for infection, which could lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection. Broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated, but given the thick secretions and low-grade fevers, VAP should be considered.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has a baseline of poor mental functioning, and continued sedation may be due to slow clearance of sedating medications. Monitoring is recommended.
4. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's SBO may lead to further complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, or strangulation.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and diuresis should be managed carefully.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus and subsequent colostomy, who presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was diagnosed with small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient underwent surgery to remove a significant amount of ischemic bowel. Postoperatively, the patient developed septic, distributive shock, and is now experiencing volume overload. 

The patient's respiratory status has been improving, but there have been episodes of acute desaturation following suctioning. A bronchoscopy showed thick white secretions, which raises concern for infection. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, indicating a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or another infection. 

The patient's mental status has been altered, but a CT scan of the head did not reveal any clear cause for continued sedation. The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, and they were on pressors. 

The patient's nutritional needs are being met through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and enteral nutrition. Glycemic control is being maintained. 

Potential Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to episodes of acute desaturation and thick secretions found during bronchoscopy. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated leukocyte count and presence of thick secretions suggest a possible infection, such as VAP or another source of"

   have SBO, with removal of significant amount of ischemic bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now volume
   overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously negative yesterday but effusions
   persist on CXR.  Respiratory status improving, with better RSBI but
   then acute desaturation following suctioning for past several days.
   Bronch yesterday showing thick white secretions. Mucus plug and
   leukocytosis are concerning for infection.  Interactive and adequately
   alert.  Need to discuss possibility of trach/reintubation with wife
   today.
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro until sputum cx
   neg
   --Will hold on diuresis
   --wean back to PS later today
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are continuing broad abx coverage
   as above.  Patient could have VAP given thick secretions and
   leukocytosis (also having low grade fevers). Another possibility is
   that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn resistant, or he could have an
   unpenetrable source somewhere in his body.  Would infection is another
   possibility
 will touch base with surgery
    - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - will reculture today
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Was most likely septic and distributive shock
   occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well as acute
   intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria through
   ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed with prn boluses
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 11 of 14)
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus who underwent colostomy reversal. He presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was diagnosed with small bowel obstruction (SBO), leading to the removal of significant ischemic bowel. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by septic, distributive shock, and now volume overload.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, but he still has effusions on the chest X-ray. He experienced acute desaturation following suctioning, indicating possible infection with thick white secretions found during bronchoscopy. There is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given the leukocytosis and low-grade fevers. The patient is currently on broad antibiotic coverage for VAP, and the sensitivity of the bacteroides culture will be followed up.

The patient's hypotension was likely due to septic and distributive shock caused by an inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection. Now, the patient is stable off of pressors.

The patient's altered mental status is a result of baseline poor mental functioning, and a CT head did not show any clear cause of continued sedation. The sedating medications are being monitored and adjusted as needed.

The patient's history of intestinal obstruction is due to prior abdominal surgeries, including volvulus and colostomy reversal. Immodium was"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male with history of volvulus with colostomy subsequently
   reversed now admitted with SBO complicated by ishemic bowel and s/p
   small bowel resection with post op course complicated by septic shock.
   Patient now with persistent respiratory failure (10 days with ETT) with
   altered mental status as well as mucus plugging and hypoxia.
   1)Sepsis-No further positive cultures obtained,
   -Zosyn/Vanco/Cipro
   -BP without need for pressors although patient does have intermittent
   hypotension with sedation and desaturations.
   2)Respiratory Failure-This is most concerning issue and it is an issue
   of altered mental status which is less concerning as well as increase
   impact from inability to clear secretions effectively with recurrent
   collapse of lobar regions.
   -Atrovent/Albuterol
   -Bronch to work to clear left sided secretions today completely
   -Will need to continue suctioning as needed during the day
   -Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro in place
   -Will need to move to SBT to try extubation in am if at all favorable
   -Will discuss with health care proxy (wife) future if unable to
   tolerate extubation and possible need for trach and ventilatory
   dependence.
   3)Small Bowel Obstruction--Patient with persistent drainage from
   abdominal incision site--increased, yellow by report.
   -Follow wound
   -Advance tube feeds
   4)Altered Mental Status-Patient with poor baseline, persistent altered
   mental status
does respond to verbal prompts and will occasionally
   follow commands.
   -Will minimize sedation
   -[**Month (only) 51**] be limiting factor for extubation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus and subsequent colostomy reversal. He was admitted with small bowel obstruction (SBO) complicated by ischemic bowel and underwent a small bowel resection. The patient's post-operative course has been complicated by septic shock, persistent respiratory failure for 10 days with endotracheal tube (ETT) placement, altered mental status, mucus plugging, and hypoxia.

The patient has a chief complaint of sepsis and is currently receiving antibiotics (Zosyn/Vanco/Cipro). He also has respiratory failure, which is the most concerning issue, along with altered mental status and an inability to clear secretions effectively. The patient's small bowel obstruction persists, with increased drainage from the abdominal incision site. Additionally, the patient has an altered mental status but does respond to verbal prompts and can follow commands occasionally.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis - The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics, but there is a risk of further infection due to his compromised immune system.
2. Respiratory Failure - The patient's prolonged respiratory failure may lead to further lung complications, such as pneumonia or atelectasis.
3. Small Bowel Obstruction - The patient's persistent SBO can potentially result in recurrent bowel ischemia or perforation.
4. Altered Mental Status - The patient's poor baseline cognitive function may worsen if he does not improve or"

   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), found
   to have SBO, with large amounts of necrotic bowel emergently removed.
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock, and failure to
   wean from vent.
 Respiratory failure:  Bronch with removal of copioius secretions, and
   subsequent CXR showing much improvement.  Although mucous plug and
   leukocytosis are concerning for infection, nothing has grown so far.
   Interactive and adequately alert.  Family meeting yesterday; will try
   to extubate once more this afternoon
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro for now, though
   may discontinue if no evidence for infection
   --Continue albuterol/Atrovent MDIs and aggressive suctioning, chest PT
   --Attempt extubation once more this afternoon; again stress possibility
   of trach with wife.
   .
 Leukocytosis:  Trending down today, but still elevated above
   baseline.  Patient could have VAP given thick secretions and
   leukocytosis (also having low grade fevers). Another possibility is
   that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn resistant, or he could have an
   unpenetrable source somewhere in his body.
   - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - continue zosyn (day [**1-4**]) and vanc/Cipro (day 4) for now
   - reculture if spikes
   - send BAL for culture today
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a history of volvulus who had a colostomy reversed and subsequently developed small bowel obstruction (SBO). He underwent emergent removal of necrotic bowel. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by septic, distributive shock, and failure to wean from the ventilator.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient had bronchial suctioning to remove copious secretions, resulting in an improved chest X-ray. Although mucous plug and leukocytosis are concerning for infection, nothing has grown so far. The plan is to continue empiric coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for now, though it may be discontinued if no evidence of infection is found. The patient will continue to use albuterol/Atrovent MDIs and aggressive suctioning, and chest physical therapy will be continued. Another attempt at extubation will be made this afternoon, with the possibility of tracheostomy discussed with the wife.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated above baseline, indicating an ongoing infection. There is a possibility of VAP given the thick secretions and leukocytosis, or it could be due to bacteroides resistance to zosyn or an unpenetrable source of infection.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus, who underwent colostomy and subsequent reversal. He presented with symptoms of small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to necrotic bowel, which was emergently removed. The patient experienced septic and distributive shock and failed to wean from the ventilator. He is currently intubated but interactive and alert. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). There have been no significant growths in the cultures so far. The patient is being considered for extubation and may require a tracheostomy if extubation fails. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's thick secretions and leukocytosis could indicate an infection. Empiric coverage for VAP with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin has been started. The plan is to continue these antibiotics and monitor for any signs of infection.
2. Line infection: The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line. There is a risk of developing line-associated infections, which should be closely monitored.
3. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of septic shock, there is a risk of recurrent sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential.
4. Failure to wean from the"

   Wife in to communicate patient wishes--she notes that son has been
   updated, she has had time off from work and would agree with patient
   moving to extubation without plans for re-intubation as current plan of
   care given the fact that patient would require tracheostomy and be very
   unlikely to return to independent life at home where baseline status,

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male with initial admission with SBO and now has had significant
   bowel necrosis now s/p removal and with persistent respiratory failure
   in the setting of recurrent lung collapse.  He has had bronchoscopy
   with improvement in infiltrates.  He has increased alertness through
   this morning.  He has had extensive course with antibiotics with known
   pathogens treated.  He has an improved RSBI this morning and has been
   able to tolerate PSV at 5/5 for 3 hours this morning
   1)Respiratory Failure-He has had 12 days on ventilator and may be
   limited by weakness but does have modifiable variables treated
   maximally to date.  We have had extensive discussions with his wife in
   regards to possible next steps.
   -He has had some improvement in secretion volume but will have
   continued need to work to clear secretions with chest PT and suctioning
   -Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro to continue for treatment
   -Will have patient sitting up, sedation off, tube feeds held prior to
   extubation
   -We have been clear that patient may do well off of ventilatory support
   given that this is a reasonably optimal window for trial, but that
   decline is certainly possible.  With tracheostomy and chronic rehab
   making return to what was only borderline meaningful existence to the
   patient not reasonable to expect, should patient decline would move to
   CMO for support.
   -Will discuss in detail with surgical team prior to extubation given
   plan not to re-intubate
   2)SBO--S/P Resection-
   -Continue with antibiotics as described above
   -Wound management per surgical team

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with initial admission for small bowel obstruction (SBO) and subsequent bowel necrosis. The patient has persistent respiratory failure due to recurrent lung collapse and has undergone bronchoscopy with improvement in infiltrates. The patient's alertness has increased, and he has shown some improvement in secretion volume. 

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, pain control (acute and chronic), hypotension (not in shock), small bowel obstruction, and atrial flutter. 

The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for treatment of known pathogens, and his antibiotics will continue as described above. The plan is to have the patient sit up, sedation off, and tube feeds held prior to extubation. The patient's wife has been informed about the possible next steps, including the potential for extubation with a reasonable optimal window for trial but with the possibility of decline. If the patient declines, the plan is to move to comfort measures only (CMO) for support. 

The patient will also continue with wound management per surgical team and will discuss the plan in detail with the surgical team prior to extubation, given the decision not to re-intubate."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been on invasive ventilation and was recently extubated. He is now on a face mask with FIO2 of 35%. The patient's vitals are stable, and he is hemodynamically stable. However, there are several concerning findings. The patient has a positive guaiac test indicating the presence of blood in the stool. Additionally, his hemoglobin concentration is decreasing, suggesting potential gastrointestinal bleeding. To investigate further, lactate levels were ordered to rule out ischemic bowel. The patient is not oriented but remains quiet. Allergies, medications, and infusions are documented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The positive guaiac test and decreasing hemoglobin levels raise concerns for gastrointestinal bleeding. This could be due to various causes such as peptic ulcer disease, diverticulosis, or ischemic bowel. Immediate evaluation and management are necessary to identify and address the source of bleeding.

2. Ischemic Bowel: Given the presence of blood in the stool and the decreasing hemoglobin levels, ischemic bowel should be considered. Lactate levels have been ordered to help determine if there is ischemia. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential to prevent further complications like bowel necrosis or perforation.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on invasive ventilation,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a history of volvulus and subsequent colostomy, who presented with symptoms of small bowel obstruction (SBO). He underwent an emergency removal of necrotic bowel and experienced complications including septic shock, difficulty weaning from ventilation, and respiratory failure. The patient has been on invasive ventilation but was recently extubated and is currently on a face mask with supplemental oxygen. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 113/67 mmHg, heart rate of 78 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a history of poor mental functioning, but his mental status is improving. He has leukocytosis and low-grade fevers, which may indicate a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is a trace-positive guaiac test indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has a history of hypertension but is currently on hold from taking his home medication, lisinopril.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's leukocytosis, low-grade fevers, and difficulty clearing secretions suggest the possibility of VAP. The current treatment plan includes continuing empiric coverage for VAP with Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin until the BAL cultures are negative.

   to have SBO, with large amounts of necrotic bowel emergently removed.
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock, and difficulty
   weaning from vent.
 Respiratory failure:  Bronch with removal of copioius secretions, and
   subsequent CXR showing much improvement.  Although mucous plug and
   leukocytosis are concerning for infection, nothing has grown so far.
   Interactive and alert.  Extubated yesterday, oxygenating well
   post-extubation although CXR shows persistent collapse of LLL and
   patient difficult to suction
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro for now, though
   may discontinue if no evidence for infection
   --Continue albuterol/Atrovent nebs and aggressive suctioning, chest PT
   .
 Leukocytosis:  Trending down today, but still elevated above
   baseline.  Patient could have VAP given thick secretions and
   leukocytosis (also having low grade fevers). Another possibility is
   that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn resistant, or he could have an
   unpenetrable source somewhere in his body.
   - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - continue zosyn (day 13/14) and vanc/cipro (day 5) for now
   - reculture if spikes

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus who underwent colostomy surgery. He presented with symptoms of small bowel obstruction (SBO), including feculent vomitus and left lower quadrant abdominal pain. He was found to have SBO with necrotic bowel that required emergent removal. The patient experienced septic and distributive shock and had difficulty weaning from ventilation. He was extubated yesterday and is currently on face mask with FIO2 of 35%. His vital signs are stable, but he is not oriented. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the new finding of a positive guaiac stool test, indicating potential gastrointestinal bleeding. His laboratory results show leukocytosis, which could be due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or another infection source. Imaging reveals partial atelectasis of the left lower lobe, small-to-moderate left pleural effusion, and minor atelectasis at the right base. The patient's Hct is trending down, which may indicate ongoing bleeding or fluid loss. He has an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count. His blood cultures are pending, as well as sensitivities of the bacteroides culture. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics for empiric coverage of VAP, anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and pain management.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and small bowel obstruction. The patient was previously intubated but has now been successfully extubated after aggressive pulmonary toilet.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given are:

1. Pneumonia, bacterial, ventilator acquired (VAP): The patient was on invasive ventilation and had a high FIO2 overnight. This increases the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The current plan includes continuing with antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro) for an 8-day course, providing humidified air to facilitate secretion clearance, performing chest physical therapy with intermittent suctioning, and obtaining final sensitivities for bacteroides.

2. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has a known SBO, which is causing limited capacity to tolerate oral intake. The plan includes attempting to place a feeding tube and starting tube feeds today. Further wound management will be done per the surgical team.

3. Shock, other: The patient is in shock, possibly due to sepsis or another cause. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation should be implemented.

4. Atrial flutter (AFLUTTER): The patient has atrial flutter, which needs to be managed accordingly. Antiarrhythmic medications or cardioversion may be considered depending on the patient's hemodynamic stability.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs"
