","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a chief complaint of worsening encephalopathy. He has been admitted to the ICU for hepatic encephalopathy, which improved with lactulose. The patient's mental status has been deteriorating over the past two days, with increasing agitation and confusion. He was given lorazepam and became nearly unresponsive. The patient has a history of cirrhosis due to hepatitis C, hepatorenal syndrome resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and other medical history that remains unchanged. His review of systems is also unchanged except for the worsening encephalopathy.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7째C (96.2째F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/83 mmHg to 201/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an ABG showing pH 7.53, PaCO2 34 mmHg, HCO3- 108 mEq/L, and BE -6 mEq/L. Physical examination findings are notable for diminished breath sounds on the chest, a midline incision on the abdomen, and unassessed peripheral pulses and skin. Neurological examination reveals the patient responding to noxious stimuli"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old with a worsening mental status, increasing agitation, and confusion. They were recently admitted for hepatic encephalopathy and showed improvement with lactulose. In the ER, their vitals were stable, and a head CT was unremarkable. The patient has a history of cirrhosis due to HCV, hepatorenal syndrome resulting in ESRD, a previous SBP, HTN, DM, and allergies to penicillins and ciprofloxacin. They received ceftriaxone but developed worsening encephalopathy after that. They were given lorazepam and became nearly unresponsive before being transferred to the ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7째C (96.2째F), a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/83 mmHg to 201/89 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an IV fluid balance of 65 mL in and 22 mL out, with a urine output of 22 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support but does not require supplemental oxygen. An arterial blood gas reveals a pH of 7.53, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 34 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-)"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old female with a history of ESLD on transfer list c/b SBP and
   HRS, HTN, DM who p/w altered mental status.
   .
   # AMS: Likely recurrent hepatic encephalopathy confounded by ativan
   administration in ED.  Patient with multiple admissions for hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Potential exacerbating causes include SBP, UTI,
   medication non-compliance.  No evidence of SBP on diagnostic
   paracentesis.  Unclear medication compliance as unable to get history.
   Likely etiology is UTI vs worsening liver disease.  Less likely would
   be uremia in setting of HD, however no other evidence of worsening
   renal function, patient seems adequately dialized.  BUN mildly
   elevated.
   - Continue lactulose titrate to [**1-22**] BM per day
   - Continue rifaximin
   - Place NGT so patient can receive medication
   - Treat UTI with ceftriaxone (avoiding cipro as had prolonged QTc in
   past)
   - Continue SBP prophylaxis with HD
   - Continue HD per renal
   - Consider LP if patient does not improve
   .
   # UTI: Possibly the etiology of her worsening AMS or at least
   contributing. Patient with long QT when receiving cipro. Will treat
   with ceftriaxone as tolerated cephalosporins in past.
   - Treat UTI with ceftriaxone (avoiding cipro as had prolonged QTc in
   past)
   - Follow up urine culture
   .
   # ESLD: ESLD secondary to hepatitis C, complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, currently listed for transplant.
   - Will continue treatment of encephalopathy/AMS per above
   - Continue nadolol
   - Continue lactulose titrate to [**1-22**] BM per day
   - Continue rifaximin
   - Obtain hepatology consult in AM
   - Ceftriaxone should cover SBP prophylaxis; can consider cefpodoxime
   when off ceftriaxone
   .
   # ESRD/hepatorenal syndrome: Patient is dialysis dependent. Continue HD
   per renal, MWF.
   .
   # DM: Insulin sliding scale while NPO.
   .
   # CVA: History of CVA that converted from an embolic stroke to a
   hemorrhagic stroke following a fall.  Continue to hold anticoagulation.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, currently NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: Peripherals, right dialysis catheter

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and hepatic encephalopathy. She is currently admitted to the ICU for altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1째C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/56 mmHg to 201/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. She is somnolent but responsive to pain, and her pupils are reactive to light.

The patient has a history of multiple admissions for hepatic encephalopathy and potential exacerbating causes include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and medication non-compliance. No evidence of SBP on diagnostic paracentesis. Unclear medication compliance as unable to get history. Likely etiology is UTI vs worsening liver disease. Less likely would be uremia in setting of hemodialysis (HD), however no other evidence of worsening renal function, patient seems adequately dialyzed. BUN mildly elevated.

The patient has been treated for hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin. She has also been started on ceftriaxone to treat the suspected UTI, avoiding ciprofloxacin due to prolonged QTc in the past. SBP prophylaxis with HD continues"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old female with a history of ESLD on transfer list c/b SBP and
   HRS, HTN, DM who p/w altered mental status.
   .
   # AMS: Likely recurrent hepatic encephalopathy confounded by ativan
   administration in ED.  Patient with multiple admissions for hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Potential exacerbating causes include SBP, UTI,
   medication non-compliance.  No evidence of SBP on diagnostic
   paracentesis.  Unclear medication compliance as unable to get history.
   Likely etiology is UTI vs worsening liver disease.  Less likely would
   be uremia in setting of HD, however no other evidence of worsening
   renal function, patient seems adequately dialized.  BUN mildly
   elevated.
   - Continue lactulose titrate to [**1-22**] BM per day
   - Continue rifaximin
   - Place NGT so patient can receive medication
   - Continue treatment of UTI with ceftriaxone (avoiding cipro as had
   prolonged QTc in past)
   - Continue SBP prophylaxis
   - Continue HD per renal
   - Consider LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow up blood/urine/peritoneal cultures, toxicologies
   - Obtain ultrasound liver with Doppler
   - Obtain echocardiogram
   .
   # UTI: Possibly the etiology of her worsening AMS or at least
   contributing. Patient with long QT when receiving cipro. Will treat
   with ceftriaxone as tolerated cephalosporins in past.
   - Continue treatment of UTI with ceftriaxone (avoiding cipro as had
   prolonged QTc in past). Likely keep on treatment for at least 48 hrs
   pending culture results. If any turn positive, low threshold to add
   coverage for nosocomial etiologies.
   - Follow up urine culture
   .
   # SBP: Negative by diagnostic paracentesis, but patient has had history
   of positive cultures in these cases. Possible precipitant of patient
   worsening AMS or at least contributing.
   - Continue ceftriaxone - should cover SBP prophylaxis; can consider
   cefpodoxime when off ceftriaxone. Likely keep on treatment for at least
   48 hrs pending culture results. If any turn positive, low threshold to
   add coverage for nosocomial etiologies.
   - Follow up GI/hepatology consult recommendations
   .
   # ESLD: ESLD secondary to hepatitis C, complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, currently listed for transplant.
   - Will continue treatment of encephalopathy/AMS per above
   - Follow up transplant surgery consult recommendations
   - Continue nadolol
   - Continue lactulose titrate to [**1-22**] BM per day
   - Continue rifaximin
   - Follow up GI/hepatology consult recommendations

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) on the transplant list, who is currently experiencing altered mental status. The patient has been admitted multiple times for hepatic encephalopathy and has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and being on the transplant list. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 104/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on a ventilator with no oxygen delivery device. 

The patient's physical examination reveals sclera anicteric, clear oropharynx, pupils reactive to light, supple neck, no jugular venous distension or liver auscultation findings, clear lungs bilaterally, regular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur at the right sternal border, midline abdominal incision with no tenderness or guarding, distended abdomen with bowel sounds present, and pitting edema in both lower extremities. 

Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 68 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, platelet count of 87 mg/dL, creatinine of 7.9 mg/dL, blood glucose of 87 mg/dL, sodium of 135 mEq/L, potassium of 4.7 mEq/L, chloride of 100 mEq/L, total bilirubin of 32.5 %, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 54 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 23 U/L, albumin of 2.3 g/dL, calcium of 9.5 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.3 mg/dL, and phosphate of 5.5 mg/dL. 

The patient's paracentesis WBC count is 155, and cultures for urine, peritoneal fluid, and MRSA are pending. The CT head is negative, and the chest X-ray is pending. 

The patient's assessment and plan include multiple diagnoses and corresponding treatments. The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include recurrent hepatic encephalopathy, urinary tract infection (UTI), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), worsening liver disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD)/hepatorenal syndrome. 

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing lactulose, rifaximin, ceftriaxone (avoiding ciprofloxacin due to prolonged QTc in the past), SBP prophylaxis, hemodialysis (HD), and considering lumbar puncture (LP) if the patient does not improve. Follow-up blood/urine/peritoneal cultures, toxicologies, ultrasound liver with Doppler, and echocardiogram are also recommended. 

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate assessment and management of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old female with a history of ESLD on transfer list c/b SBP and
   HRS, HTN, DM who p/w altered mental status.
   # AMS
   At arrival on the floor was comatose, but now is clearing slightly. Now
   moving spontaneously, but deeply stuporous/encephalopathic. Patient was
   likely encephalopathic on arrival in ED and was given ativan. Given
   flattening of mental status after this time, we attribute this as
   hepatic then medication-related. Clearing is also in context of
   rifaxamin and lactulose, with good stool output. Head CT on arrival
   also revealed no acute bleed or subacute infarction. UTI not convincing
   and no evidence for SBP yet, as infectious contributors to mental
   status. Uremia unlikely contributor given low BUN. Tox. Screen
   unrevealing.
   - Continue lactulose titrate to [**1-22**] BM per day
   - Continue rifaximin
   - Continue SBP prophylaxis with cefpodoxime (stop ceftriaxone)
   - Continue HD per renal
   - Follow up blood/urine/peritoneal cultures
   # UTI
   Less likely based on UA and culture.
   - Follow up urine culture
   # SBP
   No clear evidence for and better explanation for AMS as above. Will
   continue prophylaxis and follow culture.
   - Continue cefpodoxime and stop ceftriaxone
   - Broaden coverage depending on culture and subsequent sensitivities
   - Follow up GI/hepatology consult recommendations
   # ESLD
   ESLD secondary to hepatitis C, complicated by ascites, encephalopathy,
   varices, currently listed for transplant.
   - Will continue treatment of encephalopathy/AMS per above
   - Follow up transplant surgery consult recommendations
   - Continue nadolol
   - Continue lactulose titrate to [**1-22**] BM per day
   - Continue rifaximin
   - Follow up GI/hepatology consult recommendations
   - Cefpodoxime as above
   # ESRD/hepatorenal syndrome
   Patient is dialysis dependent. Continue HD per renal, MWF.
   - Continue dialysis and appreciate Renal input.
   # DM: Insulin sliding scale while NPO.
   # Previous CVA
   History of CVA that converted from an embolic stroke to a hemorrhagic
   stroke following a fall.  Continue to hold anticoagulation. No evidence
   or suggestion at this time, but Neurologic status will need to be
   followed closely. CT enough at this time, but if focality emerges from
   delirium, then will consider MR.

   administration in ED.  Patient with multiple admissions for hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Potential exacerbating causes include SBP, UTI,
   medication non-compliance.  No evidence of SBP on diagnostic
   paracentesis.  Unclear medication compliance as unable to get history.
   Likely etiology is UTI vs worsening liver disease.  Less likely would
   be uremia in setting of HD, however no other evidence of worsening
   renal function, patient seems adequately dialized.  BUN mildly
   elevated.
   - Continue lactulose titrate to [**1-22**] BM per day
   - Continue rifaximin
   - Place NGT so patient can receive medication
   - Continue treatment of UTI with ceftriaxone (avoiding cipro as had
   prolonged QTc in past)
   - Continue SBP prophylaxis
   - Continue HD per renal
   - Consider LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow up blood/urine/peritoneal cultures, toxicologies
   - Obtain ultrasound liver with Doppler
   - Obtain echocardiogram
   # UTI: Possibly the etiology of her worsening AMS or at least
   contributing. Patient with long QT when receiving cipro. Will treat
   with ceftriaxone as tolerated cephalosporins in past.
   - Continue treatment of UTI with ceftriaxone (avoiding cipro as had
   prolonged QTc in past). Likely keep on treatment for at least 48 hrs
   pending culture results. If any turn positive, low threshold to add
   coverage for nosocomial etiologies.
   - Follow up urine culture
   # SBP: Negative by diagnostic paracentesis, but patient has had history
   of positive cultures in these cases. Possible precipitant of patient
   worsening AMS or at least contributing.
   - Continue ceftriaxone - should cover SBP prophylaxis; can consider
   cefpodoxime when off ceftriaxone. Likely keep on treatment for at least
   48 hrs pending culture results. If any turn positive, low threshold to
   add coverage for nosocomial etiologies.
   - Follow up GI/hepatology consult recommendations
   # ESLD: ESLD secondary to hepatitis C, complicated by ascites,
   encephalopathy, varices, currently listed for transplant.
   - Will continue treatment of encephalopathy/AMS per above
   - Follow up transplant surgery consult recommendations
   - Continue nadolol
   - Continue lactulose titrate to [**1-22**] BM per day

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) on the transplant list due to SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and HRS (hepatorenal syndrome), HTN (hypertension), and DM (diabetes mellitus). She presents with altered mental status (AMS) and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple admissions for hepatic encephalopathy. The likely etiology of her worsening AMS is UTI (urinary tract infection) or worsening liver disease. Other potential exacerbating causes include SBP, UTI, medication non-compliance. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is receiving appropriate treatment for her conditions. She is on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, rifaximin for SBP prophylaxis, ceftriaxone for UTI treatment, and hemodialysis for renal failure. Further evaluation and management are recommended, including follow-up blood/urine/peritoneal cultures, toxicologies, ultrasound liver with Doppler, echocardiogram, and GI/hepatology consult recommendations. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status. It is essential to continue lactulose and rifaximin as prescribed.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient is being treated"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C. She has been admitted multiple times for hepatic encephalopathy and is currently listed for a liver transplant. The patient is also experiencing renal failure, requiring hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. She has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and is currently on hold for anticoagulation. 

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status (AMS) likely due to recurrent hepatic encephalopathy, which may be confounded by recent administration of ativan in the emergency department. Other potential exacerbating causes include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and medication non-compliance. The patient does not show evidence of SBP based on diagnostic paracentesis. 

The patient is being treated for UTI with ceftriaxone and is receiving prophylaxis for SBP. Her encephalopathy/AMS management includes lactulose titrated to one bowel movement per day and rifaximin. She is also on nadolol for ESLD and insulin sliding scale while NPO for DM. The patient is undergoing HD per renal function on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be a result"

   54 year old female with a history of ESLD on transfer list c/b SBP and
   HRS, HTN, DM who p/w altered mental status.
   # AMS
   At arrival on the floor was comatose, but now is clearing slightly. Now
   moving spontaneously, but deeply stuporous/encephalopathic. Patient was
   likely encephalopathic on arrival in ED and was given ativan. Given
   flattening of mental status after this time, we attribute this as
   hepatic then medication-related. Clearing is also in context of
   rifaxamin and lactulose, with good stool output. Head CT on arrival
   also revealed no acute bleed or subacute infarction. UTI not convincing
   and no evidence for SBP yet, as infectious contributors to mental
   status. Uremia unlikely contributor given low BUN. Tox. Screen
   unrevealing.
   - Continue lactulose titrate to [**1-22**] BM per day
   - Continue rifaximin
   - Continue SBP prophylaxis with cefpodoxime (stop ceftriaxone)
   - Continue HD per renal
   - Follow up blood/urine/peritoneal cultures

   - Broaden coverage depending on culture and subsequent sensitivities
   - Follow up GI/hepatology consult recommendations

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and chronic renal failure (CRF). She presented with altered mental status (AMS) and was found to have hepatic encephalopathy. The patient underwent dialysis, which was well tolerated, and her mental status gradually improved. She is now moving spontaneously but remains deeply stuporous. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure around 110/63 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 100%. The patient has been given lactulose and rifaximin to manage her hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by liver dysfunction. It is important to continue managing her encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin.

2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): SBP is a potential complication in patients with ESLD. Although there is no clear evidence for SBP in this case, the patient is being given cefpodoxime prophylaxis to prevent its development.

3. Upper urinary tract infection (UTI): While the patient does not have a convincing UTI based on the urine analysis and culture, it is still"
