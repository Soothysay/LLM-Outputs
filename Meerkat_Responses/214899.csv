   Assessment and Plan
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   75 y/oF with T Cell Lymphoma with CNS involvment with recurrent status
   epilepticus, non-convulsive, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   management. Phenobarbital is indicated, and we have discussed with
   neurology on call, pharmacy, and anesthesia regarding elective
   intubation for phenobarbital management, airway protection. Have also
   discussed this with the son, who is okay with trial on intubation and
   phenobarb. Risks of intubation have been discussed with the family.
         Status Epilepticus: cause likely related to TCL in CNS
   - elective intubation for phenobarb. 20mg/kg IV x1, (1500mg given 75kg
   weight). BMT fellow paged to be made aware of this decision, reached
   with resident, RN, pharmacy, and intensivist overnight.
   - Rechecked dilantin level in [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] and calculated out that her
   corrected dilantin was 15.6.  Aiming for between 16-18, will re-bolus
   her an additional 150mg in addition to her scheduled 100mg to achieve a
   higher trough.
   Her access is also fully utilized now for bicarb infusion, dilantin
   presently, and will need access for sedation for vent.
   Will continue LeVETiracetam 1000 mg IV Q8HR
   receiving steroids
   Will try and add on beta-2microglobulin,LDH,protein, VZV/HSV to CSF if
   quantity sufficient.
   Neurology to continue following.
   She is on antibiotics given low grade fevers, on vanc/cefepime.  She is
   on acyclovir as well.
   Treatment course undefined as present, likely to be continued as counts
   drop though. Will d/w BMT team in AM.
         T Cell Lymphoma:
   - Received CHOP, MTX, IT cytarabine
   - For MTX, continuing to alkalanize the urine, and following levels.
   continuing on leucovorin
   - Counts are dropping, will follow CBC and ANC.

 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   75 y/oF with T Cell Lymphoma with CNS involvment with recurrent status
   epilepticus, non-convulsive, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   management. Phenobarbital is indicated, and we have discussed with
   neurology on call, pharmacy, and anesthesia regarding elective
   intubation for phenobarbital management, airway protection. Have also
   discussed this with the son, who is okay with trial on intubation and
   phenobarb. Risks of intubation have been discussed with the family.
         Status Epilepticus: cause likely related to TCL in CNS
   - elective intubation for phenobarb. 20mg/kg IV x1, (1500mg given 75kg
   weight). BMT fellow paged to be made aware of this decision, reached
   with resident, RN, pharmacy, and intensivist overnight.
   - Rechecked dilantin level in [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] and calculated out that her
   corrected dilantin was 15.6.  Aiming for between 16-18, will re-bolus
   her an additional 150mg in addition to her scheduled 100mg to achieve a
   higher trough.
   Her access is also fully utilized now for bicarb infusion, dilantin
   presently, and will need access for sedation for vent.
   Will continue LeVETiracetam 1000 mg IV Q8HR
   receiving steroids
   Will try and add on beta-2microglobulin,LDH,protein, VZV/HSV to CSF if
   quantity sufficient.
   Neurology to continue following.
   Check daily LFTs on
   She is on antibiotics given low grade fevers, on vanc/cefepime.  She is
   on acyclovir as well.
   Treatment course undefined as present, likely to be continued as counts
   drop though. Will d/w BMT team in AM.
         T Cell Lymphoma:
   - Received CHOP, MTX, IT cytarabine
   - For MTX, continuing to alkalanize the urine, and following levels.
   continuing on leucovorin
   - Counts are dropping, will follow CBC and ANC.
         Hypertension:
   - Currently NPO, not receiving meds
   - Following for now, can address hypertension with PRN hydralazine if
   needed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement, admitted initially with febrile neutropenia. She is currently in nonconvulsant status epilepticus and has been admitted to the ICU for induction phenobarb coma. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is on mechanical ventilation. She is receiving multiple medications, including keppra, dilantin, phenobarbital, decadron, and lopressor. Her blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging and microbiology results are also included in the note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications due to mechanical ventilation and intubation.
2. Infection, particularly central nervous system infection, given her immunocompromised state and CNS involvement.
3. Bleeding or coagulation disorders due to low platelet count and abnormal coagulation profile.
4. Hepatic dysfunction based on elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.
5. Poor glycemic control due to regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.
6. Nutritional deficiencies, as indicated by low albumin level.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization.
8. Stress ulcers due to critical illness.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.

   75 y/o F with T Cell Lymphoma with CNS involvement with recurrent
   status epilepticus, non-convulsive, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   management. Phenobarbital is indicated, and we have discussed with
   neurology on call, pharmacy, and anesthesia regarding elective
   intubation for phenobarbital management, airway protection. Have also
   discussed this with the son, who is okay with trial on intubation and
   phenobarb. Risks of intubation have been discussed with the family.
         Status Epilepticus: cause likely related to TCL in CNS
   - elective intubation for phenobarb. 20mg/kg IV x1, (1500mg given 75kg
   weight). BMT fellow paged to be made aware of this decision, reached
   with resident, RN, pharmacy, and intensivist overnight. - Maintenance
   dose to be 5mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] per neuro
   - Rechecked dilantin level in [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] and calculated out that her
   corrected dilantin was 15.6.  Aiming for between 16-18, will re-bolus
   her an additional 150mg in addition to her scheduled 100mg to achieve a
   higher trough. f/u level in the AM
   - Will continue Levetiracetam 1000 mg IV Q8HR
   - Neurology to continue following. Continue continuous EEG monitoring
   showing not in status as of yesterday evening.
   - Continue dexamethasone
   - Unable to add on beta-2microglobulin, LDH, protein, VZV/HSV to CSF.
   Follow Daily LFT
   - Her access is also fully utilized now for bicarb infusion, dilantin
   presently, and will need access for sedation for vent.
         Ventilatory support/intubation. Continue AC for now. ABG
   showing alkalosis likely related to metabolic alkalosis and bicarb gtt.
   - Tv turned down overnight to 400 cc with some improvement in pH from
   7.58 --> 7.52.  Goal pH closer to 7.45. Titrate down Tv today if bicarb
   to remain on (pending MTX level this am)
   - Switched sedation from Fent/Midazolam to Propofol for ease of
   SBT/extubation in AM if ok to extubate per neuro; clarify w/neuro if
   patient needs to remain intubated while on maintenance dose of
   Phenobarb
         Low Grade Fevers. She is on antibiotics given low grade
   fevers, on vanc/cefepime.  She is on acyclovir as well.
   - BMT ok with discontinuation of ABx (Vanc/Cefepime)
   -Continue Acyclovir

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She has been experiencing recurrent non-convulsive status epilepticus and has been transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS, and ongoing seizure activity with status epilepticus. She is sedated and intubated for airway protection and management of phenobarbital. The cause of the status epilepticus is likely related to her T-cell lymphoma in the CNS.

The plan involves elective intubation for phenobarbital management, with a loading dose of 20mg/kg IV and a maintenance dose of 5mg/kg at [**Hospital1**] per neurology consultation. The corrected dilantin level was found to be 15.6, aiming for between 16-18, so an additional 150mg will be given to achieve a higher trough. Continuous EEG monitoring will continue to assess the patient's seizure activity.

Other medications include levetiracetam 1000mg IV Q8HR, dexamethasone, and antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) for low-grade fevers. The patient is also on acyclovir.

Regarding her T-cell lymphoma, she received CHOP, methotrexate, and intrathecal cytarabine. Methotrexate levels will be followed, and leucov"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old individual with a history of T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. The patient was admitted with febrile neutropenia and is currently in the ICU for induction phenobarb coma, intubated for airway control, and now presents with new fevers after stopping antibiotic therapy.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this scenario include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Infection: The patient has fevers, which could indicate an ongoing infection. Sources of infection may include the PICC line, urinary tract infection (UTI), or drug-related causes. The patient's immunocompromised state due to lymphoma treatment increases the risk of infections.

3. Seizure: The patient had status epilepticus and is being managed with antiepileptic drugs. Continuous EEG monitoring is ongoing to ensure seizure control.

4. Neurological complications: Given the patient's CNS involvement with lymphoma, there is a risk of neurological complications such as cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, or neurological deficits.

5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient has hypertension, which needs to be managed with appropriate antihypertensive therapy.

6. Hyperglycemia: The patient requires glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale to manage blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement admitted to the ICU for induction phenobarb coma and airway control. She presented with nonconvulsant status epilepticus and is now no longer seizing, but has new fevers since discontinuing her antibiotic regimen yesterday. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.0 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 77/26 mmHg to 175/90 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 59-92 bpm, respiratory rate of 14-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

Her laboratory results show leukopenia with a WBC count of 7.6, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 166, elevated creatinine level of 0.7, elevated glucose level of 396, and low albumin level of 2.7 g/dL. Other lab results are within normal range. 

Imaging shows clear lung fields on chest X-ray, and microbiology tests are pending. 

Assessment and plan include respiratory failure, acute seizure with status epilepticus, fevers, and lymphoma. The patient will continue on keppra, dilantin, and phenobarb coma with continuous EEG monitoring. She will be extubated once additional seizure treatment plans are clarified.

 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   75 y/o F with T Cell Lymphoma with CNS involvement with recurrent
   status epilepticus, non-convulsive, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   management. Phenobarbital is indicated, and we have discussed with
   neurology on call, pharmacy, and anesthesia regarding elective
   intubation for phenobarbital management, airway protection.
   Status Epilepticus: cause likely related to TCL in CNS. Elective
   intubation for phenobarb initiation.  Loading complete and currently on
   maintenance dose of 5mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] per neuro.  Seizure activity suppressed
   after load with one transient repeat episode lasting 15 min on
   afternoon of [**5-6**].  Failure to wake not likely related to status
   epilepticus, more likely related to sedating meds.
   - continue phenobarbital and check f/u level this am
   - per neurology, satisfied with current dilantin levels, will continue
   to follow daily levels
   - Will continue Levetiracetam 1000 mg IV Q8HR
   - Neurology to continue following. Continue continuous EEG monitoring
   showing not in status as of yesterday evening.
   - F/u CSF viral culture
   # Sedation/ Unresponsiveness: Pt has been off propofol for 12 hours and
   currently only withdrawing to pain. Unclear etiology; we will need
   input from neurology regarding whether this is expected with initiation
   of phenobarbital and what measures/ diagnositics should be pursued.
   Specifically, will d/w neourology re: need for imaging, effect of
   phenobarbital and subsequent dosing.
   - check phenobarbital level and d/w neuro re: dosing
  Ventilatory support. Intubated electively for phenobarb initiation
   without underlying acitve pulm issues.  Continued AC for now as pt
   tolerating well off propofol for 12 hours.  Previous metabolic
   alkalosis attributed to bicarb gtt which has been discontinued. Off all
   sedation currently.  Ability to wean limited by apnea and dependent on
   issues discussed above.
   - repeat abg and adjust vent settings accordingly.
   Fevers. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] on VANCO/CEFEPIME for febrile neutropenia
   on admission; both were discontinued shortly after arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].
   Now afebrile since morning of [**5-6**]. Time course does not fit with VAP
   but could be related to multiple lines. Of note, pt did initially p/w
   fevers prior to lymphoma diagnosis (B symptoms)
   -Continue Acyclovir and f/u CSF viral cultures
   - hold off on Abx unless we identify source or decompensates in which
   case we would resume previous broad covg
   - f/u BCX and UCX
   - d/c PICC line and culture tip
  T Cell Lymphoma: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**] is her neuro-oncologist.
   - Received CHOP, MTX, IT cytarabine; continuing dexamethasone
   - Counts are dropping, will follow CBC and ANC.
   - Per BMT, alkalinzation no longer necessary, leukovorin to be
   continued as small left pleural effusion can act as depot
   - D/W BMT re; need for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   Hypertension:
   - On metoprolol currently, adequately  controlled
   - Following for now, can address hypertension with PRN hydralazine if
   needed
   # Hct drop: recheck in PM. [**Month (only) 11**] be product of decreased cell counts from
   lymphoma Tx as WBC dropping as well
   - Transfuse for Hct< 21
   # Thrombocytopneia: Need to mnitor as 50% decline over one week. No
   need to d/c heparin at this point. [**Month (only) 11**] also be realated to famotidine
   and MTX.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement, who was admitted to the ICU for management of recurrent status epilepticus. She was intubated for airway protection during phenobarbital administration. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F, blood pressure ranging from 160/77 to 96/46 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory alkalosis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient requires continued ventilatory support and consideration for extubation once stable.
2. Seizure, with status epilepticus: Phenobarbital has been administered, and maintenance doses will be given based on weight. Levetiracetam will also be continued, and continuous EEG monitoring will be maintained.
3. Fevers: Acyclovir has been continued, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been resumed due to ongoing fevers, despite previous discontinuation.
4. T-cell lymphoma: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old individual with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. They were initially admitted with febrile neutropenia and then transferred to the ICU for induction phenobarb coma and airway control due to nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The patient is now intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F (38.5°C), blood pressure ranging from 152/62 mmHg to 167/79 mmHg, heart rate between 58-79 bpm, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute with spontaneous ventilation not observed, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 of 40%.

The patient's neurologic examination shows that they are not attentive, do not follow simple commands, respond to noxious stimuli, exhibit minimal nonpurposeful movement, and have decreased tone. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.6-9.3 thousand/mm3, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 143-198 thousand/mm3, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 0.7-0.9 mg/dL, and elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 396-118 mg/dL. The patient's imaging shows right lower lobe atelectasis versus small effusion, and their microbiology tests are pending.

   I met with the [**Known lastname 6025**] family, along with the neurology and BMT teams.
   The family was updated to the patient
s current status.  The family had
   many questions regarding prognosis and quality of life which were
   answered by all teams.  We continue to wait for the effects of
   phenobarb to wear off, hopeful that we will then be able to extubate
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6025**].  We will continue to monitor and uodate family as to any
   new change in condition.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old individual with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement, initially admitted with febrile neutropenia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute status epilepticus, and potential infection. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on ventilator support due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).

2. Status Epilepticus: The patient is at risk of recurrent seizures and further neurological complications. It is important to monitor for any changes in mental status or seizure activity.

3. Infection: The patient has fevers, and an infection workup is underway. The patient may be at risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, especially considering the use of indwelling lines and prolonged immobility.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has mild thrombocytopenia, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.

5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and it needs to be managed appropriately.

6. Lymphoma-related complications: The patient's underlying T-cell lymphoma can lead to various complications such as infections, organ dysfunction, or progression of the disease itself.

7. Medication side effects: The patient is on multiple medications including phenobarbital, dilant"

 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   75 y/o F with T Cell Lymphoma with CNS involvement with recurrent
   status epilepticus, non-convulsive, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   management. Phenobarbital is indicated, and we have discussed with
   neurology on call, pharmacy, and anesthesia regarding elective
   intubation for phenobarbital management, airway protection.
   Status Epilepticus: cause likely related to TCL in CNS. Elective
   intubation for phenobarb initiation.  Loading complete and currently on
   maintenance dose of 5mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] per neuro.  Seizure activity suppressed
   after load with one transient repeat episode lasting 15 min on
   afternoon of [**5-6**].  Failure to wake not likely related to status
   epilepticus, more likely related to sedating meds.
   - continue phenobarbital and check f/u level this am
   - per neurology, satisfied with current dilantin levels, will continue
   to follow daily levels
   - Will continue Levetiracetam 1000 mg IV Q8HR
   - Neurology to continue following. Continue continuous EEG monitoring
   showing not in status as of yesterday evening.
   - F/u CSF viral culture
   # Sedation/ Unresponsiveness: Pt has been off propofol for 12 hours and
   currently only withdrawing to pain. Unclear etiology; we will need
   input from neurology regarding whether this is expected with initiation
   of phenobarbital and what measures/ diagnositics should be pursued.
   Specifically, will d/w neourology re: need for imaging, effect of
   phenobarbital and subsequent dosing.
   - check phenobarbital level and d/w neuro re: dosing
  Ventilatory support. Intubated electively for phenobarb initiation
   without underlying acitve pulm issues.  Continued AC for now as pt
   tolerating well off propofol for 12 hours.  Previous metabolic
   alkalosis attributed to bicarb gtt which has been discontinued. Off all
   sedation currently.  Ability to wean limited by apnea and dependent on
   issues discussed above.
   - repeat abg and adjust vent settings accordingly.
   Fevers. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] on VANCO/CEFEPIME for febrile neutropenia
   on admission; both were discontinued shortly after arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].
   Now afebrile since morning of [**5-6**]. Time course does not fit with VAP
   but could be related to multiple lines. Of note, pt did initially p/w
   fevers prior to lymphoma diagnosis (B symptoms)
   -Continue Acyclovir and f/u CSF viral cultures
   - hold off on Abx unless we identify source or decompensates in which
   case we would resume previous broad covg
   - f/u BCX and UCX
   - d/c PICC line and culture tip
  T Cell Lymphoma: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**] is her neuro-oncologist.
   - Received CHOP, MTX, IT cytarabine; continuing dexamethasone
   - Counts are dropping, will follow CBC and ANC.
   - Per BMT, alkalinzation no longer necessary, leukovorin to be
   continued as small left pleural effusion can act as depot
   - D/W BMT re; need for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   Hypertension:
   - On metoprolol currently, adequately  controlled
   - Following for now, can address hypertension with PRN hydralazine if
   needed
   # Hct drop: recheck in PM. [**Month (only) 11**] be product of decreased cell counts from
   lymphoma Tx as WBC dropping as well
   - Transfuse for Hct< 21
   # Thrombocytopneia: Need to mnitor as 50% decline over one week. No
   need to d/c heparin at this point. [**Month (only) 11**] also be realated to famotidine
   and MTX.
   - continue to follow
   - d/w BMT
  Electrolyte Abnormalities
   - K, Mg repletion as needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and central nervous system involvement, who was admitted to the ICU for the management of recurrent status epilepticus. She has been on phenobarbital and dilantin for seizure control, and her seizure activity has been suppressed. However, she remains unresponsive and sedated, which is unclear whether it is related to the status epilepticus or sedating medications.

The patient is intubated for elective phenobarbital initiation and airway protection. She is currently on a maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg of phenobarbital. The EEG monitoring shows that she is not in status epilepticus as of yesterday evening.

The patient has respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is receiving ventilatory support. Her metabolic alkalosis has resolved since discontinuing the bicarbonate gtt. She is tolerating well off propofol for 12 hours and the ability to wean her off the ventilator is limited by apnea and dependent on issues discussed above.

The patient initially presented with fevers prior to the lymphoma diagnosis and is being treated with acyclovir for suspected viral infection. However, she is now afebrile since the morning of [5-6]. There are no signs of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but further investigations are needed.

The patient's T-cell lymphoma is being treated with CHOP, methotrexate, and"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   75 y/o F with T Cell Lymphoma with CNS involvement with non-convulsive
   recurrent status [**Hospital 6033**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for elective
   intubation for initiation of phenobarbital. Pt has failed continues to
   be somnolent off propofol, but is still seizing through current levels
   of dilantin, phenobarb, and keppra.
   Status Epilepticus: cause likely related to TCL in CNS. Elective
   intubation for phenobarb initiation.  Loading complete and currently on
   maintenance dose of 5mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] per neuro.  Seizure activity initially
   suppressed after load with one transient repeat episode lasting 15 min
   on afternoon of [**5-6**], but then had several episodes on afternoon of
   [**5-7**].  Failure to wake not likely related to status epilepticus, more
   likely related to sedating meds.
   - holding phenobarbital and check f/u level this am
   - increase dose to 130 tid with addtnl one time 300mg dose, will
   continue to follow daily levels of dilantin and free dilantin
   - Will continue Levetiracetam 1000 mg IV Q8HR
   - Neurology to continue following. Continue continuous EEG monitoring
   - F/u CSF viral culture
   # Sedation/ Unresponsiveness: Pt has been off propofol for 12 hours and
   only intermittently withdrawing to pain. As per neurology, not expected
   with initiation of phenobarbital. No indication for repeat imaging or
   testing otherwise, will continue to monitor for improvement pending
   dose adjustments as above.  [**Month (only) 11**] be hard to strike balance that would
   avoid sedation yet effectively suppress seizures.
   - check phenobarbital level as above and d/w neuro re: dosing
  Ventilatory support. Intubated electively for phenobarb initiation
   without underlying acitve pulm issues.  Continued AC for now as pt
   tolerating well off propofol for 12 hours.  Previous metabolic
   alkalosis attributed to bicarb gtt which has been discontinued. Off all
   sedation currently.  Ability to wean limited by apnea and dependent on
   issues discussed above.
   - repeat abg, attempt pressure support
   Fevers. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] on VANCO/CEFEPIME for febrile neutropenia
   on initial admission; both were discontinued shortly after arrival to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  Pt spiked on [**5-6**] to 103.0. Time course does not fit with VAP
   but could be related to multiple lines. Of note, pt did initially p/w
   fevers prior to lymphoma diagnosis (B symptoms)
   -Continue Acyclovir and f/u CSF viral cultures
   - hold off on Abx unless we identify source or decompensates in which
   case we would resume previous broad covg
   - f/u BCX and UCX
  T Cell Lymphoma: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**] is her neuro-oncologist.
   - Received CHOP, MTX, IT cytarabine; continuing dexamethasone,
   initiating PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) 6129**] are labile, will follow CBC and ANC.
   - Per BMT, alkalinzation no longer necessary, leukovorin to be
   continued as small left pleural effusion can act as depot
   # Gram + cocci in UCx: Per report c/w staph. UA done at same time was
   clean. Likely represents contaminant (epi) vs colonizer
   (saprophyticus). Will repeat UA/UCX and ask for further speciation.
   Hypertension:
   - On metoprolol currently, adequately  controlled
   - Following for now,  PRN hydralazine as needed
   # Hct drop: recheck in PM. [**Month (only) 11**] be product of decreased cell counts from
   lymphoma Tx as WBC dropping as well
   - Transfuse for Hct< 21
   # Thrombocytopneia: Need to mnitor as 50% decline over one week. No
   need to d/c heparin at this point. [**Month (only) 11**] also be realated to famotidine
   and MTX. Now trending up slightly
   - continue to follow

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement, admitted to the ICU for elective intubation and initiation of phenobarbital. She has been experiencing recurrent status epilepticus despite being on multiple antiseizure medications. The patient's condition remains unchanged, with ongoing somnolence and seizure activity. The primary concern is to effectively suppress the seizures while avoiding excessive sedation. The patient is currently intubated and receiving ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial to ensure adequate respiratory support.
2. Status Epilepticus: The patient continues to experience recurrent seizures, indicating ongoing status epilepticus. Frequent monitoring of seizure activity and adjusting antiseizure medication doses based on therapeutic levels is essential.
3. Sedation/Unresponsiveness: The patient is off propofol and only intermittently withdrawing to pain, which may be due to sedating medications. Regular evaluation of the level of sedation and pain response is necessary to optimize sedation management.
4. Fevers: The patient has had intermittent fevers, and previous broad-spectrum antibiotics have been discontinued. Close monitoring of temperature trends and considering the source of infection or contamination is important.
5. T Cell Lymphoma: The patient's underlying T-cell lymphoma needs to be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She was initially admitted with febrile neutropenia and later transferred to the ICU for induction of phenobarb coma, intubation for airway control, and ongoing management of respiratory failure and status epilepticus. The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin and is currently on multiple medications including acyclovir, famotidine, heparin sodium, fosphenytoin, and others. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she remains minimally responsive and is overbreathing on the ventilator. The patient's laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and low platelet count, with normal kidney and liver function tests. Imaging reveals lobar atelectasis and small effusion. Microbiology tests are pending for urine culture. The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, acute seizure with status epilepticus, mild thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and ongoing management of her underlying lymphoma. The patient has a DNR code status and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised due to the need for airway control and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if the ventilator settings are not optimized or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration.

2. Status Epilepticus: The patient has recurrent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement, initially admitted with febrile neutropenia. She was transferred to the ICU for induction of phenobarb coma and intubation for airway control. The patient had a breakthrough seizure on EEG and remains minimally responsive off propofol, likely due to ongoing effects of phenobarbital and possible post-ictal component.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently overbreathing on the ventilator, which could lead to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Status Epilepticus: The patient has had recurrent seizures, indicating ongoing seizure activity. This can increase the risk of further brain injury, metabolic disturbances, and potential complications like superinfection or aspiration pneumonia.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has mild thrombocytopenia, which may be related to chemotherapy (mtx). This can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension that needs to be managed with antihypertensive medication.
5. Lymphoma: The patient's underlying lymphoma requires ongoing management and treatment.
6. Infection: The patient has fevers and an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible infection. Further investigation and appropriate antimicrobial therapy may be necessary.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   75 y/o F with T Cell Lymphoma with CNS involvement with non-convulsive
   recurrent status [**Hospital 6033**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for elective
   intubation for initiation of phenobarbital. Pt  continues to be
   somnolent off propofol, but is still seizing through dilantin,
   phenobarb, and keppra.  Dose adjustments are being made.
   Status Epilepticus: cause likely related to TCL in CNS. Elective
   intubation for phenobarb initiation.  Loading complete and currently
   dosing phenobarb per level .  Seizure activity initially suppressed
   after load with one transient repeat episode lasting 15 min on
   afternoon of [**5-6**], but then had several episodes on afternoon of [**5-7**].
   Failure to wake not likely related to status epilepticus, more likely
   related to sedating effects of meds.
   - holding phenobarbital and check level; f/u w/ neuro re: dose
   - increase dilantin dose to 130 tid , will continue to follow daily
   levels of dilantin and free dilantin; adjust accordingly
   - Levetiracetam 2000mg [**Hospital1 **] with level check on AM of [**5-10**]
   - Neurology to continue following. Continue continuous EEG monitoring
   - F/u CSF viral culture
   # Sedation/ Unresponsiveness: Pt has been off propofol for 12 hours and
   only intermittently withdrawing to pain. As per neurology, not expected
   with initiation of phenobarbital. Will continue to monitor for
   improvement pending dose adjustments as above.  [**Month (only) 11**] be hard to strike
   balance that would avoid sedation yet effectively suppress seizures.
   - D/w Neuro re: need for repeat imaging.
   - check phenobarb/dilantin/keppra levels as above and d/w neuro re:
   dosing
  Ventilatory support. Intubated electively for phenobarb initiation
   without underlying acitve pulm issues.  Continued AC for now as pt
   tolerating well off propofol.  Ability to wean limited by low resp rate
   on PSV and dependent on mental status as discussed above.
   -          repeat abg, continue to attempt pressure support
   Fevers. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] on VANCO/CEFEPIME for febrile neutropenia
   on initial admission; both were discontinued shortly after arrival to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  Pt spiked on [**5-6**] to 103.0. Time course does not fit with VAP
   but could be related to multiple lines. Of note, pt did initially p/w
   fevers prior to lymphoma diagnosis (B symptoms)
   -Continue Acyclovir and f/u CSF viral cultures
   - hold off on Abx unless we identify source or decompensates in which
   case we would resume previous broad covg
   - f/u BCX and UCX
  T Cell Lymphoma: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**] is her neuro-oncologist.
   - Received CHOP, MTX, IT cytarabine; continuing dexamethasone, on PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) 6129**] are labile, will follow CBC and ANC.
   - Per BMT, alkalinzation no longer necessary, d/w leukovorin still
   needed
   # Gram + cocci in UCx: Per report c/w staph. UA done at same time was
   clean. Repeat UA clean.
   - f/u repeat Cx
   Hypertension:
   - On metoprolol currently, adequately  controlled majority of time
   - Following for now,  PRN hydralazine as needed
   # Hct drop: 27.4
24.7, recheck in PM. No hx of bleeding. Likely
   multifactorial in this pt with lymphoma.
   - Transfuse for Hct< 21
   # Thrombocytopneia: Need to monitor as 50% decline over one week. No
   need to d/c heparin at this point. [**Month (only) 11**] also be realated to famotidine
   and MTX.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement, admitted for elective intubation to initiate phenobarbital due to recurrent status epilepticus. She continues to have seizures despite being on phenobarbital, dilantin, and keppra. The patient's sedation level is still high, and she is not responsive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on ventilatory support and has been intubated electively for phenobarbital initiation. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be closely monitored.
2. Status Epilepticus: The patient has recurrent seizures, which could lead to further complications if not effectively managed.
3. Infection: The patient has had fevers and is at risk for infections, particularly due to her immunocompromised state from chemotherapy.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a risk for bleeding complications.
5. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels, including potassium and magnesium, which need to be monitored and managed.
6. Hypertension: The patient has controlled hypertension but requires ongoing monitoring.
7. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit level has dropped, indicating a potential need for blood transfusion.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status should be assessed and addressed to support recovery.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and seizure activity. The patient has been receiving various medications including phenobarbital, dilantin, keppra, heparin sodium, fosphenytoin, and others. The patient's allergies include amoxicillin, and the last dose of antibiotics was acyclovir on 05/09/2144 at 12:10 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 80 bpm (normal range: 65-90 bpm), blood pressure of 144/64 mmHg (normal range: 105/49-182/83 mmHg), respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute (normal range: 10-18 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 2,240 mL total in (711 mL PO, 970 mL TF, 1,270 mL IVF), with a total output of 3,090 mL (820 mL blood products, 820 mL urine). The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set Vt of 400 mL, PS of 15 cmH2O, RR set at 10, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, RSBI of 80, PIP of 23 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.28, PaCO2 of 28 mmHg, PaO2 of 106 mmHg, HCO3 of 24.7 mEq/L, and BE of -8.2 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, PERRL, symmetric chest expansion, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and sedated with no neurological assessment performed. 

The patient's lab results include a white blood cell count ranging from 4.6-6.9 K/uL, hemoglobin ranging from 24.6-27.7 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 156-166 K/uL, creatinine ranging from 0.8-0.9 mg/dL, total CO2 ranging from 32-39 mEq/L, glucose ranging from 78-139 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. 

Imaging and microbiology results are pending. The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and status epilepticus. The patient is receiving ICU care including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement, admitted initially with febrile neutropenia. She has been in nonconvulsive status epilepticus and was transferred to the ICU for induction of phenobarb coma, intubated for airway control. The patient continues to have breakthrough seizures and remains minimally responsive off propofol, likely due to ongoing effects of phenobarbital and possible post-ictal component.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Status epilepticus: The neuro input regarding antiepileptic regimen is being followed, and the patient's phenobarb levels are being monitored. Dil and keppra levels have been increased, and continuous EEG monitoring is ongoing. Consideration is being given to remaining with MRI.
2. Respiratory support: The patient is on intermittent overbreathing with ventilator support for airway protection during phenobarb load. Extubation is limited by hypoventilation due to ongoing minimal responsiveness. Retrying spontaneous breathing trial/pressure support.
3. Lymphoma: Treatment remains as per bone marrow transplant protocol, including dexa, acyclovir, and pcp. Discussion is ongoing regarding discontinuation of leucovorin due to low methotrexate level.
4. Fever: Resolved, with follow-up pending cultures.
5. Mild thrombocytopenia: Stable, likely methotrexate-related, continue to monitor.

 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   75 y.o. with T-cell lymphoma with CNS involvement, admitted initially
   with febrile neutropenia, course c/b nonconvulsant status [**Hospital 6033**]
   transferred to ICU for induction of phenobarb coma, intubated for
   airway control. Continued to have breakthrough sz as of 2 days ago.
   She is overbreathing on vent but remains minimally responsive off
   propfol, hypoventialting on PS trial, likely from ongoing effects of
   phenobarbital as well as possible post-ictal component.
   # Status epilepticus
Neuro input regarding antiepileptic regimen.  We
   continue to follow her phenobarb levels and have increased dil and
   keppra given breakthrough sz activity, following levels. She remains on
   continuous eeg monitoring. Would  consider repeat CNS imaging given
   slow recovery.
   # Respiratory support
for airway protection in setting of phenobarb
   load.  She is now intermittently overbreathing vent but ability to
   extubate is limited by hypoventilation. Will check abg as she had a sig
   metabolic alkalosis from prior bicrab gtt which could contribute.
   Retry SBT/PS trials.
   # Lymphoma
as per bmt. Remains on dexa, acyclovir and pcp [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement, admitted with febrile neutropenia.
- She was initially treated with induction of phenobarb coma and intubated for airway control.
- The patient continues to have breakthrough seizures despite treatment, and her condition remains critical.
- She is overbreathing on the ventilator but remains minimally responsive off propofol, likely due to ongoing effects of phenobarbital and possible post-ictal component.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/70 to 182/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin, nausea/vomiting, and previous antibiotic use.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,240 mL and output of 3,090 mL, with a negative balance of -850 mL.
- Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation with assist, auto-flow, set tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 80, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 25 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O.
- Physical examination reveals the patient to be intubated, minimally responsive with spontaneous movement, PERRLA (pupils equal, react to light and accommodation), CTA (constriction to accommodation), RR (respiratory rate) normal, and trace edema with warm extremities.
- Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 4.6 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 140 K/uL, and elevated creatinine levels at 0.9 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.
- Imaging reveals a chest X-ray showing small effusion on the right side with minimal blunting of the costophrenic angle, and left lower lobe atelectasis.
- Microbiology results indicate a small amount of Staphylococcus in the urine culture, while the repeat urine analysis is clean and the blood culture is negative.
- The patient's condition is assessed as respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and seizure with status epilepticus.
- The plan includes continuing neurologic input regarding antiepileptic regimen, respiratory support for airway protection, and ongoing monitoring.
- The patient remains on dexa, acyclovir, and pcp, and discussions are ongoing regarding d/c leucovorin given low methotrexate level. Mild thrombocytopenia is stable and likely methotrexate-related.
- The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with Lopressor and prn hydralazine.
- ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylactic measures such as DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and V"

   75 y/o F with T Cell Lymphoma with CNS involvement with non-convulsive
   recurrent status [**Hospital 6033**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for elective
   intubation for initiation of phenobarbital. Pt  continues to be
   somnolent off propofol, with evidence of continued seizing through
   dilantin, phenobarb, and keppra.
   Status Epilepticus: The patient is in non-convulsive status due to
   TCL. Seizure activity initially suppressed after load with one
   transient repeat episode lasting 15 min on afternoon of [**5-6**], but then
   had several episodes on afternoon of [**5-7**].  Failure to wake not likely
   related to status epilepticus, more likely related to sedating effects
   of meds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T Cell Lymphoma and CNS involvement, who was transferred to the ICU for elective intubation and initiation of phenobarbital. She continues to be somnolent off propofol and has evidence of continued seizing despite being on dilantin, phenobarbital, and keppra. The patient's main concerns include status epilepticus, sedation/unresponsiveness, fevers, and T Cell Lymphoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Status Epilepticus: The patient has recurrent seizures despite being on multiple antiepileptic drugs. Continuous EEG monitoring and adjustment of medication dosages may be necessary to control seizure activity.
2. Sedation/Unresponsiveness: The patient remains somnolent and only intermittently withdraws to pain. This could be due to the sedating effects of medications or underlying brain injury. Monitoring for improvement and adjusting medication doses as per neurology recommendations is crucial.
3. Fevers: The patient has had multiple episodes of fevers, which could be due to infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infection, or other causes. Acyclovir has been started, and further evaluation is needed to identify the source of infection.
4. T Cell Lymphoma: The patient has a history of T Cell Lymphoma with CNS involvement. Chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy will be ongoing, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/o F with T Cell Lymphoma with CNS involvement with non-convulsive
   recurrent status [**Hospital 6033**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for elective
   intubation for initiation of phenobarbital. Pt  continues to be
   somnolent off propofol, with evidence of continued seizing through
   dilantin, phenobarb, and keppra.
   Status Epilepticus: The patient is in non-convulsive status due to
   TCL. Seizure activity initially suppressed after load with one
   transient repeat episode lasting 15 min on afternoon of [**5-6**], but then
   had several episodes on afternoon of [**5-7**].  Failure to wake not likely
   related to status epilepticus, more likely related to sedating effects
   of meds.
   - holding phenobarbital and check level; f/u w/ neuro re: dose
   - Continue dilantin dose to 130 tid , will continue to follow daily
   levels of dilantin and free dilantin; adjust accordingly
   - Levetiracetam 2000mg [**Hospital1 **] with level check on AM of [**5-10**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She was transferred to the ICU for elective intubation to initiate phenobarbital due to recurrent seizures. The patient remains somnolent off propofol and continues to have seizure activity despite being on dilantin, phenobarbital, and keppra.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Status Epilepticus: The patient is experiencing recurrent seizures, indicating ongoing status epilepticus due to T-cell lymphoma. This condition requires continuous EEG monitoring and adjustment of antiepileptic medications.
2. Sedation/Unresponsiveness: The patient has been off propofol for 36 hours and only intermittently responds to pain. It is necessary to monitor for improvement and consider dose adjustments of sedating medications.
3. Fevers: The patient has had fevers on multiple occasions, which could be related to febrile neutropenia, line infections, or underlying infection. Acyclovir and broad-spectrum antibiotics may be needed based on the clinical scenario.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated and requires close monitoring. Adjustments to antihypertensive medication may be required.
5. T-cell Lymphoma: The patient has a history of T-cell lymphoma, which may contribute to her neurological symptoms and requires further management by the neuro-oncologist.

- She remains somnolent off propofol and continues to be controlled on phenobarbital, Keppra, and fosphenytoin.
- Her seizures are not related to status epilepticus but are more likely due to the sedating effects of medications.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement, admitted initially with febrile neutropenia. They were transferred to the ICU for induction of phenobarb coma and intubated for airway control. The patient has been minimally responsive off propofol, hypoventilating and apneic on PS trials likely from ongoing effects of phenobarbital. 

The patient continues to be monitored with continuous EEG monitoring, with no new evidence of breakthrough seizures. Phenobarb levels are slowly decreasing, and the patient has been given Dilantin and Keppra for breakthrough seizure activity. 

The patient remains on respiratory support for airway protection due to phenobarb load. They are intermittently overbreathing on the ventilator, but extubation is limited by hypoventilation and apnea. Repeat SBT/PS trials are planned.

The patient also has hyponatremia, which requires limiting free water and checking osmolality. 

Lymphoma management remains as per bmt protocols, including ongoing use of dexa, acyclovir, and pcp. Leucovorin may be discontinued given low methotrexate level. 

The patient's hypertension is being managed with Lopressor and prn hydralazine.

Other ICU care includes nutrition via Nutren Pulmonary at 40 mL/hour, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement, admitted initially with febrile neutropenia. She was transferred to the ICU for induction of phenobarb coma and intubation for airway control. The patient has been on continuous EEG monitoring and remains on continuous antiepileptic treatment. She is still hypoventilating and apneic on a pressure support trial, likely due to ongoing effects of phenobarbital.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is indicated by hypoventilation and apnea on pressure support trial. This is likely a result of the ongoing effects of phenobarbital.
2. Status Epilepticus: The patient has been diagnosed with status epilepticus, a condition characterized by continuous seizure activity. She has been receiving continuous EEG monitoring and antiepileptic treatment.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is indicated by low sodium levels in the blood. It is important to limit free water intake and check osmolarity.
4. Lymphoma: The patient's underlying T-cell lymphoma requires ongoing treatment as per the bone marrow transplant protocol.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, for which she is receiving Lopressor medication. Prn hydralazine may be considered.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement.
- She was transferred to the ICU for elective intubation and initiation of phenobarbital due to recurrent non-convulsive status epilepticus.
- The patient is currently not in status epilepticus and is being controlled on phenobarbital, Keppra, and fosphenytoin.
- She remains somnolent but is expected to wake up soon, as the sedation is likely due to the medications.
- The plan is to hold phenobarbital and check the level, continue monitoring with continuous EEG, follow up with neurology, and adjust doses accordingly.
- The patient's sedation and unresponsiveness will be closely monitored, and repeat imaging may be needed.
- Ventilatory support is provided through intubation, which was done electively for phenobarbital initiation without any underlying pulmonary issues.
- The patient is tolerating well off propofol, but weaning ability is limited by hypopnea on PSV and dependent on mental status improvements.
- The patient has a history of T-cell lymphoma and has received CHOP, MTX, IT cytarabine. She is continuing dexamethasone and will follow up with her neuro-oncologist.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. They were admitted initially with febrile neutropenia and later transferred to the ICU for induction of phenobarb coma, intubation for airway control, and management of status epilepticus.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient is overbreathing on the ventilator and tolerating pressure support (PS) but remains minimally responsive off propofol, hypoventilating, and apneic on PS trials likely from ongoing effects of phenobarbital.
2. Seizure, with Status Epilepticus: The patient's phenobarb levels are slowly decreasing, and further dosing is being held. They are on continuous EEG monitoring with no new evidence of breakthrough seizures. Repeat CNS imaging would be considered if any sign of clinical deterioration occurs.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, and rechecking ABG and administering bicarbonate gtt would be necessary. Checking central venous pressure (CVP) is also recommended.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, and urine osmolarity and sodium levels should be checked. Limiting free water intake is advised.
5. Eosinophilia: The patient's eosinophilia should be followed up.

 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   75 y.o. with T-cell lymphoma with CNS involvement, admitted initially
   with febrile neutropenia, course c/b nonconvulsant status [**Hospital 6033**]
   transferred to ICU for induction of phenobarb coma, intubated for
   airway control. Her ICU course has been complicated by recurrent sz
   activity
though now without evidence of recurrent sz for > 2 days and
   minimal responsiveness off propofol with hypoventilation and apnea on
   PS trials likely from ongoing effects of phenobarbital.
   # Status epilepticus
We continue to follow her phenobarb levels which
   are slowly decreasing holding further dosing.  She remains on keppra
   and dilantin, following levels. She remains on continuous eeg
   monitoring with no new evidence of breakthrough sz. Would consider
   repeat CNS imaging if any sign of clinical deterioration or worsening
   in neuron exam.  She remains minimally responsive though the
   respiratory depressive effects of phenobarb seem to be resolving at the
   current level.
   # Respiratory support
for airway protection in setting of phenobarb
   load.  She is no longer apneic or hypoventilating on PS.  Will continue
   PSW and move to SBT.  Would clarify neurology plan regarding phenobarb
   dosing and reintubation code status prior to considering extubation
   given that she has poorly tolerated therapeutic levels of phenobarb
   thus far.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She was transferred to the ICU for elective intubation and initiation of phenobarbital. The patient continues to be somnolent and only intermittently withdrawing to pain. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on ventilatory support due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the patient does not improve or if there are any complications related to the mechanical ventilation.

2. Seizures/Status Epilepticus: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently on multiple antiepileptic medications (keppra, fosphenytoin, and phenobarbital). There is a risk of breakthrough seizures if the medication levels are not within the therapeutic range or if the underlying cause of the seizures is not adequately managed.

3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension that is currently being managed with metoprolol and PRN hydralazine. There is a risk of uncontrolled hypertension leading to end-organ damage if the blood pressure is not adequately controlled.

4. Infection: The patient is receiving acyclovir, which suggests a concern for viral infection. There is a risk of developing further infections while in the ICU, especially given the immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy and underlying lymphoma.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She was transferred to the ICU for elective intubation and initiation of phenobarbital due to recurrent non-convulsive status epilepticus. The patient is currently not in status epilepticus and is being controlled on phenobarbital, Keppra, and fosphenytoin. She remains somnolent and sedated, likely due to the medications rather than ongoing status epilepticus. 

The patient has a history of T cell lymphoma and has received chemotherapy including CHOP, MTX, and IT cytarabine. She is currently on dexamethasone and PCP. Her lab results show an elevated WBC count, slightly low Hct, and normal platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal range. 

She is on ventilatory support through intubation and is tolerating it well off propofol. She is expected to transition to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and may be able to be extubated soon. 

The patient has hypertension, which is controlled with metoprolol, and her blood pressure is being monitored closely. She is also receiving prophylactic heparin for DVT and a stress ulcer medication. 

Her nutritional status is being managed with tube feedings, and she is being monitored for glycemic control. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order in place."

   # Sedation/ Unresponsiveness:  Current mental status is likely
   secondary to persistent phenobarbital.  She has been improving daily in
   that she is now responsive to pain.  She has been off propofol for
   days.
   - continue to check daily phenobarbital levels
   - would discuss with neuro further imaging or other work-up if she does
   not become more responsive as phenobarb levels decrease
   - discuss with neuro if we will be able to avoid phenobarbial in the
   future
   .
   Seizures/Status Epilepticus: No longer seizing, on keppra and
   fosphenytoin.  Phenobarbital levels are also still within therapeutic
   range.
   - continue to hold phenobarbital and check levels
   -  would prefer to avoid phenobarbital in the future given prolonged
   sedation, as above
   - continue dilantin dose to 130 tid , will continue to follow daily
   levels of dilantin and free dilantin; adjust accordingly in

   intubation for initiation of phenobarbital,  now persistnetly requiring
   mechanical ventilation because of ongoing sedation, likely because of
   phenobarbital.
   # Sedation/ Unresponsiveness:  Current mental status is likely
   secondary to persistent phenobarbital.  She has been improving daily in
   that she is now responsive to pain.  She has been off propofol for
   days.
   - continue to check daily phenobarbital levels
   - would discuss with neuro further imaging or other work-up if she does
   not become more responsive as phenobarb levels decrease
   - discuss with neuro if we will be able to avoid phenobarbial in the
   future
   .
   Seizures/Status Epilepticus: No longer seizing, on keppra and
   fosphenytoin.  Phenobarbital levels are also still within therapeutic
   range.
   - continue to hold phenobarbital and check levels
   -  would prefer to avoid phenobarbital in the future given prolonged
   sedation, as above
   - continue dilantin dose to 130 tid , will continue to follow daily
   levels of dilantin and free dilantin; adjust accordingly in
   consultation with neurology
   - continue levetiracetam 2000mg to PO bid
   - Neurology to continue following
   - continuous EEG monitorring for now; discuss course with neuro
   .
  Ventilatory support.:  Intubated electively for phenobarb initiation
   without underlying acitve pulmonary issues.  Currently able to tolerate
   PSV with a good ventilatory drive (new over the psat 24 hours).   The
   only barrier to extubation currently is her  mental status.  Hopefully

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She was admitted to the ICU for elective intubation and initiation of phenobarbital due to recurrent non-convulsive status epilepticus. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been improving daily, now responsive to pain. Her mental status is likely secondary to persistent phenobarbital, and daily phenobarbital levels will be checked. 

The patient is also on keppra and fosphenytoin for seizures/status epilepticus. Phenobarbital levels are within therapeutic range, and it is planned to avoid phenobarbital in the future due to prolonged sedation. Dilantin dose will be adjusted in consultation with neurology, and levetiracetam will continue at 2000mg PO bid. Continuous EEG monitoring will be continued for now.

The patient was intubated electively for phenobarbital initiation without underlying active pulmonary issues. She is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a good ventilatory drive. The only barrier to extubation at the moment is her mental status. 

The patient has a history of T-cell lymphoma and has received CHOP, MTX, and IT cytarabine. Leukovorin was stopped yesterday, and dexamethasone will continue. Acyclovir will be continued for prophylactic purposes. Hypertension is well controlled on metop"

The patient is a 75-year-old female with T cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She was admitted to the ICU for elective intubation due to recurrent non-convulsive status epilepticus. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been improving daily, responding to pain and off propofol for days. Her phenobarbital levels are within therapeutic range, but there is ongoing sedation. The plan is to continue checking phenobarbital levels, discuss further imaging or work-up if she does not become more responsive, and potentially avoid phenobarbital in the future. She is also on keppra, fosphenytoin, and levetiracetam. Her respiratory support includes intubation for phenobarbital initiation without any active pulmonary issues. She can tolerate pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a good ventilatory drive. The only barrier to extubation is her mental status. The patient has a history of T cell lymphoma, receiving CHOP, MTX, and IT cytarabine. She is continuing dexamethasone and on PCP. Acyclovir is being continued for PPX. She has well-controlled hypertension on metoprolol. Nutrition is via tube feeds, and glycemic control is being monitored. She has multi-lumen lines for ICU care, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and VAP precautions. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of lymphoma, hypertension, and respiratory failure. He is currently admitted to the ICU for seizure with status epilepticus. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 133/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and RSBI of 142. Physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral vascular status, skin, and neurologic function due to sedation. Laboratory results show normal WBC count, Hct, and Plt levels, with slightly elevated Cr and TCO2 levels. Imaging reveals no changes in the lines or lungs from previous CXR. The patient's microbiology results are negative, except for a viral culture pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Seizure with Status Epilepticus: The patient has a history of seizure and is currently in status epilepticus. There is a risk of recurrent seizures and potential complications associated with prolonged seizure activity.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and it needs to be closely monitored and managed during the ICU stay.
4. Lymphoma (Cancer): The patient has a known diagnosis of lymphoma. There is a risk of disease progression or complications related to cancer treatment during the ICU stay.
5. Infection: Despite negative blood cultures, there is still a risk of developing nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) due to the invasive nature of ICU interventions.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   75 y/o F with T Cell Lymphoma with CNS involvement with non-convulsive
   recurrent status [**Hospital 6033**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for elective
   intubation for initiation of phenobarbital,  now persistnetly requiring
   mechanical ventilation because of ongoing sedation, likely because of
   phenobarbital.
   # Sedation/ Unresponsiveness:  Current mental status is likely
   secondary to persistent phenobarbital.  She has been improving daily in
   that she is now responsive to pain.  She has been off propofol for
   days.
   - continue to check daily phenobarbital levels
   - would discuss with neuro further imaging or other work-up if she does
   not become more responsive as phenobarb levels decrease
   - discuss with neuro if we will be able to avoid phenobarbial in the
   future
   .
   Seizures/Status Epilepticus: No longer seizing, on keppra and
   fosphenytoin.  Phenobarbital levels are also still within therapeutic
   range.
   - continue to hold phenobarbital and check levels
   -  would prefer to avoid phenobarbital in the future given prolonged
   sedation, as above
   - continue dilantin dose to 130 tid , will continue to follow daily
   levels of dilantin and free dilantin; adjust accordingly in
   consultation with neurology
   - continue levetiracetam 2000mg to PO bid
   - Neurology to continue following
   - continuous EEG monitorring for now; discuss course with neuro
   .
  Ventilatory support.:  Intubated electively for phenobarb initiation
   without underlying acitve pulmonary issues.  Currently able to tolerate
   PSV with a good ventilatory drive (new over the psat 24 hours).   The
   only barrier to extubation currently is her  mental status.  Hopefully
   we will be able to move toward this in the upcoming days.
   - discuss with family her current status
  T Cell Lymphoma: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**] is her neuro-oncologist.

She was admitted to the ICU for elective intubation to initiate phenobarbital, but now requires mechanical ventilation due to ongoing sedation. The sedation is likely secondary to persistent phenobarbital use. The patient has shown improvement daily, as she is now responsive to pain and has been off propofol for several days.

The patient's seizures and status epilepticus have been managed with keppra and fosphenytoin. Phenobarbital levels are within therapeutic range. It is planned to continue monitoring phenobarbital levels, avoid phenobarbital in the future if possible, and adjust dilantin doses accordingly.

The patient is currently intubated electively for phenobarbital initiation without any underlying active pulmonary issues. She is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well and has a good ventilatory drive. The main barrier to extubation at this time is her mental status. 

The patient has a history of T-cell lymphoma and has received treatments such as CHOP, MTX, IT cytarabine, and dexamethasone. She is also on acyclovir for prophylactic purposes. Her hypertension is well-controlled on metoprolol.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving a pulmonary nutrition support and has good glycemic control. She has multiple lumen lines for medication administration. Pro"

   intubation for initiation of phenobarbital,  now persistently requiring
   mechanical ventilation because of ongoing sedation, likely because of
   phenobarbital.
   # Sedation/ Unresponsiveness:  Current mental status is likely
   secondary to persistent phenobarbital.  This has trended down from a
   peak of 35 but has persisted in the low 20s for days.  Although
   portions of her neurologic exam (ability to open eyes, gag) are
   improved, others (withdrawal to pain) are worse and thus it is
   difficult to say whether there has been any meaningful improvement at
   this point.  Neuro has said that there is no role for rpt imaging.
   - continue to check daily phenobarbital levels
   - would discuss with neuro further imaging or other work-up if she does
   not become more responsive as phenobarb levels decrease
   .
   Seizures/Status Epilepticus: No longer seizing, on keppra and
   fosphenytoin.  Phenobarbital levels are trending down.
   - continue to hold phenobarbital and check levels
   -  would prefer to avoid phenobarbital in the future given prolonged
   sedation, as above
   - continue dilantin dose to 130 tid , will continue to follow daily
   levels of dilantin and free dilantin; adjust accordingly in
   consultation with neurology
   - continue levetiracetam 2000mg to PO bid
   - Neurology to continue following
   - continuous EEG monitorring off as has not seized x 72 hrs

  Ventilatory support.:  Intubated electively for phenobarb initiation
   without underlying acitve pulmonary issues.  Currently on PSV 14/5 and
   tachypneic with small tidal volumes; will increase PSV to 18 in hope of
   decreaseing RR and increasing TV.   The only barrier to extubation
   currently is her  mental status.  Hopefully we will be able to move
   toward this in the upcoming days.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement. She was admitted to the ICU for elective intubation and initiation of phenobarbital. However, she has been persistently requiring mechanical ventilation due to ongoing sedation from phenobarbital. The patient's mental status is likely secondary to persistent phenobarbital, with sedation levels trending down but still in the low 20s for days. Some improvements have been observed in portions of her neurological exam, but others have worsened. Neurology has stated that there is no role for repeat imaging. The patient is on multiple antiepileptic medications and is no longer seizing. She is intubated electively for phenobarbital initiation without underlying active pulmonary issues. The only barrier to extubation currently is her mental status. The patient has a history of hypertension, which is well-controlled on metoprolol, and is also being treated for T-cell lymphoma, hypertension, and suspected pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged sedation and unresponsiveness due to high levels of phenobarbital.
2. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Potential seizures due to CNS involvement of T-cell lymphoma and ongoing antiepileptic medication management.
4. Complications related to T-cell lymphoma, such as disease progression or treatment-related side effects.
5. Hypertension management"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and central nervous system involvement.
- She was transferred to the ICU for elective intubation and initiation of phenobarbital.
- The patient now requires mechanical ventilation due to ongoing sedation, likely caused by phenobarbital.
- Her mental status is sedated, and there has been no meaningful improvement in her neurological exam.
- She has been on keppra and fosphenytoin for seizures, and her phenobarbital levels are trending down.
- The plan is to continue monitoring phenobarbital levels, avoid using phenobarbital in the future, and adjust dilantin dose accordingly.
- The patient is currently on PSV 14/5 and tachypneic with small tidal volumes; it is hoped that increasing PSV to 18 will decrease RR and increase TV.
- The main barrier to extubation is her mental status.
- She has leukocytosis and low-grade fever, so empiric vancomycin and zosyn were started. There is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Daily chest X-ray, trend fever/WBC, and follow-up cultures should be done. If no yield on sputum, a mini-BAL may be performed.
- Review medications for the source of eosinophilia, especially considering"

   75 y/o F with T Cell Lymphoma with CNS involvement with non-convulsive
   recurrent status [**Hospital 6033**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for elective
   intubation for initiation of phenobarbital,  now persistently requiring
   mechanical ventilation because of ongoing sedation, likely because of
   phenobarbital.
   # Sedation/ Unresponsiveness:  Current mental status is likely
   secondary to persistent phenobarbital.  This has trended down from a
   peak of 35 but has persisted in the low 20s for days.  Although
   portions of her neurologic exam (ability to open eyes, gag) are
   improved, others (withdrawal to pain) are worse and thus it is
   difficult to say whether there has been any meaningful improvement at
   this point.  Neuro has said that there is no role for rpt imaging.
   - continue to check daily phenobarbital levels
   - would discuss with neuro further imaging or other work-up if she does
   not become more responsive as phenobarb levels decrease
   .
   Seizures/Status Epilepticus: No longer seizing, on keppra and
   fosphenytoin.  Phenobarbital levels are trending down.
   - continue to hold phenobarbital and check levels
   -  would prefer to avoid phenobarbital in the future given prolonged
   sedation, as above
   - continue dilantin dose to 130 tid , will continue to follow daily
   levels of dilantin and free dilantin; adjust accordingly in
   consultation with neurology
   - continue levetiracetam 2000mg to PO bid
   - Neurology to continue following
   - continuous EEG monitorring off as has not seized x 72 hrs

  Ventilatory support.:  Intubated electively for phenobarb initiation
   without underlying acitve pulmonary issues.  Currently on PSV 14/5 and
   tachypneic with small tidal volumes; will increase PSV to 18 in hope of
   decreaseing RR and increasing TV.   The only barrier to extubation
   currently is her  mental status.  Hopefully we will be able to move

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T Cell Lymphoma and CNS involvement. She was transferred to the ICU for elective intubation due to recurrent status epilepticus. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires sedation. Her mental status has been unresponsive, likely secondary to persistent phenobarbital use. The patient has shown no improvement in her neurological exam. Seizures are under control with keppra and fosphenytoin. Ventilatory support is required due to tachypnea and small tidal volumes, with plans to increase PSV to 18 to decrease RR and increase TV. The patient's only barrier to extubation is her mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilatory failure: The patient's tachypnea and small tidal volumes indicate potential ventilatory failure if PSV is not adjusted appropriately.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU. Prophylactic SQH (subcutaneous heparin) is being administered.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness. Prophylactic H2B (histamine-2 blocker) is being administered.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to endotracheal intubation. Measures should be taken to prevent VAP,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of nausea/vomiting. The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin, hypertension, benign lymphoma (cancer), respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and seizures with status epilepticus. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires propofol for an MRI. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/52 to 185/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 129. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 158 mg/dL. The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 218 K/uL and slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL. The patient's imaging shows no abnormalities on the chest X-ray and MRI. The patient's microbiology results are negative for both blood cultures. The patient's assessment and plan include hypertension, benign lymphoma, acute respiratory failure, and seizures with status epilepticus. The patient"

 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   75 y/o F with T Cell Lymphoma with CNS involvement with non-convulsive
   recurrent status [**Hospital 6033**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for elective
   intubation for initiation of phenobarbital,  now persistently requiring
   mechanical ventilation because of ongoing sedation, likely because of
   phenobarbital.
   # Sedation/ Unresponsiveness:  Current mental status is likely
   secondary to persistent phenobarbital.  This has trended down from a
   peak of 35 but has persisted in the low 20s for days.  Although
   portions of her neurologic exam (ability to open eyes, gag) are
   improved, others (withdrawal to pain) are worse and thus it is
   difficult to say whether there has been any meaningful improvement at
   this point.  Neuro has said that there is no role for rpt imaging.
   - continue to check daily phenobarbital levels
   - MRI from last night unchanged from prior on prelim read; f/u fianl
   report
   .
   Seizures/Status Epilepticus: No longer seizing, on keppra and
   fosphenytoin.  Phenobarbital levels are trending down.
   - continue to hold phenobarbital and check levels
   -  would prefer to avoid phenobarbital in the future given prolonged
   sedation, as above
   - continue dilantin dose to 130 tid , will continue to follow daily
   levels of dilantin and free dilantin; adjust accordingly in
   consultation with neurology
   - continue levetiracetam 2000mg to PO bid
   - Neurology to continue following
   - continuous EEG monitorring off as has not seized x 72 hrs
   .
  Ventilatory support.:  Intubated electively for phenobarb initiation
   without underlying acitve pulmonary issues.  Currently on PSV 14/5 and
   tachypneic with small tidal volumes; will increase PSV to 18 in hope of
   decreaseing RR and increasing TV.   The only barrier to extubation
   currently is her  mental status.  Hopefully we will be able to move
   toward this in the upcoming days.
   - discuss with family her current status DURING FAMILY MTG THIS PM
   .
   # Gram + cocci in blood:
   # Leukocytosis/ low-grade fever: Cx sputum, Blood, Urine. Start empiric
   Vanco/zosyn (d1= [**5-14**]). Concern for VAP
   - daily CXR
   - trend fever/WBC
   - F/U CULTURES; if no yield on sputum, will get mini-BAL
   - review meds for source of eosinophilia
especially unusual as she is
   on steroids.
   .
   # Anemia:  required blood previously [**4-30**] and [**4-26**] but Hct has been
   stable since
   - check hemolysis and DIC labs
   - guaiac stool
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  likely secondary to volume depletion
   - urine lytes
   - blood transfusion
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: likely not fluid depletion given falling/stable Cr.
   Has multiple etiologies in favor of SIADH.

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of T cell lymphoma and CNS involvement, who was transferred to the ICU for elective intubation and initiation of phenobarbital. She is currently persistently requiring mechanical ventilation due to ongoing sedation, likely because of phenobarbital. 

The patient's chief complaint is fever, and she has been experiencing low-grade fevers and leukocytosis. Blood cultures were drawn off the central line, sputum culture, and urine culture were obtained. She is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. 

The patient's sedation level has been trending down but remains in the low 20s. She has shown some improvement in her neurologic exam, such as the ability to open her eyes and gag, but her withdrawal to pain has worsened. 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on positive pressure ventilation mode with a set rate of 12 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 24 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. 

Her lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 20.7%, platelet count (Plt) of 92 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.3 mg/dL, glucose of 158 mg/dL, and sodium of 132 mEq/L. 

The patient has a history of seizures and is currently on levetiracetam and fosphenytoin. Her phenobarbital levels are trending down, and it is planned to continue monitoring them. 

She is also being monitored for anemia, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia. 

The patient's T cell lymphoma has been treated with CHOP, methotrexate, and intrathecal cytarabine. She is also receiving dexamethasone for her condition. 

The patient's blood cultures showed growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs and short chains. Her sputum culture showed more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) per high power field and 4+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. 

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and her disposition is to remain in the ICU."

   75 y/o F with T Cell Lymphoma with CNS involvement with non-convulsive
   recurrent status [**Hospital 6033**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for elective
   intubation for initiation of phenobarbital,  now persistently requiring
   mechanical ventilation because of ongoing sedation, likely because of
   phenobarbital.
   # Sedation/ Unresponsiveness:  Phenobarbital level has fallen to 16.9,
   and she seems to be waking up.
   Current mental status is likely secondary to persistent phenobarbital.
   This has trended down from a peak of 35 but has persisted in the low
   20s for days.  Although portions of her neurologic exam (ability to
   open eyes, gag) are improved, others (withdrawal to pain) are worse and
   thus it is difficult to say whether there has been any meaningful
   improvement at this point.  Neuro has said that there is no role for
   rpt imaging.
   - continue to check daily phenobarbital levels
   - MRI from last night unchanged from prior on prelim read; f/u fianl
   report
   .
   Seizures/Status Epilepticus: No longer seizing, on keppra and
   fosphenytoin.  Phenobarbital levels are trending down.
   - continue to hold phenobarbital and check levels
   -  would prefer to avoid phenobarbital in the future given prolonged
   sedation, as above
   - continue dilantin dose to 130 tid , will continue to follow daily
   levels of dilantin and free dilantin; adjust accordingly in
   consultation with neurology
   - continue levetiracetam 2000mg to PO bid
   - Neurology to continue following
   - continuous EEG monitorring off as has not seized x 72 hrs
   .
  Ventilatory support.:  Intubated electively for phenobarb initiation
   without underlying acitve pulmonary issues.  Currently on PSV 14/5 and
   tachypneic with small tidal volumes; will increase PSV to 18 in hope of
   decreaseing RR and increasing TV.   The only barrier to extubation
   currently is her  mental status.  Hopefully we will be able to move
   toward this in the upcoming days.
   - discuss with family her current status DURING FAMILY MTG THIS PM
   .
   # Gram + cocci in blood:   Accompanied by leukocytosis and fevers.
   Now in [**3-21**] bottles  Started vanc/zosyn yesterday out of concern for
   VAP.  Would be concerned for VRE as well
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  likely secondary to sepsis.
   - check DIC labs
   # Eosinophilia: not checked for days.
   - recheck
   .
   # Anemia:  required blood previously [**4-30**] and [**4-26**] but Hct has been
   stable since
   - check hemolysis and DIC labs
   - guaiac stool
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  likely secondary to volume depletion
   - urine lytes
   - blood transfusion

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and central nervous system involvement. She was transferred to the ICU for elective intubation and initiation of phenobarbital, but now requires mechanical ventilation due to ongoing sedation. The patient has a history of recurrent non-convulsive status epilepticus and persistent phenobarbital levels. Other medical conditions include acute respiratory failure, hypertension, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilatory support: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There may be complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, or ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Seizures: The patient has a history of recurrent non-convulsive status epilepticus. Continuous EEG monitoring has been discontinued as she has not seized for 72 hours, but there is still a risk of seizure recurrence.
3. Hypertension: The patient has well-controlled hypertension on metoprolol. However, there may be complications associated with long-term antihypertensive medication use, such as hypotension upon discontinuation or adverse effects.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia likely secondary to sepsis. There may be an increased risk of bleeding or bruising.
5. Eosinophilia"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 75-year-old female with T-cell lymphoma and CNS involvement.
- She was admitted to the ICU for elective intubation due to recurrent status epilepticus.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to ongoing sedation from phenobarbital.
- Blood cultures show gram-positive cocci in pairs and short chains, suspicious for VRE.
- The patient is being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn for bacteremia.
- Family is discussing goals of care, considering withdrawal of care due to multiple comorbidities.
- The patient has a history of seizures/status epilepticus, which has been managed with keppra and fosphenytoin.
- Phenobarbital levels are trending down, and the plan is to avoid phenobarbital in the future.
- Continuous EEG monitoring has been discontinued since the patient has not had a seizure for 72 hours.
- The patient requires blood transfusions due to thrombocytopenia and anemia.
- There is a possibility of acute renal failure secondary to intravascular volume depletion.
- Hyponatremia is suspected to be caused by SIADH.
- The patient's T-cell lymphoma prognosis is grim, and comfort measures are being considered.
- The patient's hypertension is well-controlled on metoprolol.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilatory support failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. If there is a failure in ventilatory support, it may lead to respiratory distress or arrest.
2. Infection: The presence of bacteremia with gram-positive cocci and the suspicion of VRE indicate a risk of infection. This can lead to sepsis or septic shock if not managed appropriately.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's potential acute renal failure could lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, uremia, and increased risk of infections.
5. Hyponatremia: If left untreated, hyponatremia can cause neurological complications, including seizures and cerebral edema.
6. Seizure recurrence: Despite current antiepileptic treatment, there is still a risk of seizure recurrence, which can lead to further neurological complications.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient's multiple comorbidities, including lymphoma, may lead to further organ dysfunction, such as liver or heart failure.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and promptly address any potential complications that may arise."
