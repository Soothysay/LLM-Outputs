   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan: [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents
   from rehab with severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and
   abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis/Pyelonephritis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal
   failure, bandemia, positive UA and CT w/ possible pyelonephritis.  SBP
   responded to 4L IVF with CVP of 12 and SVO2 in 70-80s.  However, MAPs
   continue to be marginal and pts baseline is hypertensive.  Lactate
   remained elevated at 2.8 after fluid resuscitation.  A-line intact.
   - Continue LR boluses to maintain CVP goal of >[**9-25**].  We will try to
   keep his CVP at the higher end because his ECHO shows borderline
   pulmonary hypertension so he probably has elevated CVP at baseline.
   - Continue Levophed gtt to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for empiric coverage of UTI/Pyelo. (no history of
   ESBL)
   - f/u blood, urine cultures (narrow Abx when avail)
   - check AM/PM ABG/lactate
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection,  lactate is decreasing.
   Calculated bicarb deficit is 200.
   -Will repeat with 3amps bicarb
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT.  Pain out of
   proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are concerned
   about ischemic bowel.  Given his fever and increasing leukocytosis and
   recent hospitalizationwe are also concerned for C. Diff although he
   reports normal stool yesterday and was not on antibiotics recently. It
   is also possible he has pancreatic or liver/biliary pathology. It
   appears that his abdominal imaging is unchanged from previous
   admission.
   -KUB
   -Start Empiric Flagyl for C. Diff
   -Send C. Diff cultures
   -check Amylase, Lipase, LFTs
   -Serial Abdominal exams
   - OSH records to determine chronicity of this problem.
   -Zofran and morphine for pain
   .
   # Recent TIA/MS changes: Pt noted to be lethargic at rehab and CNS
   vasculatur sensitive to low BPs given TIA [**3-17**] hypotension during recent
   admission. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] continue with aggressive IVF
   resuscitation & pressors prn to avoid hypotensive/hypoperfusion to
   CNS.  Will d/w HCP in am regarding recent baseline MS.
   - Baseline hypertension, so will continue levophed gtt to maintain
   MAP>65 and will increase for mental status decline
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   -speak to his HCP about baseline mental status.
   .
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.2  likely
   due to sepsis and relative hypovolemia/hypotension.
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue Levo gtt to maintain MAP>65 to maintain kidney perfusion
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-29 range, currently  and
   normocytic after agressive resuscitation with NS and LR.   Most likely
   hemodilution.  Iron low with normal [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and
   chronic disease.
   -Transfuse for HVT<25
   -replete iron when stable and taking PO
   -q12 HCT
   - guaic all stools
   - has type & cross

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes and hypertension, who presented from rehab with severe sepsis and acute renal failure. The patient initially responded to fluid resuscitation but continues to have marginal mean arterial pressure (MAP) and elevated lactate levels. The patient is receiving continuous infusion of norepinephrine to maintain MAP >65 and urine output >30cc/hr. Empiric antibiotic coverage is being provided for urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis. Blood and urine cultures have been obtained, with plans to narrow antibiotic coverage once available.

The patient has non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and abdominal pain, with imaging showing a dilated colon. Given the recent transient ischemic attack (TIA), concern exists for ischemic bowel. Additionally, the patient may have Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) colitis, pancreatic or liver/biliary pathology, or other abdominal issues. Empiric treatment for C. Diff has been started, along with sending cultures and checking amylase, lipase, liver function tests (LFTs), and serial abdominal exams.

   failure, bandemia, positive UA and CT c/w pyelonephritis.  SBP
   responded to 4L IVF with CVP of 12 and SVO2 in 70-80s.  However, MAPs
   continue to be marginal and pts baseline is hypertensive.  Lactate
   remained elevated at 2.8 after fluid resuscitation.  A-line intact.
   - Continue LR boluses to maintain CVP goal of [**9-25**]
   - start Levophed gtt to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for empiric coverage of UTI/Pyelo. (no history of
   ESBL)
   - f/u blood, urine cultures (narrow Abx when avail)
   - check AM/PM ABG/lactate
   .
   # Recent TIA/MS changes: Pt noted to be lethargic at rehab and CNS
   vasculatur sensitive to low BPs given TIA [**3-17**] hypotension during recent
   admission. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] continue with aggressive IVF
   resuscitation & pressors prn to avoid hypotensive/hypoperfusion to
   CNS.  Will d/w HCP in am regarding recent baseline MS.
   - continue levophed gtt to maintain MAP>65
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   .
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently ????
   likely due to sepsis and relative hypovolemia/hypotension.
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue Levo gtt to maintain MAP>65 to maintain kidney perfusion
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-29 range, currently  and
   normocytic after agressive resuscitation with NS and LR.   Most likely

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis
   SEPSIS -- clinical presentation consistent with sepsis, possible
   urinary source.  Additional concerns include C. diff colitis, bowel
   ischemia, pancreatitis.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- somewhat more obtunded compared to admission,
   but improved this AM during rounds.  Variable.  Suspect toxic-metabolic
   encephalopathy.
   HYPOTENSION -- suspect hypovolemia and sepsis.  Monitor BP, maintain
   MAP >60 mmHg.
   ABDOMINAL PAIN -- new pain this AM.  Concerns include C. Diff, PUD,
   acute pancreatitis, and ischemic bowel.  Monitor serial exam, check
   stool for C. diff, guiac stools, amylase & lipase.  Consider empirical
   Flagyl.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect prerenal, although at risk for ATN.  Monitor
   urine output, BUN, creatinine.
   ACIDOSIS -- non-anion gap, likley from resussitation.  Use lactated
   ringer's judiciously in setting of acute renal failure.
   FLUIDS -- suspect hypovolemia.  Continue iv fluid boluses, monitor uo,
   BUN, creatinine.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus; may be due to hypotension, hypovolemia, pain or
   vasopressor effect.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- likely due to oral hypoglycemic agents in setting of
   NPO.
   ANEMIA -- ACD and iron deficiency by blood testing.  Transfuse to
   Hct>28.

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis
   SEPSIS -- clinical presentation consistent with sepsis, possible
   urinary source.  Additional concerns include C. diff colitis, bowel
   ischemia, pancreatitis.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- somewhat more obtunded compared to admission,
   but improved this AM during rounds.  Variable.  Suspect toxic-metabolic
   encephalopathy.
   HYPOTENSION -- suspect hypovolemia and sepsis.  Monitor BP, maintain
   MAP >60 mmHg.
   ABDOMINAL PAIN -- new pain this AM.  Concerns include C. Diff, PUD,
   acute pancreatitis, and ischemic bowel.  Monitor serial exam, check
   stool for C. diff, guiac stools, amylase & lipase.  Consider empirical
   Flagyl.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect prerenal, although at risk for ATN.  Monitor
   urine output, BUN, creatinine.
   ACIDOSIS -- non-anion gap, likley from resussitation.  Use lactated
   ringer's judiciously in setting of acute renal failure.
   FLUIDS -- suspect hypovolemia.  Continue iv fluid boluses, monitor uo,
   BUN, creatinine.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus; may be due to hypotension, hypovolemia, pain or
   vasopressor effect.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- likely due to oral hypoglycemic agents in setting of
   NPO.
   ANEMIA -- ACD and iron deficiency by blood testing.  Transfuse to
   Hct>28.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a clinical presentation consistent with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection. The possible urinary source suggests that a urinary tract infection may be contributing to the development of sepsis.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is somewhat more obtunded compared to admission but has shown improvement during rounds. This could be due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, which can result from various factors such as medications, electrolyte imbalances, or organ dysfunction.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure (BP) suggests hypovolemia and sepsis. It is important to monitor the patient's BP and maintain the mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg to ensure adequate blood flow to vital organs.

4. Abdominal pain: The patient's new pain in the abdomen raises concerns for conditions like Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), acute pancreatitis, and ischemic bowel. Monitoring the patient's abdominal examination and checking stool for C. diff, as well as amylase and lipase levels, will help identify the underlying cause.

5. Renal failure: The patient is at risk of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and prerenal renal failure. Monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis/Pyelonephritis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal
   failure, bandemia, positive UA and CT w/ possible pyelonephritis.  SBP
   responded to 4L IVF with CVP of 12 and SVO2 in 70-80s.  However, MAPs
   continue to be marginal and pts baseline is hypertensive.  Lactate
   remained elevated at 2.8 after fluid resuscitation.  A-line intact.
   - Continue LR boluses to maintain CVP goal of >[**9-25**].  We will try to
   keep his CVP at the higher end because his ECHO shows borderline
   pulmonary hypertension so he probably has elevated CVP at baseline.
   - Continue Levophed gtt to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for empiric coverage of UTI/Pyelo. (no history of
   ESBL)
   - f/u blood, urine cultures (narrow Abx when avail)
   - check AM/PM ABG/lactate
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection,  lactate is decreasing.
   Calculated bicarb deficit is 200.
   -Will repeat with 3amps bicarb
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT.  Pain out of
   proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are concerned
   about ischemic bowel.  Given his fever and increasing leukocytosis and
   recent hospitalizationwe are also concerned for C. Diff although he
   reports normal stool yesterday and was not on antibiotics recently. It
   is also possible he has pancreatic or liver/biliary pathology. It
   appears that his abdominal imaging is unchanged from previous
   admission.
   -KUB
   -Start Empiric Flagyl for C. Diff
   -Send C. Diff cultures
   -check Amylase, Lipase, LFTs
   -Serial Abdominal exams
   - OSH records to determine chronicity of this problem
   -Zofran and morphine for pain
   .
   # Recent TIA/MS changes: Pt noted to be lethargic at rehab and CNS
   vasculatur sensitive to low BPs given TIA [**3-17**] hypotension during recent
   admission. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] continue with aggressive IVF
   resuscitation & pressors prn to avoid hypotensive/hypoperfusion to
   CNS.  Will d/w HCP in am regarding recent baseline MS.
   - Baseline hypertension, so will continue levophed gtt to maintain
   MAP>65 and will increase for mental status decline
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   -speak to his HCP about baseline mental status.
   .
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.2  likely
   due to sepsis and relative hypovolemia/hypotension.
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue Levo gtt to maintain MAP>65 to maintain kidney perfusion
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-29 range, currently  and
   normocytic after agressive resuscitation with NS and LR.   Most likely
   hemodilution.  Iron low with normal [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and
   chronic disease.
   -Transfuse for HVT<25
   -replete iron when stable and taking PO
   -q12 Hct
   - guaic all stools
   - has type & cross
   .
   # DM: Holding oral hypoglycemics, monitor BS QIDACHS
   - Humalog sliding scale coverage
   .
   # Hypertension: currently hypotensive
   - holding all BP meds for now
   - continue Aspirin 81mg
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue Atorvastatin 10mg daily

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and a recent transient ischemic attack (TIA) who presented from rehabilitation with severe sepsis, hypotension, and pyelonephritis. He also has acute renal failure, bandemia, positive urine analysis, and possible pyelonephritis. The patient's blood pressure remains marginal despite fluid resuscitation, and his lactate level remains elevated at 2.8. 

The patient is currently being treated with continuous low-dose dopamine (Levophed) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg and urine output (UOP) above 30cc/hr. He is also receiving vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) for empiric coverage of UTI/Pyelo, and blood and urine cultures have been ordered. 

The patient is also being managed for non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is likely secondary to normal saline (NS) resuscitation and underlying infection. The calculated bicarbonate deficit is 200, and he will be given 3 amps of bicarbonate. 

The patient's abdominal pain is out of proportion to the physical examination findings, and there is concern for ischemic bowel, Clostridium difficile infection (C. Diff), pancreatic, liver/biliary pathology, or other causes. Imaging results are unchanged from previous admission, so further investigations"

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing hypotension. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, likely of intraabdominal or urinary origin. The hypotension is attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, possibly due to shock liver, and there is distention of the gallbladder and upper limit of bile duct distention seen on RUQ US. 

The patient's nutritional support is currently NPO pending evaluation. There is a gradual reduction in hematocrit (Hct), indicating anemia, but without clinical evidence for bleeding. The patient's blood glucose levels need to be maintained below 140 mg/dL. 

The patient has multiple lines inserted, including a multi-lumen line, an 18-gauge line, and an arterial line. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) code status. The patient remains in the ICU for ongoing care."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. The key findings and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to hypovolemia and sepsis.

2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, including fever, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal laboratory values such as elevated lactate levels and liver function tests.

3. Abdominal pain: The patient complains of diffuse abdominal pain, particularly in the right upper quadrant (RUQ). There is concern for bowel ischemia and possible intra-abdominal sources of infection.

4. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating possible shock liver. A HIDA scan may be considered to evaluate the biliary system.

5. Fluid balance: The patient has a positive fluid balance, indicating fluid overload or inadequate fluid resuscitation.

6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, suggesting anemia. However, there is no clinical evidence of bleeding.

7. Nutritional support: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth), pending evaluation.

8. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels need to be maintained below 140 mg/dL due to a history of NIDDM (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus).

9. Lines and tubes: The patient has multiple lines and tubes inserted, including"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Sepsis: The patient presented with severe sepsis, characterized by hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and bandemia. The source of infection is still unknown, and the patient has been experiencing abdominal pain. The patient's urine culture showed E. coli, but they did not improve on vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn)/flagyl. 

2. Ischemic bowel: The patient has a dilated colon on the CXR and abdominal CT without contrast, along with pain that is out of proportion to the examination. Given the recent TIA (transient ischemic attack) and concern for ischemic bowel, Flagyl has been started.

3. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: This is likely secondary to NS (normal saline) resuscitation, underlying infection, and lactate is decreasing.

4. Recent TIA/MS changes: The patient was lethargic at rehab and had CNS (central nervous system) vasculature sensitive to low blood pressures due to a recent hypotensive episode during admission. Neuro exam was non-focal, but the patient was not oriented to time/place. Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of acute infection vs. baseline MS (multiple sclerosis).

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Sepsis: The patient presented with severe sepsis, which is characterized by systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction caused by an infection. The source of the infection is still unknown. Complications associated with sepsis include multiple organ failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level from 1.1 to 2.5. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not properly managed.

3. Ischemic Bowel: The patient's abdominal pain is out of proportion to the physical examination findings, raising concern for ischemic bowel. This condition can lead to bowel necrosis and perforation if not promptly treated.

4. Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has non-anion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to NS resuscitation and underlying infection. If not corrected, it can result in further acid-base disturbances and organ dysfunction.

5. Central Nervous System (CNS) Dysfunction: The patient's recent TIA and mental status changes suggest CNS involvement. The patient is at risk for further neurological decline if not aggressively managed with blood pressure control and infection treatment.

6. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia with a baseline Hct"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes and hypotensive TIA who presented from rehab with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and bandemia. The source of infection is still unknown. The patient has a positive urine culture for E. coli but is not improving on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole. He also has abdominal pain, dilated loops of bowel on X-ray, and a history of multiple small bowel obstructions (SBO). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure of 117/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. He is receiving norepinephrine and phenylephrine infusions to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and urine output above 30 cc/hr. His central venous pressure (CVP) is being kept at the higher end due to borderline pulmonary hypertension shown on echocardiogram. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) is being maintained above 28% with a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). He is also receiving vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, and meropenem for possible extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ischemic bowel: The patient's abdominal pain is disproportionate to the physical examination findings, raising concerns for ischemic bowel, especially given the history of multiple SBOs and dilated loops of bowel on imaging.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.1, which has increased to 2.5, indicating renal dysfunction likely secondary to sepsis and relative hypovolemia/hypotension.
3. Metabolic encephalopathy: The patient is lethargic and not oriented to time/place, which could be due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of acute infection or his underlying medical conditions.
4. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has borderline pulmonary hypertension, and his CVP is being kept at the higher end to avoid hypotension and subsequent hypoperfusion to the kidneys.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels need to be closely monitored and managed due to his diabetes and the stress of sepsis.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged bed rest in the ICU.
7. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers should be continued to prevent these complications.

Overall, the patient requires aggressive management of sepsis, close monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated
   LFT
s and bandemia.   Source is still currently unknown. He had
   positive UA and CT peri-nephric stranding, but also a history of
   multiple SBO and dilated loops of bowel on KUB.  Urine Cx with E.coli
   but not improving on Vanc/Zosyn/flaygyl.
   - Continue IV  boluses to maintain CVP goal of >[**11-25**].  We will try to
   keep his CVP at the higher end because his ECHO shows borderline
   pulmonary hypertension so he probably has elevated CVP at baseline.
   - Continue Neo gtt to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - f/u blood Cx
   - Transfuse 1 U PRBC to keep Hct >28.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn/flagyl for now
   - Start Meropenum for possibility of ESBL
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT w/o contrast.  Pain
   out of proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are
   concerned about ischemic bowel.  Flagyl started for ? of C diff though
   probability low. It is also possible he has liver/biliary pathology
   although LFTs are correcting quickly suggesting shock liver.
   -CT with Oral Contrast for ? of SBO
   -F/u C diff. Cont flagyl
   -serial LFTs
   - OSH records to determine chronicity of this problem
   -Zofran and morphine for pain
   .
   # Recent TIA/MS changes: Pt noted to be lethargic at rehab and CNS
   vasculatur sensitive to low BPs given TIA [**3-17**] hypotension during recent
   admission. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] continue with aggressive IVF
   resuscitation & pressors prn to avoid hypotensive/hypoperfusion to
   CNS.  Will d/w HCP in am regarding recent baseline MS.
   - Baseline hypertension, so will continue levophed gtt to maintain
   MAP>65 and will increase for mental status decline
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   .
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection,  lactate is decreasing.
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.5  likely
   due to sepsis and relative hypovolemia/hypotension.
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue Levo gtt to maintain MAP>65 to maintain kidney perfusion
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-29 range, currently  and
   normocytic after agressive resuscitation with NS and LR.   Most likely
   hemodilution.  Iron low with normal [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and
   chronic disease.  Given septic picture, we will transfuse to higher
   goal
   -Transfuse for HCT<28
   -replete iron when stable and taking PO
   -q12 Hct
   - guaic all stools
   - has type & cross
   .
   # DM: Holding oral hypoglycemics, monitor BS QIDACHS
   - Humalog sliding scale coverage
   .
   # Hypertension: currently hypotensive
   - holding all BP meds for now
   - continue Aspirin 81mg
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue Atorvastatin 10mg daily
   .
   # FEN: NG tube placed for Oral contrast.  Will give meds and consider
   TF tomorrow

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus and hypotensive transient ischemic attack. He presented from rehabilitation with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and bandemia. The source of sepsis is still unknown, but it may be urosepsis with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli. He had a positive urine culture and computed tomography (CT) peri-nephric stranding, but also a history of multiple small bowel obstructions and dilated loops of bowel on CT. He is improving on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presented with severe sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ dysfunction. It is important to continue monitoring his vital signs, blood glucose levels, and urine output. Source control and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial for managing sepsis.

2. Abdominal Pain: The patient has abdominal pain that is out of proportion to the physical examination findings. This could suggest ischemic bowel, especially considering his recent transient ischemic attack. Further evaluation with a CT scan with oral contrast is needed to assess for small bowel obstruction and possible ischemia.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient required three amps of dextrose 50% overnight,"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated
   LFT
s and bandemia.   Source is still currently unknown but may be
   urosepsis with ESBL.  He had  positive UA and CT peri-nephric
   stranding, but also a history of multiple SBO and dilated loops of
   bowel on CT.  Urine Cx with E.coli, now improving on
   Vanc/Zosyn/flaygyl/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - Continue to monitor BP, if decreased can bolus but otherwise
   maintanence fluids.
   - f/u E. Coli sensitivities
   - Transfuse 1 U PRBC to keep Hct >28.
   - Continue Zosyn/flagyl/[**Last Name (un) **] for now, D/C vanc
   - Continue Meropenum for possibility of ESBL
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT w/o contrast.  Pain
   out of proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are
   concerned about ischemic bowel.  Flagyl started for ? of C diff though
   probability low. It is also possible he has liver/biliary pathology
   although LFTs are correcting quickly suggesting shock liver.
   -CT with Oral Contrast for ? of SBO
   -F/u C diff. Cont flagyl
   -serial LFTs
   - OSH records to determine chronicity of this problem
   -Zofran and morphine for pain
   .
   # Recent TIA/MS changes: Pt noted to be lethargic at rehab and CNS
   vasculatur sensitive to low BPs given TIA [**3-17**] hypotension during recent
   admission. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] continue with aggressive IVF
   resuscitation & pressors prn to avoid hypotensive/hypoperfusion to
   CNS.  Will d/w HCP in am regarding recent baseline MS.
   - Baseline hypertension, so will continue levophed gtt to maintain
   MAP>65 and will increase for mental status decline
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   .
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection,  lactate is normal.
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.7.  Given
   prolonged hypotension likely due to ATN
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue Levo gtt to maintain MAP>65 to maintain kidney perfusion
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-29 range, currently  and
   normocytic after agressive resuscitation with NS and LR.   Most likely
   hemodilution.  Iron low with normal [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and
   chronic disease.  Given septic picture, we will transfuse to higher
   goal
   -Transfuse for HCT<28
   -replete iron when stable and taking PO
   -q12 Hct
   - guaic all stools
   .
   # DM: Holding oral hypoglycemics, monitor BS QIDACHS
   - D/C Humalog sliding scale coverage given Hypoglycemia
   .
   # Hypertension: currently hypotensive
   - holding all BP meds for now
   - continue Aspirin 81mg
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue Atorvastatin 10mg daily
   .
   # FEN: NG tube to suction.  Will give D5
 NS for hypoglycemia
   - adv diabetic diet when more alert

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus and hypotensive transient ischemic attack (TIA). The patient presented from rehabilitation with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and bandemia. The source of sepsis is still unknown but may be urosepsis with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli. The patient has a history of multiple small bowel obstructions (SBO) and dilated loops of bowel on CT scan. The urine culture showed E. coli, which is now improving on vancomycin (Vanc), piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and metronidazole (Flagyl). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/40 mmHg to 133/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles, diffuse end expiratory wheezes, soft but more distended abdomen, and trace edema at the ankles.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.2 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 1."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus and hypotensive transient ischemic attack. He presented to the ICU with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and bandemia. The source of infection is still unknown but may be urosepsis with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli. He has a history of multiple small bowel obstructions and dilated loops of bowel on CT scan. His urine culture showed E. coli, which is improving on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole. 

The patient has abdominal pain out of proportion to the examination, possibly due to ischemic bowel, and there is concern for liver/biliary pathology. A CT scan with oral contrast is planned to evaluate for possible small bowel obstruction. Flagyl has been started for possible Clostridium difficile infection. 

The patient also had a recent transient ischemic attack and has changes in mental status. Neurological exams will be performed every four hours, and aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation and pressors will be administered to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and avoid hypoperfusion to the central nervous system. 

Other findings include non-anion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to normal saline resuscitation and underlying infection, acute renal failure due to sepsis and relative hypovolemia/h"

   serial.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA --  may be consumption (but no evidence for active
   bleeding), may be bone marrow suppression, may be medication related
   (ex heparin).  Monitor.
   ABD PAIN -- somewhat improved, but more distended --> decompress with
   NGT, intermittent suction.

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, urinary source.
   SEPSIS -- slow improvement, but now off vasopressors.  WBC
   normalizing.  Continue support.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis.  No evidence for
   cortisol insufficiency.  No evidence MI.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- likely attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.
   Continue to monitor UO, BUN, creat.  Monitor for diuresis.
   ABNORMAL LFTs -- resolving;  attributed to shock liver.  Monitor
   serial.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA --  may be consumption (but no evidence for active
   bleeding), may be bone marrow suppression, may be medication related
   (ex heparin).  Monitor.
   ABD PAIN -- somewhat improved, but more distended --> decompress with
   NGT, intermittent suction.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- total body depleted.  continue to replete, monitor
   ionized ca++
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- accounts for lethargy in part;  [**Month (only) 51**] be attributed to
   slow clearance of oral hypoglycemia in combination with NPO.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   ascribed to antibiotic.  Continue to monitor glucose, hold hypoglycemic
   agents.  Provide D5W if remains NPO.
   NUTRITION -- hope to initiate TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is sepsis and hypotension. The patient underwent a HIDA scan, which was negative for acute cholecystitis. The patient also had an arterial line placed and experienced episodes of hypoglycemia, responding to IV D50 boluses. The patient was weaned off vasopressor and received IV fluids and 1 unit of packed red blood cells. The patient's abdominal pain has somewhat improved, but they are more distended, leading to the decompression with an NG tube and intermittent suction.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the gastrointestinal system, where they reported abdominal pain. The patient's allergies are no known drug allergies. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 10/9/2108 at 3:49 PM, metronidazole on 10/10/2108 at 4:00 AM, meropenem on 10/10/2108 at 6:00 AM, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 10/10/2108 at 8:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature range of 36.7°C to 35.4°C, heart rate range of 69-82 bpm, blood pressure range of 121/56-133/61 mmHg, respiratory rate range of 13-22 breaths per minute, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated
   LFT
s and bandemia.   Source is still currently unknown but may be
   urosepsis with ESBL.  He had  positive UA and CT peri-nephric
   stranding, but also a history of multiple SBO and dilated loops of
   bowel on CT.  Urine Cx with E.coli, now improving on
   Vanc/Zosyn/flaygyl/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - Continue to monitor BP, if decreased can bolus but otherwise
   maintanence fluids.
   - f/u E. Coli sensitivities
   - Transfuse 1 U PRBC to keep Hct >28.
   - ABG in PM to trend lactate.
   - Continue Zosyn/flagyl/[**Last Name (un) **] for now,
   - D/C vanc
   - Continue Meropenum for possibility of ESBL
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT w/o contrast.  Pain
   out of proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are
   concerned about ischemic bowel.  Flagyl started for ? of C diff though
   probability low. It is also possible he has liver/biliary pathology
   although LFTs are correcting quickly suggesting shock liver.
   -CT with Oral Contrast for ? of SBO
   -F/u C diff. Cont flagyl for now
   -serial LFTs
   -Zofran for nausea
   .
   #. Hypoglycemia: Patient required 3 amps D50 overnight.  Likely
   combination of poor clearance of glyburide given prior to admit with
   new renal/hepatic injury, and pt being NPO.
   -Switch IVF to D5
   - consider TF when abdomen is decompressed and patient with regular BM.
   - D/C ISS
   .
   # MS changes: Patient lethargic after morphine yesterday.  Also with
   low Glucose. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS.
   - Hold sedatives for now
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   - Add D5 to IVF to prevent further Hypoglycemia
   .
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection, lactate is normal.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.7.  Given
   prolonged turnaround of renal function in setting of  hypotension ->
   likely ATN
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue to monitor UOP to keep >30 cc/hr
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-28 range.   Most likely
   hemodilution but pt with acute 3 pt drop this AM.  Iron low with normal
   [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and chronic disease.  Given septic
   picture, we will transfuse to higher goal
   -Transfuse for HCT<28
   -replete iron when stable and taking PO
   -q12 Hct
   - guaic all stools
   .
   # DM: Holding oral hypoglycemics, monitor BS QIDACHS
   - D/C Humalog sliding scale coverage given Hypoglycemia
   .
   # Hypertension: currently hypotensive
   - holding all BP meds for now
   - continue Aspirin 81mg
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold Atorvastatin 10mg daily given poor PO with
   altered MS
   .
   # FEN: NG tube to suction.  Will give D5
 NS for hypoglycemia
   - adv diabetic diet when more alert
   - monitor lytes/replete prn

He was admitted from a rehabilitation facility with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and bandemia. The source of sepsis is still unknown but may be urosepsis with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli. He has a positive urine culture with E. coli and is currently improving on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole. 

The patient has multiple comorbidities including dilated loops of bowel on computed tomography (CT) scan, abdominal pain out of proportion to examination, and concern for ischemic bowel given recent TIA. There is also a possibility of liver/biliary pathology, although liver function tests (LFTs) are correcting quickly suggesting shock liver.

Other medical issues include hypoglycemia, likely due to poor clearance of glyburide, new renal/hepatic injury, and being nothing by mouth (NPO). The patient's mental status has been altered, possibly due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of acute infection or baseline multiple sclerosis (MS). Neuro exams are non-focal but the patient is not oriented to time/place.

The patient is also experiencing non-anion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated
   LFT
s and bandemia.   Source is still currently unknown but may be
   urosepsis with ESBL.  He had  positive UA and CT peri-nephric
   stranding, but also a history of multiple SBO and dilated loops of
   bowel on CT.  Urine Cx with E.coli, now improving on
   Vanc/Zosyn/flaygyl/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - Continue to monitor BP, if decreased can bolus but otherwise
   maintanence fluids.
   - f/u E. Coli sensitivities
   - Transfuse 1 U PRBC to keep Hct >28.
   - ABG in PM to trend lactate.
   - Continue Zosyn/flagyl/[**Last Name (un) **] for now,
   - D/C vanc
   - Continue Meropenum for possibility of ESBL
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT w/o contrast.  Pain
   out of proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are
   concerned about ischemic bowel.  Flagyl started for ? of C diff though
   probability low. It is also possible he has liver/biliary pathology
   although LFTs are correcting quickly suggesting shock liver.
   -CT with Oral Contrast for ? of SBO
   -F/u C diff. Cont flagyl for now
   -serial LFTs
   -Zofran for nausea
   .
   #. Hypoglycemia: Patient required 3 amps D50 overnight.  Likely
   combination of poor clearance of glyburide given prior to admit with
   new renal/hepatic injury, and pt being NPO.
   -Switch IVF to D5
   - consider TF when abdomen is decompressed and patient with regular BM.
   - D/C ISS
   .
   # MS changes: Patient lethargic after morphine yesterday.  Also with
   low Glucose. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS.
   - Hold sedatives for now
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   - Add D5 to IVF to prevent further Hypoglycemia
   .
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection, lactate is normal.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.7.  Given
   prolonged turnaround of renal function in setting of  hypotension ->
   likely ATN
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue to monitor UOP to keep >30 cc/hr
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-28 range.   Most likely
   hemodilution but pt with acute 3 pt drop this AM.  Iron low with normal
   [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and chronic disease.  Given septic
   picture, we will transfuse to higher goal
   -Transfuse for HCT<28
   -replete iron when stable and taking PO
   -q12 Hct
   - guaic all stools
   .
   # DM: Holding oral hypoglycemics, monitor BS QIDACHS
   - D/C Humalog sliding scale coverage given Hypoglycemia
   .
   # Hypertension: currently hypotensive
   - holding all BP meds for now
   - continue Aspirin 81mg
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold Atorvastatin 10mg daily given poor PO with
   altered MS
   .
   # FEN: NG tube to suction.  Will give D5
 NS for hypoglycemia
   - adv diabetic diet when more alert
   - monitor lytes/replete prn
   .
   # Access: Subclavian CVL, PIV
   .
   # PPx: Heparin sc TID, PPI, bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: DNR/DNI (lines & pressors okay)

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated
   LFT
s and bandemia.   Source is likely urosepsis with E. Coli.  Urine
   Cx with E.coli, sensitive to Meropenem and ceftriaxone and others (see
   [**Last Name (un) 270**] in OMR).
   - Continue to monitor BP, if decreased can bolus but otherwise minimize
   fluids.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for now
   - D/C vanc, zosyn, flagyl
   #Abdominal Pain: Much improved today with decompression and BM x 2
   yesterday.  C diff negative.
   - D/C flagyl
   - continue bowel regimen
   - continue [**Last Name (un) **] for 1 more day then consider switching to ceftriaxone
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient with platlets continuing to trend down now
   78
   - D/C all heparin exposure (SQ, Flushes)
   - CBC this PM
   - Send HIT antibody.
   .
   #. Hypoglycemia: Patient required D10 overnight.  Likely combination of
   poor clearance of glyburide given prior to admit with new renal/hepatic
   injury, and pt being NPO.
   - Continue D10
 NS and titrate to normal BG
   - Advance to diabetic diet as tolerated.
   - D/C ISS
   .
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.9.  Given
   prolonged turnaround of renal function in setting of  hypotension ->
   likely ATN
   - monitor creatinine
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue to monitor UOP to keep >30 cc/hr
   - Diurese today given crackles on Lung exam
   .
   # MS changes: Patient much improved from yesterday.  Also with low
   Glucose. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.  Most
   likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute infection vs.
   baseline MS.
   - treat infection: continue Abx
   - continue to monitor for Hypoglycemia.
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-28 range.   Most likely
   hemodilution but pt with acute 3 pt drop this AM.  Iron low with normal
   [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and chronic disease.  Given septic
   picture, we will transfuse to higher goal
   -Transfuse for HCT<28
   -replete iron when stable and taking PO
   -q12 Hct
   - guaic all stools
   .
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection, lactate is normal.
   - continue to monitor
   # DM: Holding oral hypoglycemics, monitor BS QIDACHS
   - D/C Humalog sliding scale coverage given Hypoglycemia
   .
   # Hypertension: currently hypotensive
   - holding all BP meds for now
   - continue Aspirin 81mg
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue Atorvastatin 10mg daily
   .
   # FEN: D/C NG tube.  Will give D10
 NS for hypoglycemia and titrate as
   appropriate
   - adv diabetic diet as tolerated
   - monitor lytes/replete prn
   .
   # Access: Subclavian CVL, PIV  -> D/C prior to transfer to floor
   .
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes and a hypotensive transient ischemic attack (TIA). He presented to the hospital with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and bandemia. The source of sepsis is likely urosepsis caused by E. coli. The patient has shown improvement in abdominal pain with decompression and bowel movements. His thrombocytopenia is worsening, and he has hypoglycemia due to poor clearance of glyburide and renal/hepatic injury. He also has acute renal failure with a recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently at 2.9, indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's mental status has improved but remains disoriented to time and place, possibly due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy or his underlying multiple sclerosis (MS). 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation was severe sepsis, which can lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction and septic shock.

2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's acute renal failure indicates ATN, which can result in chronic kidney disease and impaired renal function.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing sepsis with a urinary source and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension, but it has resolved. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the increasing creatinine levels. The patient's blood glucose levels are being maintained with D10W infusion. Fluid balance is being monitored, and the patient remains volume expanded. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Progressive renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating worsening renal function. This could lead to further fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and the need for dialysis.

2. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension has resolved, but it can recur due to sepsis or other factors. This could compromise organ perfusion and lead to tissue damage.

3. Infection: As the patient is already experiencing sepsis, there is a risk of developing new infections or complications related to the current infection, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infection.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has thrombocytopenia and a prolonged PTT, which may indicate a coagulopathy. This increases the risk of bleeding, especially if invasive procedures are required.

5. Organ dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and there is evidence of hepatomegaly. This could progress to hepatic failure, affecting the metabolism of drugs and production of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, urinary source; acute renal failure.
   SEPSIS -- good response to current therapy.  Monitor VS.
   HYPTENSION -- hypovolemia, sepsis.  Resoved.  Maintin BP MAP > 60 mmHg
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- progressive, non-oliguric.  Creatinine continues
   to increase.  Intravascular replete.  Monitor uo, BUN, creatinine.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  D10W for glucose control.
   FLUIDS -- remains volume expanded.  Desire net negative.  Monitor I/O.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- likely attributed to slow clearance of oral
   hypoglycemic [**Doctor Last Name **] in setting of renal failure.
   LFT ABNORMALITIES -- resolving; likely shock liver.  Continue to
   monitor.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- marked decrease.  Likely drug-related.  check HIT
   antibody.
   ABD PAIN -- likely related to hepatic inflammation, possible related to
   sepsis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening infection that can lead to organ failure.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is also suffering from acute renal failure, as indicated by the increasing levels of creatinine. This condition can further complicate the patient's condition and require dialysis.

3. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension previously, which resolved but may recur if fluid balance is not maintained or if sepsis worsens.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a marked decrease in platelet count, which may be drug-related or due to sepsis. This can increase the risk of bleeding.

5. Abdominal Pain: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, which could be related to hepatic inflammation or sepsis. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause.

6. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to ""shock liver"" caused by sepsis. Monitoring liver function is essential.

7. Nutritional Support: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving D10W infusion for glucose control. Nutritional support should be carefully managed in critically ill patients.

8. Fluid Management: The patient's fluid balance needs close monitoring to maintain"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with sepsis, urinary source, and acute renal failure. The patient has shown a good response to current therapy for sepsis but continues to experience hypotension due to hypovolemia and sepsis. The acute renal failure is progressive and non-oliguric, with an increasing creatinine level. The patient's nutritional support involves being NPO and receiving dextrose 10% in water (D10W) for glucose control. Fluid management remains volume expanded, aiming for a net negative balance. The patient's blood glucose levels have been low, likely attributed to the slow clearance of oral hypoglycemic agents in the setting of renal failure. Liver function test abnormalities are resolving and are believed to be related to shock liver. Thrombocytopenia, with a marked decrease in platelet count, is suspected to be drug-related, and HIT antibody testing should be conducted. The patient's abdominal pain is likely related to hepatic inflammation or possible sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, and there is a risk of worsening or complications arising from the infection.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, leading to an increase in creatinine levels. Further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, or the need for renal replacement therapy may occur.
