","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multi-organ failure and severe sepsis. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuating vital signs and ongoing bleeding. Multiple interventions have been performed, including central line placement, paracentesis, and blood transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's presentation suggests severe sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Multi-organ Dysfunction Syndrome: With multi-organ failure indicated, there is a risk of further deterioration in organ function, leading to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Coagulopathy: The presence of bleeding and a drop in hemoglobin levels suggest coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and invasive procedures increase the risk of healthcare-associated infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
5. Fluid Imbalance: The fluid balance chart shows a significant net output of fluids, indicating potential dehydration or ongoing fluid losses.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to the underlying condition and mechanical ventilation.
7. Renal Dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level suggests renal dysfunction, which may worsen if adequate fluid"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 y/o woman with alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic
   cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper GI
   bleeding.
   .
   # Shock: Unclear etiology but most concerning for hypovolemic (due to
   blood loss) versus septic/infectious. Patient has obvious GI blood loss
   with hct down to 21 on arrival at OSH. Hct here 26.4 (after 2 u prbcs
   at other hospital). Has clot in gastric fundus on EGD but no apparent
   varices. For infection, patient has leukocytosis with bandemia.
   Potential sources include abdomen (peritoneal fluid not indicative of
   sbp), ? stool (c diff given bandemia), and UTI (wbcs on urinalysis). ?
   other ingestion (given lithium level 0.2 and tylenol in serum tox) but
   unclear how related.
   - 2 U PRBCs & 2 U [**Year (4 digits) 1345**] on arrival to MICU, will get addt
l 2 units PRBCs
   and 2 units [**Year (4 digits) 1345**]
   - CVL and arterial line placed for monitoring
   - CVP goal [**11-20**]
   - MAP goal > 65
   - treat for uti with ceftriaxone
   - treat other sources broadly with vancomycin (given multiple recent
   hospitalizations)/flagyl (? ciff or other intraabdominal source)
   - on levophed, may augment with fluids, vasopressin prn
   .
   # upper GI bleeding: EGD on arrival to the MICU demonstrated large
   blood clot in the gastric fundus but no esophageal varices (difficult
   to discern due to hypotension).
   - continue octreotide gtt, PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - repeat endoscopy with liver today, admin
d dose erythromycin prior to
   EGD for motility
   - maintain active type & cross
   - transfusion per above
   - posttransfusion hct last 2 units of PRBCs and [**Hospital1 1345**]
   - liver following
   - hold all anticoagulation, antiinflammatories
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: Anion gap 21-> 16 on most recent lytes. Lactate
   elevated at 12->6 in presence of renal failure.
   -Continue to trend and cover with abx and transfusion prn.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated due to agonal respirations at OSH. ETT
   in good position.
   - monitor ABGs
   - f/u sputum cx
   - follow CXRs
   .
   # Altered mental status: Patient intermittently alert on arrival to
   MICU and following commands.
   - sedated, opening eyes to voice
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to hypotension, volume
   depletion.  Cr trending down.
   - trend uop & creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Coagulopathy: likely related to underlying liver disease (though
   platelets normal). INR 2.5 earlier down to 2.0 on arrival to MICU.
   continue to trend with goal < 2 for reversal of coagulopathy. Given
   vitamin K given at OSH, will repeat dose here. Fibrinogen also < 150 on
   labs from arrival to our ED. Could represent an element of DIC given
   other active problems.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] prn for goal INR < 2
   - vitamin K 10 mg admin
   - trend coags
   - check hemolysis labs
 slightly elevated for

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has been intubated due to agonal respirations. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube in good position. She has a large blood clot in the gastric fundus but no esophageal varices.

The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and has shown a decrease in hemoglobin concentration. Her blood cultures were obtained, and she underwent paracentesis, removing 8 liters of cloudy green-brown fluid. Urine culture was also collected. An arterial line and central venous line were placed for monitoring.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and an increased respiratory rate. She has scleral edema, icterus, and dry lips. There are bibasilar crackles in her lungs, and she has a small ventral/umbilical hernia with positive bowel sounds and a fluid wave. She has cool extremities with positive Duroziez pulses and bilateral pitting edema. She is jaundiced and sedated with symmetric facial features.

Her laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with bandemia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal renal function tests. The patient has hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and an elevated lactate"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 y/o woman with alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic
   cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper GI
   bleeding.
   .
   # Shock: Unclear etiology but most concerning for hypovolemic (due to
   blood loss) versus septic/infectious. Patient has obvious GI blood loss
   with hct down to 21 on arrival at OSH. Hct here 26.4 (after 2 u prbcs
   at other hospital). Has clot in gastric fundus on EGD but no apparent
   varices. For infection, patient has leukocytosis with bandemia.
   Potential sources include abdomen (peritoneal fluid not indicative of
   sbp), ? stool (c diff given bandemia), and UTI (wbcs on urinalysis). ?
   other ingestion (given lithium level 0.2 and tylenol in serum tox) but
   unclear how related.
   - 2 U PRBCs & 2 U [**Year (4 digits) 1345**] on arrival to MICU
   - CVL and arterial line placed for monitoring
   - CVP goal [**11-20**]
   - MAP goal > 65
   - treat for uti with ceftriaxone
   - treat other sources broadly with vancomycin (given multiple recent
   hospitalizations)/flagyl (? ciff or other intraabdominal source)
   - wean levophed to off maintaining map > 65
   .
   # upper GI bleeding: EGD on arrival to the MICU demonstrated large
   blood clot in the gastric fundus but no esophageal varices (difficult
   to discern due to hypotension).
   - continue octreotide gtt, PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - plan for repeat endoscopy in the morning, ? dose erythromycin 1 hour
   prior for motility
   - maintain active type & cross
   - 2u prbcs & 2 u [**Hospital1 **] as above
   - posttransfusion hct with AM labs
   - appreciate liver input
   - hold all anticoagulation, antiinflammatories
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: Anion gap 21 on most recent lytes. Lactate
   elevated at 12 so likely the culprit. Also with element of renal
   failure so ? contribution with nongap acidosis as well. Continue to
   trend.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated due to agonal respirations at OSH. ETT
   in good position.
   - adjust vent by ABGs
   - send sputum culture but no obvious infiltrate on CXR
   - ? eval L pleural effusion for tap, but likely related to ascites
   - repeat CXR in AM after paracentesis
   .
   # Altered mental status: Patient intermittently alert on arrival to
   MICU and following commands. Likely that unresponsiveness earlier
   related to hypotension, blood loss, ? infection. Continue to monitor
   and consider head imaging if mental status deteriorates. No overt
   signs/symptoms of stroke or seizure at present.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to hypotension, volume depletion.
   continue to trend. Consider urine lytes if not improved in AM. No urine
   output on arrival but abdomen tense at that time. Continue to trend
   urine output but appears improved since paracentesis.
   - trend uop & creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Coagulopathy: likely related to underlying liver disease (though
   platelets normal). INR 2.5 earlier down to 2.0 on arrival to MICU.
   continue to trend with goal < 2 for reversal of coagulopathy. Given
   that ? vitamin K given at OSH, will repeat dose here. Fibrinogen also <
   150 on labs from arrival to our ED. Could represent an element of DIC
   given other active problems.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] prn for goal INR < 2
   - vitamin K 10 mg iv X 1
   - trend coags
   - check hemolysis labs
   - check fibrinogen/fdp with AM labs
   .
   # hyperkalemia: Likely related to acidosis and renal insufficiency. No
   acute EKG changes so have not given insulin/d50 or calcium gluconate.
   - trend creatinine & potassium
   - repeat ekg in AM
   - reverse acidosis with bicarb fluids, improvement in hypotension
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely related to volume depletion with element of
   cirrhosis. Continue to trend after volume resuscitation.
   .
   # Alcohol abuse with cirrhosis: Patient arrived with tense ascites and
   is now s/p large volume tap (8 L removed). Her alcohol level on arrival
   to [**Hospital1 1**] was 229 at 1800 pm (patient's family not aware she continued
   to drink per their report). Also, the patient had tylenol in her serum
   tox (? ingestion time but could have been up to 24 hours prior).
   - follow peritoneal studies, culture results
   - albumin 6 g/L replacement tonight given 8 L paracentesis (50 g to be
   given)
   - appreciate Liver input
   - banana bag tonight then folate/thiamine/mvi daily
   - social work consult for family coping
   - treat for ? tylenol overdose with n-acetylcysteine
   - watch for withdrawal once extubated/off versed
   - attempt to obtain records from [**Hospital6 3017**] regarding prior
   discharges, other medical problems

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 y/o woman with alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic
   cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper GI
   bleeding.
   .
   # Shock: Unclear etiology but most concerning for hypovolemic (due to
   blood loss) versus septic/infectious. Patient has obvious GI blood loss
   with hct down to 21 on arrival at OSH. Hct here 26.4 (after 2 u prbcs
   at other hospital). Has clot in gastric fundus on EGD but no apparent
   varices. For infection, patient has leukocytosis with bandemia.
   Potential sources include abdomen (peritoneal fluid not indicative of
   sbp), ? stool (c diff given bandemia), and UTI (wbcs on urinalysis). ?
   other ingestion (given lithium level 0.2 and tylenol in serum tox) but
   unclear how related.
   - 2 U PRBCs & 2 U [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1345**] on arrival to MICU, will get addt
l 2 units PRBCs
   and 2 units [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1345**]
   - CVL and arterial line placed for monitoring
   - CVP goal [**11-20**]
   - MAP goal > 65
   - treat for uti with ceftriaxone
   - treat other sources broadly with vancomycin (given multiple recent
   hospitalizations)/flagyl (? ciff or other intraabdominal source)
   - on levophed, may augment with fluids, vasopressin prn
   .
   # upper GI bleeding: EGD on arrival to the MICU demonstrated large
   blood clot in the gastric fundus but no esophageal varices (difficult
   to discern due to hypotension).
   - continue octreotide gtt, PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - repeat endoscopy with liver today, admin
d dose erythromycin prior to
   EGD for motility
   - maintain active type & cross
   - transfusion per above
   - posttransfusion hct last 2 units of PRBCs and [**Hospital1 1345**]
   - liver following
   - hold all anticoagulation, antiinflammatories
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: Anion gap 21-> 16 on most recent lytes. Lactate
   elevated at 12->6 in presence of renal failure.
   -Continue to trend and cover with abx and transfusion prn.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated due to agonal respirations at OSH. ETT
   in good position.
   - monitor ABGs
   - f/u sputum cx
   - follow CXRs
   .
   # Altered mental status: Patient intermittently alert on arrival to
   MICU and following commands.
   - sedated, opening eyes to voice
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to hypotension, volume
   depletion.  Cr trending down.
   - trend uop & creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Coagulopathy: likely related to underlying liver disease (though
   platelets normal). INR 2.5 earlier down to 2.0 on arrival to MICU.
   continue to trend with goal < 2 for reversal of coagulopathy. Given
   vitamin K given at OSH, will repeat dose here. Fibrinogen also < 150 on
   labs from arrival to our ED. Could represent an element of DIC given
   other active problems.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] prn for goal INR < 2
   - vitamin K 10 mg admin
   - trend coags
   - check hemolysis labs
 slightly elevated for
   - check fibrinogen/fdp with AM labs
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Likely related to acidosis and renal insufficiency. No
   acute EKG changes so have not given insulin/d50 or calcium gluconate.
   - trend creatinine & potassium
   - repeat ekg with further elevations of K
   - reverse acidosis with bicarb fluids, improvement in hypotension
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely related to volume depletion with element of
   cirrhosis. Continue to trend after volume resuscitation.
   .
   # Alcohol abuse with cirrhosis: Patient arrived with tense ascites and
   is now s/p large volume tap (8 L removed). Her alcohol level on arrival
   to [**Hospital1 1**] was 229 at 1800 pm (patient's family not aware she continued
   to drink per their report). Also, the patient had tylenol in her serum
   tox (? ingestion time but could have been up to 24 hours prior).
   - follow peritoneal studies, culture results
   - albumin 6 g/L replacement tonight given 8 L paracentesis (50 g to be
   given)
   - appreciate Liver input
   - banana bag overight; folate/thiamine/mvi daily
   - social work consult for family coping; family mtg as group to address
   continuity of care
   - treat for ? tylenol overdose with n-acetylcysteine
   - watch for withdrawal -> monitor vital signs
   - attempt to obtain records from [**Hospital6 3017**] regarding prior
   discharges, other medical problems

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She has received 6 units of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma transfusions, and is still hypotensive. She underwent an endoscopy which showed a large blood clot in the gastric fundus but no apparent esophageal varices. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis with bandemia, indicating a potential infection. Sources of infection could include the abdomen (peritoneal fluid), stool (C. difficile given bandemia), or urinary tract infection (UTI).
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure could progress to ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy is a concern. This condition can cause altered mental status due to liver dysfunction.
4. Hepato-renal Syndrome: Acute renal failure may be related to hypotension and volume depletion, but it could also progress"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, suspected upper gastrointestinal bleed, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently intubated on mechanical ventilation. The patient has received 6 units of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma transfusions. Initial endoscopy findings revealed grade 1 varices and ulceration in the stomach but no active bleeding. The patient's blood cultures were obtained, and he is being treated with vasopressin and norepinephrine for persistent hypotension. The patient's laboratory results indicate hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, and altered liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and history of alcohol abuse increase the risk of infection, which may lead to sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and potential for aspiration due to altered mental status may lead to the development of ARDS.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and elevated liver enzymes suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although no active bleeding was observed during endoscopy, the patient may continue to bleed from other sites, leading to further blood loss and potential complications.
5. Hypotension: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 y/o woman with alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic
   cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper GI
   bleeding.
   .
   # Shock: Unclear etiology but most concerning for hypovolemic (due to
   blood loss) and septic/infectious. Patient had obvious GI blood loss
   with hct down to 21 on arrival at OSH. Hct here 26.4 (after 2 u prbcs
   at other hospital). Had clot in gastric fundus on initial EGD, repeat
   with grade 1 varices and gastric ulcer bu no sogns of active bleeding.
   Pt has leukocytosis with bandemia. Potential SBP r/o, other sources
   include stool (c diff given bandemia), UTI (pan [**Last Name (un) 206**] Klebsiella from
   OSH), aspiration PNA.
   - 4 U PRBCs & 4 U [**Last Name (un) 1345**] thus far in MICU
   - CVL and arterial line placed for monitoring
   - CVP goal [**11-20**]
   - MAP goal > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   - treat uti with ceftriaxone
   - treat other sources broadly with vancomycin (given multiple recent
   hospitalizations)
   - on levophed, vasopressin, fluid boluses prn
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 increased PEEP from yesterday with worsening
   bilat diffuse infiltrative process suggestive of ARDS.  Sputum cx with
   yeast and gram + cocci in pairs and chains.
   - cover with current abx
   -decrease Vtidal ~ 40
   -wean PEEP as tolerated
   -cont ABG
   -wean sedation to fentanyl, d/c midazolam
   .
   # Upper GI bleeding: EGD on arrival to the MICU demonstrated large
   blood clot in the gastric fundus but no esophageal varices (difficult
   to discern due to hypotension).  Now with no active visualized bleeding
   though some suggestion that pt is still oozing with guaiac positive
   stool.
   - cont PPI, on 2 pressors, will readdress need for octreotide PRN
   - maintain active type & cross
   - transfusion to keep crit > 25
   - AM/PM crits
   - liver following
   - hold all anticoagulation, antiinflammatories
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap closed from 21-> 16 -> 10 on most
   recent lytes. Lactate decreased to 3 in presence of renal failure.
   Issue resolved.  Will readdress PRN and cont to trend lytes and AG.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Patient intermittently alert on arrival to
   MICU and following commands.
   - sedated, opening eyes to voice
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to hypotension, volume depletion.
    Recent rise in Cr, but making urine.
   - trend uop & creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Coagulopathy: likely related to underlying liver disease (though
   platelets normal). INR 2.5 earlier down to 2.0 on arrival to MICU.
   continue to trend with goal < 2 for reversal of coagulopathy. Given
   vitamin K given at OSH, will repeat dose here. Fibrinogen also < 150 on
   labs from arrival to our ED. Could represent an element of DIC given
   other active problems.

   - vitamin K 10 mg admin
   - trend coags
   - check hemolysis labs
 slightly elevated for
   - check fibrinogen/fdp with AM labs

   # Hyperkalemia: Likely related to acidosis and renal insufficiency. No
   acute EKG changes so have not given insulin/d50 or calcium gluconate.
   - trend creatinine & potassium
   - repeat ekg with further elevations of K
   - reverse acidosis with bicarb fluids, improvement in hypotension
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely related to intravascular volume depletion with
   element of cirrhosis; ADH may be playing a role with free water
   holding. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Alcohol abuse with cirrhosis: Patient arrived with tense ascites and
   is now s/p large volume tap (8 L removed). Her alcohol level on arrival
   to [**Hospital1 1**] was 229 at 1800 pm (patient's family not aware she continued
   to drink per their report). Also, the patient had tylenol in her serum

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been receiving multiple blood transfusions, vasopressor support, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. She has a variety of medical complications, including respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has increased PEEP and worsening bilateral diffuse infiltrative process suggestive of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She is already on mechanical ventilation, and her oxygenation is being closely monitored.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's anion gap has closed from 21 to 10, indicating improvement. However, lactate levels are still elevated, indicating ongoing tissue hypoperfusion. Close monitoring of electrolytes and anion gap is required.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a recent rise in creatinine and oliguria. She is producing urine but at a low volume. Renal function should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to maintain adequate hydration and avoid nephrotoxins.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged INR and low fibrinogen levels. Vitamin K has been administered, and coagulation parameters should be closely monitored"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. He has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with hypotension, respiratory failure, and evidence of multi-organ dysfunction. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, vasopressin, and other medications. His laboratory results indicate electrolyte imbalances, elevated liver enzymes, and signs of acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could progress to delirium due to underlying conditions such as alcohol withdrawal, sepsis, or multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Septic Shock: The presence of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension raises the concern for sepsis, which can lead to septic shock if not promptly treated.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Elevated liver enzymes and a history of alcohol abuse suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause confusion and altered mental status.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine and decreased urine output indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which can lead to AKI.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 y/o woman with alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic
   cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper GI
   bleeding.
   .
   # Shock: Unclear etiology but most concerning for hypovolemic (due to
   blood loss). Other possibility includes septic/infectious from known
   UTI. Patient had obvious GI blood loss with hct down to 21 on arrival
   at OSH. Hct here has been stable in around 30 last 2 days (after 2 u
   prbcs at other hospital). Had clot in gastric fundus on initial EGD,
   repeat with grade 1 varices and gastric ulcer but no signs of active
   bleeding. Pt still has has leukocytosis which is slightly improved.
   Potential SBP ruled out, other sources include stool (c diff given
   bandemia), aspiration PNA, but no other cultures positive except for
   urine. Since other sources less likely and no other signs of infection
   or positive cx data will discontinue vanc and cipro.
   - 4 U PRBCs & 4 U [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1345**] thus far in MICU, no recent transfusions
   - CVL and arterial line placed for monitoring
   - CVP goal [**11-20**]
   - MAP goal > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   - treat uti with ceftriaxone
   - discontinue vanc/cipro since no obvious source
   - off levophed, still on vasopressin which will wean as tolerated
   - continue fluid boluses prn
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Improved ventilation and oxygenation on less
   ventilatory support. TV decreased for possible ARDS vent. PEEP had been
   increased yesterday with worsening bilateral diffuse infiltrative
   process suggestive of ARDS and lungs appear ti have improved aeration
   on today
s CXR.  Sputum cx with yeast and gram + cocci in pairs and
   chains on gram stain but op flora on cx.
   --decrease Vtidal 350
   -wean PEEP as tolerated,currently in 10 with good oxygen sats, PaO2 on
   ABG
   -serial ABGs
   -maintain off sedatyion if possible and decreased vent settings as
   tolerated
   .
   # Upper GI bleeding: EGD on arrival to the MICU demonstrated large
   blood clot in the gastric fundus but no esophageal varices (difficult
   to discern due to hypotension).  Now with no active visualized bleeding
   though some suggestion that pt is still oozing with guaiac positive
   stool.
   - cont PPI, will readdress need for octreotide PRN
   - maintain active type & cross
   - transfusion to keep crit > 25
   - AM/PM crits
   - liver following
   - hold all anticoagulation, antiinflammatories
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap. Lactate decreased to 1.3 in presence
   of renal failure.   Issue resolved.  Will readdress PRN and cont to
   trend lytes and AG.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Patient intermittently alert on arrival to
   MICU and following commands.
   - sedated, opening eyes to voice
   - continue to monitor
   - lactulose via NGT to help encephalopathy
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to hypotension, volume
   depletion.  Recent rise in Cr, now trending down with adequate UOP
   overnight.
   - trend uop & creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Coagulopathy: likely related to underlying liver disease (though
   platelets normal). INR 2.5 earlier down to 2.0 on arrival to MICU.
   continue to trend with goal < 2 for reversal of coagulopathy. Given
   vitamin K given at OSH.
   - [**Month/Year (2) **] prn for goal INR < 2
   - vitamin K 10 mg admin
   - trend coags
   - check hemolysis labs
 slightly elevated for
   - check fibrinogen/fdp with AM labs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to underlying liver disease but has
   trended down since admission, possibly secondary to liver disease,
   concern for sepsis, also may be HIT but 4T
s not satisfied so will
   defer for now and
   - follow for now
   - transfuse plt<20 or active bleed
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolved
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely related to intravascular volume depletion with
   element of cirrhosis; ADH may be playing a role with free water
   holding. Continue to trend. Improved.
   .
   # Alcohol abuse with cirrhosis: Patient arrived with tense ascites and
   is now s/p large volume tap (8 L removed). Her alcohol level on arrival
   to [**Hospital1 1**] was 229 at 1800 pm (patient's family not aware she continued
   to drink per their report). Also, the patient had tylenol in her serum
   tox (? ingestion time but could have been up to 24 hours prior).
   - SBP w/u negative
   - albumin 6 g/L replacement tonight
   - appreciate Liver input

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 y/o woman with alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic
   cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper GI
   bleeding.
   .
   # Shock: Unclear etiology but most concerning for hypovolemic (due to
   blood loss). Other possibility includes septic/infectious from known
   UTI. Patient had obvious GI blood loss with hct down to 21 on arrival
   at OSH. Hct here has been stable in around 30 last 2 days (after 2 u
   prbcs at other hospital). Had clot in gastric fundus on initial EGD,
   repeat with grade 1 varices and gastric ulcer but no signs of active
   bleeding. Pt still has has leukocytosis which is slightly improved.
   Potential SBP ruled out, other sources include stool (c diff given
   bandemia), aspiration PNA, but no other cultures positive except for
   urine. Since other sources less likely and no other signs of infection
   or positive cx data will discontinue vanc and cipro.
   - 4 U PRBCs & 4 U [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1345**] thus far in MICU, no recent transfusions
   - CVL and arterial line placed for monitoring
   - CVP goal [**11-20**]
   - MAP goal > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   - treat uti with ceftriaxone
   - treat other sources broadly with vancomycin (given multiple recent
   hospitalizations)
   - off levophed, still on vasopressin which will wean as tolerated with
   fluid boluses prn
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Improved ventilation and oxygenation on less
   ventilatory support. TV decreased. PEEP from yesterday with worsening
   bilateral diffuse infiltrative process suggestive of ARDS.  Sputum cx
   with yeast and gram + cocci in pairs and chains.
   - cover with current abx
   -decrease Vtidal ~ 40
   -wean PEEP as tolerated
   -cont ABG
   -wean sedation to fentanyl, d/c midazolam
   .
   # Upper GI bleeding: EGD on arrival to the MICU demonstrated large
   blood clot in the gastric fundus but no esophageal varices (difficult
   to discern due to hypotension).  Now with no active visualized bleeding
   though some suggestion that pt is still oozing with guaiac positive
   stool.
   - cont PPI, on 2 pressors, will readdress need for octreotide PRN
   - maintain active type & cross
   - transfusion to keep crit > 25
   - AM/PM crits
   - liver following
   - hold all anticoagulation, antiinflammatories
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap closed from 21-> 16 -> 10 on most
   recent lytes. Lactate decreased to 3 in presence of renal failure.
   Issue resolved.  Will readdress PRN and cont to trend lytes and AG.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Patient intermittently alert on arrival to
   MICU and following commands.
   - sedated, opening eyes to voice
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to hypotension, volume
   depletion.  Recent rise in Cr, but making urine.
   - trend uop & creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Coagulopathy: likely related to underlying liver disease (though
   platelets normal). INR 2.5 earlier down to 2.0 on arrival to MICU.
   continue to trend with goal < 2 for reversal of coagulopathy. Given
   vitamin K given at OSH, will repeat dose here. Fibrinogen also < 150 on
   labs from arrival to our ED. Could represent an element of DIC given
   other active problems.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] prn for goal INR < 2
   - vitamin K 10 mg admin
   - trend coags
   - check hemolysis labs
 slightly elevated for
   - check fibrinogen/fdp with AM labs
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Likely related to acidosis and renal insufficiency. No
   acute EKG changes so have not given insulin/d50 or calcium gluconate.
   - trend creatinine & potassium
   - repeat ekg with further elevations of K
   - reverse acidosis with bicarb fluids, improvement in hypotension
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely related to intravascular volume depletion with
   element of cirrhosis; ADH may be playing a role with free water
   holding. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Alcohol abuse with cirrhosis: Patient arrived with tense ascites and
   is now s/p large volume tap (8 L removed). Her alcohol level on arrival
   to [**Hospital1 1**] was 229 at 1800 pm (patient's family not aware she continued
   to drink per their report). Also, the patient had tylenol in her serum
   tox (? ingestion time but could have been up to 24 hours prior).

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise due to her condition.

1. Shock: The patient is still at risk for hypovolemic shock due to ongoing blood loss, as well as septic/infectious shock from a known urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's hemodynamic monitoring, including CVP and MAP goals, should be closely monitored.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved with ventilation and oxygenation on less ventilatory support. However, the worsening bilateral diffuse infiltrative process suggests acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient should be weaned off sedation and extubated as tolerated, and ABG monitoring should continue.

3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: Although no active bleeding was visualized during the endoscopy, the patient may still be oozing blood. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, type and crossmatch, and transfusion to maintain a critical hemoglobin level above 25 should be performed. Prophylactic therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and pressors should be continued, and the need for octreotide should be reassessed.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap has closed, and lactate levels have decreased. However, the patient still has renal failure, and close monitoring of electroly"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 y/o woman with alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic
   cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper GI
   bleeding.
   .
   # Shock: Unclear etiology but most concerning for hypovolemic (due to
   blood loss) and septic/infectious. Patient had obvious GI blood loss
   with hct down to 21 on arrival at OSH. Hct here 26.4 (after 2 u prbcs
   at other hospital). Had clot in gastric fundus on initial EGD, repeat
   with grade 1 varices and gastric ulcer bu no sogns of active bleeding.
   Pt has leukocytosis with bandemia. Potential SBP r/o, other sources
   include stool (c diff given bandemia), UTI (pan [**Last Name (un) 206**] Klebsiella from
   OSH), aspiration PNA.
   - 4 U PRBCs & 4 U [**Last Name (un) 1345**] thus far in MICU
   - CVL and arterial line placed for monitoring
   - CVP goal [**11-20**]
   - MAP goal > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   - treat uti with ceftriaxone
   - treat other sources broadly with vancomycin (given multiple recent
   hospitalizations)
   - on levophed, vasopressin, fluid boluses prn
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 increased PEEP from yesterday with worsening
   bilat diffuse infiltrative process suggestive of ARDS.  Sputum cx with
   yeast and gram + cocci in pairs and chains.
   - cover with current abx
   -decrease Vtidal ~ 40
   -wean PEEP as tolerated
   -cont ABG
   -wean sedation to fentanyl, d/c midazolam
   .
   # Upper GI bleeding: EGD on arrival to the MICU demonstrated large
   blood clot in the gastric fundus but no esophageal varices (difficult
   to discern due to hypotension).  Now with no active visualized bleeding
   though some suggestion that pt is still oozing with guaiac positive
   stool.
   - cont PPI, on 2 pressors, will readdress need for octreotide PRN
   - maintain active type & cross
   - transfusion to keep crit > 25
   - AM/PM crits

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hyperglycemia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and has undergone several interventions to stabilize her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is an increased PEEP from yesterday with worsening bilateral diffuse infiltrative process suggestive of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She has sputum cultures showing yeast and gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, indicating a possible infection.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a recent rise in creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure. This could be related to hypotension, volume depletion, or underlying liver disease.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and low fibrinogen levels, suggesting coagulopathy. This may be related to her underlying liver disease or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, likely due to acidosis and renal insufficiency. Close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent cardiac complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 y/o woman with alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic
   cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper GI
   bleeding.
   .
   # Shock: Unclear etiology but most concerning for hypovolemic (due to
   blood loss). Other possibility includes septic/infectious from known
   UTI. Patient had obvious GI blood loss with hct down to 21 on arrival
   at OSH. Hct here has been stable in around 30 last 2 days (after 2 u
   prbcs at other hospital). Had clot in gastric fundus on initial EGD,
   repeat with grade 1 varices and gastric ulcer but no signs of active
   bleeding. Pt still has has leukocytosis which is slightly improved.
   Potential SBP ruled out, other sources include stool (c diff given
   bandemia), aspiration PNA, but no other cultures positive except for
   urine. Since other sources less likely and no other signs of infection
   or positive cx data will discontinue vanc and cipro. 4 U PRBCs & 4 U
   FFP thus far in MICU, no recent transfusions, HCT stable at ~30. CVL
   and arterial line placed for monitoring. CVP goal [**11-20**]. MAP goal > 65,
   UOP > 30cc/hr. Pt pulled out A-line but as pressures have been good,
   will not replace.
   - Continue treating uti with ceftriaxone for 7 day course
   - Continue to wean off of vasopressin
   - continue fluid boluses prn
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Improved ventilation and oxygenation on less
   ventilatory support. O2 sats and respiratory status has improved after
   paracentesis yesterday. Sputum with yeast and gram + cocci in pairs and
   chains on gram stain but op flora on cx.
   -wean PEEP as tolerated,currently in 10 with good oxygen sats, PaO2 on
   ABG
   -maintain off sedatyion if possible and decreased vent settings as
   tolerated
   - trial of PSV today and discussion with family about long term
   planning for trach if does not improve
   .
   # Upper GI bleeding: EGD on arrival to the MICU demonstrated large
   blood clot in the gastric fundus but no esophageal varices (difficult
   to discern due to hypotension).  Now with no active visualized bleeding
   though some suggestion that pt is still oozing with guaiac positive
   stool. HCT has been stable x several days at ~30.
   - continue daily HCT checks, unless pt decompensates, then will send
   stat hct.
   - cont PPI, will readdress need for octreotide PRN
   - maintain active type & cross
   - liver following
   - hold all anticoagulation, antiinflammatories
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap. Lactate decreased to 1.3 in presence
   of renal failure.   Issue resolved.  Will readdress PRN and cont to
   trend lytes and AG.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Patient intermittently alert on arrival to
   MICU and following commands. Sedation is off except for PRN. Lactulose
   30mg NGT TID started yesterday, may improve MS with time.
   - watch for signs of EtOH withdrawl
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to hypotension, volume
   depletion.  Recent rise in Cr, now trending down with adequate UOP
   overnight. Cr now 0.9. Resolved.
   - continue to follow uop & creatinine
   .
   # Coagulopathy: likely related to underlying liver disease (though
   platelets normal). INR 2.5 earlier down to 2.0 on arrival to MICU.
   continue to trend with goal < 2 for reversal of coagulopathy. Given
   vitamin K given at OSH.
   - ffp prn for goal INR < 2
   - vitamin K 10 mg admin
   - trend coags
   - check hemolysis labs
 slightly elevated for
   - check fibrinogen/fdp with AM labs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to underlying liver disease but has
   trended down since admission, possibly secondary to liver disease,
   concern for sepsis, also may be HIT but 4T
s not satisfied so will
   defer for now.
   - follow for now
   - transfuse plt<20 or active bleed
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolved
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely related to intravascular volume depletion with
   element of cirrhosis; ADH may be playing a role with free water
   holding. Continue to trend. Improved.
   .
   # Alcohol abuse with cirrhosis: Patient arrived with tense ascites and
   had an initial large volume tap (8 L removed). Her alcohol level on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 1**] was 229 at 1800 pm (patient's family not aware she
   continued to drink per their report). Also, the patient had tylenol in
   her serum tox (? ingestion time but could have been up to 24 hours
   prior). Initial labs for SBP w/u negative. Had albumin 6 g/L
   replacement tonight . n-acetylcysteine completed. Paracentesis
   yesterday 4.8 L, neg for SBP, w improved respiratory status and CXR.
   Still oozing ascitic fluid from TAP site.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including:
1. Altered mental status: The patient is intermittently alert and follows some commands. Sedation is being used on a PRN basis, and lactulose has been started to improve her mental status over time.
2. Shock: The etiology of the shock is unclear, but hypovolemic shock due to blood loss is a concern. There is also a possibility of septic/infectious shock due to a known urinary tract infection.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient had a large blood clot in the gastric fundus on initial endoscopy, but no active bleeding was observed. However, she may still be oozing blood as evidenced by guaiac-positive stool.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved after paracentesis, which suggests relief of pressure from ascites. She is now maintaining better oxygenation and ventilation on less ventilatory support.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The anion gap metabolic acidosis has resolved, and lactate levels have decreased.
6. Acute renal failure: This condition is likely related to hypotension and volume depletion. Creatinine levels have improved with adequate urine output.

   # Shock: Unclear etiology but most concerning for hypovolemic (due to
   blood loss). Other possibility includes septic/infectious from known
   UTI. Patient had obvious GI blood loss with hct down to 21 on arrival
   at OSH. Hct here has been stable in around 30 last 2 days (after 2 u
   prbcs at other hospital). Had clot in gastric fundus on initial EGD,
   repeat with grade 1 varices and gastric ulcer but no signs of active
   bleeding. Pt still has has leukocytosis which is slightly improved.
   Potential SBP ruled out, other sources include stool (c diff given
   bandemia), aspiration PNA, but no other cultures positive except for
   urine. Since other sources less likely and no other signs of infection
   or positive cx data will discontinue vanc and cipro.

   # Upper GI bleeding: EGD on arrival to the MICU demonstrated large
   blood clot in the gastric fundus but no esophageal varices (difficult
   to discern due to hypotension).  Now with no active visualized bleeding
   though some suggestion that pt is still oozing with guaiac positive
   stool.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's condition has been complex and required close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient presented with shock, likely due to hypovolemia from blood loss. There is also a possibility of septic shock secondary to a urinary tract infection. The patient received blood transfusions and fluid boluses to maintain adequate volume status.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required mechanical ventilation initially but has improved over time. The ventilator settings were adjusted to optimize oxygenation and ventilation. There were concerns for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but her lungs showed improvement with increased aeration on chest X-ray.
3. Upper GI Bleeding: The patient had a significant upper gastrointestinal bleed, and an endoscopy revealed a large blood clot in the gastric fundus. Although no active bleeding was seen during the endoscopy, the patient may still be oozing blood, as indicated by guaiac-positive stool.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient initially presented with anion gap metabolic acidosis, which has since resolved. Close monitoring of electrolytes and anion gap is necessary to prevent recurrence.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient intermittently had altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephal"

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, alcohol abuse, hypotension, respiratory failure, and shock. The patient underwent a paracentesis, which was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). An ultrasound revealed reversed flow in the main portal vein, indicating portal hypertension. The patient has large ascites and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the pressure-controlled ventilation mode (PCV). His sedation has been increased due to agitation, and he is receiving vasopressin, midazolam, and fentanyl. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 118/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal potassium, slightly low sodium, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's daily fluid balance shows a significant fluid input and output, with a negative balance of 4,480 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, MMV/PSV/AutoFlow ventilation mode, and supplemental oxygen. The patient's ABG results indicate a slightly alkalotic pH, normal oxygenation, and adequate ventilation. Physical examination findings are not documented.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 y/o woman with alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic
   cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper GI
   bleeding.
   .
   # Shock: Unclear etiology but most concerning for hypovolemic (due to
   blood loss). Other possibility includes septic/infectious from known
   UTI. Patient had obvious GI blood loss with hct down to 21 on arrival
   at OSH. Hct here has been stable in around 30 last 2 days (after 2 u
   prbcs at other hospital). Had clot in gastric fundus on initial EGD,
   repeat with grade 1 varices and gastric ulcer but no signs of active
   bleeding. Pt still has has leukocytosis which is slightly improved.
   Potential SBP ruled out, other sources include stool (c diff given
   bandemia), aspiration PNA, but no other cultures positive except for
   urine. Since other sources less likely and no other signs of infection
   or positive cx data will discontinue vanc and cipro. 4 U PRBCs & 4 U
   FFP thus far in MICU, no recent transfusions, HCT stable at ~30. CVL
   and arterial line placed for monitoring. CVP goal [**11-20**]. MAP goal > 65,
   UOP > 30cc/hr. Pt pulled out A-line but as pressures have been good,
   will not replace.
   - Continue treating uti with ceftriaxone for 7 day course
   - Continue to wean off of vasopressin
   - continue fluid boluses prn
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Improved ventilation and oxygenation on less
   ventilatory support. O2 sats and respiratory status has improved after
   paracentesis yesterday. Sputum with yeast and gram + cocci in pairs and
   chains on gram stain but op flora on cx.
   -wean PEEP as tolerated,currently in 10 with good oxygen sats, PaO2 on
   ABG
   -maintain off sedatyion if possible and decreased vent settings as
   tolerated
   - trial of PSV today and discussion with family about long term
   planning for trach if does not improve
   .
   # Upper GI bleeding: EGD on arrival to the MICU demonstrated large
   blood clot in the gastric fundus but no esophageal varices (difficult
   to discern due to hypotension).  Now with no active visualized bleeding
   though some suggestion that pt is still oozing with guaiac positive
   stool. HCT has been stable x several days at ~30.
   - continue daily HCT checks, unless pt decompensates, then will send
   stat hct.
   - cont PPI, will readdress need for octreotide PRN
   - maintain active type & cross
   - liver following
   - hold all anticoagulation, antiinflammatories
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap. Lactate decreased to 1.3 in presence
   of renal failure.   Issue resolved.  Will readdress PRN and cont to
   trend lytes and AG.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Patient intermittently alert on arrival to
   MICU and following commands. Sedation is off except for PRN. Lactulose
   30mg NGT TID started yesterday, may improve MS with time.
   - watch for signs of EtOH withdrawl
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely related to hypotension, volume
   depletion.  Recent rise in Cr, now trending down with adequate UOP
   overnight. Cr now 0.9. Resolved.
   - continue to follow uop & creatinine
   .
   # Coagulopathy: likely related to underlying liver disease (though
   platelets normal). INR 2.5 earlier down to 2.0 on arrival to MICU.
   continue to trend with goal < 2 for reversal of coagulopathy. Given
   vitamin K given at OSH.
   - ffp prn for goal INR < 2
   - vitamin K 10 mg admin
   - trend coags
   - check hemolysis labs
 slightly elevated for
   - check fibrinogen/fdp with AM labs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to underlying liver disease but has
   trended down since admission, possibly secondary to liver disease,
   concern for sepsis, also may be HIT but 4T
s not satisfied so will
   defer for now.
   - follow for now
   - transfuse plt<20 or active bleed
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolved
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely related to intravascular volume depletion with
   element of cirrhosis; ADH may be playing a role with free water
   holding. Continue to trend. Improved.
   .
   # Alcohol abuse with cirrhosis: Patient arrived with tense ascites and
   had an initial large volume tap (8 L removed). Her alcohol level on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 1**] was 229 at 1800 pm (patient's family not aware she
   continued to drink per their report). Also, the patient had tylenol in
   her serum tox (? ingestion time but could have been up to 24 hours
   prior). Initial labs for SBP w/u negative. Had albumin 6 g/L
   replacement tonight . n-acetylcysteine completed. Paracentesis
   yesterday 4.8 L, neg for SBP, w improved respiratory status and CXR.
   Still oozing ascitic fluid from TAP site.
   - Continue folate/thiamine/mvi daily

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Shock: The patient's initial presentation included shock, likely due to hypovolemia secondary to blood loss. Other possibilities include septic/infectious causes from a known urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in the MICU.

2. Upper GI bleeding: The patient had a large blood clot in the gastric fundus without active bleeding observed during endoscopy. There was also evidence of ongoing oozing, as indicated by guaiac positive stool. HCT has been stable at around 30 for several days. 

3. Respiratory failure: The patient showed improvement in ventilation and oxygenation on less ventilatory support after a paracentesis yesterday. Sputum culture revealed yeast and gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, but oral flora on culture.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient had anion gap metabolic acidosis, which has resolved. Lactate levels decreased to 1.3 in the presence of renal failure. 

5. Altered mental status: The patient intermittently displayed alertness and was following commands. Sedation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been extubated and is tolerating spontaneous breathing well. She has been weaned off vasopressin and is showing improvement in her condition. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 95/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg, with a stable blood volume and no signs of hypovolemia. Fluid balance is positive with a total input of 578 mL and output of 3235 mL, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation.

The patient's respiratory support has been transitioned from invasive ventilation to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), and she is tolerating it well. Her ABG results indicate a respiratory acidosis with compensated metabolic acidosis.

Physical examination reveals scleral icterus, jaundice, and mild peripheral edema. The patient has distended abdomen with positive bowel sounds, dullness to percussion with fluid wave, and reducible umbilical hernias. Laboratory results show elevated leukocyte count, liver enzymes, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 y/o woman with alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic
   cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper GI
   bleeding.
   .
   # Shock: RESOLVED. Unclear etiology but most concerning for hypovolemic
   (due to blood loss). Other possibility includes septic/infectious from
   known UTI. Patient had obvious GI blood loss with hct down to 21 on
   arrival at OSH. Hct here has been stable in around 30 last 3 days
   (after 2 u prbcs at other hospital). Had clot in gastric fundus on
   initial EGD, repeat with grade 1 varices and gastric ulcer but no signs
   of active bleeding. Pt still has has leukocytosis which has trended
   steadily downwrad. Potential SBP ruled out, other sources include stool
   (c diff given bandemia), aspiration PNA, but no other cultures positive
   except for urine. Since other sources less likely and no other signs of
   infection or positive cx data vanc and cipro were d/c
d. 4 U PRBCs & 4
   U FFP thus far in MICU, no recent transfusions, HCT stable at ~30. CVL
   and arterial line placed for monitoring. Pt pulled out A-line but as
   pressures have been good, will not replace. Extubated and doing well on
   RA. Alert oriented. VSS.
   - Continue treating uti with ceftriaxone, on 5 of 7 day course
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Resolved. O2 sats and respiratory status has
   improved after paracentesis, did well on PSV yesterday and was
   extubated. Sputum with yeast and gram + cocci in pairs and chains on
   gram stain but op flora on cx.
   -doing well on RA
   .
   # Upper GI bleeding: EGD on arrival to the MICU demonstrated large
   blood clot in the gastric fundus but no esophageal varices (difficult
   to discern due to hypotension).  HCT has been stable x several days at
   ~30, however platelets still low and some blood in urine.
   - continue daily HCT checks
   - cont PPI, will readdress need for octreotide PRN
   - maintain active type & cross
   - liver following
   - hold all anticoagulation, antiinflammatories
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Anion gap. Lactate decreased to 1.3 in
   presence of renal failure.  Will readdress PRN and cont to trend lytes
   and AG.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Appears mostly resolved. Patient
   intermittently alert on arrival to MICU and following commands.
   Sedation is off except for PRN. Lactulose 30mg NGT TID started two days
   ago. Pt now off sedation and extubated. Alert and oriented x 3 and
   appears likely to be at her baseline.
   - watch for signs of EtOH withdrawl
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Likely related to hypotension, volume
   depletion.  Recent rise in Cr, now trending down with adequate UOP
   overnight. Cr now 0.6. Resolved.
   - continue to follow uop & creatinine
   .
   # Coagulopathy: likely related to underlying liver disease (though
   platelets normal). INR 2.5 earlier down to 2.0 on arrival to MICU.
   continue to trend with goal < 2 for reversal of coagulopathy. Given
   vitamin K given at OSH.
   - ffp prn for goal INR < 2
   - vitamin K 10 mg admin
   - trend coags
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to underlying liver disease but has
   trended down since admission, concern for sepsis, also may be HIT but
   4T
s not satisfied so will defer HIT antibody for now. Improved
   slightly today to 50 from 39.
   - transfuse plt<20 or active bleed
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolved
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved. Likely related to intravascular volume
   depletion with element of cirrhosis; ADH may be playing a role with
   free water holding. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Alcohol abuse with cirrhosis: Patient arrived with tense ascites and
   had an initial large volume tap (8 L removed). Her alcohol level on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 1**] was 229 at 1800 pm (patient's family not aware she
   continued to drink per their report). Also, the patient had tylenol in
   her serum tox (? ingestion time but could have been up to 24 hours
   prior). Initial labs for SBP w/u negative. Had albumin 6 g/L
   replacement tonight . n-acetylcysteine completed. Paracentesis
   yesterday 4.8 L, neg for SBP, w improved respiratory status and CXR.
   Still oozing ascitic fluid from TAP site. [**Name (NI) **] pt

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse and presumed alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted with altered mental status, shock, and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has experienced several medical complications during her stay in the ICU, including respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and alcohol abuse with cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required invasive ventilation but has since been extubated and is tolerating spontaneous breathing well.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient had anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to renal failure, which has since resolved.
3. Altered mental status: The patient initially presented with altered mental status but has shown improvement and is now alert and oriented.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient likely experienced acute renal failure related to hypotension and volume depletion, but it has since resolved.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged INR likely due to liver disease, and she requires continued monitoring and potential administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for reversal of coagulopathy.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, possibly due to liver disease and sepsis. Platelet transfusion may be necessary if the count"
