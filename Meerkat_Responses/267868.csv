   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   HYPOTENSION
   ACUTE RENAL FAIULRE
   ACIDOSIS
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
   ANEMIA
   =========================
   Patient with evidence of probable severe infection with marked
   leuckocytosis and hypotension. Acute renal failure likely due to ATN.
   CVP is 13; would continue fluids for now as we try to reduce/eliminate
   phenylephrine. Once a-line in place, monitor pulsse pressure with
   respiratory cycle to further assess intravascular volume. Patient
   getting repeat ultrasound to look for evidence of ascites and
   hydronephrosis. Smear negative for schistocytes arguing against TTP.
   With hx of low back pain, concern for a retroperitoneal process/pelvic
   sepsis. Bacterial colonic infection also a consideration. Cultures
   sent. Patient on broad spectrum antibiotics.Will probably need CT but
   would like to avoid IV contrast to minimize chances of permanent renal
   failure.
   Acidosis a mixed picture of anion and nonanion gap acidosis. Diarrhea
   and treatment with NS likely contributing to the nongap acidosis. Use
   LR or D5W with bicarb rather than normal saline for additional volume
   resuscitation. Surgery and gyn consulted. Need to be careful giving
   bicarb with hypokalemia; would not give any until K is above 3. Will
   need to give potassium with frequent checks; given oliguria, we don't
   want to overshoot potassium replacement. Renal should be consulted.
   Anemia likely related to her recent pregnancy and marrow suppression
   from acute infection. Not at transfusion threshold. Smear negative for
   evidence of intravacuilar hemolysis. No evidnce of GI bleeding at this
   time or by hx. Check stool guaiac.
   Thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology; probalby related to sepsis.
   Values rising now making ITP/TTP less likely. Continue to monitor. As
   above, no evidence of intravascular consumption.
   LFT's elevated. Ultraslund to assess for obstruction. Transaminitis
   probably related to hypotension.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with several medical complications. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low and requires vasopressor support with medications such as phenylephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin. The blood pressure values indicate a fluctuating state, with efforts being made to wean off the vasopressors.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient has a rising creatinine level, minimal urine output, and evidence of acidosis. This suggests impaired kidney function, which may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal replacement therapy may be necessary.

3. Acidosis: The patient's blood gas analysis shows acidosis, likely a mixed picture of anion and non-anion gap acidosis. The use of normal saline for resuscitation and treatment with bicarbonate is contributing to the non-anion gap acidosis. Appropriate fluid management with lactated Ringer's (LR) or D5W with bicarb should be considered.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is of unclear etiology. It is probable that the thrombocytopenia is related to sepsis. Close monitoring is required as the platelet count is rising, making immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purp"
