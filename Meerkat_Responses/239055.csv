","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis (AS), previous mitral valve replacement (MVR), and atrial flutter. The patient presents with acute on chronic renal failure and worsening lower extremity edema.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 79 bpm with a normal range of 72-93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/55 mmHg to 76/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with inspiration, oxygen saturation of 95%, and an atrial flutter heart rhythm.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%. The patient's B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is increased from the previous value on 12/8/2166. To improve forward flow and encourage diuresis, milrinone has been initiated at 0.25 mcg/kg/min. Neo has been added to counteract the hypotensive effects of milrinone.

The patient also has a history of CAD with ST depressions in leads I and aVL. No complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath have been reported, and the patient's cardiac enzymes (CKs) are flat with trending-down Tn's from the last admission. The patient is currently on aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker medications for CAD management, with lisinopril being held due to acute renal failure.

The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is indicated by an improvement in creatinine from admission levels of 4.9 to 4.5 (baseline 2.7). The patient's fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and feurea are indeterminate at 1.8 and 35.5, respectively. Lisinopril has been held for acute renal failure, and the patient's urine output (UOP) and creatinine levels will be monitored on milrinone.

The patient's atrial flutter is being managed with coumadin, with an INR subtherapeutic at 1.3. The goal INR is 2-3, and the patient will continue to be monitored daily. Telemetry monitoring and beta-blocker for rate control will also be continued.

The patient's hypertension is being managed with a beta-blocker. Hyperlipidemia is being treated with a statin.

   [**2166-12-8**]. Pt being diuresed with Milrinone and Lasix gtt.  LOS is -4.3L
   so far.
   - Cont milrinone at 0.37mcg/kg/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] likely stop this shortly as pt
   appears to be clinically much less volume overloaded.
   - Continue neo gtt to counteract hypotensive effects of milrinone.
   Attempt to wean today.
   - Control HR with Metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue lasix drip while monitoring UOP and Cr
   - continue digoxin, level acceptable
   - fluid restrict; low salt diet
   - continue to hold lisinopril in setting of ARF

   3.1 today (Baseline 2.7). Likely secondary to poor forward flow. FENA
   and Feurea indeterminate at 1.8, 35.5.
   - hold lisinopril for ARF
   - No eos in urine; unlikely to be AIN
   - monitor UO and creatinine on milrinone

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, prior mitral valve replacement, and atrial flutter. He presents with acute on chronic renal failure and worsening lower extremity edema. 

The patient's current medications include Coumadin (warfarin) for atrial flutter, digoxin, and various other medications for his cardiac condition. He has allergies to Vasotec (enalapril maleate) and niacin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/58 to 108/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient has a history of a 0.5 x 0.5 cm Grade II ulcer on the coccyx with a yellow base and surrounding margin of erythema that blanches. Wound care has been initiated.

The patient's labs show elevated BUN and creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased edema in the extremities, irregular rhythm consistent with atrial flutter, and no jugular venous distention. 

The patient's plan includes continuing diuresis with milrinone and Lasix, controlling heart rate with metoprolol"

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis (AS), previous mitral valve replacement (MVR), and atrial flutter. He presents with acute-on-chronic renal failure and worsening lower extremity edema. The patient's estimated ejection fraction (EF) is 15-20%, and his B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level has increased from 6529 to 6744.

The patient is being treated with milrinone and Lasix drips. The milrinone dose will be decreased to 0.37 mcg/kg/min as the patient appears to be less volume overloaded. Neo will continue to be given to counteract the hypotensive effects of milrinone. An attempt will be made to wean off the medication today.

The patient's heart rate will be controlled with metoprolol 25mg PO BID. Lasix drip will be continued while monitoring urine output (UOP) and creatinine levels. Digoxin levels are acceptable, so it will be continued. The patient is advised to follow a low-salt diet and restrict fluids. Lisinopril will be held due to acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient also has a history of CAD, with ST depressions in leads I and aVL. There are no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath, and cardiac enzymes (CKs"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, prior mitral valve replacement, and atrial flutter. He presents with acute on chronic renal failure and worsening lower extremity edema, which is now resolving. The patient's estimated ejection fraction (EF) is 15-20%. His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, indicating systolic heart failure. He is currently being treated with milrinone and Lasix to manage fluid overload. 

The patient has a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. His current symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain, and lower extremity edema. His vital signs include a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/45 to 117/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is alert and oriented, with no signs of distress.

The patient's lab results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, elevated potassium levels at 5.3 mEq/L, and decreased creatinine levels from 4.9 to 2.8 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal range. 

Plan:
1. Continue milrinone at 0.37 mcg"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 15-20%), coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis (AS), previous mitral valve replacement (MVR), and atrial flutter. He presented with acute on chronic renal failure and worsening lower extremity edema. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 88 bpm (76-115 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 98/50 mmHg to 136/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (12-27 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently being treated with milrinone and Lasix drips.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an estimated ejection fraction of 15-20% and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels indicate ongoing heart failure. The use of milrinone and Lasix may help improve cardiac output and reduce fluid overload, but careful monitoring is necessary to avoid hypotension and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The presence of ST depressions in the I and avL leads suggest ongoing ischemia. Continuing the current medication regimen, including aspirin, statin, and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis (AS), prior mitral valve replacement (MVR), and atrial flutter. He presents with acute-on-chronic renal failure and worsening lower extremity edema, which improved with milrinone. The patient has been receiving various treatments including milrinone, lasix, neo, bumex, metoprolol, digoxin, and coumadin. His derm biopsy shows bullous pemphigoid.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute-on-chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's cardiomyopathy with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% may lead to CHF exacerbations. His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated.
2. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has CAD, which could result in angina or myocardial infarction if there is inadequate blood flow to the heart muscles.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, a type of supraventricular tachycardia. It can cause palpitations, dizziness, and an increased risk of stroke if not properly managed.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, which could be due to poor forward"
