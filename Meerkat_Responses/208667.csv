   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old with afib w/PCM, recent acute on chronic SDH, hip fx 6
   weeks ago who presents with failure to thrive and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: The patient is mildly intermittently hypoxic, now 98% on
   2L.  Given the degree of lung collapse, it is difficult r/o PNA but pt
   has no fever or WBC. CT scan reveals a very large unilateral effusion
   of unclear etiology at this point -mucus pluging? Parapneumonic [**1-25**]
   aspiration? Given relatively good oxygenation, will defer thoracentesis
   until tomorrow.
   - thoracentesis tomorrow
   - repeat echo
   - add on BNP
   - Vanc/zosyn as HCAP/aspiration is most likely reason for effusion
   .
   # Altered mental status: Per family, mental status is slightly worse
   over the past week. [**1-25**] mild hypoxia? Worsening SDH (missed f/u head CT
   last week)? Pain? Stool impaction? No evidence of fever or leukocytosis
   to suggest infection. UA neg. Electrolytes nl- just mildly
   hypernatremia, ? past hx of hyperosmolar hypernatremia.
   - Vanc/Zosyn
   -head CT
   - f/u cultures
   - follow sodium
   - pain control tyelnol
   - bowel regimen

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with atrial fibrillation, chronic subdural hematoma, and a history of hip fracture. He presents with failure to thrive, hypoxia, and a unilateral lung effusion. His mental status has slightly worsened over the past week, and he is experiencing mild abdominal discomfort. The patient has altered mental status, intermittent hypoxia, worsening subdural hematoma, and possible aspiration pneumonia. He also has a history of torsades de pointes, hip fracture, and stool impaction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's intermittent hypoxia and unilateral lung effusion raise concerns for aspiration pneumonia. This is further supported by his risk factors, including advanced age and altered mental status.
2. Worsening Subdural Hematoma: The patient has a chronic subdural hematoma that is stable but requires close monitoring. Failure to manage this condition appropriately may lead to further neurological deterioration.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient is mildly hypernatremic, which can be potentially dangerous if not corrected. It may contribute to confusion and other neurological symptoms.
4. Stool Impaction: The patient has abdominal discomfort and a history of stool impaction. If not managed properly, this can lead to bowel ischemia, perforation, or sepsis.
5. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and torsades de"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old individual with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent acute-on-chronic subdural hematoma, hip fracture six weeks ago, presenting with failure to thrive and hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing intermittent hypoxia, with an oxygen saturation level of 99% on 2L. There is a large unilateral effusion of unclear etiology, but it is most likely a parapneumonic effusion due to pneumonia or aspiration. Thoracentesis has been performed, and blood cultures will be repeated. An echocardiogram will also be repeated due to the patient's prior ejection fraction of 30%.

The patient's mental status has slightly worsened over the past week, with possible causes including worsening SDH, pain, stool impaction, or an infectious process. Neurological checks will be done every two hours, and a repeat head CT will be performed in 24 hours. The patient is on Vanc/Zosyn for infection control, and pain control with Tylenol will be provided as needed. A bowel regimen will be continued, and the patient will undergo repeat echo and thoracentesis. Sedating medications will be held, and sodium levels will be monitored.

The patient's heart rate is 100, and torsades were observed during the last admission. Metoprolol has been changed from 25mg daily to 12.5mg due to ease of titration. QTc prolonging medications will be avoided, and the patient will be monitored on tele.

The patient previously had a stool impaction, which has now resolved. A bowel regimen will continue to be administered. The patient also has a history of hip fracture, for which pain control with Tylenol will be provided.

Prophylaxis measures include a bowel regimen, holding heparin sc until a negative head CT is obtained, pneumoboots, aspiration precautions, ground solids, and PIVs. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and disposition is to remain in the ICU for now.

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (20 Gauge), prophylaxis measures such as DVT boots and stress ulcer prophylaxis, and comments regarding family meetings and consent signed."

   has no fever or WBC. CT scan reveals a very large unilateral effusion
   of unclear etiology, however given the time course this is most likely
   conistent with parapneumonic effusion due to PNA / aspiration.   Much
   less likely to be secondary to CHF, but will repeat TTE due to prior EF

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   I have seen and examined Mr [**Known lastname 11339**] and concur with the note above.
   His mental status is improved with hydration and he continues to have
   features of a large right sided pleural effusion but stable O2
   requirements. He will need a thoracentesis provided BP/ HR are stable
   and he is somewhat co-operative for the procedure. I suspect this is a
   parapneumonic effusion given that his CXR was clear in the right lung
   filed in [**9-1**]. We will continue strict aspiration precautions and have
   a PICC lined placed for the eventuality of TPN until S/S has been
   reassessed and he is safe to eat.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, and chronic subdural hematoma. He presents with failure to thrive and hypoxia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 92/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 2L nasal cannula. The patient has a large unilateral pleural effusion of unclear etiology, but is likely due to parapneumonic effusion secondary to pneumonia or aspiration. There are no signs of congestive heart failure. The patient's mental status is slightly worse over the past week, and possible causes include worsening subdural hematoma, pain, stool impaction, or an infectious process. The patient has a history of hip fracture, for which he is taking Tylenol for pain. He also has a history of torsades de pointes. The patient's laboratory results show elevated BUN and creatinine levels, low albumin level, and abnormal coagulation profile. The patient is currently receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy for suspected healthcare-associated pneumonia and aspiration. The plan includes repeating head CT in 24 hours, thoracentesis, and repeat echo. Code status is DNR/DNI, and disposition is ICU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening subdural hematoma:"

   24 Hour Events:
   CC:[**CC Contact Info 11327**]   .
   HPI: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old with tachy-brady w/PCM, recent acute on
   chronic SDH, hip fx 6 weeks ago who presents with failure to thrive and
   hypoxia. Per ED report and NH notes, patient was 92% on RA at the NH.
   He has lost 15-20 lbs in the past 6 weeks with poor PO intake. Per
   family history, his mental status prior to recent hospitalizations was
   good, able to converse, visiting friends. Since hip fracture, his
   mental status has decreased, frequently disoriented but intermittently
   answering questions. However, the son reports that his mental status
   seems to have worsened over the past week and that he seems to be
   grimacing in pain as well.
   .
   Of note his was admitted from [**Date range (2) 11311**] for right hip fracture,
   SHD and an episode of torsades. Torsades may have been due to
   florouquinolones, which were subsequently avoided. EP also increased
   demand pacing to 80 and pt was started on metoprolol.  His subdural
   hematomas were followed on serial HCT and were found to be stable.
   There was also a concern for aspiration pneumonitis, although S/S eval
   cleared the pt for thicked fluids but was concerned for aspiraton.
   .
   In the ED: He was found to he in afib at 112 w/o ischemic changes,
   slightly  elevated trop at 0.04. Cardiology consulted w/o recommended
   no intervention. CT abd noted a large amount of stool and very large
   left effusion with lung collapse. He was given Zosyn and Levofloxacin.
   Initially his lactate was 3.9 but improved with one liter NS to 2.0.

The patient presents with failure to thrive, hypoxia, and altered mental status. 

The patient's medical history includes a recent hip fracture, for which he was admitted previously. He also had an episode of torsades de pointes and was treated with Zosyn and Levofloxacin. He has been on metoprolol ER 25mg daily.

The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 109/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His neurological status is described as drowsy and grimacing in pain, not following commands or answering questions.

The patient has a large pleural effusion on the left side, which is of unclear etiology. The plan is to defer thoracentesis until tomorrow and repeat echo. His mental status has been worsening over the past week, and there is concern for worsening subdural hematoma. A head CT has been ordered, along with further cultures and follow-up on sodium levels.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated BNP levels at 9319, potassium repletion, and other electrolyte imbalances. His WBC count is slightly"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old with afib w/PCM, recent acute on chronic SDH, hip fx 6
   weeks ago who presents with failure to thrive and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: The patient is mildly intermittently hypoxic, now 96-99% on
   2L.  Given the degree of lung collapse, it is difficult r/o PNA but pt
   has no fever or WBC. CT scan reveals a very large unilateral effusion
   of unclear etiology, however given the time course this is most likely
   conistent with parapneumonic effusion due to PNA / aspiration.   Much
   less likely to be secondary to CHF, but will repeat TTE due to prior EF
   of 30%.  Malignancy is also a possibility.
   - Diagnostic thoracentesis during this hospitalization
   -F/u Blood cultures
   -Urine culture
   - f/u TTE today
   - Vanc/zosyn as HCAP/aspiration is most likely reason for effusion (Day
   3)
   .
   # Altered mental status: Per family, mental status is slightly worse
   over the past week. Possible causes are worsening SDH vs pain vs. stool
   impaction vs. infectious process. No electrolyte disturbances at this
   point.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn above
   - Hold CT today due to pt. agitation, stable neuro exam
   -hold Aspirin, neuro checks q2hours
   - f/u cultures
   - follow sodium
   - pain control with Tylenol PRN
   - bowel regimen
   - f/u TTE
   - Thoracentesis as above
   -Hold sedating meds
   .
   # Afib/ arrythmias: HR 100 now; torsades on last admission
   - change toprol 25mg daily to metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] for ease of
   titration
   - avoid QTc prolonging medications
   - monitor on Tele

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old individual with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent acute on chronic subdural hematoma, hip fracture 6 weeks ago, and presenting with failure to thrive and hypoxia. The patient's current condition includes mild intermittent hypoxia, difficulty ruling out pneumonia, a very large unilateral effusion of unclear etiology, and altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing mild intermittent hypoxia, which can be caused by pneumonia or aspiration. Further diagnostic thoracentesis and blood cultures are planned to identify the cause of the unilateral effusion.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is slightly worse over the past week. Possible causes include worsening subdural hematoma, pain, stool impaction, or an infectious process. Continuing current medications and monitoring electrolyte disturbances are recommended.

3. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and torsades de pointes was observed on the last admission. To prevent QTc prolongation, medications that can cause it should be avoided, and the patient is being monitored on Tele.

4. Stool Impaction: The patient previously had stool impaction, but it has been resolved. The bowel regimen should continue to prevent recurrence.

5. Hip Fracture: The patient had a hip fracture 6 weeks ago, and pain management with Ty"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old individual with atrial fibrillation and pulmonary edema, presenting with failure to thrive and hypoxia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing several medical complications.

1. Hypoxia: The patient is mildly intermittently hypoxic, with an oxygen saturation level of 99% on 2L. A large unilateral effusion has been identified on the CT scan, which is of unclear etiology. This effusion could potentially be due to a parapneumonic effusion secondary to pneumonia or aspiration. A thoracentesis has been planned, and blood cultures will be repeated. An echocardiogram (echo) will also be repeated, considering the patient's prior ejection fraction of 30%. Antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) have been started for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has slightly worsened over the past week. Possible causes include worsening subdural hematoma, pain, stool impaction, or an infectious process. The neurosurgeon has recommended a repeat head CT in 24 hours. Neurologic checks will be done every 2 hours. Cultures will be followed up, and sodium levels will be monitored. Pain control with Tylenol will be provided as needed, and a bowel regimen will be continued. Another echo will be repeated, and a thoracentesis will be performed"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old with afib w/PCM, recent acute on chronic SDH, hip fx 6
   weeks ago who presents with failure to thrive and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: The patient is mildly intermittently hypoxic, now 98% on
   2L.  Given the degree of lung collapse, it is difficult r/o PNA but pt
   has no fever or WBC. CT scan reveals a very large unilateral effusion
   of unclear etiology at this point -mucus pluging? Parapneumonic [**1-25**]
   aspiration? Given relatively good oxygenation, will defer thoracentesis
   until tomorrow.
   - thoracentesis tomorrow
   - repeat echo
   - add on BNP
   - Vanc/zosyn as HCAP/aspiration is most likely reason for effusion
   .
   # Altered mental status: Per family, mental status is slightly worse
   over the past week. [**1-25**] mild hypoxia? Worsening SDH (missed f/u head CT
   last week)? Pain? Stool impaction? No evidence of fever or leukocytosis
   to suggest infection. UA neg. Electrolytes nl- just mildly
   hypernatremia, ? past hx of hyperosmolar hypernatremia.
   - Vanc/Zosyn

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old individual with a history of atrial fibrillation with pulmonary edema, recent acute on chronic subdural hematoma, and a hip fracture that occurred six weeks ago. The patient presents with failure to thrive and hypoxia.

The patient has been started on NPO due to concerns for aspiration, and speech and swallow evaluation is required. Pneumoboots have been placed, and a PICC line has been inserted. The patient received IV fluid boluses twice for hypotension and low urine output. An echo, thoracentesis, and repeat head CT have been planned.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 91 bpm with a range of 82-94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/82 mmHg to 132/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular paced.

The patient's physical examination reveals that they are awake but grimacing, very thin, and the neck is supple without jugular venous distention. The patient has absent lung sounds on the left side and diminished lung sounds on the right side. There are no crackles or labored breathing noted. The abdomen is firm, lumpy, and mildly tender with no masses or organomegaly. There is a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with chronic subdural hematoma, large right pleural effusion, small left effusion, and congestive heart failure (ejection fraction ~30%). He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing dyspnea. The patient is unable to provide a history as he is only oriented to his name. He has no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/62 to 132/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications including lorazepam, metoprolol, and other ICU medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and inability to protect his airway may increase the risk of aspiration, leading to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Pleural effusion: The large right pleural effusion could potentially worsen, leading to respiratory distress and compromised oxygenation.
3. Congestive heart failure exacerbation: The patient's low ejection fraction indicates impaired cardiac function, and further deterioration could result in congestive heart failure exacerbation.
4. Subdural hematoma progression: Although currently stable from a neurologic standpoint, there is a risk of the subdural hematoma worsening and causing neurological complications.
5. Delirium:"
