   Assessment and Plan
   76 year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung cancer
   who presented to OSH with syncope and black stool x 2 without clear
   source of bleed on EGD, now transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for enteroscopy and
   colonoscopy.
   .
   # GIB:  Given black stool, likely upper source.  As outlined above,
   initial EGD showed nonbleeding duodenal ulcer, but repeat scope showed
   duodenitis without evidence of ulceration.  Given GIB with HD
   instability (hypotensive, tachy, requiring 3 u prbcs), seems unlikely
   to be from sources visualized.  Thus, may likely be from small bowel
   AVM vs. ulceration distal to segments scoped.  Given no BRBPR, seems
   less likely lower source, but right sided colonic source is certainly
   possible.  Prepped already for [**Last Name (un) **] at [**Hospital3 1959**].  Currently HD
   stable.
   - ensure patient is clear
   - NPO p MN for enteroscopy and colonoscopy
   - maintain 2 PIVs
   - monitor q6h hcts
   - send stat T and S and will crossmatch
   - protonix gtt although can likely transition to [**Hospital1 **] dosing
   .
   # Anemia:  Chronic anemia likely [**2-2**] to malignancy (baseline hct
   unknown), now with acute drop from blood loss.  Received 2 units during
   his [**Date range (1) 2759**] admission and then an additional 3 units since [**10-16**].
   - management as above
   .
   # Candidal esophagitis:  Although none noted on repeat EGD, has
   received approximately 3 days of fluconazole and nystatin.  Patient
   without any symptoms of dysphagia or odynophagia.
   - will continue fluconazole and nystatin for now
   - address with GI duration of therapy (normally 14-21 days) given no
   signs of esophagitis on repeat scope just days after initial (? clear
   so quickly after initiation of rx)
   .
   # ESRD on PD:  Actually hypophosphotemic so will hold phosphate
   lowering meds.  Will continue qid dwells of 2L 2.5% dextrose solution.
   .
   # Small cell lung cancer:  Metastatic and not currently undergoing any
   therapy.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**].
   .
   # BPH: Produces small amount of urine.  Will hold on flomax pending
   continued stability in BP.
   .
   # h/o DVT/PE:  s/p IVC filter.  h/o HIT so prophylaxis with
   pneumoboots.
   .
   # FEN:  Clears until midnight and NPO thereafter pending procedure.
   Gentle IVFs.
   .
   # Access:  2 20G PIVs.
   .
   # PPx:  Pneumoboots.  Protonix gtt.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung cancer. He presented to the hospital with syncope and black stool, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Initial endoscopy showed a non-bleeding duodenal ulcer, but subsequent scope revealed duodenitis without evidence of ulceration. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) during his admission and an additional 3 units since October 16th due to acute drop in hemoglobin from blood loss. The source of bleeding is likely from a small bowel arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or ulceration distal to the scoped segments. The patient is prepped for an enteroscopy and colonoscopy at another hospital. His current hemoglobin level is 9.0 g/dL. The patient also has chronic anemia likely due to malignancy, with baseline hematocrit unknown. He is being maintained on two peripheral intravenous lines and will continue receiving fluconazole and nystatin for candidal esophagitis. The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis and will hold phosphate-lowering medications. He is also being followed for metastatic small cell lung cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), for which he is on pneumatic boots as prophylaxis. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR)/do-not-intubate (DNI) code status and is likely to be discharged after gastrointestinal procedures."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung cancer who presented with syncope and black stool. He underwent an endoscopy and colonoscopy at Hospital1 to investigate gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The initial EGD showed a nonbleeding duodenal ulcer, but a repeat scope revealed duodenitis without evidence of ulceration. The patient also has chronic anemia likely due to malignancy and has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). He is currently stable hemodynamically and is being prepared for GI procedures. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), HIT, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He is on dialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has small cell lung cancer that is not currently undergoing any therapy. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is expected to remain in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient may continue to experience bleeding from an undetected source in the small bowel or right-sided colon, leading to further anemia and potential hypotension.
2. Hemodynamic instability: Due to the patient's history of hypotension and tachycardia requiring blood transfusions, there is a risk of recurrent hemodynamic instability during"

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) presenting with ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He has been hemodynamically stable overnight after receiving a transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 82-145/33-76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission.

On physical examination, the patient appears without acute distress. His eyes and conjunctiva are pupil equal and reactive to light (PERRL), and his head, ears, nose, and throat examination is unremarkable. Cardiovascular examination reveals normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and peripheral vascular examination shows absent pulses in both radial and dorsal pedal arteries. Respiratory examination shows symmetric chest expansion and rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally. Abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. Neurologic examination is also unremarkable.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, leukocyte count of 76 K/uL, platelet count of 123 mg/dL, sodium level of 1.6 mg/dL, potassium level of 31 mEq/L"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) presenting with ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He has been hemodynamically stable overnight after receiving a blood transfusion. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 145/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for ongoing GIB. The patient has allergies to heparin, possibly due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). He is currently receiving fluconazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip, and nystatin for suspected fungal infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued GIB: The patient's recurrent episodes of GIB indicate a potential ongoing risk for significant bleeding, which could lead to hypotension and shock if not managed appropriately.
2. HIT: Given the patient's allergy to heparin and the suspicion of HIT, there is a risk of developing further clotting complications if heparin or related medications are used.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to SCLC and ongoing GIB increases his susceptibility to infections. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or elevated white blood cell count, is essential.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He has been admitted to the ICU and has received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) overnight. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, with vital signs within normal range. He has a history of possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), for which he is receiving fluconazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip, and nystatin for suspected yeast infection. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. His laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, and electrolytes, except for elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The patient is scheduled for a push enteroscopy and colonoscopy today. His code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI), and he is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's ongoing GIB and recurrent melena indicate a risk of further bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters, especially coagulation profile, is necessary.
2. Infection: The presence of suspected yeast infection warrants prompt treatment to prevent complications associated with immunosuppression.
3. Organ dysfunction: Elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest possible kidney dysfunction. Regular"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving dialysis since October 18th. The patient's chief complaint is regaining strength. 

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range but slightly below average, heart rate and blood pressure are stable, respiratory rate is normal, and oxygen saturation is at 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals that they appear well-nourished, overweight or obese, with normal head, ears, nose, and throat findings. Cardiovascular examination is difficult to assess due to audible breath sounds. Peripheral vascular examination shows present pulses in both right and left digital arteries. Respiratory examination shows symmetric chest expansion with rhonchorous breath sounds. Abdominal examination indicates non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present and distention. Extremities show 2+ edema in both right and left legs. Skin examination is not assessed. Neurologic examination reveals attentive behavior, following simple commands, responding to verbal stimuli, purposeful movement, and normal tone.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and slightly elevated potassium levels. Other lab values are within normal range. Imaging from endoscopy indicates Barrett's esophagus, clotted blood in the stomach body, erythema and congestion in the antrum suggestive of mild gastritis, and a 1."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung cancer. He presented with syncope and black stool, indicating a possible gastrointestinal bleed. An endoscopy revealed a bleeding ulcer in the duodenal bulb with a visible vessel, which was successfully treated with hemostasis. The patient has been experiencing chronic anemia likely due to malignancy, and has received a total of 5 units of blood since admission. His hematocrit levels are improving. He also has candidal esophagitis, for which he has been receiving fluconazole and nystatin treatment. The patient is on peritoneal dialysis (PD) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has hypophosphatemia, so phosphate-lowering medications are being held. His small cell lung cancer is currently not undergoing any therapy. He has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient is currently NPO per GI recommendations, with gentle IV fluids. He has two peripheral IV lines, and prophylaxis for DVT and PE is being provided. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) code status, and is likely to be transferred to the floor soon.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who presented with recurrent episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to a bleeding duodenal ulcer. He was hemodynamically stable and had a stable hematocrit (Hct) level. The patient's vital signs were within normal range, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 129/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient's physical examination revealed no acute distress and his abdomen was soft and distended, with no tenderness.

Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 9.0 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin level of 11.4 g/dL, platelet count of 88 x 10^9/L, creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 121 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal range. The patient's coagulation profile included a prothrombin time (PT) of 11.2 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 21.8 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 0.9.

   76 year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung cancer
   who presented to OSH with syncope and black stool x 2 without clear
   source of bleed on EGD, now transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for push enteroscopy.
   .
   # GIB:  Enteroscopy yesterday revealed bleeding ulcer in duodenal bulb
   with visible vessel, which was clamped successfully. HCT=29.4 last
   night, and 32.3 this morning. Patient is hemodynamically stable.
   - Advance diet as tolerated
   - Change to Protonix 40mg IV BID
   .
   # Anemia:  Chronic anemia likely [**2-2**] to malignancy (baseline hct
   unknown), now with acute drop from blood loss.  Received 2 units during
   his [**Date range (1) 2759**] admission and then an additional 3 units since [**10-16**].
   HCT improving this morning, recheck at 5pm.
   .
   # Candidal esophagitis:  Although none noted on repeat EGD, has
   received approximately 4 days of fluconazole and nystatin.  Patient
   without any symptoms of dysphagia or odynophagia.
   - Will discontinue fluconazole and nystatin as recent enteroscopy
   yesterday did not show evidence of candidal esophagitis.
   .
   # ESRD on PD:  Actually hypophosphotemic so will hold phosphate
   lowering meds. Continued improvement in phos. Currently on dwells of 2L
   2.5% dextrose solution. Will switch to home regimen of 4.25%.

   # Small cell lung cancer:  Metastatic and not currently undergoing any
   therapy.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**].
   .
   # BPH: Produces small amount of urine.  Flomax initially held for BP
   concerns. BP has been stable, thus this will be restarted at home dose
   of 0.4mg PO QHS.
   .
   # h/o DVT/PE:  s/p IVC filter.  h/o HIT so prophylaxis with
   pneumoboots.
   # FEN:  Advance diet as tolerated with no restrictions.  Gentle IVFs.
   # Access:  2 20G PIVs.
   # PPx:  Pneumoboots.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung cancer. He presented to the hospital with syncope and black stool, indicating potential gastrointestinal bleeding. An endoscopy revealed a bleeding ulcer in the duodenal bulb with a visible vessel, which was successfully clamped. The patient has received blood transfusions due to acute blood loss, but is currently hemodynamically stable. His hematocrit levels have improved this morning. The patient also has chronic anemia likely due to malignancy and has received a total of 5 units of blood during his admission. He is scheduled for recheck of his hematocrit at 5 pm. Candidal esophagitis was initially suspected but has been ruled out as there were no signs of it on repeat endoscopy. The patient is on peritoneal dialysis for end-stage renal disease and will switch to a home regimen of 4.25% dextrose solution. He has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The patient has chosen do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status and will be transferred to the medicine floor for further care."
