   catheter in abscess. He returned to ER with PE while off of coumadin -
   anticoagulation restarted.
   Returns now with hypoxemia and dyspnea. CXR apparently showed new left
   infiltrate and he was treated with CTX/azithro and transferred. In our
   ER, he required bipap then intubation for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure and mental status decline.
   CT-A showed no significant changes from prior CT, head CT negative. He
   was given vanco as well and admitted to ICU.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of retroperitoneal mass due to abscess and empyema, for which he underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and had a pig-tailed catheter placed in the abscess. He was previously treated for a pulmonary embolism (PE) while off of coumadin, and anticoagulation was restarted.

The patient's current presentation includes hypoxemia and dyspnea, with a new left infiltrate seen on chest X-ray. He was initially treated with ceftriaxone/azithromycin and transferred to the hospital's emergency room. In the ER, he required bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and subsequent intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and mental status decline. A computed tomography angiogram (CT-A) showed no significant changes from the prior CT scan, and a head CT was negative. Vancomycin was also started, and the patient was admitted to the ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 142/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen via endotracheal tube. He is mechanically ventilated in assist-control mode with a tidal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of retroperitoneal mass due to abscess and empyema, who underwent VATS and pig-tailed catheter in abscess. He previously returned to the ER with PE while off of coumadin - anticoagulation restarted. The patient presents now with hypoxemia and dyspnea, and a new left infiltrate on CXR. He required bipap then intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and mental status decline. ABG showed pH 7.29, PaCO2 94, and HCO3- 81. CT-A showed no significant changes from prior CT, and head CT was negative. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and receiving vanco as well.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is unclear in origin, but it is suspected to be due to significant restrictive lung disease caused by bilateral pleural processes. The ongoing respiratory support with mechanical ventilation is crucial.
2. Infection: The presence of rigors suggests an ongoing infection, despite imaging not supporting pneumonia. Empiric antibiotics have been initiated to cover possible infections.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the recent PE is doubtful, continued anticoagulation may be necessary to prevent further thrombotic events.
4. Extubation: The"

 .H/O PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   80M s/p VATS and drainage of an empyema and retroperitoneal abscess
   infected with Pantoea spp (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) and PE on
   warfarin as well as CAD s/p CABG, CHF, and Afib admitted with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Etiology unclear. R pleural effusion
   improved on CT. No PE on CTA. NCHCT for central cause of respiratory
   failure negative. No infectious workup in the ED, but infection is a
   likely cause. Pt empirically received ceftriaxone, azityhromycin, and
   vancomycin but was not cultured. Of note, his past empyema and
   retroperitoneal abscess were growing Pantoea spp, a Gram negative
   bacteria which can produce a beta lactamase. He was successfully
   treated with levofloxacin in his prior admission. Extubated
   successfully on [**12-18**]. Perhaps hypothyroidism and neuromuscular slowing
   of diaphragm/respiratory muscles contributes to hypercarbia.
   - ABG 12 hours post-extubation with hypercarbia, but oxygenating well;
   repeat with O2 weaned down more to just 1L NC with less hypercarbia
   (ie: he is correcting himself; likely lives at baseline of pCO2 in 60s)
   - Follow-up repeat ABG this morning
   - Treat presumptively for aspiration PNA with vancomycin 1g IV BID,
   metronidazole 500mg IV TID, and levofloxacin 750mg IV daily
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - OSH concerned about CHF, but not hypoxic at any point and no crackles
   on exam. Elevated JVP likely due to known 3+ tricuspid regurgitation;
   mild crackles at right lung base, 1+ b/l pedal edema.
   .
   # Possible infection as cause of decompensation: Pt was treated for
   infection with Pantoea (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) approximately 1
   month ago. He also is a risk for aspiration.
   - Treat aspiration PNA as above with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
   metronidazole
   - f/u blood culture and sputum culture
   .
   # Pulmonary embolus: Diagnosed [**2188-11-22**] with segmental pulmonary
   embolism within the anterior basal segment of the right lower lobe
   pulmonary artery. Warfarin as an outpatient. Admission CTA showed no
   further PE.
   - Restart home warfarin today
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
   .
   # CAD: S/p CABG in [**2182**], chronically in Afib. Vpaced.
   - Continue home ASA 325mg PO daily
   - Continue home pravastatin 80mg PO HS
   - Continue home Metoprolol Tartrate 50mg PO daily
   - Continue AC as above for PE and Afib
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - TSH 35 (significantly elevated)
   - Continue home Levothyroxine Sodium 75 mcg PO/NG DAILY  - increase to
   ???

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), acute respiratory failure, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and hypothyroidism. The patient was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, and the etiology is unclear. The patient's pleural effusion improved on CT, and there was no PE on computed tomography angiography (CTA). A noncontrast head computed tomography (NCHCT) for central cause of respiratory failure was negative. The patient received ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin empirically but was not cultured. The patient had previous empyema and retroperitoneal abscess growing Pantoea spp., a Gram-negative bacteria that can produce beta-lactamase. The patient was successfully treated with levofloxacin during a prior admission. The patient was successfully extubated on [**12-18**].

The patient's current condition includes mild crackles at the right lung base, 1+ bilateral pedal edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) likely due to known 3+ tricuspid regurgitation. The patient is at risk for aspiration and has a history of infection with Pantoea spp. approximately one month ago.

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   80M s/p VATS and drainage of an empyema and retroperitoneal abscess
   infected with Pantoea spp (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) and PE on
   warfarin as well as CAD s/p CABG, CHF, and Afib admitted with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Etiology unclear. R pleural effusion
   improved on CT. No PE on CTA. NCHCT for central cause of respiratory
   failure negative. No infectious workup in the ED, but infection is a
   likely cause. Pt empirically received ceftriaxone, azityhromycin, and
   vancomycin but was not cultured. Of note, his past empyema and
   retroperitoneal abscess were growing Pantoea spp, a Gram negative
   bacteria which can produce a beta lactamase. He was successfully
   treated with levofloxacin in his prior admission. Extubated
   successfully on [**12-18**]. Perhaps hypothyroidism and neuromuscular slowing
   of diaphragm/respiratory muscles contributes to hypercarbia.
   - ABG 12 hours post-extubation with hypercarbia, but oxygenating well;
   repeat with O2 delivery weaned down more to just 1L NC with less
   hypercarbia (ie: he is correcting himself; likely lives at baseline of
   pCO2 in 60s); also less O2 delivery likely helps his respiratory drive
   to blow off more CO2; seems to be somewhat of a chronic retainer (maybe
   due to physiology s/p effusions and empyema and abscess and surgeries)
   - Follow-up repeat ABG at noon today
 if improved, consider pull
   a-line and send to floor; if pCO2 rises again (or change in MS,
   oxygenation etc.) then non-invasive ventilation as a possibility if
   needed to help with the hypercarbia if he
s not tolerating it
   - Had been treating presumptively for aspiration PNA with vancomycin 1g
   IV BID, metronidazole 500mg IV TID, and levofloxacin 750mg IV daily;
   but afebrile, no leukocytosis, oxygenating well
 so d/c all these
   antibiotics today, and monitor clinically for evidence of
   aspiration/pneumonia/infection
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Crackles on exam and pedal edema, restart home lasix 40mg PO daily
   .
   # Possible infection as cause of decompensation: Pt was treated for
   infection with Pantoea (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) approximately 1
   month ago. He also is a risk for aspiration.
   - d/c antibiotic treatment for aspiration PNA
   - f/u blood culture and sputum culture
   .
   # Pulmonary embolus: Diagnosed [**2188-11-22**] with segmental pulmonary
   embolism within the anterior basal segment of the right lower lobe
   pulmonary artery. Warfarin as an outpatient. Admission CTA showed no
   further PE.
   - Continue coumadin at 2mg today, then up to 4mg daily (home dose) on
   [**12-20**] (wait until [**12-20**] to bump up the dose, because of the residual
   antibiotic effect on anticoagulation)
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
   .
   # CAD: S/p CABG in [**2182**], chronically in Afib. Vpaced.
   - Continue home ASA 325mg PO daily
   - Continue home pravastatin 80mg PO HS
   - Continue home metoprolol Tartrate 50mg PO daily
   - Continue anticoagulation as above for PE and Afib
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH 35 (significantly elevated); unclear if because
   of not receiving med at rehab versus inappropriate dose
   - Increase home Levothyroxine Sodium 75 mcg PO/NG DAILY to 100mcg
   - Recheck TSH in 1 month (approx mid/late [**2189-1-2**])
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRB, replete electrolytes as needed, advancing diet as
   tolerated, speech & swallow consult f/u. Send nutrition labs (albumin,
   iron, B12, folic acid). PT consult.
   # Prophylaxis: Warfarin as above, pneumoboots, PPI (change IV to PO now
   that extubated)
   # Access: Peripherals, Aline.
   # Communication: Patient and wife.
   # Code:  Full (discussed with wife in [**Name (NI) **]).
   # Disposition: After noon ABG, consider call-out to floor pending pCO2
   and respiratory status. Plan for rehab after hospitalization.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), acute respiratory failure, and previous empyema. He was recently admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated but extubated yesterday and is doing well. His pCO2 levels were in the 90s overnight but have improved to the 50s this morning. He has no complaints and is alert with good mentation.
