","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, asbestosis, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic aspiration, and multiple recent admissions. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia in the setting of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has been refusing nasal suctioning and has a flu swab negative result. His symptoms have significantly improved with 1mg doses of morphine. He received a 250cc bolus of normal saline due to a low fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) of 0.83%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent aspiration: The patient's history of chronic aspiration and hypoxia suggests that recurrent aspiration could continue to be a concern.
2. Severe pulmonary hypertension: The patient's history of severe pulmonary hypertension may contribute to respiratory distress and complications.
3. Chronic renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may require careful monitoring and management of fluid balance and electrolyte levels.
4. Open wound with fluid drainage: The patient has an open area with fluid draining, which may require further evaluation and management to prevent infection.
5. Pressure ulcer: The patient has a stage II pressure ulcer on his coccyx gluteal region, which needs to be monitored and managed to prevent worsening.
6. Femoral hernia repair: The patient recently underwent fem"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including COPD, hypertension, asbestosis, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic aspiration, and chronic renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxia in the setting of Vanc/Zosyn treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) versus aspiration pneumonia.

The patient has known MRSA and has been treated with Vanc/Zosyn. He is also on tamiflu and nebs for respiratory support. The goal is to maintain oxygen saturation in the low 90s, and Lasix may be considered if the patient desaturates. Broadening the antibiotic coverage to meropenem may be considered if the patient spikes.

The patient has decided against feeding tube placement and is DNR/DNI. Intubation carries significant risk due to severe lung disease, and the family has decided to support the patient for now but will change goals to comfort if he decompensates.

The patient has several other medical issues, including an open wound with fluid draining, chronic renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.4, COPD, hypertension, GERD, anxiety/sleep problems, glaucoma, a stage II pressure ulcer on his coccyx gluteal region, recent femoral hernia repair, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, bowel regimen, aspiration precautions, and central access.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, development of infections in the open wound or urinary tract, exacerbation of chronic renal failure, pressure ulcer progression, and complications related to the recent hernia repair."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of chronic pleural effusions, severe pulmonary hypertension, COPD, asbestosis, and recent hospitalization for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) treated with vancomycin and zosyn. The patient returns with worsening hypoxemia from rehab and has a confirmed do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI) status. The patient appears mildly hypovolemic based on increased creatinine, tachycardia, and desaturation. He was given a dose of lasix with minimal increase in urine output. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a mixed venous oxygen saturation of 59-59%. The patient's recent CT chest shows significant new right middle lobe/right lower lobe pneumonia, bilateral effusions, enlarging pleural-based nodules/masses, and emphysema. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and his blood glucose level is within normal range. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and viral panel is negative. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to recurrent aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia, and the patient declines nasogastric suctioning. The patient's chronic renal failure is evidenced by a slight increase in creatinine, and the patient also has mild hypernatremia. The patient's identification of pneumonia is being treated with continued vancomycin and zosyn"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, asbestosis, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic aspiration, and multiple recent admissions. He returns from a nursing home with hypoxia in the setting of Vanc/Zosyn treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, possibly due to recurrent aspiration and pulmonary edema. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/41 to 135/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on aerosol-cool with a face tent. Physical examination findings include decreased breath sounds bilaterally, crackles at the bases, soft abdomen, 2+ pitting edema bilaterally, and an open inguinal hernia wound with scant drainage. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including chronic renal failure, COPD, hypertension, GERD, anxiety/sleep disorder, glaucoma, and a recent femoral hernia repair.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent aspiration leading to respiratory failure.
2. Pulmonary edema due to fluid overload or cardiac dysfunction.

   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with a history of COPD on home
   oxygen, HTN, asbestosis, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions, severe
   pulmonary HTN, chronic aspiration, with multiple recent admissions,
   returns from NH with hypoxia in setting of Vanc/Zosyn treatment of
   HAP.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Most likely recurrent aspiration as is mostly right sided.
   Flu negative. Pt. refusing nasal suctioning.
   -- continue Vanc/Zosyn for now.
   -- nebs
   -- goal O2 sat low 90s
   - lasix
   - consider broaden to meropenem if spikes
   .
   # Goals of care: Pt decided against feeding tube placement at recent
   admission, but has consistently been DNR/DNI. Given severe lung
   disease, intubation would carry significant risk of difficulty
   extubating. Family had long discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2021**] who knows the
   patient and his family very well and have come to the decision that
   will try to support pt. for now but if he decompensates will change
   goals to comfort.
   -- DNR/DNI
   -- If decompensates start morphine drip
   .
   #. Wound: Open area with fluid draining.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, asbestosis, recurrent bilateral pleural effusions, severe pulmonary hypertension, chronic aspiration, and multiple recent admissions. He has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, possibly due to recurrent aspiration. He is refusing nasal suctioning, so the treatment plan continues with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. Nebulizers and goal oxygen saturation in the low 90s have been implemented, along with diuresis using Lasix. The possibility of broadening antibiotics to Meropenem is considered if the patient's condition worsens.

The patient has decided against feeding tube placement and has chosen to be DNR/DNI. If he decompensates, the goal of care will be changed to comfort, and a morphine drip will be started. The patient also has an open wound with fluid draining, and wound care recommendations are being followed. His chronic renal failure has shown improvement with gentle hydration.

Other medical conditions include COPD, hypertension, GERD, anxiety/sleep issues, glaucoma, and a stage II pressure ulcer on his coccyx gluteal region. The patient recently underwent femoral hernia repair and is undergoing wet to dry dressing changes for the wound. He also requires precautions for prevention of aspiration,"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of recent hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and recurrent aspiration. He was admitted with hypoxemia and recurrent aspiration. The patient's condition has improved with time, antibiotics, and diuresis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient's history of recurrent aspiration puts him at risk for developing aspiration pneumonitis, especially since he declined suctioning.
2. Infection: Although the patient has received a complete course of antibiotics for his HAP, there is still a possibility of developing a new infection due to his immunocompromised state.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, which is improving with diuresis. It is important to monitor his renal function closely.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and it should be managed appropriately during his transfer to the floor.

Overall, the patient's hypoxemia has improved, and he is stable on 2 liters of oxygen. He is awake, alert, and conversant. His physical examination reveals crackles at the right base, and his vital signs are within normal limits. The assessment and plan include continuing diuresis, completing the course of antibiotics, managing his renal function, and addressing his hypertension."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of aspiration pneumonia and recent hospital admission. He presented with hypoxemia and was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonitis. The patient received antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and showed improvement with time, antibiotics, and diuresis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/37-121/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is alert and conversant but declines suctioning. Physical examination reveals crackles at the right base and minimal edema. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine level. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and bicarbonate levels. The patient's renal function is improving with diuresis. The patient has a history of hypertension and is on home medication for it. The plan is to continue diuresis, transfer the patient to the floor, and discontinue antibiotics since there are no new infectious etiologies or evidence of infection. The patient's code status remains DNR/DNI."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of recent hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and recurrent aspiration. He was admitted with hypoxemia and recurrent aspiration. The patient's condition has improved with time, antibiotics, and diuresis. His vital signs are stable, and he is currently on 2L O2 by NC. There are no known drug allergies. The patient's lab results show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and elevated lactate levels. The patient has a history of hypertension, and his renal function is improving with diuresis. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient has a history of recurrent aspiration, which increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonitis. His symptoms, such as hypoxemia and crackles at the right base, suggest this condition. Close monitoring and supportive care are necessary.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's lab results indicate some abnormalities in renal function, including decreased hematocrit and elevated lactate levels. Acute renal failure could be a concern in this case. Diuretics may be helping to improve renal function, but ongoing monitoring is essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side (102/37 mmHg). This may indicate hypot"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of recent pneumonia (PNA), recurrent aspiration events, and known COPD and pulmonary hypertension. He returns with aspiration pneumonitis and possible pulmonary edema. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia, which is likely due to aspiration pneumonitis, as well as stable renal function with creatinine levels at 1.2. The patient has completed his course of antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). He is awake and alert, but shows diminished breath sounds at the right base and scattered crackles in the chest. Other findings include trace edema in the extremities and abnormal lab values, including low hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 92%) indicates respiratory distress and may require further intervention, such as increasing oxygen delivery or considering mechanical ventilation if respiratory failure occurs.
2. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient's recurrent aspiration events have led to aspiration pneumonitis, which can progress to pneumonia and worsen respiratory function if not managed appropriately.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of crackles in the chest and potential pulmonary edema could lead to worsening respiratory distress and fluid overload, necessitating careful monitoring and management of fluid balance.
4. Renal Function: Although the patient's creatinine levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of COPD, pulmonary hypertension, recent pneumonia (PNA), and known recurrent aspiration. He presented with aspiration pneumonitis and possible pulmonary edema. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation level of 92%. His lab results show a slightly elevated creatinine level of 1.2. The patient's condition is being managed with diuresis, off antibiotics, and plans for transfer to the floor. He will continue using home oxygen with a target SpO2 range of 88-92%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient's recurrent aspiration events have led to aspiration pneumonitis. This condition can cause inflammation in the lungs and may result in respiratory distress or failure if not properly managed.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms suggest possible pulmonary edema, which is a condition characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs. It can cause difficulty breathing and decreased oxygenation if not treated promptly.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation level indicates hypoxemia. This can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not corrected.
4. Renal Impairment: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated at 1.2. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
5. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD"
