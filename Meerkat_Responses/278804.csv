","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, URI symptoms, and dietary indiscretion. She presented with acute worsening of hypoxia and acute congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has a history of chronic CHF, hypertension, renal artery stenosis, and diabetes.

24-hour events:
- The patient felt much improved and denied any shortness of breath or chest pain.
- She received Lasix 80mg IV three times and had increased urine output.
- Antibiotics were stopped.
- A chest X-ray showed worsened pulmonary edema and possible opacities, but it was suggested to repeat the X-ray after diuresis to confirm the presence of opacity.
- A renal ultrasound showed no acute pathology, but Doppler assessment was difficult due to respiratory movement.
- The patient had increased blood pressure in the morning, so labetalol was given.

Allergies:
The patient is allergic to levofloxacin, which caused a rash.

Infusions and ICU medications:
- The patient received pantoprazole (Protonix) on [**2115-5-17**] at 09:30 AM.
- Heparin sodium (prophylaxis) was started on [**2115-5-17**] at 05:10 PM.
- Furosemide (Lasix) was given on [**2115-5-17**]"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure who was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, URI symptoms, and dietary indiscretion. She presented with acute worsening of hypoxia and was found to have acute CHF exacerbation. 

The patient received IV Lasix multiple times over the course of the day and diuresed approximately 3L. Her exam showed improvement, suggesting a relatively euvolemic state. She is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NP O2) with good oxygen saturation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary edema due to acute CHF exacerbation.
2. Respiratory infection such as pneumonia, as indicated by URI symptoms and clear productive sputum.
3. Hypertension, as evidenced by an episode of high blood pressure in the 160s overnight.
4. Renal artery stenosis status post stenting x2, which requires monitoring of creatinine levels and blood pressure.
5. Diabetes, for which she is on a diabetic diet and home insulin regimen.
6. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), requiring renal dose medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms, and dietary indiscretion. She presented with acute worsening of hypoxia and is now diagnosed with acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's condition has been exacerbated by flash pulmonary edema due to elevated blood pressures. 

The patient received Lasix 80mg IV twice today, resulting in only about 1 liter of urine output. She is currently on nonrebreather (NRB) ventilation with good oxygen saturation. 

The treatment plan includes continuing aggressive diuresis with Lasix 80mg IV as needed, aiming for a total output of -2.5-3L today. She will also receive [Hospital1] Lytes, continue home medications including aspirin (ASA), labetalol, clonidine, and nifedipine, with the goal of maintaining a systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 140s. Oxygen therapy will be weaned as tolerated.

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (URI) with mild cough and clear productive sputum, accompanied by chills. A retrocardiac opacity was noted on admission, and she was started on ceftriaxone/azithromycin. However, the CXR is less likely to represent pneumonia, so antibiotics have been held, and blood cultures will be"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted with shortness of breath, URI symptoms, and dietary indiscretion.
- She has a history of chronic CHF and recent worsening symptoms such as SOB, DOE, and orthopnea.
- Today, she experienced acute hypoxia and was given Lasix 80mg IV with minimal urine output.
- She is currently on a non-rebreather mask with good oxygen saturation.
- There is a concern for flash pulmonary edema due to elevated blood pressures.
- She also has a possible opacity on chest X-ray, which could be related to a URI or pneumonia.
- She has a history of hypertension, renal artery stenosis, and diabetes.
- Her labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels.
- The plan includes continuing aggressive diuresis with Lasix, monitoring for any signs of infection or worsening renal function, and adjusting medications accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic CHF exacerbation: The patient's worsening symptoms and acute hypoxia suggest an exacerbation of her chronic CHF. This condition can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs, resulting in pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's URI symptoms and the presence of an opacity on chest X-ray raise concerns for pneumonia. If left untreated, pneumonia can worsen her respiratory status and potentially lead to sepsis.
3. Flash pulmonary edema"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted with shortness of breath, URI symptoms, and dietary indiscretion. She presented with acute worsening of hypoxia and is now diagnosed with acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has been undergoing total diuresis since admission, with a total output of 5.3L. Her physical examination shows comfort, clear lungs, no jugular venous distention, and mild bilateral leg edema. Vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 128-157 mmHg and an oxygen saturation of 95% on high-flow nasal cannula. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Renal function tests show improvement in creatinine levels. The patient's current medications include lasix PO, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole, and her home medications for hypertension, renal artery stenosis, and diabetes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure symptoms: The patient's current presentation of acute on chronic CHF may indicate an ongoing deterioration in cardiac function. Close monitoring of symptoms such as increased shortness of breath, increased leg edema, or signs of fluid overload is necessary.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, with readings in the 150-160s. If not controlled, this could lead to further"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female admitted with shortness of breath, URI symptoms, and dietary indiscretion. She is now experiencing acute worsening of hypoxia and acute congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has a history of chronic CHF and renal artery stenosis status post stenting.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 83 bpm with sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 128/41 mmHg to 192/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high flow nasal cannula.

The patient has received a total of 5.3 liters of diuretics since admission, which suggests fluid removal. Her physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, decreased breath sounds at bilateral bases, and 1+ edema in both lower extremities to the calves. There are no rashes, lesions, or ecchymoses observed.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 12.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, sodium of 142 mEq/L, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride of 103 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 28.4%, BUN of 28 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a diagnosis of acute diastolic heart failure (CHF). The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 157/52 mmHg, heart rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient has mild distress and is tachypneic, but able to speak in short sentences. Physical examination reveals crackles in bilateral lung fields, 1+ edema in both lower extremities, and no other significant findings. Lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and potassium, while glucose levels are low.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The presence of crackles in bilateral lung fields and tachypnea suggests worsening pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Elevated levels of creatinine and BUN indicate impaired renal function. In the context of heart failure, this may be due to reduced cardiac output leading to decreased renal perfusion.

3. Hyperkalemia: The elevated potassium level requires careful monitoring and management, as hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.

4. Hypoglycemia: The low glucose level needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications"

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted with shortness of breath, upper respiratory infection symptoms, and dietary indiscretion. She has a history of chronic heart failure and was found to be acutely hypoxic yesterday morning, likely due to an acute exacerbation of CHF. The patient received IV Lasix multiple times over the course of yesterday and diuresed approximately 3L. Her exam has improved significantly, suggesting a relatively euvolemic state. She is currently on nasal cannula oxygen with good oxygen saturation.

Medical Complications that can arise:

1. Acute on chronic CHF: The patient's worsening symptoms of shortness of breath, orthopnea, and acute hypoxia indicate an acute exacerbation of her chronic heart failure. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function and potentially life-threatening complications.

2. Hypertension: The patient had an episode of high blood pressure overnight, likely due to non-adherence to home medications. If not controlled, hypertension can increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke or heart attack.

3. Respiratory infections: The patient's URI symptoms and mild cough with clear productive sputum suggest a possible respiratory infection. If left untreated or inadequately treated, this can progress to pneumonia, which can be potentially serious or even life-threatening, especially in older adults.

4. Renal artery stenosis: The patient has a history of renal artery st"
