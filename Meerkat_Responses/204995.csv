","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female who was transferred from an outside hospital with a diagnosis of STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient's EKG demonstrated ST elevations in anterior leads, indicating an occlusion in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) proximal to the septal branch, resulting in an anterior MI. The patient is hemodynamically stable and chest pain-free. 

Medical Complications:

1. STEMI/ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome): The patient has been diagnosed with STEMI, which is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention. The occlusion in the LAD artery has resulted in an anterior MI.

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient presents with lower extremity edema and pulmonary rales on examination, suggesting the presence of CHF. Cardiomegaly is also observed on chest x-ray. The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.2, and ACE inhibitors may be considered once a baseline creatinine level is established.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, for which outpatient metoprolol 25 mg has been prescribed. Currently, the patient is stable.

4. Renal Failure: There are no prior records available to determine whether the patient's renal failure is acute or chronic. The patient's GFR (glomerular filtration rate) is 55, and renal dosing of medications is"

   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and I
   concur with the history, physical examination, assessment, and
   treatment plan outlined above.  The physical examination is consistent
   with my own examination today.
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1198**] is a 77 year old woman with known aortic stenosis (peak
   velocity 4.3 M/sec) who suffers with dementia and is a nursing home

   with an anterior STEMI by EKG.  After review of her condition and
   overall prognosis
 she is oriented x 1
 we have opted for maximal
   medical therapy with IV heparin, clopidogrel, IV eptifibatide, morphine
   and morphine sulfate.   An echocardiogram showed a LVEF of
   approximately 40% with mid and distal anterior hypokinesis.
   The patient is resting currently comfortably and is painfree.  She
   states that she feels much better than yesterday but cannot place where
   she is.  She has had borderline hypotension (systolic 90s) and we will
   start low dose beta [**Known lastname 770**] and captopril therapy.
   Our primary goal is patient comfort.  Routine post MI care full be
   undertaken.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with dementia who was admitted with a STEMI. The note outlines the patient's medical history, current medications, and ongoing treatment plan.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac Complications: As the patient had a STEMI, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as recurrent myocardial ischemia, heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or even sudden cardiac death.

2. Respiratory Complications: The patient has diffuse rales and rhonchi throughout the lungs, which may indicate fluid accumulation in the lungs leading to pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This can compromise oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, suggesting some degree of renal impairment. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening renal function can occur due to factors like hypotension, use of nephrotoxic drugs, or decreased renal perfusion.

4. Delirium: The patient was agitated and delirious at some point, which can be a common complication in critically ill patients, especially the elderly. Delirium increases the risk of falls, fractures, and worsening cognitive function.

5. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Infections"

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with dementia who was transferred from an outside hospital with a diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient is being medically managed in the CCU after reversing her do-not-resuscitate (DNR) / do-not-intubate (DNI) status.

The patient has a history of medical comorbidities, including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), renal failure, dementia, depression, dyslipidemia, hypertension, overactive bladder, and osteoporosis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Cardiac:
- The patient's EKG demonstrates ST elevations in anterior leads, indicating occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) distal to the septal branch, resulting in an anterior myocardial infarction.
- The patient's hemodynamics are stable, and she is currently chest pain-free.
- She was tachycardic overnight and this morning, with chest pain and significant nausea, which responded to a nitroglycerin drip and morphine.
- Integrilin course completed this morning.

   40-45% with prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Possible aortic valve stenosis.  Currently on home dose
   Lasix.
   - Continue B-[**Last Name (LF) 770**], [**First Name3 (LF) 119**]

   CCU ATTENDING DAILY PROGRESS NOTE:
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and I
   concur with the history, physical examination, assessment, and
   treatment plan outlined above.  The physical examination is consistent
   with my own examination today.
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1198**] is a 77 year old woman with known aortic stenosis (peak
   velocity 4.3 M/sec) who suffers with dementia and is a nursing home
   resident.  She developed typical chest pain consistent with an anterior
   STEMI by EKG.  She was treated with maximal medical therapy including
   IV heparin, clopidogrel, IV eptifibatide, morphine and morphine
   sulfate.
   An echocardiogram showed a LVEF of approximately 40% with mid and
   distal anterior hypokinesis.
   The patient is resting currently comfortably and is painfree.  She
   remains oriented times 1.  Her blood pressures have stabilized and we
   will start low dose beta [**Known lastname 770**].  We will not give ACE inhibitors at
   the current time due to her underlying aortic stenosis.  Her enzymes
   have peaked and are downtrending
   Our primary goal is patient comfort.  Routine post MI care full be
   undertaken.  She will be able to move to the floor tomorrow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with dementia who was admitted with an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and aortic stenosis.

From the note, we can summarize the following key points:
1. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 133/68 mmHg, heart rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula, and temperature within normal range.
2. The patient's physical examination revealed lower extremity edema, pulmonary rales, cardiomegaly on chest x-ray, and a first-degree AV block.
3. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine level, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.
4. The patient's echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 40-45%, prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, regional systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD, severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, mild-moderate mitral regurgitation, and possible aortic valve stenosis.
5. The patient has been receiving medical management for her STEMI, including heparin drip, nitroglycerin, morphine, metoprolol, clopidogrel, and aspirin.
6. The patient's renal function has improved, as indicated by a decrease in creatinine level from 1.4 to 1.0 mg/dL.
7. The patient's dementia and depression medications have been continued.
8. The patient's leukocytosis is resolving, and there is no evidence of infection.
9. The patient's dyslipidemia is being managed with high-dose atorvastatin.
10. The patient's hypertension is being managed with metoprolol and nitroglycerin.
11. The patient's overactive bladder medication has been discontinued.
12. The patient's osteoporosis medication has been held.
13. The patient's care in the ICU includes pain management, bowel regimen, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's pre-existing aortic stenosis and the presence of a first-degree AV block.
2. Worsening congestive heart failure symptoms, such as increased fluid overload or pulmonary edema.
3. Acute renal failure, especially considering the patient's baseline renal function and the use of certain medications like heparin.
4. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to the patient's inability to clear secretions and the presence of pulmonary rales.
5. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and the presence"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old female with dementia who was transferred from an outside hospital with a diagnosis of STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). She is being medically managed in the CCU (Cardiac Care Unit).
- The patient's EKG on admission demonstrated ST elevations in anterior leads, indicating an occlusion in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) resulting in an anterior myocardial infarction. Subsequent EKGs showed decreasing ST elevations and the development of q waves in V4-V5.
- The patient experienced chest pain and significant nausea overnight but responded well to treatment with nitroglycerin and morphine. Her chest pain has since resolved, and her heart rate has been controlled with metoprolol.
- The plan is to continue medical management of the STEMI and improve the patient's EKG findings with the formation of q waves. Heparin will be discontinued after 48 hours following the peak of CK (creatine kinase) levels.
- The patient will continue on metoprolol, Plavix, and atorvastatin. Outpatient simvastatin will be held, and the patient will start on an ACE inhibitor tomorrow.
- The patient also has lower extremity edema and pulmonary rales, indicating fluid overload in the setting of congestive heart failure. A chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, and a transthoracic echocardiogram"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with dementia who was transferred from an outside hospital with a diagnosis of STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient is being medically managed in the ICU after the reversal of her DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate) status.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including congestive heart failure (CHF), cardiomegaly, pulmonary hypertension, mitral regurgitation, possible aortic valve stenosis, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She also has atrial fibrillation (a-fib) and a history of myocardial infarction.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate, but she has an elevated respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. Her physical examination reveals lower extremity edema, pulmonary rales, and a systolic murmur.

The laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated troponin levels, and signs of renal dysfunction. Imaging shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette with mild pulmonary vascular congestion, improving subtle hazy opacities in the left lung likely representing slowly resolving edema.

The patient is currently on a furosemide (Lasix) drip and will need to be started on an ACE inhibitor in the future. She is also being treated with metoprolol, Plavix, and atorvastatin. The plan is to continue diuretic therapy, monitor for fluid"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 87-year-old female with dementia who was transferred from an outside hospital with a diagnosis of STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate).

- The patient's medical management includes being on a Lasix drip for fluid overload, as well as medications for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and hypertension.

- The patient's cardiac condition is complex, with a history of STEMI, cardiomegaly, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF 40-45%), and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is also a possibility of aortic valve stenosis.

- The patient's rhythm has been changing, with a recent episode of atrial fibrillation (a fib) that required treatment with Metoprolol IV. The goal is to achieve rate control and monitor for spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm.

- The patient's coronary arteries are affected, with evidence of occlusion in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), leading to an anterior myocardial infarction (MI).

- The patient's renal function was initially affected but has now resolved, with a creatinine level of 1.0.

- Other medical issues include dementia, depression, leukocytosis (which is resolving), dyslipidemia,"

   # CORONARIES: OSH EKG demonstrates ST elevations in anterior leads.
   Elevation V1 > 2.5 mm suggests occlusion LAD distal to septal branch
   resulting in anterior MI. EKG on admission to CCU showed decreasing ST
   elevations in V1-V3 and q waves in V4-V5, this morning with worsening
   ST elevations. Patient hemodynamically stable and chest pain free
   currently but was tachycardic in 90
s-100
s overnight and this morning,
   with chest pain and significant nausea overnight, which responded to
   Nitro drip and Morphine.  Nitro drip now d/c
ed, pt chest pain free
   overnight.  Metoprolol up-titrated for HR control.
   - Due to medical co-morbidities, improving EKG with q waves,
   hemodynamic stability continue medical management of STEMI
   - Heparin drip for 48 hours following CK peak, will d/c today at
   appropriate time
   - Continue Metoprolol, Plavix, Atorvastatin, [**Year (4 digits) 119**]
   - Hold outpatient Simvastatin 40 mg qd
   - Zofran and compazine as needed for nausea
   - Patient will need to be started on ACE-I, but hold now until tomorrow

   # PUMP: Patient with lower extremity edema and pulmonary rales on exam.
   Cardiomegaly on chest x-ray. Lasix listed as outpatient medication.
   Fluid overload in setting of congestive heart failure. TTE showed EF
   40-45% with prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Possible aortic valve stenosis.  Currently on home dose
   Lasix.
   - Continue B-[**Last Name (LF) 770**], [**First Name3 (LF) 119**]
   - Switch to Lasix drip, with additional doses of Lasix to meet goal of
   -1.5-2L/day.
   - Patient will need to be started on ACE-I in the future, as above
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus, intermittently V-pacing.  Does not appear to have
   defibrillator.  Continue monitoring on tele.
   - Daily EKGs while receiving Haldol as below, to monitor QT interval
   .
   # Renal failure: Acute renal failure, likely [**3-15**] hypoperfusion from
   STEMI, now resolved to Cr 1.0.
   .
   # Dementia/Depression: Continue outpatient Aricept 10 mg qhs,
   Mitrazapine 15 mg qhs, Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Patient extremely agitated
   previous night, responded to total Haldol 3.5mg IV, but calm without
   need for Haldol last night.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with dementia who was transferred from an outside hospital with a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction). The patient's medical management includes reversal of DNR/DNI status, ongoing treatment for STEMI, and management of other comorbidities.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of STEMI and enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or recurrent myocardial ischemia.

2. Respiratory complications: The presence of diffuse rales and rhonchi throughout the lungs suggests pulmonary congestion, which may indicate fluid overload or worsening heart failure. This increases the risk of respiratory distress, pneumonia, or acute respiratory failure.

3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, likely due to hypoperfusion from the STEMI. Although the creatinine level has resolved to 1.0, there is still a potential risk for renal dysfunction or worsening renal failure.

4. Infectious complications: Although the patient does not have any obvious infiltrate on the chest X-ray and does not exhibit symptoms of cough or fever, there is still a risk for developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

5. Neurological complications: The patient's agitation and need"

   Medical Decision Making:   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1198**] is a 77 year old woman with
   known aortic stenosis (peak velocity 4.3 M/sec) who suffers with
   dementia and is a nursing home resident.  She developed typical chest
   pain consistent with an anterior STEMI by EKG.  She was treated with
   maximal medical therapy including IV heparin, clopidogrel, IV
   eptifibatide, morphine and morphine sulfate.   Aspirin and clopidogrel
   have been continued.  An echocardiogram showed a LVEF of approximately
   40% with mid and distal anterior hypokinesis.
   The patient continues to rest comfortably and is painfree.  She remains
   oriented times 1.
   She developed atrial fibrillation today without a rapid ventricular
   response.  She will be treated with beta blockers and continued on
   aspirin and clopidogrel without warfarin.
   Our primary goal continues to be patient comfort.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has signs of fluid overload, as indicated by lower extremity edema, pulmonary rales on exam, and an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray. The patient's history of cardiomegaly and the presence of an S3 heart sound could suggest CHF.

2. Arrhythmias: The patient has had episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is currently on metoprolol IV for rate control. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and continue with beta-blockers to prevent further episodes of AF.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially had an elevated creatinine level, indicating possible acute renal failure. However, it has since resolved to a creatinine level of 1.0.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's history and symptoms suggest significant CAD, with evidence of an anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient's EKG changes and troponin levels are consistent with this diagnosis.

5. Respiratory Complications: The patient has diffuse rales and rhonchi throughout the lungs, which may indicate pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status is necessary.

6. Dementia: The patient has a known history of dementia, which can complicate management and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with dementia who was transferred from an outside hospital with a STEMI. She is being medically managed after reversing her DNR/DNI status. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure, as evidenced by lower extremity edema, pulmonary rales, cardiomegaly on chest x-ray, and an EF of 40-45% with prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and regional systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD. She also has severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, mild-moderate mitral regurgitation, and possible aortic valve stenosis. The patient is currently on a Lasix drip at 10ml/hr and remains fluid overloaded.

The patient developed atrial fibrillation this morning with a heart rate of 110s and blood pressure in the 80s. She was given metoprolol IV and her heart rate responded well. She is now in flutter with a heart rate in the 100s and blood pressure in the 70s-80s. The plan is to continue monitoring her on tele and administer additional doses of metoprolol as needed.

The patient's coronary arteries show evidence of occlusion, specifically with ST elevations in anterior leads, suggesting an anterior MI. Her chest pain has been controlled with nitroglycerin and morphine. She underwent medical management of STEMI due to her medical comorbidities and improving EKG trends.

   CCU ATTENDING DAILY PROGRESS NOTE:
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and I
   concur with the history, physical examination, assessment, and
   treatment plan outlined above.  The physical examination is consistent
   with my own examination today.
   History:  As documented by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   Physical:  As documented by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
   Medical Decision Making:   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1198**] is a 87 year old woman with
   known aortic stenosis (peak velocity 4.3 M/sec) who suffers with
   dementia and is a nursing home resident.  She developed typical chest
   pain consistent with an anterior STEMI by EKG.  She was treated with
   maximal medical therapy including IV heparin, clopidogrel, IV
   eptifibatide, morphine and morphine sulfate.   Aspirin and clopidogrel
   have been continued.  An echocardiogram showed a LVEF of approximately
   40% with mid and distal anterior hypokinesis.
   Over the last evening, the patient developed atrial fibrillation
   without a rapid ventricular response.  She has been treated with beta
   blockers and continued on aspirin and clopidogrel.  We will not give
   her warfarin considering her underlying orientation and
   co-morbidities.
   We will continue diuresis to provide volume control.
   We would consider cardioversion in the event that she does not revert
   to sinus rhythm and develops hemodynamic instability due to a loss of
   her atrial kick and shortened diastolic filling period.
   Our primary goal continues to be patient comfort.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with dementia and a history of aortic stenosis, who presented with typical chest pain consistent with an anterior STEMI. The patient has been treated with maximal medical therapy including IV heparin, clopidogrel, IV eptifibatide, morphine, and aspirin. An echocardiogram showed a LVEF of approximately 40% with mid and distal anterior hypokinesis.

The patient developed atrial fibrillation overnight without a rapid ventricular response. She has been treated with beta blockers and continued on aspirin and clopidogrel. The decision not to give her warfarin is due to her underlying orientation and co-morbidities.

The primary goal is patient comfort, and cardioversion may be considered if she does not revert to sinus rhythm and develops hemodynamic instability due to a loss of her atrial kick and shortened diastolic filling period.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Congestive heart failure: The patient has evidence of fluid overload and cardiomegaly on chest x-ray, suggesting congestive heart failure. Lasix has been initiated to address this issue.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and potential complications such as stroke or thromboembolism. The patient's heart rate is currently controlled with beta blockers, but further management options may"

   Assessment and Plan
 87 year old female with dementia transferred from outside hospital
   with STEMI, being medically managed after reversal of DNR/DNI status,
   now back to DNR/DNI status.
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with lower extremity edema and pulmonary rales on exam.
   Cardiomegaly on chest x-ray. Lasix listed as outpatient medication.
   Fluid overload in setting of congestive heart failure. TTE showed EF
   40-45% with prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Possible aortic valve stenosis.  Lasix drip at 10ml/hr
   was d/c
ed last night when BP decreased to 70
s while sleeping.
   Remains fluid overloaded
   - Continue Metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5mg tid, ASA
   - Initiate Digoxin with loading dose and then maintenance dose to slow
   HR and increase CO and BP
   - Re-initiate Lasix drip, goal of -1.5-2L/day.
   - Patient will need to be started on ACE-I in the future, following
   diuresis
   .
   # RHYTHM: In a fib since [**11-19**] AM, previously sinus and intermittently
   V-pacing.  HR 80
s-110
s overnight with BP 70
s-80
s while sleeping.
   Did not respond to Metoprolol IV overnight, but did yesterday morning.
   Will decrease Metoprolol to 12.5mg tid to decrease BP effect and
   initiate Digoxin to decrease HR without significant BP effect.  Goal HR
   80-90
   - Initiate Digoxin to slow HR with minimal BP effect
   - Decrease Metoprolol to 12.5mg mg tid
   - On ASA, Plavix, but holding on Coumadin as patient high fall risk and
   risks outweight benefits of Coumadin
   - Daily EKGs
   .
   # CORONARIES: OSH EKG demonstrates ST elevations in anterior leads.
   Elevation V1 > 2.5 mm suggests occlusion LAD distal to septal branch
   resulting in anterior MI. EKG on admission to CCU showed decreasing ST
   elevations in V1-V3 and q waves in V4-V5, this morning with worsening
   ST elevations. Patient hemodynamically stable and chest pain free
   currently but was tachycardic in 90
s-100
s overnight and this morning,
   with chest pain and significant nausea overnight, which responded to
   Nitro drip and Morphine.  Nitro drip now d/c
ed, pt chest pain free
   overnight.  Metoprolol up-titrated recently for HR control.  Due to
   medical co-morbidities, improving EKG with q waves, hemodynamic
   stability underwent medical management of STEMI.  Now CEs trending down
   but still with ST elevations on EKG.
   - RV lift present on previous days exams, but will obtain focused TTE
   to r/o VSD as complication of STEMI
   - Continue Metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5mg tid
   - Continue Plavix, Atorvastatin, ASA
   - Hold outpatient Simvastatin 40 mg qd
   - Patient will need to be started on ACE-I, but hold now until after
   diuresis
   .
   # Renal failure: Acute renal failure, likely [**3-15**] hypoperfusion from
   STEMI, now resolved to Cr 1.0.
   - Reinitiate ACE once diuresis complete
   .
   # Dementia/Depression: Continue outpatient Aricept 10 mg qhs,
   Mitrazapine 15 mg qhs, Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Patient extremely needing
   Haldol previously, but calm since without need for Haldol.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Resolving, most likely related to ACS/STEMI. No obvious
   infiltrate on CXR, no symptoms of cough, fever.  Levaquin d/c
ed as no
   evidence of infection.
   # Dyslipidemia: Setting of ACS, Atorvastatin 80mg high dose.
   .
   # Hypertension: Metoprolol as above.  Nitro drip previously d/c
   Currently stable/low in setting of a fib.
   .
   # Overactive bladder: DC detrol.
   .
   # Osteoporosis: Hold fosamax and vitamin D while in house.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with dementia who was transferred from an outside hospital with a STEMI. She is being medically managed and has had her DNR/DNI status reversed, but is now back to DNR/DNI. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and has been found to have an EF of 40-45% with prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and regional systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD. She also has severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, mild-moderate mitral regurgitation, and possible aortic valve stenosis. The patient remains fluid overloaded despite Lasix treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications:
   - Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has been in AF since November 19th and has had rapid heart rates overnight, which could increase the risk of complications such as stroke.
   - Heart Failure: The patient's CHF exacerbation may worsen due to ongoing fluid overload and reduced cardiac output.
   - Ventricular Arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of CAD and reduced EF, there is a risk of ventricular arrhythmias, which could lead to hemodynamic instability.

2. Respiratory Complications:
   - Pulmonary Edema: The presence of diffuse rales in the mid lung fields bilaterally suggests pulmonary edema, which can compromise oxygenation and ventilation.
   - Pneumonia: The patient is"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's chief complaint is chest pain, and he presented to the emergency department with complaints of worsening chest pain radiating to the left arm. Upon arrival, the patient had a blood pressure of 105/43 mmHg, heart rate of 105 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

During the hospital course, the patient received Lasix 20mg IV for fluid overload and metoprolol 5mg IV for rate control due to atrial fibrillation. The patient's renal ultrasound showed no significant findings but cannot exclude right renal artery stenosis. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of chest pain.

On the flow sheet data as of 10:45 AM on [**2151-11-20**], the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate of 113 beats per minute, blood pressure of 81/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with dementia who was admitted to the ICU with a STEMI. She has a history of congestive heart failure, CAD, and is currently being medically managed. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has fluid overload, lower extremity edema, and pulmonary rales. Her EKG shows ST elevations in the anterior leads, indicating an occlusion in the LAD distal to the septal branch resulting in an anterior MI. The patient's CK and CK-MB levels are elevated, and she has been on a nitro drip and morphine for chest pain relief. Her renal function has improved, and she is now on a Lasix drip for fluid overload. She also has atrial fibrillation and is on metoprolol for rate control. The patient's other medical conditions include hypertension, dyslipidemia, dementia, depression, leukocytosis, overactive bladder, and osteoporosis. She is currently on several medications, including metoprolol, Lasix, heparin, Plavix, atorvastatin, and others. Her prognosis is guarded due to her age and comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of congestive heart failure and STEMI, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, or heart failure exacerbation.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old female with dementia transferred from outside hospital with
   STEMI, being medically managed after reversal of DNR/DNI status, now
   back to DNR/DNI status.
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with lower extremity edema and pulmonary rales on exam.
   Cardiomegaly on chest x-ray. Lasix listed as outpatient medication.
   Fluid overload in setting of congestive heart failure. TTE showed EF
   40-45% with prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Possible aortic valve stenosis.  Lasix drip was d/c
   the evening of [**11-19**] d/t SBP
s in the 70s. Remains fluid overloaded.
   - Increase Metoprolol to 25mg tid
   - ASA
   - Continue digoxin with loading dose and then maintenance dose of daily
   digoxin to slow HR
   - Check digoxin level tomorrow
   - Patient will need to be started on ACE-I in the future, following
   diuresis
   .

s overnight with BP 70
s-80
s while sleeping.
   Did not respond to Metoprolol IV overnight, but did yesterday morning.
   Goal HR 80-90
s. In atrial fibrillation in the 100s now. Concerned that
   heart will not tolerate atrial fibrillation, as need atrial kick to
   help with cardiac output versus aortic stenosis.
   - 2.5 mg IV metoprolol now
   - Cardiovert patient today out of atrial fibrillation
   - Heparin drip in preparation for cardioversion
   - Start Amiodarone 200mg PO tid
   - Continue Digoxin to slow HR with minimal BP effect
   - Increase metoprolol to 25 mg tid
   - On ASA, Plavix, but holding on Coumadin as patient high fall risk and
   risks outweight benefits of Coumadin
   - Daily EKGs
   - Restart lasix drip for continued diuresis, goal negative 1L today,
   titrate to >150cc/hour UOP
   .
   # CORONARIES: OSH EKG demonstrates ST elevations in anterior leads.
   Elevation V1 > 2.5 mm suggests occlusion LAD distal to septal branch
   resulting in anterior MI. EKG on admission to CCU showed decreasing ST
   elevations in V1-V3 and q waves in V4-V5, this morning with worsening
   ST elevations. Patient hemodynamically stable and chest pain free
   currently but was tachycardic in 90
s-100
s overnight and this morning,
   with chest pain and significant nausea overnight, which responded to
   Nitro drip and Morphine.  Nitro drip now d/c
ed, pt chest pain free
   overnight.  Metoprolol up-titrated recently for HR control.  Due to
   medical co-morbidities, improving EKG with q waves, hemodynamic
   stability underwent medical management of STEMI.  Now CEs trending down
   but still with ST elevations on EKG.  RV lift present on previous days
   exams, TTE showed no VSD (as complication of STEMI).
   - Continue Metoprolol at 25mg tid
   - Continue Plavix, Atorvastatin 80 daily, ASA
   - Hold outpatient Simvastatin 40 mg qd
   - Patient will need to be started on ACE-I, but hold now until after
   diuresis
   .
   # Renal failure: Acute renal failure, likely [**3-15**] hypoperfusion from
   STEMI, now resolved to Cr 0.9. Continue to diurese patient today with
   lasix.
   - Reinitiate ACE once diuresis complete
   .
   # Dementia/Depression: Continue outpatient Aricept 10 mg qhs,
   Mitrazapine 15 mg qhs, Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Patient extremely needing
   Haldol previously, but calm since without need for Haldol.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Resolving, most likely related to ACS/STEMI. No obvious

   CCU ATTENDING DAILY PROGRESS NOTE:
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment, and
   treatment plan outlined above.  The physical examination is consistent
   with my own examination today.
   History:  As documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].   While up in a chair, she
   developed nausea this morning.  She is not particularly short of
   breath.
   Physical:  As documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].   She has rales one half way up
   her posterior chest wall.
   Medical Decision Making:   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1198**] is a 87 year old woman with
   known aortic stenosis (peak velocity 4.3 M/sec) who suffers with
   dementia and is a nursing home resident.  She developed typical chest
   pain consistent with an anterior STEMI by EKG.  She was treated with
   maximal medical therapy including IV heparin, clopidogrel, IV
   eptifibatide, morphine and morphine sulfate.   Aspirin and clopidogrel
   have been continued.  An echocardiogram showed a LVEF of approximately
   40% with mid and distal anterior hypokinesis.
   Over the past 2 days, the patient developed atrial fibrillation now
   with a rapid ventricular response that has not responded to IV and oral
   beta blocker therapy.  Due to her underlying aortic stenosis, we will
   proceed with DC cardioversion and IV heparin after the procedure. We
   will monitor her for any worsening in bleeding after the procedure
   (guiac positive stools).   We will continue to force diuresis her but I
   suspect that this will be easier once she converts back to sinus
   rhythm,
   Our primary goal continues to be patient comfort.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with dementia who was admitted with a STEMI. The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and osteoporosis. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. STEMI: The patient presented with typical chest pain consistent with an anterior STEMI. She received maximal medical therapy including IV heparin, clopidogrel, IV eptifibatide, and morphine. Aspirin and clopidogrel have been continued.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which did not respond to IV and oral beta-blocker therapy. DC cardioversion is planned, followed by IV heparin. The patient will be monitored for any worsening in bleeding (guiac positive stools).

3. Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of fluid overload in the setting of congestive heart failure. Lasix was previously listed as an outpatient medication, but it was discontinued due to low blood pressure. The patient remains fluid overloaded.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has evidence of CAD with an occlusion in the LAD, resulting in an anterior myocardial infarction. The patient underwent medical management of STEMI due to medical comorbidities. There are no complications such as ventricular septal defect (VSD)."

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with dementia who was admitted to the ICU for STEMI. The patient had atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of up to 130s and blood pressure in the 80s. She was cardioverted and started on digoxin loading, which resulted in a heart rate of 80s to 100s and blood pressure in the 100s. The patient is continuing with digoxin load and will be treated with digoxin every other day.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.4°C (95.7°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 101/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm remains in atrial fibrillation.

The patient has a history of congestive heart failure, as evidenced by lower extremity edema, pulmonary rales, and cardiomegaly on chest x-ray. The patient was on Lasix but it was discontinued due to blood pressure in the 70s.

 87 year old female with dementia transferred from outside hospital
   with STEMI, being medically managed after reversal of DNR/DNI status,
   now back to DNR/DNI status.
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with lower extremity edema and pulmonary rales on exam.
   Cardiomegaly on chest x-ray. Lasix listed as outpatient medication.
   Fluid overload in setting of congestive heart failure. TTE showed EF
   40-45% with prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Possible aortic valve stenosis.  Lasix drip at 10ml/hr
   was d/c
ed last night when BP decreased to 70
s while sleeping.
   Remains fluid overloaded
   - Continue Metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5mg tid, ASA
   - Initiate Digoxin with loading dose and then maintenance dose to slow
   HR and increase CO and BP
   - Re-initiate Lasix drip, goal of -1.5-2L/day.
   - Patient will need to be started on ACE-I in the future, following
   diuresis
   .
   # RHYTHM: In a fib since [**11-19**] AM, previously sinus and intermittently
   V-pacing.  HR 80
s-110
s overnight with BP 70
s-80
s while sleeping.
   Did not respond to Metoprolol IV overnight, but did yesterday morning.
   Will decrease Metoprolol to 12.5mg tid to decrease BP effect and
   initiate Digoxin to decrease HR without significant BP effect.  Goal HR
   80-90
   - Initiate Digoxin to slow HR with minimal BP effect
   - Decrease Metoprolol to 12.5mg mg tid
   - On ASA, Plavix, but holding on Coumadin as patient high fall risk and
   risks outweight benefits of Coumadin
   - Daily EKGs
   .
   # CORONARIES: OSH EKG demonstrates ST elevations in anterior leads.
   Elevation V1 > 2.5 mm suggests occlusion LAD distal to septal branch
   resulting in anterior MI. EKG on admission to CCU showed decreasing ST
   elevations in V1-V3 and q waves in V4-V5, this morning with worsening
   ST elevations. Patient hemodynamically stable and chest pain free
   currently but was tachycardic in 90
s-100
s overnight and this morning,
   with chest pain and significant nausea overnight, which responded to
   Nitro drip and Morphine.  Nitro drip now d/c
ed, pt chest pain free
   overnight.  Metoprolol up-titrated recently for HR control.  Due to
   medical co-morbidities, improving EKG with q waves, hemodynamic
   stability underwent medical management of STEMI.  Now CEs trending down
   but still with ST elevations on EKG.
   - RV lift present on previous days exams, but will obtain focused TTE
   to r/o VSD as complication of STEMI
   - Continue Metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5mg tid
   - Continue Plavix, Atorvastatin, ASA
   - Hold outpatient Simvastatin 40 mg qd
   - Patient will need to be started on ACE-I, but hold now until after
   diuresis
   .
   # Renal failure: Acute renal failure, likely [**3-15**] hypoperfusion from
   STEMI, now resolved to Cr 1.0.
   - Reinitiate ACE once diuresis complete
   .
   # Dementia/Depression: Continue outpatient Aricept 10 mg qhs,
   Mitrazapine 15 mg qhs, Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Patient extremely needing
   Haldol previously, but calm since without need for Haldol.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Resolving, most likely related to ACS/STEMI. No obvious
   infiltrate on CXR, no symptoms of cough, fever.  Levaquin d/c
ed as no
   evidence of infection.
   # Dyslipidemia: Setting of ACS, Atorvastatin 80mg high dose.
   .
   # Hypertension: Metoprolol as above.  Nitro drip previously d/c
   Currently stable/low in setting of a fib.
   .
   # Overactive bladder: DC detrol.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 87-year-old female with dementia who was admitted to the ICU for management of STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). She underwent cardioversion and defibrillation successfully. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 94/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), as evidenced by lower extremity edema, pulmonary rales, and cardiomegaly on chest x-ray. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 40-45% with prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, regional systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease (CAD), particularly involving the mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery. There is also severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, mild-moderate mitral regurgitation, and possible aortic valve stenosis.

The patient's renal function was initially compromised but has now improved, with creatinine levels decreasing from 1.4 to 1.0 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count has been elevated but is resolving, likely related to the acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/STEMI.

   initiate Digoxin to decrease HR without significant BP effect.  Goal HR
   80-90
   - Initiate Digoxin to slow HR with minimal BP effect
   - Decrease Metoprolol to 12.5mg mg tid
   - On ASA, Plavix, but holding on Coumadin as patient high fall risk and
   risks outweight benefits of Coumadin
   - Daily EKGs
   .
   # CORONARIES: OSH EKG demonstrates ST elevations in anterior leads.
   Elevation V1 > 2.5 mm suggests occlusion LAD distal to septal branch
   resulting in anterior MI. EKG on admission to CCU showed decreasing ST
   elevations in V1-V3 and q waves in V4-V5, this morning with worsening
   ST elevations. Patient hemodynamically stable and chest pain free
   currently but was tachycardic in 90
s-100
s overnight and this morning,
   with chest pain and significant nausea overnight, which responded to
   Nitro drip and Morphine.  Nitro drip now d/c
ed, pt chest pain free
   overnight.  Metoprolol up-titrated recently for HR control.  Due to
   medical co-morbidities, improving EKG with q waves, hemodynamic
   stability underwent medical management of STEMI.  Now CEs trending down
   but still with ST elevations on EKG.
   - RV lift present on previous days exams, but will obtain focused TTE
   to r/o VSD as complication of STEMI
   - Continue Metoprolol at lower dose of 12.5mg tid
   - Continue Plavix, Atorvastatin, ASA
   - Hold outpatient Simvastatin 40 mg qd
   - Patient will need to be started on ACE-I, but hold now until after
   diuresis
   .
   # Renal failure: Acute renal failure, likely [**3-15**] hypoperfusion from
   STEMI, now resolved to Cr 1.0.
   - Reinitiate ACE once diuresis complete
   .
   # Dementia/Depression: Continue outpatient Aricept 10 mg qhs,
   Mitrazapine 15 mg qhs, Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Patient extremely needing
   Haldol previously, but calm since without need for Haldol.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Resolving, most likely related to ACS/STEMI. No obvious
   infiltrate on CXR, no symptoms of cough, fever.  Levaquin d/c
ed as no
   evidence of infection.
   # Dyslipidemia: Setting of ACS, Atorvastatin 80mg high dose.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of dementia, who was admitted to the ICU with a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, but previously had atrial fibrillation. She has been medically managed and her initial DNR/DNI status has been reversed, but now it has been changed back to DNR/DNI.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 70-94 mmHg and a heart rate between 68-116 bpm. She is receiving IV heparin, lasix, and metoprolol, and has been started on digoxin. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure, as evidenced by lower extremity edema, pulmonary rales, and cardiomegaly on chest x-ray. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% with prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, regional systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD (coronary artery disease), and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's renal function has improved from acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.0. She has a history of dementia and depression, for which she is being continued on Aricept, Mitrazapine, and Seroquel. The patient also has leukocytosis, which is resolving, likely related to ACS/STEMI. Her dyslipid"

   # PUMP: Patient with lower extremity edema and pulmonary rales on exam.
   Cardiomegaly on chest x-ray. Lasix listed as outpatient medication.
   Fluid overload in setting of congestive heart failure. TTE showed EF
   40-45% with prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Possible aortic valve stenosis.  Lasix drip re-started,
   patient diuresed ~1L in the past day (with total extra 100mg IV Lasix
   bolus as well as Lasix drip), ~-3.5 LOS, appears nearing dry weight,
   though still with rales at bases.  Given hypernatremia and approach to
   dry weight, would slow diuresis rate.
   - Consider decreasing Lasix drip to goal of -0.5-1L/day as patient
   hypernatremic.
   - Continue Metoprolol at 25mg tid
   - Consider initiating ACE-I tomorrow, after anticipated d/c of
   diuresis, as pt
s pressures higher and stable following cardioversion
   - CXR to evaluate fluid overload (and to r/o PNA given leukocytosis, as
   below)

s while sleeping.
   Pt cardioverted and currently in sinus with Amiodarone to maintain
   sinus rhythm.  Digoxin d/c
ed as patient in sinus and concern for
   interaction with Amiodarone.
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - On Heparin drip, holding on Coumadin as patient high fall risk and
   risks outweigh benefits of Coumadin
   - Daily EKGs
   .
   # CORONARIES: OSH EKG demonstrates ST elevations in anterior leads.
   Elevation V1 > 2.5 mm suggests occlusion LAD distal to septal branch
   resulting in anterior MI. EKG on admission to CCU showed decreasing ST
   elevations in V1-V3 and q waves in V4-V5, this morning with worsening
   ST elevations. Patient hemodynamically stable and chest pain free
   currently but was tachycardic in 90
s-100
s overnight and this morning,
   with chest pain and significant nausea overnight, which responded to
   Nitro drip and Morphine.  Nitro drip now d/c
ed, pt chest pain free
   overnight.  Metoprolol up-titrated recently for HR control.  Due to
   medical co-morbidities, improving EKG with q waves, hemodynamic
   stability underwent medical management of STEMI.  Now CEs trending down
   but still with ST elevations on EKG.  HR well controlled with increased
   dose of Metoprolol 25mg daily.  Focused TTE negative for VSD as
   possible complication of STEMI.
   - Continue Metoprolol at 25mg daily, Plavix, Atorvastatin, ASA
   - Hold outpatient Simvastatin 40 mg qd
   - Consider starting ACE-I tomorrow, once diuresis complete
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Patient with reported diarrhea, new leukocytosis but
   no fevers.  Will r/o infection as patient unable to give reliable
   history, though no clear evidence of infection on exam.
   - C. diff stool study as pt with report of diarrhea
   - UCx, as patient has foley in place
   - CXR to r/o PNA, though low suspicion

   # Renal failure: Acute renal failure, likely [**3-15**] hypoperfusion from
   STEMI, now resolved with stable Cr ~1.0.
   - Reinitiate ACE once diuresis complete

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of dementia and multiple medical conditions. She was admitted to the ICU with a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction), congestive heart failure, and pulmonary edema. The patient underwent cardioversion for atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure, and her symptoms such as lower extremity edema, pulmonary rales, and cardiomegaly on chest x-ray indicate ongoing fluid overload. Lasix has been restarted to promote diuresis and reduce fluid retention.

2. Arrhythmias: The patient has had episodes of atrial fibrillation and ventricular pacing. It is important to monitor the EKG daily and continue with amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm.

3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and reported diarrhea, which raises suspicion for an infection. Further investigations such as C. diff stool study, urine culture, and chest x-ray are needed to rule out infection.

4. Renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure, likely due to hypoperfusion from the STEMI. However, her creatinine levels have stabilized at around 1.0. It is important to monitor renal function closely and consider initiating ACE inhibitors once diuresis is complete.

   CCU ATTENDING DAILY PROGRESS NOTE:
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and I
   concur with the history, physical examination, assessment, and
   treatment plan outlined above.  I was present for the entire physical
   examination and the progress note documents my own findings.
   History:  As documented by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].   She refused her medication this
   morning but has now taken them with more encouragement.
   Physical:  As documented by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].   Her rales have improved.
   Medical Decision Making:   Ms. [**Known lastname 1198**] is an 87 year old woman with
   known aortic stenosis (peak velocity 4.3 M/sec) who suffers with
   dementia and is a nursing home resident.  She developed typical chest
   pain consistent with an anterior STEMI by EKG.  She was treated with
   maximal medical therapy including IV heparin, clopidogrel, IV
   eptifibatide, morphine and morphine sulfate.   Aspirin and clopidogrel
   have been continued.  An echocardiogram showed a LVEF of approximately
   40% with mid and distal anterior hypokinesis.
   After remaining in sinus rhythm for the past 18 hours following
   electrical cardioversion, the patient redeveloped atrial fibrillation
   this morning.  As a result of this recurrence, we will continue loading
   with Amiodarone (for rate control) and use intermittent IV beta
   blockers to keep her ventricular response rate < 80.  She has a VVI
   pacemaker.   We will discontinue her IV heparin and coumadin
   transition, and keep her on aspirin and clopidogrel alone for
   anticoagulation.
   Our primary goal continues to be patient comfort and we will transition
   her over to bolus diuretics with anticipation of moving her to the
   floor later today.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of dementia who was admitted to the ICU for STEMI (heart attack). The patient's medical history includes congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, dyslipidemia, dementia, depression, osteoporosis, and overactive bladder. 

The patient underwent cardioversion and defibrillation successfully on [**2151-11-21**] at 02:00 PM. She was converted to sinus rhythm with one shock of 200j. The patient was started on IV heparin, and Lopressor was increased to 25mg. There were concerns about significant drug-drug interactions with amiodarone and digoxin, so digoxin was discontinued, and amiodarone was continued as per cardiology fellow's recommendation.

The patient had episodes of diarrhea and agitation overnight. Her Lasix drip rate was increased again, and she received another Lasix IV bolus due to concerns of not meeting diuresis goals at midnight.

The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable with a heart rate range of 68-116 bpm, blood pressure range of 64-138 mmHg, respiratory rate range of 12-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 10.3 to 15.3 thousand/mm³. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, creatinine, and platelet count are within normal limits. Troponin-T levels have decreased from 3.66 to 0.10 ng/mL.

The patient's physical examination revealed coarse rales at bases bilaterally, trace pitting edema in dependent areas, and no acute distress. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pump: The patient has lower extremity edema and pulmonary rales on exam. Cardiomegaly is present on chest x-ray. The patient is being managed for congestive heart failure. A TTE showed ejection fraction of 40-45% with prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and regional systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and mild-moderate mitral regurgitation were also noted. Possible aortic valve stenosis was observed. The patient's fluid overload is being managed with Lasix, and the diuresis rate will be slowed down due to hypernatremia. 
- Discontinue Lasix drip.
- Initiate IV Lasix at 80mg to goal of -0.5-1L/day as the patient is hypernatremic.
- Continue Metoprolol at 25mg tid.
- Consider initiating ACE-I tomorrow after anticipated d/c of diuresis, as the patient's pressures are higher and stable following cardioversion.
- Obtain CXR to evaluate fluid overload (and to r/o P"

 87 year old female with dementia transferred from outside hospital
   with STEMI, being medically managed after reversal of DNR/DNI status,
   now back to DNR/DNI status.
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with lower extremity edema and pulmonary rales on exam.
   Cardiomegaly on chest x-ray. Lasix listed as outpatient medication.
   Fluid overload in setting of congestive heart failure. TTE showed EF
   40-45% with prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Severe
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Possible aortic valve stenosis.  Lasix drip re-started,
   patient diuresed ~1L in the past day (with total extra 100mg IV Lasix
   bolus as well as Lasix drip), ~-3.5 LOS, appears nearing dry weight,
   though still with rales at bases.  Given hypernatremia and approach to
   dry weight, would slow diuresis rate.
   - d/c Lasix drip
   - Initiate IV Lasix at 80mg [**Hospital1 **] to goal of -0.5-1L/day as patient
   hypernatremic.
   - Continue Metoprolol at 25mg tid
   - Consider initiating ACE-I tomorrow, after anticipated d/c of
   diuresis, as pt
s pressures higher and stable following cardioversion
   - CXR to evaluate fluid overload (and to r/o PNA given leukocytosis, as
   below)
   .
   # RHYTHM: In a fib since [**11-19**] AM, previously sinus and intermittently
   V-pacing.  HR 80
s-110
s overnight with BP 70
s-80
s while sleeping.
   Pt cardioverted and currently in sinus with Amiodarone to maintain
   sinus rhythm.  Digoxin d/c
ed as patient in sinus and concern for
   interaction with Amiodarone.
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - On Heparin drip
   - Initiate Coumadin x30 days
   - Daily EKGs
   .
   # CORONARIES: OSH EKG demonstrates ST elevations in anterior leads.
   Elevation V1 > 2.5 mm suggests occlusion LAD distal to septal branch
   resulting in anterior MI. EKG on admission to CCU showed decreasing ST
   elevations in V1-V3 and q waves in V4-V5, this morning with worsening
   ST elevations. Patient hemodynamically stable and chest pain free
   currently but was tachycardic in 90
s-100
s overnight and this morning,
   with chest pain and significant nausea overnight, which responded to
   Nitro drip and Morphine.  Nitro drip now d/c
ed, pt chest pain free
   overnight.  Metoprolol up-titrated recently for HR control.  Due to
   medical co-morbidities, improving EKG with q waves, hemodynamic
   stability underwent medical management of STEMI.  Now CEs trending down
   but still with ST elevations on EKG.  HR well controlled with increased
   dose of Metoprolol 25mg daily.  Focused TTE negative for VSD as
   possible complication of STEMI.
   - Continue Metoprolol at 25mg daily, Plavix, Atorvastatin, ASA
   - Hold outpatient Simvastatin 40 mg qd
   - Consider starting ACE-I tomorrow, once diuresis complete
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Patient with reported diarrhea, new leukocytosis but
   no fevers.  Will r/o infection as patient unable to give reliable
   history, though no clear evidence of infection on exam.
   - C. diff stool study as pt with report of diarrhea
   - UCx, as patient has foley in place
   - CXR to r/o PNA, though low suspicion
   .
   # Renal failure: Acute renal failure, likely [**3-15**] hypoperfusion from
   STEMI, now resolved with stable Cr ~1.0.
   - Reinitiate ACE once diuresis complete
   .
   # Dementia/Depression: Continue outpatient Aricept 10 mg qhs,
   Mitrazapine 15 mg qhs, Seroquel 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Patient extremely needing
   Haldol previously, calm for several days but again agitated again,
   though not given Haldol.  Will r/o infectious cause of
   delirium/agitation as above.
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Setting of ACS, Atorvastatin 80mg high dose.
   .
   # Hypertension: Metoprolol as above.  Nitro drip previously d/c
   Currently stable on current regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of dementia who was admitted to the ICU with a STEMI (heart attack). She has been medically managed and has had several changes in her treatment plan. Her current condition includes congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and leukocytosis. She also has multiple comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, and overactive bladder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and signs of fluid overload indicate possible cardiogenic shock due to her congestive heart failure.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of pulmonary rales on examination suggests the possibility of pulmonary edema, which can be a complication of congestive heart failure.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events like stroke.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection or inflammation, which needs further investigation.
5. Diarrhea: The reported diarrhea could be a sign of an underlying infection or gastrointestinal issue.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's previous acute renal failure, although resolved, could potentially recur if there is worsening of her congestive heart failure or other renal insults.
7. Delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium may be related to her dementia, recent cardiac"
