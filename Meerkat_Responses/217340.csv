","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who underwent T2-7 spinal fusion. He presented with hypotension, fever, and abdominal distention. Blood cultures showed growth of Gram-Negative Rods (GNRs) in both urine and blood. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl. His vital signs are stable, but he has a history of Ogilvies syndrome and concern for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient is also being evaluated for further radiation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: Given the presence of GNRs in both urine and blood, there is a potential risk of urosepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate management with antibiotics are crucial.
2. Gut Translocation: Due to the massively dilated colon, there is a possibility of gut translocation, which can lead to bacterial translocation into the bloodstream and cause sepsis.
3. C. diff Infection: Although the stool toxin was negative, the patient's clinical presentation raises concerns for C. diff infection. Further stool studies should be conducted, and appropriate treatment should be initiated if positive.
4. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, which needs to be managed appropriately. Continued fluid repletion and addressing electrolyte imbalances are important.
5. Abdominal Distention: The patient's abdominal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented for evaluation of further radiation therapy. He has had a course complicated by post-operative ileus, now with hypotension and fever. The patient's current assessment includes hypotension/fever, diarrhea, RCC, s/p T2-7 spinal fusion, ileus, hypoxia, DVT, HTN, and FEN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Fever: The patient has shown signs of hypotension and fever, indicating a possible infection or sepsis. Immediate measures such as bolus fluids and antibiotic therapy are being taken to address this condition.
2. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, which could be due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, especially considering the CT scan findings. Aggressive repletion of electrolytes, surveillance blood cultures, and empirical antibiotic therapy are being implemented.
3. RCC: The patient has metastatic renal cell carcinoma, which may have spread to the brain and lungs. Future plans for systemic therapy will be discussed, along with cyberknife treatment for the brain mass.
4. S/p T2-7 Spinal Fusion: The patient underwent spinal fusion surgery, and TLSO (thoracolumbosacral orthosis) is recommended while out of bed. Pain control and physical therapy consultations have been arranged.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who is experiencing fever, hypotension, and diarrhea. The patient has a history of postoperative ileus following spinal fusion surgery, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and brain metastases for which he is on steroids.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 104/65 mmHg to 121/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient's general appearance is well-nourished and not in acute distress.

Physical examination reveals crackles at the left base of the chest, distended abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds, and no peripheral edema or muscle wasting. Neurological examination shows normal tone and purposeful movement.

Laboratory findings indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.5 thousand cells/mm³, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 105 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, and glucose levels within normal range. Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), low albumin levels, and abnormal coagulation profile (PTT and INR).

The patient's assessment includes hypotension, fever,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented for evaluation of further radiation therapy. He has been experiencing hypotension and fever, likely due to urosepsis or gut translocation from massively dilated colon. His urine culture showed pan-sensitive E. coli, and he is currently on cefepime with plans to narrow coverage once blood cultures are available. He is also on surveillance blood cultures, and antibiotics have been changed to cover for possible C. difficile infection. The patient's diarrhea is a concern, and he has undergone replete lytes aggressively. He will continue to have p.m. K and Mg, and surgery will be following up with him. The patient's ileus appears to be post-op in origin, and he will be monitored for stool studies. He has been prescribed simethicone and narcotics have been minimized. The patient's metastatic renal cell carcinoma has also been discussed, including possible cyberknife treatment for brain metastasis and systemic therapy in the future. He is currently on dexamethasone for cerebral swelling and will continue with pain control using Tylenol and oxycodone. Physical examination revealed a well-nourished patient with a slightly distended abdomen and no tenderness. His vital signs are stable, but he does have crackles at the left base of his lungs. His laboratory results show normal WBC count, slightly elevated Hct, and slightly decreased platelet count. Other lab values"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented for evaluation of further radiation therapy. The patient's course has been complicated by post-operative ileus, hypotension, and fever. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with urosepsis caused by GNR in both urine and blood, as well as a pan-sensitive E. coli in the urine. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl.

The patient is also experiencing diarrhea, which is a concern for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Stool studies are pending, and the patient is receiving aggressive repletion of electrolytes. Serial abdominal exams are being conducted, and the patient will have repeat KUB (kidney, ureter, and bladder) and abdominal X-ray today to evaluate for free air. 

The patient has a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma that has spread to the brain and likely the lungs and liver. There are plans for systemic therapy in the future, including cyberknife treatment for the brain mass and potential chemotherapy. 

The patient also underwent T2-7 spinal fusion surgery and is wearing a TLSO (thoracolumbosacral orthosis) while out of bed. There is a concern for cord compression despite urinary retention, and a PT (physical therapy) consult has been ordered.

Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with"
