   24 Hour Events:
   call out but no bed
   CP free
   weaned nitro
   dc heparin
   prn breakthrough pain control with oxycodone 15 mg
   TEE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   thinned and akinetic (mildly aneurysmal) basal inferior and
   inferolateral segments. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
   There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2168-4-19**], basal inferior hypokinesis was reported
   previously. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
   similar.

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI), who presented to the ICU with chest pain. He underwent multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and is currently on various cardiac medications. The patient also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and received heparin therapy. Additionally, he has undergone renal transplantation and is being treated with cyclosporine and prednisone. The patient is experiencing neuropathic pain and is on pain management medication. He is currently euvolemic but has mildly depressed left ventricular function with wall motion abnormalities consistent with prior infarcts. The patient's renal function has been deteriorating, and his creatinine level is increasing. He has replete electrolytes and is receiving prophylaxis for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and previous MI puts him at risk for further cardiac events such as unstable angina, myocardial ischemia, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
2. Renal complications: The patient's deteriorating renal function and increasing creatinine levels indicate a possible acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to his history of cardiac issues, which can lead to pulmonary edema or respiratory failure.
4. Infection complications:"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with chest pain after experiencing a myocardial infarction (MI). He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 114/64 mmHg and a heart rate of 65 bpm. His oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. The patient's TEE shows mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinned and akinetic (mildly aneurysmal) basal inferior and inferolateral segments. There is no evidence of aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation, and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently on heparin. His renal function is impaired, and he is being treated with cyclosporine and prednisone. The patient's neuropathy is managed with pain medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and previous MI, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as angina, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
2. Renal Complications: The patient's impaired renal function may lead to further deterioration or the development of renal failure.
3. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction increases"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a middle-aged male admitted to the ICU with a history of renal failure and myocardial infarction. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/64 mmHg to 143/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a normal S1 and S2 heart sound without any murmurs, lifts, or thrills. The patient's abdomen is soft with no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly. There are no abnormal findings on the skin examination. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels but within normal range for the patient's history of renal failure. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and elevated creatinine levels indicate compromised renal function. AKI can occur due to various factors such as hypotension, dehydration, or medication side effects. Close monitoring of fluid balance, urine output, and electrolyte levels is crucial to prevent and manage AKI.

2. Infection: The patient's slightly elevated white blood cell count may suggest an underlying infection. Infections in the ICU can"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction who presented to the ICU with chest pain. He has undergone multiple percutaneous coronary interventions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 114/64 to 143/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is oriented and in no apparent distress. Physical examination reveals a regular heart rhythm and no murmurs or abnormal findings on auscultation of the heart. No jugular venous distention is noted. There are no abnormalities observed on chest examination. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no palpable masses or bruits. Extremities show good pulses bilaterally. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Troponin-T levels are within normal range. The patient is currently being treated for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is on various cardiac medications including aspirin, metoprolol, and statin therapy. The plan is to perform a stress test tomorrow if the patient experiences chest pain, otherwise, a coronary angiogram will be performed. The patient's renal transplant status and history of deep vein thrombosis are also noted.

The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI), who presented with chest pain. The patient underwent multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 114/64 mmHg, heart rate of 65 bpm, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is oriented and in no acute distress.

Echocardiogram findings show mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular cavity size, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and thinned and akinetic basal inferior and inferolateral segments. The right ventricular chamber size and motion are normal. There is no evidence of aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation, and the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal, and there is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

The patient has allergies to Cymbalta and Ativan. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on [**2175-4-19**]. The patient is receiving various infusions and other medications in the ICU. Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except as noted below.
