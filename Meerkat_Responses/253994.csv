   24 Hour Events:
   - CXR showed ? RLL consolidation, with pulm edema so started on
   levo/azithro for s. pneumo double coverage and given lasix 20 mg IV.
   Pt was afebrile overnight with diuresis od 6320 cc at MN.
   - Desats yesterday evening to mid 80s.  On high flow mask ABG:
   7.41/57/51.  Switched to a trial of Noninvasive CPAP and ABG
   7.41/62/52.  Pt could not tolerate non-invasive and since gas pt was
   relatively [**Name2 (NI) 284**] free while on high flow facemask, she was switched
   back.  O2 saturations remained in the low 90s on high flow facemask
   throughout the night.
   - CE checked due to concern about new pulm edema caused by CHF with
   infarct.  2 sets CE negative thus far.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of dyspnea. The patient has a history of COPD and was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to a COPD exacerbation with pneumonia (PNA) and volume overload. The patient received levo/azithro for S. Pneumonia coverage, lasix 20 mg IV for diuresis, and bronchodilators. The patient's condition improved overnight with an increased urine output of 6320 cc at midnight. However, the patient desaturated to the mid-80s in the evening and required high flow mask ABG. The patient's ABG showed pH 7.41, PaCO2 57, and PaO2 51. The patient was switched to noninvasive CPAP but could not tolerate it and was switched back to high flow facemask with O2 saturations remaining in the low 90s throughout the night. The patient also had a central line evaluation due to concern about new pulmonary edema caused by congestive heart failure (CHF) with infarct, but two sets of central line evaluations were negative. The patient's allergies include Motrin (Ibuprofen), Compazine (Prochlorperazine Maleate), Vancomycin and derivatives, Haldol (Haloperidol Lactate), and Nitrofurantoin. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was ceftria"

","Summary:
The patient is a 138 kg overweight, well-nourished 38-year-old male with a chief complaint of dyspnea. The patient has been diagnosed with right lower lobe consolidation and pulmonary edema. He has been started on levo/azithro for Staphylococcus pneumonia double coverage and given lasix 20 mg IV. The patient's overnight events include desaturation to mid 80s, use of high flow mask, and subsequent switch back to high flow facemask due to inability to tolerate non-invasive CPAP. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 57, and PaO2 of 51 on high flow facemask. The patient was initially on non-invasive CPAP but could not tolerate it and was switched back to high flow facemask. His O2 saturations remained in the low 90s throughout the night. A chest x-ray was performed and showed new pulmonary edema, possibly secondary to congestive heart failure with infarct. Two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative thus far. The patient has allergies to Motrin, Compazine, vancomycin and derivatives, Haldol, and nitrofurantoin. He received ceftriaxone at 03:51 AM on 12/23/2159. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 105/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for improved dyspnea since yesterday. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished, overweight individual with no acute distress, crackles at the mid L lung field, and symmetric chest expansion. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, potassium of 3.7 mEq/L, and sodium of 137 mEq/L. The patient's medical history includes HIV (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, and urinary tract infection. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or pneumonia.
2. Congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema.
3. Urinary tract infection.
4. HIV-related complications, such as opportunistic infections or immune dysfunction.
5. Possible adverse drug reactions or allergies.
6. Potential worsening of the patient's underlying conditions, such as COPD or heart failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent episodes of urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia, respiratory failure, and an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient is currently receiving care in the ICU with multiple interventions, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of COPD and current respiratory failure, there is a high risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or exacerbation of COPD symptoms.

2. Infection: The patient has a history of UTI and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). There is a potential for new infections or antibiotic resistance due to the use of multiple antibiotics.

3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's vital signs show borderline hypertension, and there is a possibility of developing cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

4. Diabetic Complications: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating possible uncontrolled diabetes. This increases the risk of diabetic complications like hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.

5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's creatinine"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of HIV/AIDS, obesity, chronic pain, mood disorder, migraines, and COPD. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 127/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 79%. She is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and IV lasix for diuresis. The patient's recent CD4 count is 280 (25%), which is lower than her previous count of 980. She also has a history of Enterococcus infection in her urine and moderate OP flora with PCP in her sputum. Her labs show elevated WBC, Hct, and slightly abnormal electrolyte levels. Her CXR shows signs of fluid overload and an enlarged cardiac silhouette but no new parenchymal opacities. The patient's assessment includes hypoxemia, possibly due to an infectious or noninfectious cause. Infectious causes such as PCP and bacterial pneumonia have been ruled out, but other possibilities like atypical bacteria, respiratory virus, or shunt should be considered. Noninfectious causes like COPD exacerbation and pulmonary edema are also possible. The patient's HIV/AIDS status should be managed with appropriate medications. The plan includes further tests and treatments for hypoxemia, such as"

 HYPOXEMIA
   Uncertain whether this is infectious or not in etiology.  WBC up
   slightly today, but could reflect steroids. Patient does have h/o HIV
   but preserved CD4 recently (dip to 280 less reliable indicator in
   setting of acute illness) and two negative DFA screens for PCP make PCP
   less likely. LDH is elevated, though this is not at all specific for
   PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 59**] lobar infiltrate suggestive of a typical bacterial pneumonia.
   Consider atypical bacteria also respiratory virus.  Fungal/TB seem less
   likely. Among noninfectious causes, patient does have COPD with
   baseline home O2 requirement.  No evidence for PE on recent CTA. Shunt
   either intracardiac or intrapulmonary merits consideration given marked
   hypoxia. Chest film does suggest some degree of pulmonary edema
   --Check nasopharyngeal aspirate for viral antigen screen and culture.
   Add on differential to CBC
   --Check TTE to assess for shunting, repeat ABG
   --Continue bronchodilators for COPD, tapering steroids

   *** Patient threatened to leave AMA on [**12-24**].
    She did not appear to have a good understanding of the seriousness of
   her respiratory status. If she is serious about leaving she needs to be
   seen by psychiatry to ensure that she has capacity to leave.
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of HIV/AIDS, chronic pain, mood disorder, migraines, and COPD. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and has been experiencing decreased oxygen saturation levels despite being on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 127/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 79%. Her telemetry shows desaturation to 70%. Fluid balance shows a net negative 1,515 mL balance since 12 AM, with total input of 3,410 mL and total output of 4,925 mL.

The patient has a CD4 count of 281 (25%), indicating some degree of immunocompromise. Her HIV medications include atazanavir/ritonavir, emtricitabine/tenofovir, HCTZ, and propranolol. She is also on various other medications for her chronic pain, mood disorder, and migraines.

Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for occasional non-productive cough. She denies shortness of breath or pleuritic chest pain. The physical examination reveals crackles in the bilateral lung fields and no other abnormalities. The patient appears to be overweight/obese.

Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.1 K/uL, hem"

","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has been asking to leave the hospital, and there is no clear etiology for the respiratory failure. The patient may have significant alveolar disease and is awaiting an echo with bubbles to confirm. The patient also has a history of HIV, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), urinary tract infection (UTI), and agitation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, exacerbation of COPD, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential bloodstream infections due to the presence of central venous lines. Additionally, the patient's agitation and threat to sign out against medical advice (AMA) should be addressed promptly to prevent any potential complications related to non-compliance with treatment or self-discharge."

   that the presence of an ASD/PFO could not be confirmed or refuted, even
   after the injection of agitated saline.
   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOXEMIA
   Etiology remains uncertain. Does have severe COPD with home O2 but
   oxygen requirements still above her baseline.  ABG repeated yesterday
   shows hypoxia somewhat improved (P02 was 45 on [**12-22**]). O2 saturation
   improved following diuresis
 consistent with a contribution from
   pulmonary edema. Difficult to say whether the edema is cardiogenic or
   not as recent TTE of poor quality; EF was 60% but WMA could not be
   excluded. Cardiac catheterization could be a helpful next step
 could
   check LVgram, also assess for shunt (could not rule out shunt on TTE).
   No evidence of PE on CTA chest.  Infectious workup has been negative to
   date, patient currently on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
   --If she leaves AMA today would send her home on levofloxacin PO x7
   days for broad empiric coverage.
   --If stays, will consult cardiology regarding ?cath and further workup
   for her pulmonary edema. If she leaves, will arrange for her to follow
   up with cardiology as outpatient.
   --Continue lasix diuresis today with goal at least 1 liter net
   negative, will give additional 80IV lasix
   --Follow up cultures including nasopharyngeal washings
   --Continue bronchodilators and steroid taper
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   ID recommendations appreciated.
   --Continue truvada, boosted atazanavir
 Migraines
   Continue propranolol ppx with triptan prn
 Mood disorder
   Continue outpatient regimen buspar, diazepam, and lamictal
   Will consult psychiatry today regarding patient
s capacity for leaving
   AMA. She does not appear to fully appreciate the risks of going home
   given her current respiratory status, which is still worse than her
   baseline.  Risks include, but are not limited to, respiratory
   decompensation leading to death or septic shock.
 Chronic pain
   Continue neurontin and methadone, limit prn dilaudid as may be
   contributing to confusion worsened with steroids

   *** Patient threatened to leave AMA on [**12-24**].
    She did not appear to have a good understanding of the seriousness of
   her respiratory status. If she is serious about leaving she needs to be
   seen by psychiatry to ensure that she has capacity to leave.
","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old obese woman admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxemia of uncertain etiology. She has a history of severe COPD, HIV infection, migraines, mood disorder, and chronic pain. The patient's current medications include ceftriaxone, azithromycin, prednisone, atazanavir/ritonavir, emtricitabine/tenofovir, HCTZ/propranolol, fluticasone-salmeterol, tiotropium, ipratropium nebs, bupropion, lamotrigine, diazepam, gabapentin, and methadone. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 123/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient has trace bilateral edema and is receiving diuretic therapy with lasix. Imaging studies show evidence of atelectasis versus edema in the parenchyma on chest X-ray, and an echocardiogram reveals a very poor technical quality due to the patient's body habitus, with left ventricular function probably normal and a focal wall motion abnormality that cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well seen, and no pathologic valvular abnormality is seen."

 HYPOXEMIA
   Uncertain whether this is infectious or not in etiology.  WBC up
   slightly today, but could reflect steroids. Patient does have h/o HIV
   but preserved CD4 recently (dip to 280 less reliable indicator in
   setting of acute illness) and two negative DFA screens for PCP make PCP
   less likely. LDH is elevated, though this is not at all specific for
   PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 59**] lobar infiltrate suggestive of a typical bacterial pneumonia.
   Consider atypical bacteria also respiratory virus.  Fungal/TB seem less
   likely. Among noninfectious causes, patient does have COPD with
   baseline home O2 requirement.  No evidence for PE on recent CTA. Shunt
   either intracardiac or intrapulmonary merits consideration given marked
   hypoxia. Chest film does suggest some degree of pulmonary edema
   --Check nasopharyngeal aspirate for viral antigen screen and culture.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old with a history of HIV, being treated in the ICU for respiratory issues. The patient has been on various medications including ceftriaxone, azithromycin, diuretics, and steroids. They have shown some improvement in their condition but still have a persistent hypoxemia. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in temperature. They have a history of migraines, mood disorder, and chronic pain, for which they are receiving appropriate medication. The patient's recent lab results indicate a slightly elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactic acid levels, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). There are no signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or stress ulcers. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient continues to experience low oxygen levels in their blood, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not addressed promptly.
2. Possible Pneumonia: The patient has a lobar infiltrate on their chest X-ray, suggesting a possible bacterial pneumonia. This will require further evaluation and treatment.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The chest X-ray also indicates some degree of pulmonary edema, which may be contributing to the hypoxemia.
4. Cardiac Shunt: Given the marked hypoxia, the possibility of an intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunt"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOXEMIA
   Etiology remains uncertain. Does have severe COPD with home O2 but
   oxygen requirements still above her baseline.  ABG repeated yesterday
   shows hypoxia somewhat improved (P02 was 45 on [**12-22**]). O2 saturation
   improved following diuresis
 consistent with a contribution from
   pulmonary edema. Difficult to say whether the edema is cardiogenic as
   recent TTE of poor quality; EF was 60% but WMA could not be excluded.
   Cardiac catheterization could be a helpful next step
 could check
   LVgram, also assess for shunt (could not rule out shunt on TTE).  No
   evidence of PE on CTA chest.  Infectious workup has been negative to
   date, patient currently on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
   --If she leaves AMA today would send her home on levofloxacin PO x7
   days for broad empiric coverage.
   --If stays, will consult cardiology regarding ?cath and further workup
   for her pulmonary edema. If she leaves, will arrange for her to follow
   up with cardiology as outpatient.
   --Continue lasix diuresis today with goal at least 1 liter net
   negative, will give additional 80IV lasix
   --Follow up cultures including nasopharyngeal washings
   --Continue bronchodilators and steroid taper

   Will consult psychiatry today regarding patient
s capacity for leaving
   AMA. She does not appear to fully appreciate the risks of going home
   given her current respiratory status, which is still worse than her
   baseline.  Risks include, but are not limited to, respiratory
   decompensation leading to death or septic shock.

    She did not appear to have a good understanding of the seriousness of
   her respiratory status. If she is serious about leaving she needs to be
   seen by psychiatry to ensure that she has capacity to leave.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including HIV, chronic pain, mood disorder, migraines, and COPD. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and hypoxemia of uncertain etiology.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7 C (98 F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/78 to 147/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. She has been diuresed with Lasix for pulmonary edema.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated glucose levels, slightly decreased white blood cell count, and elevated lactic acid levels. Her HIV viral load is significantly increased compared to her previous value of 980 copies.

The patient's imaging studies reveal some atelectasis and edema in the parenchyma, but an echocardiogram done to evaluate for PFO was of poor quality and unable to provide conclusive results. A CT angiogram did not show evidence of pulmonary embolism.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing bronchodilators and steroid taper, follow-up cultures including nasopharyngeal washings, and monitoring for infectious causes. She is also being treated for her mood disorder, migraines, chronic pain, and HIV.

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory decompensation leading to death"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several health conditions. They are experiencing hypoxemia and respiratory failure, with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is also uncertainty regarding the presence of HIV/AIDS. The patient has expressed a desire to sign out against medical advice (AMA) and has been informed of the risks involved. Pain control is also a concern for the patient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels can lead to further respiratory distress and potential organ damage if not addressed promptly.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's current respiratory failure, there is a risk of developing ARDS, which can significantly worsen lung function and require advanced medical interventions.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient may have had prior heart attacks, as suggested by the ECG findings. Further cardiac evaluation and management are needed to assess and address any underlying cardiac issues.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's elevated glucose levels could indicate poorly controlled diabetes, increasing the risk of DKA, a serious condition characterized by high blood sugar, ketone production, and acidosis.
5. Infection: The presence of an elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels suggests the possibility of an infection, which may require prompt identification and treatment.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing blood clots"

 HYPOXEMIA
   Etiology remains uncertain. Does have severe COPD with home O2 but
   oxygen requirements still above her baseline.  ABG repeated yesterday
   shows hypoxia somewhat improved (P02 was 45 on [**12-22**]). O2 saturation
   improved following diuresis
 consistent with a contribution from
   pulmonary edema. Difficult to say whether the edema is cardiogenic as
   recent TTE of poor quality; EF was 60% but WMA could not be excluded.
   Cardiac catheterization could be a helpful next step
 could check
   LVgram, also assess for shunt (could not rule out shunt on TTE).  No
   evidence of PE on CTA chest.  Infectious workup has been negative to
   date, patient currently on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
   --If she leaves AMA today would send her home on levofloxacin PO x7
   days for broad empiric coverage.
   --If stays, will consult cardiology regarding ?cath and further workup
   for her pulmonary edema. If she leaves, will arrange for her to follow
   up with cardiology as outpatient.
   --Continue lasix diuresis today with goal at least 1 liter net
   negative, will give additional 80IV lasix
   --Follow up cultures including nasopharyngeal washings
   --Continue bronchodilators and steroid taper

   Will consult psychiatry today regarding patient
s capacity for leaving
   AMA. She does not appear to fully appreciate the risks of going home
   given her current respiratory status, which is still worse than her
   baseline.  Risks include, but are not limited to, respiratory
   decompensation leading to death or septic shock.
 Chronic pain
   Continue neurontin and methadone, limit prn dilaudid as may be

   *** Patient threatened to leave AMA on [**12-25**].
   She was seen by psych and felt NOT to have capacity to leave AMA. If
   threatens again talk to her HCP, c/s psych if needed
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old obese male with a history of multiple medical conditions including HIV/AIDS, COPD, and mood disorder. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient's main complaints include a nonproductive cough, mild dyspnea, and pleuritic chest discomfort. He also reports a ""burning"" sensation at the site of his right peripheral intravenous (PIV) line. 

The patient's recent events include threatened to leave against medical advice (AMA) but agreed to stay after discussion with the healthcare provider (HCP). He is still experiencing hematuria and hemorrhoidal bleeding following the removal of his Foley catheter. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 74 bpm (range 59-79 bpm), blood pressure of 128/68 mmHg (range 76-139/28-89 mmHg), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (range 9-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97% on 3L nasal cannula with 10L/min fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 0.4 mask. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 295 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.2 g/dL, leukocyte count of 8.4 K/uL, and platelet count of [**Telephone/Fax (3) 402**]95. Other lab values are within normal limits. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several ongoing assessments and plans. He is being treated for hypoxemia, with ongoing oxygen therapy and diuresis. The etiology of his hypoxemia remains uncertain, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. The patient's severe COPD and oxygen requirements above his baseline suggest a possible contribution from pulmonary edema. Cardiac causes, such as cardiogenic edema or a cardiac shunt, should be considered and ruled out. 

Infectious workup has been negative to date, and the patient is currently on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. If the patient leaves AMA today, he will be sent home on levofloxacin PO x7 days for broad empiric coverage. If he stays, cardiology consultation will be arranged to discuss cardiac catheterization and further workup for his pulmonary edema. 

The patient's HIV/AIDS management should continue with truvada and boosted atazanavir. His migraines and mood disorder medications should also be continued. A psychiatry consultation is planned regarding the patient's capacity for leaving AMA. 

ICU care will continue with regular nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures including stress ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis prevention."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old obese woman with a history of COPD, HIV/AIDS, migraines, mood disorder, chronic pain, and multiple comorbidities. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient's oxygen saturation has improved following diuresis, suggesting pulmonary edema as a contributing factor. However, the etiology of her hypoxemia remains uncertain. The patient's cardiac function is being evaluated, and cardiac catheterization is being considered. The infectious workup has been negative to date, and she is currently on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and she does not fully appreciate the risks of leaving the hospital. She has been started on a psychiatric evaluation to assess her capacity for leaving against medical advice (AMA). The patient's chronic pain management plan includes neurontin and methadone, with limited prn dilaudid due to possible confusion worsened by steroids. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory decompensation leading to death or septic shock: The patient's respiratory status is still worse than her baseline, and she has a history of severe COPD with home oxygen. If she leaves AMA, she may face risks such as respiratory decompensation, which could lead to death or septic shock.

 HYPOXEMIA
   Etiology remains uncertain. Does have severe COPD with home O2 but
   oxygen requirements still above her baseline.  ABG repeated yesterday
   shows hypoxia somewhat improved (P02 was 45 on [**12-22**]). O2 saturation
   improved following diuresis
 consistent with a contribution from
   pulmonary edema. Difficult to say whether the edema is cardiogenic as
   recent TTE of poor quality; EF was 60% but WMA could not be excluded.
   Cardiac catheterization could be a helpful next step
 could check
   LVgram, also assess for shunt (could not rule out shunt on TTE).  No
   evidence of PE on CTA chest.  Infectious workup has been negative to
   date, patient currently on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
   --If she leaves AMA today would send her home on levofloxacin PO x7
   days for broad empiric coverage.
   --If stays, will consult cardiology regarding ?cath and further workup
   for her pulmonary edema. If she leaves, will arrange for her to follow
   up with cardiology as outpatient.
   --Continue lasix diuresis today with goal at least 1 liter net
   negative, will give additional 80IV lasix
   --Follow up cultures including nasopharyngeal washings
   --Continue bronchodilators and steroid taper
 HIV (HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS, ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
   SYNDROME, AIDS)
   ID recommendations appreciated.
   --Continue truvada, boosted atazanavir
 Migraines
   Continue propranolol ppx with triptan prn
 Mood disorder
   Continue outpatient regimen buspar, diazepam, and lamictal
   Will consult psychiatry today regarding patient
s capacity for leaving
   AMA. She does not appear to fully appreciate the risks of going home
   given her current respiratory status, which is still worse than her
   baseline.  Risks include, but are not limited to, respiratory
   decompensation leading to death or septic shock.
 Chronic pain
   Continue neurontin and methadone, limit prn dilaudid as may be
   contributing to confusion worsened with steroids

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old obese individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. They have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, which has resulted in acute respiratory failure. The patient also has HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and is currently experiencing hypoxemia. The patient's pain control is also a concern, both acute and chronic.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of COPD, bronchitis, and emphysema, along with the current acute exacerbation, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening of the COPD.

2. Infection: As an immunocompromised patient with HIV/AIDS, the patient is at an increased risk of developing infections. This could include bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, which may require prompt identification and treatment.

3. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient's obesity puts them at risk for cardiovascular problems. Additionally, the use of certain medications and the stress of the ICU stay may contribute to cardiac issues such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

4. Pressure Ulcers: Due to the patient's prolonged immobility in the ICU, they are at risk for developing pressure ulcers"

","The patient is a 51-year-old female with HIV who presented with fever and shortness of breath. She has a history of allergies to certain medications and is currently on multiple medications for her HIV, COPD, and other conditions. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 128/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 3L NC with 10L/min FiO2 0.4 mask.

The patient's 24-hour events include diuresis with some hemorrhoidal bleeding, and she threatened to leave against medical advice (AMA) but agreed to stay. The patient complains of a ""burning"" sensation at the site of her right peripheral intravenous (PIV), nonproductive cough, mild dyspnea, and pleuritic chest discomfort.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a weight of 137.4 kg, with a decrease in fluid balance of -2965 mL. She is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and has been on various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Her respiratory support includes an aerosol-cool mask with supplemental oxygen.

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 295 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.2 g/dL, sodium of 137 mg/dL, potassium of 0"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with HIV who presented with fever and shortness of breath. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema, but the exact cause is uncertain. Possible causes include cardiogenic pulmonary edema, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema due to pneumonia, or right heart failure. The patient's oxygen saturation has improved after diuresis, suggesting a contribution from pulmonary edema. Her cardiac enzymes are negative, making myocardial infarction unlikely. There are concerns about potential complications such as pneumonia, HIV-associated pulmonary hypertension, or sleep apnea leading to left heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and history of fever and shortness of breath may indicate an underlying pneumonia. This could be a potential complication and should be monitored closely.
2. HIV-associated pulmonary hypertension: Given the patient's HIV status, there is a possibility of HIV-associated pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right heart failure and subsequent pulmonary edema.
3. Sleep apnea: Sleep apnea is another potential risk factor for right heart failure and subsequent pulmonary edema. It should be considered as a possible complication.
4. Left heart failure: The patient's symptoms and the presence of pulmonary edema suggest the possibility of left heart failure. Monitoring her cardiac function and response to treatment will be important.
5. Chronic pain management: The patient is on several medications for chronic pain management, including neurontin and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with HIV who presented with fever and shortness of breath. The patient has been in the ICU and has been diagnosed with pneumonia. There are several potential medical complications that can arise from the information given:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and pleuritic chest discomfort, along with the finding of pulmonary edema on the chest X-ray, indicate possible pulmonary edema. This condition can be caused by various factors such as cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic causes. Further assessment and management are needed to address this complication.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's presentation of fever, cough, and the result of a sputum culture showing PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) suggest a possible pneumonia infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered to treat the infection.

3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), which may contribute to her current symptoms and oxygen requirements. Proper management of COPD exacerbation should be considered, including bronchodilators and corticosteroids.

4. Cardiac Issues: The patient's symptoms and the presence of pulmonary edema raise concerns about potential cardiac issues. Cardiac enzymes were negative, indicating no recent myocardial infarction. However, further evaluation with cardiac imaging or catheterization may be necessary to assess cardiac"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with HIV who presented with fever and shortness of breath. She has been in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, diuretics, and medications for her underlying conditions such as COPD, mood disorder, chronic pain, and migraines. Her vital signs have been stable, but she has experienced episodes of hypoxemia and pulmonary edema. The etiology of the pulmonary edema is uncertain, with possible causes including cardiogenic, noncardiogenic, or right heart failure. The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating, and she has had positive cultures for Enterococcus and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). She also has an elevated lactate level and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and she has been assessed as not having the capacity to leave against medical advice (AMA). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has had positive cultures for PCP, indicating a possible infection. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially require more aggressive treatment.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of hypoxemia and pulmonary edema suggest fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can compromise oxygenation and lead to respiratory distress if not managed properly.
3. Right heart failure: The patient's history of HIV-associated pulmonary hypertension or sleep apnea could contribute to right heart failure,"

 HYPOXEMIA and Pulmonary edema
   Etiology remains uncertain. Does have COPD with home O2 but oxygen
   requirements still above her baseline. O2 saturation improved following
   diuresis
 consistent with a contribution from pulmonary edema.
   Difficult to say whether the edema is cardiogenic as recent TTE of poor
   quality; EF was 60% but WMA could not be excluded. MI unlikely given
   negative serial cardiac enzymes. Could have right heart failure (e.g.
   from HIV-associated pulmonary hypertension or sleep apnea) leading to
   left heart failure and therefore pulmonary edema. TEE or cardiac cath
   may help further assess pump function (e.g. LVgram) and for shunt.
   Pneumonia could be cause of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.  Albumin
   recently 3.4, no significant proteinuria.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old obese individual with a history of severe COPD, HIV/AIDS, migraines, mood disorder, chronic pain, and other medical conditions. They are currently admitted to the ICU due to hypoxemia of uncertain etiology. The patient's oxygen requirements are above their baseline despite being on home oxygen. Previous ABG showed hypoxia that improved following diuresis, suggesting a contribution from pulmonary edema. The patient's cardiac function is being evaluated, and a cardiac catheterization is considered as a helpful next step. Infectious workup has been negative so far. The patient is on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for antibiotic coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms, such as dyspnea and pleuritic chest discomfort, along with the improvement in oxygen saturation following diuresis, indicate the possibility of pulmonary edema. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's severe COPD and potential cardiac dysfunction, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and cardiac function is necessary.
3. Infectious Complications: Despite negative infectious workup so far, the patient remains at risk for developing further infections due to their immunocompromised state (HIV/AIDS).
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old obese woman admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is also HIV positive. She has been experiencing diuresis, with a total output of 14 liters over the past 24 hours. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/64 mmHg to 139/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's neurological status is attentive but unable to stand or move. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and acute respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a risk of hypoxemia, which can be exacerbated by her underlying lung conditions.
3. Diuresis: The patient's significant diuresis may indicate a renal issue or fluid overload. Monitoring fluid balance and electrolyte levels is crucial to prevent complications like electrolyte imbalances or renal dysfunction.
4. HIV/AIDS: The patient's HIV-positive status increases the risk of opportunistic infections and immune system compromise.
5. Pain management: The patient requires pain control due to acute and chronic"
