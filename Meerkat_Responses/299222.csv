","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and alcohol abuse, presenting with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He was admitted with pancreatitis and is currently in the ICU. The patient received Thiamine, Folic Acid, multivitamin, and diazepam along with fluids. His vital signs are stable, but he has shown signs of confusion and withdrawal symptoms. Laboratory results show elevated lipase and amylase levels. The patient's conditions include pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, diabetes, and thrombocytopenia/leukopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase and amylase levels, indicating pancreatitis. Complications of pancreatitis can include infection, necrosis, pseudocyst formation, or pancreatic fistula.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient exhibits severe withdrawal symptoms, which can lead to complications such as seizures, delirium tremens (DTs), or hallucinations.
3. Thrombocytopenia/Leukopenia: The patient has low platelet and white blood cell counts, which can increase the risk of bleeding or infection.
4. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension may complicate his condition and increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
5. Diabetes: The patient's uncontrolled diabetes can contribute to complications such as hyperglycemia or ketoacidosis.

The patient is also experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms due to alcohol abuse and has been admitted to the MICU for close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infected pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, or abscesses.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of severe withdrawal symptoms, which can progress to more serious complications like seizures or delirium tremens.
3. Thrombocytopenia/Leukopenia: The patient has low platelet and white blood cell counts, which can increase the risk of bleeding or infections.
4. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes may worsen during his hospital stay due to stress-induced hyperglycemia or the use of corticosteroids for other conditions.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be carefully managed to prevent complications such as stroke or heart attack.
6. Alcoholic Hepatitis: The patient's history of alcohol abuse puts him at risk for alcoholic hepatitis, which can lead to liver damage.
7. Thiamine Deficiency: Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to thiamine deficiency, resulting in conditions like Wernicke's encephalopathy or K"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and EtOH abuse. He presented with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the past day and was diagnosed with pancreatitis. The patient is currently in the ICU due to high-risk withdrawal symptoms.

The patient's vital signs have stabilized, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 135/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is awake and alert, with no focal deficits noted on the neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of amylase and lipase, indicating pancreatitis. There is also evidence of thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 68 K/uL) and leukopenia (white blood cell count of 4.3 K/uL). The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 171 mg/dL.

The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no signs of hepatic stasis or murmurs. Chest X-ray revealed clear lungs bilaterally. The RUQ ultrasound did not show any focal liver lesions, evidence of cirrhosis, or cholecystitis.

The assessment and plan include aggressive volume resuscitation, monitoring of hematocrit, BUN, calcium, PaO2, base deficit, and fluid sequestration for prognostication. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and requires a CT scan if fevers or a rising white blood cell count occur. Withdrawal precautions, thiamine, folate, social work consult, and guaiac testing of stools have been initiated.

The patient's diabetes will be managed with insulin sliding scale and A1C testing. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia will continue to be monitored. Hypertension management has been temporarily held due to pancreatitis, but will be restarted tomorrow if blood pressure and renal function stabilize. Alcoholic hepatitis will be monitored by trending transaminases, and hepatitis serologies will be sent to rule out alternative causes.

The patient will receive IV fluids, replete lytes as needed, and be kept NPO. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitor, pneumoboots, and bowel regimen will also be initiated. The patient's code status is full, and his disposition remains in the ICU. The total time spent with the patient is 30 minutes."

   she states patient has had very poor PO intake, and one day prior to
   admission started vomiting. On the day of admission, she reports
   patient was very anxious, agitated and tremulous. Patient is able to
   confirm he has been having vomiting and has not been able to drink in
   the past two days.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and alcohol abuse, who presented with abdominal pain and alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He was found to have pancreatitis, most likely due to his alcohol abuse. He also exhibits severe withdrawal symptoms and has a history of memory problems and confabulations, which may be concerning for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 135/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His blood glucose level is elevated at 171 mg/dL, and he has leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 4.3 K/uL. Other lab results show elevated levels of AST, ALT, amylase, lipase, and LDH.

The patient is currently on aggressive volume resuscitation, being given 1L of LR on arrival. He is also on NPO (nothing by mouth), and the insertion of a nasogastric tube is being avoided due to his altered mental status. The patient is receiving diazepam for severe withdrawal symptoms and is also receiving thiamine, folate, social work consult, psych consult for worsening depression, and guaiac testing of stools.

The patient's conditions include pancreatitis, alcohol abuse with severe withdrawal symptoms, diabetes"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection, organ failure, and sepsis.
2. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms, which can lead to complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, and hallucinations.
3. EtOH Hepatitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible liver damage from chronic alcohol abuse. This can lead to complications such as liver failure and cirrhosis.
4. Diabetes Management: The patient has diabetes, and inadequate control can lead to complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and long-term complications like diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy.
5. Thrombocytopenia and Leukopenia: These conditions can increase the risk of bleeding and infection, respectively.
6. Hypertension: Poorly controlled hypertension can lead to complications such as stroke, heart attack, and kidney damage."

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old man with past medical history significant for
   diabetes, hypertension, EtOH abuse, presenting with acute abdominal
   pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the past day.
   .
   Patient is very confused at time of interview and history is obtained
   from the wife. She reports patient has developed a 10 beer per day
   drinking habit for the past 2 years. She also reports he has been layed
   off last [**Month (only) 51**] and since has stayed home all day. For the past 2 weeks,
   she states patient has had very poor PO intake, and one day prior to
   admission started vomiting. On the day of admission, she reports
   patient was very anxious, agitated and tremulous. Patient is able to
   confirm he has been having vomiting and has not been able to drink in
   the past two days.
   .
   They deny any fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath or other
   associated symptoms. Vomitus is described and clear and without blood
   or dark contents. Pts wife did however report he has been having some
   memory problems, making up stories about family members (talking about
   recently seeing deceased relatives) and has been having worsening
   balance stumbling although not falling.
   .
   .
   In the ED, vital signs were initially:  Pain [**4-1**] T 99.0 104 153/92 16
   100%. Patient received Thiamine, Folic Acid, multivitamin and 10mg
   Diazepam along with 3L NS and 1 multivitamin bag. Chest x-ray revealed
   no acute process. Lipase and amylase were found to be elevated, surgery
   was consulted and felt patient could be monitored closely on medical
   service. Given high risk of withdrawal, patient was admitted to MICU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and alcohol abuse. He presented with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient's wife reported that he has been drinking heavily, including 10 beers per day, and has had poor oral intake for the past two weeks. He also experienced anxiety, agitation, and tremors on the day of admission. The patient's vital signs upon arrival were unstable, with high temperatures, increased heart rate, and elevated blood pressure. He was given thiamine, folic acid, multivitamins, diazepam, and intravenous fluids. A chest x-ray revealed no acute process, and his lipase and amylase levels were elevated. Surgery was consulted, but the patient was monitored closely on the medical service due to the high risk of withdrawal. He was admitted to the MICU for close monitoring and treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms, such as acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and elevated lipase and amylase levels, suggest acute pancreatitis. This condition can lead to complications like infection, organ failure, and sepsis.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient exhibits signs of severe withdrawal, including anxiety, agitation, and tremors. If left untreated, alcohol withdrawal can progress to more severe symptoms like seizures and delirium tremens.

","The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and alcohol abuse. He presented with abdominal pain and alcohol withdrawal and was found to have acute pancreatitis. His current condition shows several medical complications.

1. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has a high likelihood of alcoholic pancreatitis due to his history of alcohol abuse. His laboratory results indicate elevated levels of amylase and lipase, which are indicative of pancreatitis.

2. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient is showing severe withdrawal symptoms, which may lead to complications such as seizures or delirium tremens. He is currently receiving diazepam to manage these symptoms.

3. Thrombocytopenia/Leukopenia: The patient's blood work shows low platelet and white blood cell counts, which could be due to bone marrow suppression or other factors. Close monitoring is necessary to assess for any worsening of these conditions.

4. Ethanol Hepatitis: The patient's liver function tests reveal elevated ALT and AST levels, suggesting possible liver damage from alcohol abuse. Further evaluation with hepatitis serologies and ongoing monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended.

5. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes management is currently being addressed with an insulin sliding scale and plans for an A1C test.

6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is currently being managed with lisinopril. However, further evaluation and treatment may be required depending on his blood pressure readings and overall condition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and alcohol abuse. He presented with abdominal pain and alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The patient was found to have pancreatitis, likely caused by alcohol abuse. His condition is classified as severe pancreatitis based on the Ranson criteria score. The patient is currently receiving aggressive intravenous fluids, is nil per os (NPO), and has been started on morphine for pain management. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection, necrosis, or pseudocyst formation if not managed appropriately.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms, which need to be carefully managed to prevent complications like seizures, delirium tremens, or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
3. Thrombocytopenia/Leukopenia: The patient has low platelet and white blood cell counts, which may be due to bone marrow suppression. Close monitoring is required to prevent bleeding or infection.
4. Ethanol Hepatitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible alcohol-induced liver damage. Monitoring liver function tests and considering serologies for viral hepatitis is important.
5. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes needs to be managed with insulin sliding scale and further evaluation of A1C levels.

","The patient is a 59-year-old man with a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and alcohol abuse. He presented with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the past day and was admitted with pancreatitis. His initial vital signs included a pain score of 4, temperature of 99.0°F, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 153/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He received thiamine, folic acid, multivitamin, and diazepam along with intravenous fluids and a multivitamin bag. A chest x-ray showed no acute process, and his lipase and amylase levels were elevated. Surgery was consulted, and it was determined that the patient could be monitored closely on the medical service. Due to a high risk of withdrawal, the patient was admitted to the medical ICU.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. He received antibiotics but the last dose is not specified. He is currently on infusions of diazepam and other medications as listed. There are no changes to his medical and family history except for the pancreatitis diagnosis and potential complications related to alcohol withdrawal and thiamine deficiency.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the new symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. His vital signs have stabilized with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 137/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. He has received a total of 3,413 mL of fluids since the previous morning, with an output of 4,310 mL of urine. His respiratory support includes the use of a nasal cannula and supplemental oxygen, and his ABG results are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination revealed no peripheral vascular issues, and his neurologic status is also not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, and platelets, along with decreased levels of potassium and magnesium. Liver function tests indicate elevated ALT and AST levels, as well as elevated alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. Amylase and lipase levels are also elevated. Other lab results include normal glucose levels, slightly decreased calcium, and normal albumin and LDH levels.

The patient's assessment includes diagnoses of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, diabetes, and potential complications such as thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and alcoholic hepatitis. The plan includes aggressive volume resuscitation, monitoring of specific lab values, nasogastric tube placement, and close observation for signs of deterioration.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening pancreatitis, development of a pancreatic pseudocyst or abscess, infection (such as necrotizing fasciitis or seps"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and alcohol abuse. He presented with symptoms of acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and was diagnosed with pancreatitis. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for alcohol withdrawal, pancreatitis, diabetes, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's condition may worsen, leading to complications such as infected necrosis or pseudocysts.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is at risk of severe withdrawal symptoms, including seizures and delirium tremens.
3. Thrombocytopenia/leukopenia: These conditions may progress and cause further complications, such as increased bleeding tendencies or increased susceptibility to infections.
4. Hypertension: Poorly controlled blood pressure can lead to complications like stroke or heart attack.
5. Diabetic complications: Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
6. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system, there is a risk of developing infections, including pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
7. Malnutrition: Being NPO (nothing by mouth) increases the risk of malnutrition and dehydration.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is essential to consult with the healthcare team for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and alcohol abuse. He presented with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and was diagnosed with pancreatitis. The patient received thiamine, folic acid, multivitamin, and diazepam for withdrawal symptoms. His vital signs were initially elevated due to pain. The patient's pancreatitis is likely caused by alcohol abuse, as indicated by his history of consuming 10 drinks per day. He also exhibits signs of severe withdrawal symptoms. The patient's diabetes is currently not being managed with any antiglycemic medications, and his wife believes he has previously taken metformin. Additionally, the patient has thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, which are likely due to bone marrow suppression from alcohol use. The patient's hypertension is being temporarily held due to pancreatitis, and will be restarted if the patient's blood pressure and renal function remain stable. Other assessments include alcoholic hepatitis, fen (fluids and electrolytes), PPX (prophylactic proton pump inhibitor, pneumoboots, bowel regimen), access (peripheral intravenous line), and code status (full code). The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's condition could worsen if the underlying cause of pancreatitis is not addressed or if complications such as infection or abscess formation occur.

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and EtOH abuse. He presented with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the past day and was diagnosed with pancreatitis in the emergency department. Vital signs upon admission were as follows: Pain score of 4-1, temperature of 99.0, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 153/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient received Thiamine, Folic Acid, multivitamin, and 10mg Diazepam along with 3L NS and 1 multivitamin bag. A chest x-ray revealed no acute process, and lipase and amylase levels were found to be elevated. Surgery was consulted and determined that the patient could be monitored closely on medical service. Due to the high risk of withdrawal, the patient was admitted to the MICU.

24-hour events include no known drug allergies, and the last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient received Diazepam (Valium) at 03:04 AM and other medications as well. There were no changes to the medical and family history, and the review of systems remained unchanged from admission except as noted below.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and alcohol abuse. He presented with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and was diagnosed with pancreatitis. The patient is also experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms from alcohol use disorder. He has been admitted to the MICU for close monitoring due to his high risk of withdrawal. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure ranging from 137/81 mmHg to 160/92 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. Laboratory results show elevated lipase levels and other abnormalities consistent with pancreatitis. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia are also present, likely secondary to bone marrow suppression from alcohol abuse. The patient's alcohol consumption has led to nutritional deficiencies and potential complications such as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection, organ failure, and fluid imbalances.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms, which can progress to more serious complications like seizures, delirium tremens, and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and alcohol abuse. He presented with abdominal pain and alcohol withdrawal, and was found to have pancreatitis. The patient's condition has been unstable, with falls and agitation requiring sedation. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 75-105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/68 to 157/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%.

The patient has been receiving aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, and his lab results show elevated glucose levels but otherwise within normal range. He has thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, which may be due to bone marrow suppression, but no active bleeding has been observed. His liver function tests are elevated, indicating possible alcohol-induced hepatitis. The patient's diabetes is being managed with insulin sliding scale for now.

The patient's alcohol abuse history and symptoms suggest a high risk for complications such as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and alcoholic pancreatitis. Surgery has evaluated the patient and determined that surgery is not necessary at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's presentation of abdominal pain and alcohol abuse history suggests alcoholic pancreatitis. This condition can lead to complications like necrotizing pancreatitis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and multiple"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and alcohol abuse. He presented with abdominal pain and signs of alcohol withdrawal. The patient was diagnosed with pancreatitis, likely due to alcohol abuse. His laboratory results indicate several abnormalities including elevated glucose levels, elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is currently being treated in the ICU with aggressive intravenous fluid therapy, pain management, and medications for alcohol withdrawal. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has already been diagnosed with pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection, abscess formation, pseudocyst development, and persistent pain.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is showing severe withdrawal symptoms, which may progress to more severe manifestations like seizures or delirium tremens if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypoglycemia: Due to the patient's diabetes and insulin therapy, there is a risk of hypoglycemia, especially if the insulin dosage is not adjusted correctly.
4. Hepatitis: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, indicating possible hepatitis. If left untreated, this could lead to liver damage or failure.
5. Thrombocytopenia/Leukopenia: The patient's low platelet and white blood cell counts may increase the risk of bleeding or infection.
6. Hypertension: Although the patient's blood pressure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and alcohol abuse. He presented with abdominal pain and alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He was diagnosed with pancreatitis, most likely due to alcoholic pancreatitis given his history of alcohol abuse. The patient's Ranson criteria score is 15%, indicating a predicted mortality rate of 15%. Surgery has evaluated the patient and signed off. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1 C (96.9 F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/93 to 107/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is on hemodynamic monitoring, and his fluid balance shows an intake of 990 mL total, with 78 mL output through the Foley catheter. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, as well as elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), amylase, lipase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, and magnesium levels. The patient's blood glucose level is also elevated.

The assessment and plan include continued aggressive intravenous fluid (IVF) administration, advancing the diet as tolerated once more awake, and starting morphine as needed for pain. The patient is also being treated for alcohol abuse, including diazepam for withdrawal symptoms"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 year old man with past medical history significant for diabetes,
   hypertension, EtOH abuse, presenting with abdominal pain and EtOH
   withdrawal, found to have pancreatitis.
   .
   # ETOH ABUSE: Patient with 10drink /day habit, although this could be
   significantly underestimated given wife is not home most of the day.
   Patient exhibiting severe withdrawal symptoms on arrival. Per wife's
   history, patient having memory problems and some confabulations,
   concerning for Warnicke/Korsakoff syndrome.  Last valium given at 3am
   this AM.
   -- CIWA Q4H Diazepam 10mg, now only requiring 3 doses
   -- Withdrawal precautions
   -- Thiamine, Folate PO
   -- Social work consult, consider psych consult
   -- Check lytes 5pm
   # PANCREATITIS: Significantly improved, now with active bowel sounds /
   benign abdomen and tolerating a regular diet.
   DDx included gall stone impaction, hypertriglyceridemia, medication,
   etc. Given history of alcohol abuse however, this most likely
   represented alcoholic pancreatitis. [**Last Name (un) 2245**] Criteria Score = [**2-24**] (15%
   predicted mortality) on admission (Age > 55, Glucose > 200, AST >
   250).  Surgery has evaluated pt, now signed off.  LFTs trending down.
   .
   #. EtOH Hepatitis: Pt with ALT 106 and AST 272. No focal lesions or
   change in echotexture on U/S or CT
   - trend LFTs daily
   - hepatitis serologies pending
   - EtOH abuse plan as above
   # DIABETES: Pt is on metformin (500 [**Hospital1 7**]) /glyburide (7.5QD) at home
   -- insulin sliding scale for now
   -- A1C 9.6
   .
   #. THROMBOCYTOPENIA / LEUKOPENIA: Likely from bone marrow suppression;
   no signs of active bleeding
   -- Continue to monitor
   .
   # HYPERTENSION: Patient only on lisinopril as outpatient, normotensive
   since arrival
   - Restart if BP requires

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and EtOH abuse. He presented with abdominal pain and symptoms of EtOH withdrawal, and was found to have pancreatitis. The patient has been receiving treatment for his conditions, including medication for withdrawal symptoms, thiamine and folate supplementation, and a regular diet. His pancreatitis has improved significantly.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of glucose, ALT, AST, CK, CKMB, Troponin-T, and amylase/lipase. His white blood cell count is within normal range, but his platelet count is slightly low. Other lab values such as BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, and liver function tests are also provided.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. EtOH withdrawal: The patient exhibited severe withdrawal symptoms upon arrival, which are a potential complication of chronic alcohol abuse. He has been receiving diazepam to manage these symptoms.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis has improved significantly, but there is still a risk of complications such as infection or worsening of the condition.

3. Thrombocytopenia/Leukopenia: The patient has a slightly low platelet count and white blood cell count, which could be due to bone marrow suppression. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent any bleeding or infection.

4. Hypertension: The patient"
