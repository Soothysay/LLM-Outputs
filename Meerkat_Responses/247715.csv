 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   76 yof with history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, HTN, Asthma who was
   transferred from [**Hospital 17**] Hospital for management of respiratory
   distress/Pneumonia.
   # Respiratory Distress/ PNA:  Pt initially treated for RLL PNA seen on
   CXR and CTA with vanco, zosyn. Switched to CTX, vanco, levofloxacin
   here. Levoflox subsequently stopped for prolonged QT. Pt extubated and
   re-intubated soon after when she developed severe wheezing and new
   onset pulm edema (suggesting possible cardiogenic source also).
   -- Vanco, CTX, hold on atypical covg for now as azithro would also be
   QT prolonging
   -- blood cultures
   -- continue mechanical ventilation, attempt switch AC to PSV
   -- flu swab
   # Heart Block: Temporary pacer placed overnight with VVI 60.  When Afib
   terminated at 4am, pt became fully paced at 60, underlying rhythm seems
   to be sinus bradycardia currently.
   -- When other more pressing issues have resolved, pt may need permanent
   pacer
   # NSTEMI: likely due to poorly controlled rate in the setting of very
   significant obstructive CAD. Cannot rule out plaque rupture with
   Cardiac enzymes this significant.  On ASA, plavix, high dose statin, IV
   heparin. Currently rate controlled.  Plan is for cath early this week.
   Will attempt to obtain medical records pertaining to CABG anatomy form

   - continue to cycle cardiac enzymes q6H
   # Asthma/COPD:  Patient given Solumedrol at OSH.  ABG there consistent
   with acute on chronic COPD.
   -- albuterol/Atrovent MDI PRN
   -- solumedrol 40mg IV daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, asthma, and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG x 4). She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and pneumonia. The patient initially received vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and levofloxacin. However, levofloxacin was stopped due to prolonged QT interval. The patient experienced severe wheezing and new-onset pulmonary edema, leading to reintubation. She also developed heart block and required temporary pacing. A TEE was ordered to exclude aortic root abscess. The patient has a history of NSTEMI and asthma/COPD. She is currently on heparin, aspirin, and Plavix for rate control and management of NSTEMI. The plan is for early cardiac catheterization this week. Other issues include hypothyroidism, gout, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has shown acute respiratory failure with worsening pulmonary edema. Continuous mechanical ventilation may be required.
2. Heart Block: The patient experienced a heart block that required temporary pacing. Long-term pacing may be necessary, and further evaluation for potential causes such as aortic root abscess should be considered.
3. NSTEMI: The patient likely had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) due to poorly controlled heart rate in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented to the ICU with acute respiratory failure and subsequent cardiac complications. The patient initially had clear lungs and was extubated, but then developed severe wheezing and respiratory distress requiring re-intubation. A subsequent chest X-ray showed increased pulmonary edema. The patient's condition worsened, with tachycardia, atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, and conversion of left bundle branch block to right bundle branch block with axis shift. An introducer was placed in the right internal jugular vein and a temporary pacemaker wire was floated into the right ventricular apex to control the heart rate. The patient is currently on esmolol and pacer dependent at a rate of 60. Additionally, the patient has been started on heparin, ASA, lipitor, and Plavix for NSTEMI. There is a concern for possible transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to exclude aortic root abscess. The patient's allergies include piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.6°C (99.6°F) with a maximum temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate in the 60s with fluctuations, blood pressure ranging from 68"

   - pt with clear lungs in the AM, extubated, then developed severe
   wheezing, resp distress, requiring re-intubation. Subsequent CXR with
   increased pulm edema
   - initail cards consult attribute trop leak on arrival to demand
   ischemia in the setting of severe illness
   - Pt subsequently tachycardic to 130s, the ~115, then abruptly CHB with
   conversion of LBBB to RBBB morphology and shift of axis from 20 to 116.
   Tracings reviewed by EP fellow (&[**Doctor Last Name 2830**]). Thought to be profound
   vagal episode with no clear trigger. Change of bundle as her escape
   rhythm is fascicular in origin. Subsequently tachy/brady. Had
   introducer placed in RIJ and temp pacer floated into RV apex (rescue
   rate =60). In the interim, CK's started climbing, likely [**1-29**] to rate.
   Started on esmolol initially with limited effect, but as of this AM,
   pacer dependent at rate of 60.
   - Per EP fellow, strongly consider TEE to exclude ao root abcess
   (ordered)
   - NSTEMI substantial, on heparin drip, ASA, lipitor 80, plavix
   (continued from home); esmolol/pacer for rate control

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, asthma, and previous CABG surgery. She presented to the hospital with respiratory distress and was initially diagnosed with pneumonia. She was given vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam but developed severe wheezing and respiratory distress requiring reintubation. Subsequent chest X-ray showed increased pulmonary edema. The patient's condition deteriorated further, leading to the development of a heart block and an NSTEMI. She was subsequently placed on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and a temporary pacemaker. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent deterioration indicate a risk of respiratory failure due to pneumonia and acute on chronic COPD.
2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's history of CAD and recent NSTEMI suggest ongoing ischemic heart disease, which may lead to further cardiac complications.
3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever despite antibiotic therapy raises concerns for an underlying infection or systemic inflammatory response.
4. Heart Block: The patient's development of heart block indicates a potential complication related to her cardiac condition.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and systemic anticoagulation suggest a risk for developing DVT.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, prior intubation, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), who presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation on Friday and re-intubation yesterday. She also has intermittent heart block, including complete heart block (CHB), intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib RVR), elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction (EF) of unknown chronicity, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA).

24-hour events include intermittent CHB alternating with Afib RVR, leading to placement of temporary wire. The patient was started on esmolol infusion to control heart rate but converted to sinus rhythm with a heart rate less than 100. The patient underwent invasive ventilation, arterial line placement, and temporary pacemaker wire insertion.

Allergies: The patient has allergies to Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Vancomycin, Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone, and Levofloxacin.

Medications: The patient is receiving midazolam, fentanyl, esmolol, and verapamil infusions. Other medications include furosemide (Lasix) and verapamil.

Review of Systems: The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory failure, intermittent heart block,"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has needed a temporary wire for bradycardia ( CHB) and rising
   cardiac troponin index. I am concerned regarding RCA occlusion with RV
   function compromise although she has not needed escalating pressors.
   She appears to be ventilating well on current vent settings and we will
   not change until she has completed her cardiac cath in am [**2131-11-5**]. I am
   concerned regarding ensuing renal failure given tenuous HR/ BP issues
   and comorbid medical disease. Her family has been updated and questions
   answered. She will need low dose solumedrol for now.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. She presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation on Friday and re-intubation yesterday. The patient also has intermittent heart block, including complete heart block (CHB), intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib RVR), elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction (EF) of unknown chronicity, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA).

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate ranging from 46 to 129 beats per minute, blood pressure between 68-127 mmHg, respiratory rate between 10-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on invasive ventilation and has a temporary pacemaker wire inserted due to bradycardia. The patient's arterial line, central venous pressure (CVP), fluid balance, and urine output are being closely monitored.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly elevated potassium levels. The cardiac enzymes Troponin-T and CK-MB are elevated. The patient's blood cultures have been sent.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has a combination of RLL"

   # Respiratory Distress/ PNA:  Pt initially treated for RLL PNA seen on
   CXR and CTA with vanco, zosyn. Switched to CTX, vanco, levofloxacin
   here. Levoflox subsequently stopped for prolonged QT. Pt extubated and
   re-intubated soon after when she developed severe wheezing and new
   onset pulm edema (suggesting possible cardiogenic source also). Flu
   swab negative. Sputum gram stain growing GPCs in pairs.
   -- Day 2 of 8: Vanco, CTX, hold on atypical covg for now as azithro
   would also be QT prolonging
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- continue mechanical ventilation, attempt switch AC to PSV
   # Heart Block: Temporary pacer placed overnight with VVI 60.  Patient
   paced at 60 bpm.
   -- When other more pressing issues have resolved, pt may need permanent
   pacer
   # NSTEMI: likely due to poorly controlled rate in the setting of very
   significant obstructive CAD. Cannot rule out plaque rupture with
   Cardiac enzymes this significant.  On ASA, plavix, high dose statin, IV
   heparin. Currently rate controlled.  Plan is for cath early this week.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, asthma, and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who was admitted to the ICU for management of respiratory distress and pneumonia. She has since developed acute respiratory failure, a new-onset myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and complete heart block. The patient's medical history includes asthma/COPD, hypertension, hypothyroidism, gout, and familial educational needs. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which may require continued or prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has developed a new-onset myocardial infarction, likely secondary to poorly controlled heart rate in the setting of significant obstructive CAD. There is a risk of recurrent cardiac events, including another myocardial infarction or worsening heart failure.
3. Complete Heart Block: The patient has complete heart block, necessitating temporary pacing. There is a risk of persistent or permanent heart block requiring a permanent pacemaker.
4. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with pneumonia, which may still be an ongoing infection. There is a risk of progression or complications associated with pneumonia, such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
5. Gout: The patient has a history of gout, and it is currently"

   # Respiratory Distress/ PNA:  Pt initially treated for RLL PNA seen on
   CXR and CTA with vanco, zosyn. Switched to CTX, vanco, levofloxacin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and asthma. She was transferred to the ICU for management of respiratory distress and pneumonia. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever of unknown origin (FUO), acute respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and complete heart block. She has undergone multiple interventions including intubation, temporary pacemaker placement, and administration of various medications. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated troponin-T levels and other cardiac enzymes, suggesting myocardial injury. Her respiratory status has been unstable, with episodes of severe wheezing and pulmonary edema. Sputum gram stain has grown gram-positive cocci in pairs, indicating a possible bacterial infection. The patient's medical history also includes asthma/COPD, hypertension, hypothyroidism, gout, and familial hypertriglyceridemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory distress and subsequent acute respiratory failure indicate a high risk for further respiratory complications. These may include worsening hypoxia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and recent NSTEMI, there is an increased risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, or heart failure. The presence of complete heart block and elevated cardiac enzymes further support the likelihood of ongoing myocardial damage"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and asthma who was transferred from another hospital for the management of respiratory distress and pneumonia. The patient initially received vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ceftriaxone but had levofloxacin stopped due to prolonged QT. The patient was extubated and re-intubated after developing severe wheezing and new-onset pulmonary edema. Temporary pacing was placed overnight due to heart block, and the underlying rhythm seems to be sinus bradycardia. The patient is currently on aspirin, clopidogrel, high-dose statin, and intravenous heparin. A plan for a cardiac catheterization early this week has been made. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation indicate a potential complication of acute respiratory failure.
2. Fever, Unknown Origin (FUO, Hypothermia, Pyrexia): The patient has been experiencing fever, which may suggest an underlying infection or inflammatory condition.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD, Ischemic Heart Disease): The patient's history of CAD and recent symptoms suggest ongoing ischemic heart disease.
4. Heart Block: The temporary pacer placement indicates a heart block, which may require further investigation and possible"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x4, hypertension, and asthma. She was transferred to the ICU for management of respiratory distress and pneumonia. The patient now presents with acute respiratory failure, complete heart block, NSTEMI, and fever of unknown origin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/Pneumonia: The patient initially treated for right lower lobe pneumonia. She was extubated and re-intubated due to severe wheezing and new onset pulmonary edema. This suggests a possible cardiogenic source of respiratory distress.
2. Complete Heart Block: The patient has been paced at 60 bpm temporarily due to aortic root abscess. Permanent pacing may be necessary when other issues resolve.
3. NSTEMI: The patient likely experienced a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction due to poorly controlled heart rate in the setting of significant obstructive CAD. Cardiac enzymes have peaked, and the plan is for a cardiac catheterization early this week.
4. HCT drop: Secondary to left internal jugular (IJ) placement, the patient has experienced a drop in hematocrit (HCT). This is expected to resolve after returning from the catheterization lab and stopping heparin gtt.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension, and asthma. She presented with intermittent chest pain and dry cough throughout the week, which then developed into worsening chest pain and dyspnea. She was intubated and started on antibiotics due to pneumonia (PNA) and hypercapnic respiratory failure. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA), asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. She is currently on assisted mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient has elevated cardiac biomarkers, indicating possible myocardial damage. There is a suspicion of demand ischemia, but acute coronary syndrome (ACS) cannot be completely excluded. She is currently on aspirin, statins, and beta-blockers for cardiac support.

3. Volume overload: The patient appears to be volume overloaded, leading to cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Diuretics, specifically lasix, have been initiated to manage this issue.

4. Intermittent heart block: The patient has experienced intermittent complete heart block (CHB) with temporary pacing wire placement, and is currently paced intermittently. She also has episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, and asthma. She presented with intermittent chest pain and dry cough throughout the week prior to admission. The patient developed worsening chest pain and dyspnea, leading to admission at Hospital 17. She was found to have pneumonia (PNA) and hypercapnic respiratory failure, resulting in intubation and initiation of antibiotics. The patient was then transferred to the current ICU for further management.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues. She has had intermittent heart block, including complete heart block (CHB), intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib RVR), elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction (EF) of unknown chronicity, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA).

The patient's respiratory failure is likely a combination of RLL PNA, asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. There is also a possibility of mild upper airway obstruction. A trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) has been considered, with caution in assessment for extubation given the failure to extubate on Saturday.

The patient's elevated cardiac biomarkers suggest a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This could be due to demand ischemia or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The plan includes"

   the week PTA then developed worsening CP and dyspnea. Went to [**Hospital 17**]
   hospital found to have PNA and hypercapnic respiratory failure, was
   intubated [**11-2**] and started on Abx then transferred here. Had high BNP
   ([**Numeric Identifier 2380**]), elevated trop 0.87, and LBBB on ECG (unknown if old or new).
   Cards consult called thought it was demand ischemia not an ACS, started
   ASA, statins, and B-Blocker, no anticoagulation. Had CTA which revealed
   RLL consolidation>LLL, no PE. Had an elevated Lactic acid 5.1, now
   trending down. Extubated sat am and reintubated later that day.  Then
   developed CHB with fascicular escape and afib with RVR.  Temp wire
   placed. EF 25% on TTE.

   failure requiring intubation Fri and re-intubation Sat, intermittent
   heart block (including CHB), intermittent Afib RVR, elevated cardiac
   biomarkers, reduced EF of unknown chronicitiy, ?asthma exacerbation and
   RLL PNA.
   #Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of RLL PNA, asthma
   exacerbation and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Possible mild upper
   airway obstruction.
   - Consider trial of PS later this afternoon if stable after cath. We
   will be cautious in assessment for extubation given failure to
   extubation on Saturday
   - F/U sputum culture.
   - Continue Vanc/CTX (Levaquin d/c
ed [**1-29**] prolonged QTc)
   - Diuresis with lasix gtt
   - Steroids / bronchodilators for asthma
   #NSTEMI: elevated cardiac biomarkers to TnI 7.21. Could be demand
   ischemia or ACS.
   - Cont ASA, statin, plavix
   - Heparin gtt PTT 50-70

   #CHB: Intermittent CHB with temp wire, currently paced, intermittent
   Afib
   - Continue with temp pacer
may need permanent pacemaker
   - F/U Lyme Ab
   - TEE tomorrow to r/o aortic root abscess
   # Hct drop: Likely [**1-29**] significant bleeding from LIJ site.  Multiple
   attempts to stop bleeding, but cannot stop heparin.
   - Continue with pressure dressing
   - 1 unit PRBC ordered, Hct goal >30
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, HTN, and asthma.
- She presented with intermittent chest pain, dry cough, and worsening symptoms including dyspnea.
- She was found to have pneumonia (PNA) and hypercapnic respiratory failure, leading to intubation.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities including CHF, UTI, NSTEMI, and CHB.
- She has elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction (EF), and RLL consolidation.
- The patient experienced a significant Hct drop due to bleeding from the IJ site and required a blood transfusion.
- She also has renal failure with rising creatinine levels.
- Her condition has been unstable, with multiple reintubations and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
- The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, antiplatelet agents, and diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with ongoing respiratory failure. She may continue to experience difficulty in weaning off the ventilator due to a combination of RLL PNA, asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has evidence of NSTEMI with elevated cardiac biomarkers. There is a possibility of ACS, and further evaluation with a cardiac catheterization is planned. The patient also has intermittent"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, and asthma.
- She presented with intermittent chest pain and dry cough, which worsened to develop worsening chest pain and dyspnea.
- The patient was intubated and started on antibiotics due to pneumonia (PNA) and hypercapnic respiratory failure.
- She has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including heart block, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction (EF), and possible asthma exacerbation.
- The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring multiple reintubations and interventions.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and cardiac enzymes.
- Imaging studies revealed right lower lobe lung consolidation without pulmonary embolism.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The combination of RLL PNA, asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema may lead to ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring and consideration for a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) later in the afternoon is recommended.
2. NSTEMI: Elevated cardiac biomarkers indicate possible non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Further evaluation and management with antiplatelet agents, statins, beta-blockers, and consideration for cardiac cath"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension, and asthma. She presented with intermittent chest pain and dry cough, which worsened and led to the development of pneumonia (PNA) and hypercapnic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and started on antibiotics, then transferred to the ICU.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues. She has elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), intermittent heart block including complete heart block (CHB), and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib RVR). There is also evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA), possible asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

The patient has undergone multiple interventions, including placement of an inferior vena cava (IJ) filter with significant oozing, resulting in a drop in hematocrit (Hct) level. She received blood products, diuretics, and various medications such as antibiotics, antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, and statins. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a temporary pacemaker due to intermittent CHB.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/72 to 170/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 98%, and temperature within normal limits.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including fentanyl and midazolam for sedation, as well as antibiotics such as vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and levofloxacin. The patient also received blood products, including 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC).

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and troponin-T levels. The creatinine (Cr) level is increasing, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Other lab values, including electrolytes, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers, are within normal ranges.

The patient's respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, set Vt of 400 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 43. The ABG results indicate a slightly alkalotic pH with"

   76 yo f with history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, HTN, Asthma who was
   transferred from [**Hospital 17**] Hospital for management of respiratory
   distress/Pneumonia, now s/p NSTEMI and temp pacer for episode of
   complete heart block.
   # Respiratory Distress/ PNA:  Pt initially treated for RLL PNA seen on
   CXR and CTA with vanco, zosyn. Switched to CTX, vanco, levofloxacin
   here. Levoflox subsequently stopped for prolonged QT. Pt extubated and
   re-intubated soon after when she developed severe wheezing and new
   onset pulm edema (suggesting possible cardiogenic source also). Flu
   swab negative. Sputum gram stain growing GPCs in pairs, but no culture
   or speciation.
   -- Day 3 of 8: Vanco, CTX, hold on atypical covg for now as azithro
   would also be QT prolonging, based on CTA appearance, low suspicion for
   atyicals
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- hold diuresis given prerenal FEurea and CVP 10.
   -- continue albuterol/atrovent PRN wheezing for asthma/COPD
   -- continue solumedrol 40mg IV daily for asthma/COPD (one more day)
   -- SBT and extubation today, will use CPAP if pulmonary edema returns
   as it did at the time of last extubation
   # Leukocytosis: Marked increase. WBC had been 10 for 4 days, now 20. It
   would be surprising if this were from her PNA as respiratory status and
   CXR improved. Strong suspicion for CDIFF: cdiff tox ordered and po
   vanco started empirically. Will trend WBC. Re-culture blood.
   # Heart Block: Temporary pacer placed with VVI 60.  Patient paced at 60
   bpm.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondadry to aortic root abscess.
   -- When other more pressing issues have resolved, pt may need permanent
   pacer
   -- TEE to eval for abscess today
   -- lyme serologies negative
   -- pacer rate decreased to 50 after discussion with EP fellow, avoiding
   AV nodal blocking agents per their recommendation; underlying rthyhm is
   sinus in mid 50s with PR 180.
   # NSTEMI: likely due to poorly controlled rate in the setting of very
   significant obstructive CAD. Cannot rule out plaque rupture with
   Cardiac enzymes this significant.  On ASA, plavix, high dose statin;
   IV heparin is off. Currently rate controlled.  Plan for cath is on hold
   given worsening renal fxn. Cardiac enzymes have peaked.
   .
   # HCT drop: secondary L IJ oozing which has stopped
   -Active T&s
   -transfuse to keep HCT>25
   -[**Hospital1 **] hct
   .
   #Acute renal failure: Prerenal by FE urea, but likely some contribution
   from CTA contrast.  Hollding on diuresis as goal CVP achieved.
   -follow chem. 7 [**Hospital1 **]
   -renally dose meds
   -avoid nephrotoxins

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted for respiratory distress and pneumonia. She underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure four times and also has hypertension and asthma. The patient developed a new onset of complete heart block, necessitating the placement of a temporary pacemaker.

The patient initially received vancomycin, zosyn, and later switched to ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and levofloxacin for pneumonia treatment. However, due to prolonged QT, levofloxacin was stopped. She was extubated but re-intubated due to severe wheezing and new-onset pulmonary edema. Flu swab negative, and sputum gram stain showed growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs.

On day 3, the patient's blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in pairs, and atypical coverage was held. The patient's leukocyte count increased from 10 to 20, raising suspicion for Clostridium difficile infection (CDIFF), and cdiff tox was ordered. Blood cultures were re-collected.

The patient also has acute respiratory failure, likely not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has a history of CAD and experienced a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Her heart rate was poorly controlled, leading to the placement of a temporary pacemaker.

   transferred from [**Hospital 17**] Hospital for management of respiratory
   distress/Pneumonia, now with NSTEMI and complete heart block.
   # Respiratory Distress/ PNA:  Pt initially treated for RLL PNA seen on
   CXR and CTA with vanco, zosyn. Switched to CTX, vanco, levofloxacin
   here. Levoflox subsequently stopped for prolonged QT. Pt extubated and
   re-intubated soon after when she developed severe wheezing and new
   onset pulm edema (suggesting possible cardiogenic source also). Flu
   swab negative. Sputum gram stain growing GPCs in pairs.
   -- Day 2 of 8: Vanco, CTX, hold on atypical covg for now as azithro
   would also be QT prolonging
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- continue diuresis with lasix gtt, with goal I/O
s -1L
   -- continue albuterol/atrovent PRN wheezing for asthma/COPD
   -- continue solumedrol 40mg IV daily for asthma/COPD
   -- continue mechanical ventilation, attempt switch AC to PSV
   # Heart Block: Temporary pacer placed overnight with VVI 60.  Patient
   paced at 60 bpm.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondadry to aortic root abscess.
   -- When other more pressing issues have resolved, pt may need permanent
   pacer
   -- obtain TEE to eval for abscess
   -- lyme serologies pending
   # NSTEMI: likely due to poorly controlled rate in the setting of very
   significant obstructive CAD. Cannot rule out plaque rupture with
   Cardiac enzymes this significant.  On ASA, plavix, high dose statin, IV
   heparin. Currently rate controlled.  Plan is for cath early this week.
   Will attempt to obtain medical records pertaining to CABG anatomy form

   #Acute renal failure: Cr 1.9 up from 1.5 yesterday.  Patient appears
   fluid overloaded, though may be intravascularly depleted. Given brief
   episode of hypotension 2 days prior, this may be ATN.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and pneumonia. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery four times and has a history of hypertension and asthma. Currently, the patient is being treated for acute respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and complete heart block.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient initially treated for right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA) with vancomycin, zosyn, and later switched to ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. The patient experienced severe wheezing and new-onset pulmonary edema, indicating a possible cardiogenic source. Flu swab was negative, and sputum gram stain grew gram-positive cocci in pairs.

2. Heart Block: The patient developed complete heart block, and a temporary pacemaker was placed overnight with ventricular demand pacing at 60 beats per minute. The patient is being paced due to aortic root abscess.

3. NSTEMI: The patient likely experienced non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) due to poorly controlled heart rate in the setting of significant obstructive CAD. Cardiac enzymes were significantly elevated. The patient is currently on aspirin, clopidogrel, high-dose statin, and intravenous heparin. A cath"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, prior intubation, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation and has had intermittent episodes of heart block, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib RVR), elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction (EF) of unknown chronicity, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA).

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing a combination of RLL PNA, asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The plan is to extubate after transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to CPAP.
2. Elevated WBC count: The WBC count has increased from 10 to 23. The urinalysis (U/A) is bland, and the chest X-ray (CXR) remains unchanged. The patient is afebrile with a benign abdominal exam. It is possible that the elevated WBC count is a reaction to steroids.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating possible intrarenal damage from contrast dye and prerenal damage from diuresis.

   extubation/re-intubation 11/7t, intermittent heart block (including
   CHB), intermittent Afib RVR, elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced EF of
   unknown chronicity,possible asthma exacerbation and RLL PNA.
    #Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of RLL PNA, asthma
   exacerbation and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Possible mild upper
   airway obstruction.
   - Doing well on PS, RSBI 43. Plan to extubate after TEE to CPAP.
   - Continue Vanc/CTX
   - Steroids / bronchodilators for asthma
   # Elevated WBC count: Went from 10 to 23. U/A bland yesterday. CXR
   unchanged.  Afebrile.  Benign abdominal exam.  [**Month (only) 8**] be a component of
   reaction to steroids.
   - Check c. Diff and empirically cover with PO vanc.
   - Repeat blood cultures
   # ARF: Rising creatinine
 likely intrarenal from contrast die and
   prerenal from diuresis
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] creatinine
   - Lasix gtt d/c
   - Renal dose meds
   - If persistently elevated, may try gentle IVF later this afternoon
   #NSTEMI: elevated cardiac biomarkers to TnI 7.21, now trending down.
   Could be demand ischemia or ACS.
   - Cont ASA, statin, plavix, BB
   - Cath deferred given ARF and ongoing medical issues
   #CHB: Intermittent CHB with temp wire, intermittently paced,
   intermittent Afib
   - Continue with temp pacer (ask cards to turn rate down to 50)
may need
   permanent pacemaker
   - TEE today to r/o aortic root abscess
   # Hct drop: Likely [**1-29**] significant bleeding from LIJ site.  No stopped
   and Hct stable.
   - Hct goal >30
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   #CHF: volume overloaded with cardiogenic pulmonary edema
   - Defer ACEI [**1-29**] potential HD instability

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, previous intubation, and coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) presenting with respiratory failure requiring intubation and subsequent extubation/re-intubation. She also has intermittent heart block, intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction of unknown chronicity, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing a combination of RLL PNA, asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The plan is to extubate after performing a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to CPAP. She will continue receiving vancomycin and ceftriaxone, as well as steroids and bronchodilators for asthma management.

2. Elevated WBC count: The WBC count has increased from 10 to 23. The urinalysis is bland, and the chest X-ray remains unchanged. The patient is afebrile, and the benign abdominal exam suggests that the elevated WBC count may be due to a reaction to steroids. It is recommended to check for Clostridium difficile and empirically cover with oral vancomycin.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are rising, likely due"

 [**Last Name 9**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   76 yo f with history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, HTN, Asthma who was
   transferred from [**Hospital 17**] Hospital for management of respiratory
   distress/Pneumonia, now s/p NSTEMI and temp pacer for episode of
   complete heart block.
   # Respiratory Distress/ PNA:  Pt initially treated for RLL PNA seen on
   CXR and CTA with vanco, zosyn. Switched to CTX, vanco, levofloxacin
   here. Levoflox subsequently stopped for prolonged QT. Pt extubated and
   re-intubated soon after when she developed severe wheezing and new
   onset pulm edema (suggesting possible cardiogenic source also). Flu
   swab negative. Sputum gram stain growing GPCs in pairs, but no culture
   or speciation.
   -- Day 3 of 8: Vanco, CTX, hold on atypical covg for now as azithro
   would also be QT prolonging, based on CTA appearance, low suspicion for
   atyicals
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- hold diuresis given prerenal FEurea and CVP 10.
   -- continue albuterol/atrovent PRN wheezing for asthma/COPD
   -- continue solumedrol 40mg IV daily for asthma/COPD (one more day)
   -- SBT and extubation today, will use CPAP if pulmonary edema returns
   as it did at the time of last extubation
   # Leukocytosis: Marked increase. WBC had been 10 for 4 days, now 20. It
   would be surprising if this were from her PNA as respiratory status and
   CXR improved. Strong suspicion for CDIFF: cdiff tox ordered and po
   vanco started empirically. Will trend WBC. Re-culture blood.
   # Heart Block: Temporary pacer placed with VVI 60.  Patient paced at 60
   bpm.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondadry to aortic root abscess.
   -- When other more pressing issues have resolved, pt may need permanent
   pacer
   -- TEE to eval for abscess today
   -- lyme serologies negative
   -- pacer rate decreased to 50 after discussion with EP fellow, avoiding
   AV nodal blocking agents per their recommendation; underlying rthyhm is
   sinus in mid 50s with PR 180.
   # NSTEMI: likely due to poorly controlled rate in the setting of very
   significant obstructive CAD. Cannot rule out plaque rupture with
   Cardiac enzymes this significant.  On ASA, plavix, high dose statin;
   IV heparin is off. Currently rate controlled.  Plan for cath is on hold
   given worsening renal fxn. Cardiac enzymes have peaked.
   .
   # HCT drop: secondary L IJ oozing which has stopped
   -Active T&s
   -transfuse to keep HCT>25
   -[**Hospital1 **] hct
   .
   #Acute renal failure: Prerenal by FE urea, but likely some contribution
   from CTA contrast.  Hollding on diuresis as goal CVP achieved.
   -follow chem. 7 [**Hospital1 **]
   -renally dose meds
   -avoid nephrotoxins

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

- The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x 4, hypertension, and asthma.
- She was transferred to the ICU for management of respiratory distress/pneumonia, but later experienced a new episode of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required temporary pacing for an episode of complete heart block.
- The patient initially received vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia, but then switched to ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. Levofloxacin was stopped due to prolonged QT interval.
- She was extubated and re-intubated due to severe wheezing and new-onset pulmonary edema, suggesting a possible cardiogenic source. Flu swab was negative, and sputum gram stain grew Gram-positive cocci in pairs, but no culture or speciation.
- Blood cultures are pending, and atypical coverage has been held due to the risk of QT prolongation.
- Diuretics have been held due to pre-renal acute kidney injury (FE urea) and low central venous pressure (CVP) 10.
- The patient is receiving albuterol/atrovent as needed for wheezing related to asthma/COP"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a middle-aged male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient had been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated and tolerating clear fluids. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/52 to 101/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's rhythm is set at a paced rate of 50 bpm. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 10.3 to 21.3 thousand cells per microliter, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 24.5% to 30.7%, and a platelet count (Plt) of 245 thousand cells per microliter. The blood glucose levels are within normal range. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an increase in creatinine (Cr) levels from 1.9 to 2.7 mg/dL. Other lab values, including liver enzymes, electrolytes, and cardiac markers, are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of CAD, which puts him at risk for complications related to ischemic heart disease. Additionally, the patient presents"

 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   76 yo f with history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, HTN, Asthma who was
   transferred from [**Hospital 17**] Hospital for management of respiratory
   distress/Pneumonia, now s/p NSTEMI and temp pacer for episode of
   complete heart block.
   # Respiratory Distress/ PNA:  Pt initially treated for RLL PNA seen on
   CXR and CTA with vanco, zosyn. Switched to CTX, vanco, levofloxacin
   here. Levoflox subsequently stopped for prolonged QT. Pt extubated and
   re-intubated soon after when she developed severe wheezing and new
   onset pulm edema (suggesting possible cardiogenic source also). Flu
   swab negative. Sputum gram stain growing GPCs in pairs, but no culture
   or speciation. Currently successfully extubated
   -- Day 4 of 8: Vanco, CTX, hold on atypical covg for now as azithro
   would also be QT prolonging, based on CTA appearance, low suspicion for
   atyicals
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- hold diuresis given prerenal FEurea and CVP 10.
   -- continue albuterol/atrovent PRN wheezing for asthma/COPD
   -- continue solumedrol 40mg IV daily for asthma/COPD (last day)
   -- consider CPAP if pulmonary edema returns as it did at the time of
   last extubation
   # Leukocytosis: Marked increase. WBC had been 10 for 4 days, up to 20,
   now down to 14. It would be surprising if this were from her PNA as
   respiratory status and CXR improved. Strong suspicion for CDIFF: cdiff
   tox ordered and po vanco started empirically. Will trend WBC.
   Re-culture blood.
   -f/u C diff toxin
   -continue po vancomycin
   # Heart Block: Temporary pacer placed with VVI 60.  Patient paced at 45
   bpm.   TEE negative for abscess. Lyme serology negative.  This evening,
   patient went into Afib with RVR. Currently asymptomatic.
   -- When other more pressing issues have resolved, pt may need permanent

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, and asthma. The patient was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and pneumonia, and subsequently developed a new onset of pulmonary edema, NSTEMI, complete heart block, and acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially treated for right lower lobe pneumonia, which was seen on chest X-ray and computed tomography angiography (CTA). The patient required reintubation due to severe wheezing and new onset pulmonary edema. There is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not appropriately managed.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the presence of pulmonary edema and acute decompensation of heart failure, there is a risk of developing cardiogenic shock due to the poor cardiac output and perfusion to vital organs.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20, which raises suspicion for C. diff infection. Empirical treatment with vancomycin has been started, and further evaluation with C. diff toxin assay is planned.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has prerenal azotemia with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level"

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, prior intubation, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). She presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation, intermittent heart block (including complete heart block), intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction of unknown chronicity, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLLPNA).

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure likely due to a combination of RLL PNA, asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. She is doing well on pressure support (PS) and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 43. The plan is to extubate her after transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

The patient's elevated white blood cell (WBC) count has increased from 10 to 23. Her urine analysis (U/A) is bland, and her chest X-ray (CXR) is unchanged. She is afebrile with a benign abdominal exam. It is noted that eosinophils may be a component of the reaction to steroids.

The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) is indicated by the rising creatinine levels, likely due to intrarenal contrast dye and prerenal diuresis. It is recommended to follow hospital creatinine levels, discontinue"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, coronary artery disease, and prior CABG surgery. She was admitted with respiratory failure, intermittent heart block, atrial fibrillation, elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia.

The patient has been extubated and is currently on noninvasive ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/72 to 240/235 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin concentration, prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, elevated troponin T level, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals improving infiltrates, enlarged cardiac shadow, and bilateral effusions.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of right lower lobe pneumonia, asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. She is now extubated and receiving noninvasive ventilation.
- Continue vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
- Use bronchodilators for asthma, preferably atrovent, if problems arise with [**Name (NI) 1978**] as the day progresses.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, coronary artery disease, and previous CABG surgery. She presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation, intermittent heart block, elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia. She is currently extubated and receiving Vanc and CTX antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience recurrent respiratory failure due to a combination of right lower lobe pneumonia, asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
2. Elevated white blood cell count: The patient's WBC count has fluctuated from 10 to 23, indicating a possible infection. Further investigation is needed, including repeating blood cultures pending.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient may have prerenal acute renal failure due to diuresis and loss of atrial kick. Close monitoring of creatinine levels and administration of renal dose medications are necessary.
4. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's elevated cardiac biomarkers suggest a possible NSTEMI. Continuous ASA, statin, Plavix, and beta-blocker therapy should be continued, and a cardiac catheterization should be discussed.
5. Complete heart block: The patient's intermittent CHB requires ongoing pacing wire support, with plans to decrease the pacing rate to 40 and potentially consider a permanent pacemaker.

 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   76 yo f with history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, HTN, Asthma who was
   transferred from [**Hospital 17**] Hospital for management of respiratory
   distress/Pneumonia, now s/p NSTEMI and temp pacer for episode of
   complete heart block.
   # Respiratory Distress/ PNA:  Pt initially treated for RLL PNA seen on
   CXR and CTA with vanco, zosyn. Switched to CTX, vanco, levofloxacin
   here. Levoflox subsequently stopped for prolonged QT. Pt extubated and
   re-intubated soon after when she developed severe wheezing and new
   onset pulm edema (suggesting possible cardiogenic source also). Flu
   swab negative. Sputum gram stain growing GPCs in pairs, but no culture
   or speciation. Currently successfully extubated
   -- Day 4 of 8: Vanco, CTX, hold on atypical covg for now as azithro
   would also be QT prolonging, based on CTA appearance, low suspicion for
   atyicals
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- hold diuresis given prerenal FEurea and CVP 10.
   -- continue albuterol/atrovent PRN wheezing for asthma/COPD
   -- continue solumedrol 40mg IV daily for asthma/COPD (last day)
   -- consider CPAP if pulmonary edema returns as it did at the time of
   last extubation
   # Leukocytosis: Marked increase. WBC had been 10 for 4 days, up to 20,
   now down to 14. It would be surprising if this were from her PNA as
   respiratory status and CXR improved. Strong suspicion for CDIFF: cdiff
   tox ordered and po vanco started empirically. Will trend WBC.
   Re-culture blood.
   -f/u C diff toxin
   -continue po vancomycin
   # Heart Block: Temporary pacer placed with VVI 60.  Patient paced at 45
   bpm.   TEE negative for abscess. Lyme serology negative.  This evening,
   patient went into Afib with RVR. Currently asymptomatic.
   -- When other more pressing issues have resolved, pt may need permanent
   pacer
   -- pacer rate decreased to 45 after discussion with EP fellow, avoiding
   AV nodal blocking agents per their recommendation; underlying rthyhm is
   sinus in mid 50s with PR 180.
   -- increased metoprolol to 50mg po tid
consider further increase in
   the morning if BP tolerates
   -- IV Metoprolol for HR>110
   # NSTEMI: likely due to poorly controlled rate in the setting of very
   significant obstructive CAD. Cannot rule out plaque rupture with
   Cardiac enzymes this significant.  On ASA, plavix, high dose statin;
   IV heparin is off. Currently rate controlled.  Plan for cath is on hold
   given worsening renal fxn. Cardiac enzymes have peaked.
   -Cardiology may cath on Friday if renal function returns to normal
   .
   # HCT drop: secondary L IJ oozing which has stopped. D/c-ed L IJ.
   Guaiac negative. Hemolysis labs negative.
   -Active T&s
   -transfuse to keep HCT>25
   -[**Hospital1 **] hct
   .
   #Acute renal failure: Prerenal by FE urea, but likely some contribution
   from CTA contrast.  Hollding on diuresis as goal CVP achieved ([**10-8**]).
   -follow chem. 7 [**Hospital1 **]
   -renally dose meds
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: synthroid dose =137mcg
   # Gout: holding colchicine in setting of ARF
   -continue allopurinol, renally dosed
   # FEN: replete lytes prn / Cardiac diet

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, hypertension, and asthma. The patient was admitted to the ICU for management of respiratory distress and pneumonia (PNA). She also experienced an episode of complete heart block and required a temporary pacemaker.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Distress/Pneumonia: The patient initially treated for right lower lobe pneumonia, seen on chest X-ray and computed tomography angiography (CTA). She was initially given vancomycin and zosyn, then switched to ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. Levofloxacin was subsequently stopped due to prolonged QT interval. The patient was extubated and re-intubated after developing severe wheezing and new-onset pulmonary edema, suggesting a possible cardiogenic source. Flu swab negative. Sputum gram stain growing gram-positive cocci in pairs, but no culture or speciation. Currently successfully extubated.

2. Leukocytosis: There is a marked increase in white blood cell count from 10 to 20, now down to 14. This could be due to the recent infection or other factors. Strong suspicion for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, with C. diff toxin ordered and empirical treatment with oral"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), fever of unknown origin (FUO), and acute respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), a heart rate ranging from 65 to 109 beats per minute (bpm), a blood pressure ranging from 135/47 mmHg to 182/138 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation (AF) with a heart rate in the 100-120s, which was managed with IV metoprolol and oral metoprolol.

The patient received a total of 1,127 mL of fluids since midnight, with 310 mL given intravenously. The blood product transfusion resulted in a positive hemoglobin concentration change from 29.3% to 24.7%. The patient's guaiac test was positive, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the C. difficile test was negative.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, decreased hematocrit (Hct) levels, and increased platelet count (Plt). The creatinine (Cr) level is slightly elevated, while the troponin-T level is within normal"

 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   76 yo f with history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, HTN, Asthma who was
   transferred from [**Hospital 17**] Hospital for management of respiratory
   distress/Pneumonia, now s/p NSTEMI and temp pacer for episode of
   complete heart block.
   # Respiratory Distress/ PNA:  Pt initially treated for RLL PNA seen on
   CXR and CTA with vanco, zosyn. Switched to CTX, vanco, levofloxacin
   here. Levoflox subsequently stopped for prolonged QT. Pt extubated and
   re-intubated soon after when she developed severe wheezing and new
   onset pulm edema (suggesting possible cardiogenic source also). Flu
   swab negative. Sputum gram stain growing GPCs in pairs, but no culture
   or speciation. Currently successfully extubated
   -- Day 4 of 8: Vanco, CTX, hold on atypical covg for now as azithro
   would also be QT prolonging, based on CTA appearance, low suspicion for
   atyicals
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- hold diuresis given prerenal FEurea and CVP 10.
   -- continue albuterol/atrovent PRN wheezing for asthma/COPD
   -- continue solumedrol 40mg IV daily for asthma/COPD (last day)
   -- consider CPAP if pulmonary edema returns as it did at the time of
   last extubation
   # Leukocytosis: Marked increase. WBC had been 10 for 4 days, up to 20,
   now down to 14. It would be surprising if this were from her PNA as
   respiratory status and CXR improved. Strong suspicion for CDIFF: cdiff
   tox ordered and po vanco started empirically. Will trend WBC.
   Re-culture blood.
   -f/u C diff toxin
   -continue po vancomycin
   # Heart Block: Temporary pacer placed with VVI 60.  Patient paced at 45
   bpm.   TEE negative for abscess. Lyme serology negative.  This evening,
   patient went into Afib with RVR. Currently asymptomatic.
   -- When other more pressing issues have resolved, pt may need permanent
   pacer
   -- pacer rate decreased to 45 after discussion with EP fellow, avoiding
   AV nodal blocking agents per their recommendation; underlying rthyhm is
   sinus in mid 50s with PR 180.
   -- increased metoprolol to 50mg po tid
consider further increase in
   the morning if BP tolerates
   -- IV Metoprolol for HR>110
   # NSTEMI: likely due to poorly controlled rate in the setting of very
   significant obstructive CAD. Cannot rule out plaque rupture with
   Cardiac enzymes this significant.  On ASA, plavix, high dose statin;
   IV heparin is off. Currently rate controlled.  Plan for cath is on hold
   given worsening renal fxn. Cardiac enzymes have peaked.
   -Cardiology may cath on Friday if renal function returns to normal
   .
   # HCT drop: secondary L IJ oozing which has stopped. D/c-ed L IJ.
   Guaiac negative. Hemolysis labs negative.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, asthma, who was transferred from another hospital for management of respiratory distress/pneumonia. The patient has undergone a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery four times.

The patient's current medical issues include:
1. Respiratory distress/pneumonia: The patient initially treated for right lower lobe pneumonia seen on chest X-ray and computed tomography angiography (CTA) with vancomycin and zosyn. The antibiotic regimen was later switched to ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. Levofloxacin was subsequently stopped due to prolonged QT interval. The patient was extubated and re-intubated soon after due to severe wheezing and new-onset pulmonary edema. Flu swab was negative. Sputum gram stain showed growth of Gram-positive cocci in pairs, but no culture or speciation. Currently, the patient is successfully extubated.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a marked increase in white blood cell count from 10 to 20, now down to 14. It would be surprising if this were from her pneumonia as respiratory status and chest X-ray improved. There is a strong suspicion for Clostridium difficile infection (CDIFF): cdiff toxin ordered and oral vancomycin started empirically. Will trend"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and asthma. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and pneumonia. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) four times. She is currently being treated for NSTEMI and temporary pacing for an episode of complete heart block. The patient's respiratory distress has been managed with various interventions, including extubation and re-intubation due to severe wheezing and pulmonary edema. The patient's leukocytosis is suspected to be caused by Clostridium difficile infection (CDIFF), and she is being monitored for this condition. A temporary pacer was placed due to heart block, and the patient may require a permanent pacemaker after cardiac catheterization. The patient's HCT dropped due to oozing from the left internal jugular vein, which has been discontinued. Her acute renal failure continues to improve, and she is being closely monitored for any changes. The patient also has hypothyroidism, gout, and acute renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory distress/pneumonia required multiple interventions, including extubation and re-intubation. She is currently successfully extubated, but there is a concern for possible cardiogenic source of pulmonary edema. Close monitoring for any signs of respiratory distress or deterioration is necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, prior intubation, and coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is now experiencing respiratory failure. She has intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), reduced ejection fraction (EF) of unknown chronicity, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA). 

The patient has been intubated and is currently extubated. She is on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ranitidine, metoprolol, heparin sodium, aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, subcutaneous heparin, allopurinol, omeprazole, and synthetic thyroid hormone.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 129/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. She has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg and is receiving fluids through various routes. She has trace edema in both lower extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, low hemoglobin (Hct), elevated creatinine, elevated troponin T,"

She presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation, intermittent heart block, and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient has elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The combination of RLL PNA, asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema may lead to respiratory failure. The patient was previously intubated but is now extubated.
2. Elevated WBC count: The patient's white blood cell count increased from 10 to 23, indicating an inflammatory response. This could be due to infection or another underlying cause. The patient's urinalysis (U/A) was bland yesterday, and her chest X-ray (CXR) is unchanged. She is afebrile, and her abdominal examination is benign. There is a possibility of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, so empirical coverage with oral vancomycin (Vanc) has been started. Repeat blood cultures are pending.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have increased, suggesting ARF. This could be due to prerenal causes such as diuresis and loss of atrial kick"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, coronary artery disease, and previous CABG surgery. The patient was admitted due to respiratory failure requiring intubation, intermittent heart block, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction of unknown chronicity, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA).

The patient is currently extubated and improving, but still requires oxygen support. She has a history of intermittent complete heart block with temporary pacing wire, intermittently paced, and intermittent atrial fibrillation. Her white blood cell count has been fluctuating, but now back to normal levels. She also has acute renal failure likely due to pre-renal causes, which is improving. The patient experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with elevated cardiac biomarkers, which are now trending down. A coronary angiography (cath) was initially deferred but may be performed tomorrow. The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped without an identifiable source, and she received two units of packed red blood cells. Her stool is occult positive, but brown in color. The patient's chest X-ray is unchanged, and she tested negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff).

The assessment and plan include respiratory failure likely due to a combination of RLL PNA, asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The"

   transferred from [**Hospital 17**] Hospital for management of respiratory
   distress/Pneumonia, now s/p NSTEMI and temp pacer for episode of
   complete heart block.
   # Respiratory Distress/ PNA:  Pt initially treated for RLL PNA seen on
   CXR and CTA with vanco, zosyn. Switched to CTX, vanco, levofloxacin
   here. Levoflox subsequently stopped for prolonged QT. Pt extubated and
   re-intubated soon after when she developed severe wheezing and new
   onset pulm edema (suggesting possible cardiogenic source also). Flu
   swab negative. Sputum gram stain growing GPCs in pairs, but no culture
   or speciation. Currently successfully extubated
   -- Day 5 of 8: Vanco, CTX, hold on atypical covg for now as azithro
   would also be QT prolonging, based on CTA appearance, low suspicion for
   atyicals
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- continue albuterol/atrovent PRN wheezing for asthma/COPD
   -- consider CPAP if pulmonary edema returns as it did at the time of
   last extubation
   # Leukocytosis: Marked increase. WBC had been 10 for 4 days, up to 20,
   now down to 14. It would be surprising if this were from her PNA as
   respiratory status and CXR improved. Strong suspicion for CDIFF: cdiff
   tox ordered and po vanco started empirically. Will trend WBC.

   # Heart Block: Temporary pacer placed with VVI 60.  Patient paced at 45
   bpm.   TEE negative for abscess. Lyme serology negative.  Per EP, will
   likely need permanent pacer, but needs c.cath first

   76 yo f with history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, HTN, Asthma who was
   transferred from [**Hospital 17**] Hospital for management of respiratory
   distress/Pneumonia, now s/p NSTEMI and temp pacer for episode of
   complete heart block.
   # Respiratory Distress/ PNA:  resolving.  Pt initially treated for RLL
   PNA seen on CXR and CTA with vanco, zosyn. Switched to CTX, vanco,
   levofloxacin here. Levoflox subsequently stopped for prolonged QT. Pt
   extubated and re-intubated soon after when she developed severe
   wheezing and new onset pulm edema (suggesting possible cardiogenic
   source also). Flu swab negative. Sputum gram stain growing GPCs in
   pairs, but no culture or speciation. Currently successfully extubated
   -- Day 6 of 8: Vanco, CTX, hold on atypical covg for now as azithro
   would also be QT prolonging, based on CTA appearance, low suspicion for
   atyicals
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- continue albuterol/atrovent PRN wheezing for asthma/COPD
   -- consider CPAP if pulmonary edema returns as it did at the time of
   last extubation
   # Leukocytosis: Marked increase. WBC had been 10 for 4 days, up to 20,
   now down to 14. It would be surprising if this were from her PNA as
   respiratory status and CXR improved. C diff negative. Will trend WBC.
   - f/u culture data
   # Heart Block: Temporary pacer placed with VVI 60.  Patient paced at 45
   bpm.   TEE negative for abscess. Lyme serology negative.  Per EP, will
   likely need permanent pacer, but needs c.cath first
   -- pacer rate decreased to 45 after discussion with EP fellow, avoiding
   AV nodal blocking agents per their recommendation; underlying rthyhm is
   sinus in mid 50s with PR 180.
   -- cont Metoprolol 37.5mg PO TID
   -- IV Metoprolol for HR>110
   # NSTEMI: likely due to poorly controlled rate in the setting of very
   significant obstructive CAD. Cannot rule out plaque rupture with
   Cardiac enzymes this significant.  On ASA, plavix, high dose statin,
   ACEI;  IV heparin is off. Currently rate controlled.  Plan for cath is
   on hold, possibly [**Hospital 501**].

- The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x4, hypertension, and asthma.
- She was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and pneumonia, and subsequently developed a new onset of NSTEMI and temporary pacing for complete heart block.
- She initially treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and then switched to ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. Levofloxacin was stopped due to prolonged QT.
- The patient experienced severe wheezing and pulmonary edema, necessitating reintubation. Flu swab was negative, and sputum gram stain showed growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs.
- She is currently successfully extubated and on day 6 of an 8-day antibiotic regimen.
- Her leukocytosis has improved from 20 to 14, and C. difficile negative.
- A temporary pacer was placed with VVI 60, but the pacing rate was decreased to 45 bpm. TEE and Lyme serology were negative, and an electrophysiologist (EP) fellow recommended a permanent pacer due to persistent bradycardia.
- The patient is on metoprolol 37.5 mg PO TID and IV metoprolol for HR>110.

","The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/43 mmHg to 117/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient has atrial fibrillation.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,905 mL and total output of 905 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a positive balance of 1,000 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids, blood products, and has received antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftriaxone).

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 14.8 to 15.0 K/uL. Hemoglobin levels are within normal range, ranging from 9.4 to 11.8 g/dL. Platelet count is slightly low, ranging from 143 to 176 K/uL. Renal function is impaired with creatinine levels ranging from 1.2 to 1.9 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels are elevated at 2.85 ng/mL.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute anemia secondary to blood loss, coronary artery disease, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, coronary artery disease, and previous cardiac bypass surgery. She presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation, intermittent heart block, atrial fibrillation, elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient is now extubated and improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient had respiratory failure likely due to a combination of right lower lobe pneumonia, asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Although she is now extubated and improving, there is still a risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening asthma symptoms.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient has intermittent complete heart block with temporary pacing wire, intermittently paced, and intermittent atrial fibrillation. There is a risk of developing further arrhythmias or cardiac conduction abnormalities.
3. Elevated white blood cell count: The patient's WBC count was elevated from 10 to 23, now back down to 15. This may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure likely due to prerenal causes such as diuresis and loss of atrial kick. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
5. Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient has elevated cardiac biomarkers, which could indicate demand ischemia or acute"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, prior intubation, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She was admitted with respiratory failure requiring intubation, intermittent heart block including complete heart block (CHB) requiring pacing wire, intermittent atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR), elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction (EF) of unknown chronicity, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Arrhythmias: Intermittent CHB with temporary pacemaker at 40 beats per minute. The patient may need a permanent pacemaker, but an electrophysiology (EP) study is deferred until white blood cell (WBC) count is normal.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has a combination of RLL PNA, asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. She is now extubated and improving.
   - Continue vancomycin (Vanc) and ceftriaxone (CTX) for 8 days.
   - Wean oxygen.
   - Use Atrovent for asthma. Hold albuterol due to rapid ventricular response.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has prerenal acute renal failure from diuresis and loss of atr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, prior intubation, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, intermittent heart block, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib RVR), elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction (EF), possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA). 

The patient is extubated and improving, and her respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of RLL PNA, asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. She is being treated with antibiotics (Vanc/CTX) for 8 days and her oxygen therapy is being weaned off. 

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) that is improving, possibly due to diuresis and loss of atrial kick. She will continue to have her creatinine levels followed, and Mucomyst will be given prior to catheterization. 

Additionally, the patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with elevated cardiac biomarkers, now trending down. She is on aspirin (ASA), statin, Plavix, and a beta-blocker (BB), and a catheterization has been deferred due to ARF and ongoing medical issues, but may be performed tomorrow.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
- She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure requiring intubation, intermittent heart block, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction (EF) of unknown chronicity, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA).
- The patient's leukocyte count was initially elevated, but has now normalized.
- The patient has been extubated and is improving.
- She continues to experience arrhythmias, including intermittent complete heart block (CHB) with temporary pacing wire, intermittent atrial fibrillation (AFib), and elevated cardiac biomarkers indicative of a possible non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- Other conditions include acute renal failure (ARF), likely caused by diuresis and loss of atrial kick, congestive heart failure (CHF) with mild volume overload and cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and possible upper airway obstruction.
- The patient's current medications include metoprolol for rate control, captopril for blood pressure control, heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and various cardiac medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She also had intermittent heart block and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's cardiac biomarkers were elevated, indicating possible acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ischemia. She had reduced ejection fraction (EF) of unknown chronicity, and there were concerns about an asthma exacerbation and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA).

24-hour events include increasing the dose of metoprolol for rate control, administration of antibiotics (Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone), and initiation of heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate (HR) of 77 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 148/62 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently extubated and improving.

Physical examination findings include no acute distress, normal neurological status, decreased breath sounds at the bases with soft crackles, and irregularly irregular heart rhythm consistent with atrial fibrillation. Laboratory results show leukoc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, prior intubation, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation. She also has intermittent heart block, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction (EF) of unknown chronicity, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient initially had a high white blood cell count, which has now improved. The cause of leukocytosis is unclear.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient has intermittent complete heart block (CHB) and is being paced. She also has intermittent atrial fibrillation (AFib). The temporary pacer may need to be converted to a permanent pacemaker. 
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely a combination of RLL PNA, asthma exacerbation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. She has been extubated and is improving.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to prerenal causes such as diuresis and loss of atrial kick. Creatinine levels are being followed.
5. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient has elevated cardiac biomarkers, which may indicate a NSTEMI."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, prior intubation, and coronary artery disease who underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and is now in the ICU. She presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation, intermittent heart block (including complete heart block) requiring pacing wire, intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, elevated cardiac biomarkers indicating possible NSTEMI, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of unknown chronicity, and possible asthma exacerbation and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA).

The patient is currently extubated and improving, with ongoing management of her conditions including temporary pacing at 40 beats per minute, consideration for permanent pacemaker placement once white blood cell count normalizes, continuation of vancomycin and ceftriaxone antibiotics, weaning of oxygen, and use of Atrovent for asthma. She also has acute renal failure (ARF) likely secondary to prerenal causes such as diuresis and loss of atrial kick, which is improving. A coronary angiogram (cath) has been deferred due to ARF and ongoing medical issues, but may be performed tomorrow. Additionally, there are concerns about congestive heart failure (CHF) with mild volume overload and cardiogenic pulmonary edema, for which the patient has been started on an ACE inhibitor and will be weaned off a calcium channel blocker.

   76 yo f with history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, HTN, Asthma who was
   transferred from [**Hospital 17**] Hospital for management of respiratory
   distress/Pneumonia, now s/p NSTEMI and temp pacer for episode of
   complete heart block.
   # Respiratory Distress/ PNA:  resolving.  Pt initially treated for RLL
   PNA seen on CXR and CTA with vanco, zosyn. Switched to CTX, vanco,
   levofloxacin here. Levoflox subsequently stopped for prolonged QT. Pt
   extubated and re-intubated soon after when she developed severe
   wheezing and new onset pulm edema (suggesting possible cardiogenic
   source also). Flu swab negative. Sputum gram stain growing GPCs in
   pairs, but no culture or speciation. Currently successfully extubated
   -- Day 6 of 8: Vanco, CTX, hold on atypical covg for now as azithro
   would also be QT prolonging, based on CTA appearance, low suspicion for
   atyicals
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- continue albuterol/atrovent PRN wheezing for asthma/COPD
   -- consider CPAP if pulmonary edema returns as it did at the time of
   last extubation
   # Leukocytosis: Marked increase. WBC had been 10 for 4 days, up to 20,
   now down to 14. It would be surprising if this were from her PNA as
   respiratory status and CXR improved. C diff negative. Will trend WBC.
   - f/u culture data
   # Heart Block: Temporary pacer placed with VVI 60.  Patient paced at 45
   bpm.   TEE negative for abscess. Lyme serology negative.  Per EP, will
   likely need permanent pacer, but needs c.cath first
   -- pacer rate decreased to 45 after discussion with EP fellow, avoiding
   AV nodal blocking agents per their recommendation; underlying rthyhm is
   sinus in mid 50s with PR 180.
   -- cont Metoprolol 37.5mg PO TID
   -- IV Metoprolol for HR>110
   # NSTEMI: likely due to poorly controlled rate in the setting of very
   significant obstructive CAD. Cannot rule out plaque rupture with
   Cardiac enzymes this significant.  On ASA, plavix, high dose statin,
   ACEI;  IV heparin is off. Currently rate controlled.  Plan for cath is
   on hold, possibly [**Hospital 501**].
   -Cardiology may cath on [**Last Name (LF) 501**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] f/u recs
   .
   # HCT drop: HCT stable over 24 hours.  likely 2/2 L IJ oozing which has
   stopped. D/c-ed L IJ. Guaiac positive. Hemolysis labs negative.  HCT
   now 30 s/p transfusion

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and pneumonia. She underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure and has been experiencing multiple medical complications since admission.

24-hour events include increasing the dose of metoprolol to 50 tid. She received vancomycin and ceftriaxone for suspected pneumonia. Heparin sodium was initiated as prophylaxis, and pantoprazole was given for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the presence of atrial fibrillation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/62 mmHg to 111/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,226 mL, including 10 mL of blood products. Output includes 855 mL of urine, 371 mL of IV fluids, and 1,055 mL of blood products. The patient has received respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.8 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/d"

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of being in the ICU. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD), anemia secondary to blood loss, and fever of unknown origin. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including metoprolol, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and ceftriaxone.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is within normal range, heart rate is stable, blood pressure is elevated but fluctuating, respiratory rate is slightly increased, and oxygen saturation is at 99% on nasal cannula. The patient has atrial fibrillation as his heart rhythm.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 1,226 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with 855 mL being given through the oral route, 371 mL through IV fluids, and a net balance of 171 mL. The patient's weight has decreased from 70.5 kg at admission to 69.4 kg currently.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Blood chemistry results indicate slightly elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and troponin-T, while other lab values are within normal ranges.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds, and no lower extremity edema. Neurological assessment was not performed.

   76 yo f with history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, HTN, Asthma who was
   transferred from [**Hospital 17**] Hospital for management of respiratory
   distress/Pneumonia, now s/p NSTEMI and temp pacer for episode of
   complete heart block.
   # Respiratory Distress/ PNA:  resolving.  Pt initially treated for RLL
   PNA seen on CXR and CTA with vanco, zosyn. Switched to CTX, vanco,
   levofloxacin here. Levoflox subsequently stopped for prolonged QT. Pt
   extubated and re-intubated soon after when she developed severe
   wheezing and new onset pulm edema (suggesting possible cardiogenic
   source also). Flu swab negative. Sputum gram stain growing GPCs in
   pairs, but no culture or speciation. Currently successfully extubated
   -- Day 6 of 8: Vanco, CTX, hold on atypical covg for now as azithro
   would also be QT prolonging, based on CTA appearance, low suspicion for
   atyicals
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- continue albuterol/atrovent PRN wheezing for asthma/COPD
   -- consider CPAP if pulmonary edema returns as it did at the time of
   last extubation
   # Leukocytosis: Marked increase. WBC had been 10 for 4 days, up to 20,
   now down to 14. It would be surprising if this were from her PNA as
   respiratory status and CXR improved. C diff negative. Will trend WBC.
   - f/u culture data
   # Heart Block: Temporary pacer placed with VVI 60.  Patient paced at 45
   bpm.   TEE negative for abscess. Lyme serology negative.  Per EP, will
   likely need permanent pacer, but needs c.cath first
   -- pacer rate decreased to 45 after discussion with EP fellow, avoiding
   AV nodal blocking agents per their recommendation; underlying rthyhm is
   sinus in mid 50s with PR 180.
   -- cont Metoprolol 37.5mg PO TID
   -- IV Metoprolol for HR>110
   # NSTEMI: likely due to poorly controlled rate in the setting of very

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and pneumonia.
- The patient had undergone four coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries, hypertension, and asthma.
- Upon admission, she developed a new episode of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and experienced complete heart block, requiring a temporary pacemaker.
- The patient initially treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin for pneumonia but subsequently developed severe wheezing and pulmonary edema.
- She was successfully extubated on day 6 but had to be reintubated due to the recurrence of pulmonary edema.
- Blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in pairs, suggesting a possible bacterial infection.
- The patient's white blood cell count increased from 10 to 20 and is now at 14.
- The patient has been placed on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support.
- Temporary pacing was initiated with a ventricular-demand-only (VVI) mode at 60 beats per minute, but the pacing rate was decreased to 45 bpm due to an excessive pacing burden.
- A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) ruled out any abscess, and Lyme serology was negative.
- The patient will likely require a permanent pacemaker, but a cardiac catheterization is needed first.
- The patient"

   transferred from [**Hospital 17**] Hospital for management of respiratory
   distress/Pneumonia, now s/p NSTEMI and temp pacer for episode of
   complete heart block.
   # Respiratory Distress/ PNA:  resolving.  Pt initially treated for RLL
   PNA seen on CXR and CTA with vanco, zosyn. Switched to CTX, vanco,
   levofloxacin here. Levoflox subsequently stopped for prolonged QT. Pt
   extubated and re-intubated soon after when she developed severe
   wheezing and new onset pulm edema (suggesting possible cardiogenic
   source also). Flu swab negative. Sputum gram stain growing GPCs in
   pairs, but no culture or speciation. Currently successfully extubated
   -- Day 6 of 8: Vanco, CTX, hold on atypical covg for now as azithro
   would also be QT prolonging, based on CTA appearance, low suspicion for
   atyicals
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- continue albuterol/atrovent PRN wheezing for asthma/COPD
   -- consider CPAP if pulmonary edema returns as it did at the time of
   last extubation
   # Leukocytosis: Marked increase. WBC had been 10 for 4 days, up to 20,
   now down to 14. It would be surprising if this were from her PNA as
   respiratory status and CXR improved. C diff negative. Will trend WBC.
   - f/u culture data
   # Heart Block: Temporary pacer placed with VVI 60.  Patient paced at 45
   bpm.   TEE negative for abscess. Lyme serology negative.  Per EP, will
   likely need permanent pacer, but needs c.cath first
   -- pacer rate decreased to 45 after discussion with EP fellow, avoiding
   AV nodal blocking agents per their recommendation; underlying rthyhm is
   sinus in mid 50s with PR 180.
   -- cont Metoprolol 37.5mg PO TID
   -- IV Metoprolol for HR>110
   # NSTEMI: likely due to poorly controlled rate in the setting of very

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, asthma, who was admitted for respiratory distress and pneumonia. She has undergone a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure four times. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, fever of unknown origin, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She has had multiple episodes of respiratory distress, including wheezing and pulmonary edema, requiring re-intubation. The patient also experienced an episode of complete heart block and was temporarily paced. She had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is currently on anticoagulant therapy. There has been a marked increase in white blood cell count, which is being trended. The patient's renal function is improving, and she has received transfusions to maintain a hematocrit level above 25. Other issues include acute renal failure, gout, and hypothyroidism. The patient is currently in the ICU with plans for a permanent pacemaker and cardiac catheterization once her white blood cell count stabilizes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress, leading to further respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent episode of complete heart block, there is a risk of developing cardiogenic shock, especially if the"

   transferred from [**Hospital 17**] Hospital for management of respiratory
   distress/Pneumonia, now s/p NSTEMI and temp pacer for episode of
   complete heart block.
   # Respiratory Distress/ PNA:  resolving.  Pt initially treated for RLL
   PNA seen on CXR and CTA with vanco, zosyn. Switched to CTX, vanco,
   levofloxacin here. Levoflox subsequently stopped for prolonged QT. Pt
   extubated and re-intubated soon after when she developed severe
   wheezing and new onset pulm edema (suggesting possible cardiogenic
   source also). Flu swab negative. Sputum gram stain growing GPCs in
   pairs, but no culture or speciation. Currently successfully extubated
   -- Day 9, will stop Abx today
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- continue albuterol/atrovent PRN wheezing for asthma/COPD
   -- consider CPAP if pulmonary edema returns as it did at the time of
   last extubation
   # Leukocytosis: WBC at 16 today.Unclear cause at this time.  Pneumonia
   treated at this time.  Pacer wire taken out today and RIJ line also
   taken out.  Tip unfortunately not sent for culture.  Will f/u blood
   cultures.  UA yesterday negative.  Cdiff to be sent today
   - send cbc/diff
   - f/u culture data
   - f/u C.diff
   # Heart.   TEE negative for abscess. Lyme serology negative.  Per EP,
   will need permanent pacer.  Has not required pacing with temporary
   pacer wire so pacer wire discontinued today out of concern for
   infection.
   -- monitor on tele
   -- can place [**Hospital1 1276**] pads give Atropine if goes into heart block again
   -- cont Metoprolol 37.5mg PO TID
   -- IV Metoprolol for HR>110
   # NSTEMI: likely due to poorly controlled rate in the setting of very
   significant obstructive CAD. Cannot rule out plaque rupture with
   Cardiac enzymes this significant.  On ASA, plavix, high dose statin,
   ACEI;  IV heparin is off. Currently rate controlled.  Plan for cath is

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, hypertension, asthma, and respiratory distress/pneumonia. The patient was transferred from another hospital for management of respiratory distress/pneumonia and subsequently experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and temporary pacing for an episode of complete heart block.

The patient initially presented with right lower lobe pneumonia seen on chest X-ray and computed tomography angiography (CTA), treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and then switched to ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. Levofloxacin was stopped due to prolonged QT interval. The patient was extubated but developed severe wheezing and new-onset pulmonary edema, suggesting a possible cardiogenic source. Flu swab was negative, and sputum gram stain grew gram-positive cocci in pairs but no culture or speciation. Currently, the patient is successfully extubated.

The patient's leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 16 is unresolved, and the cause is unclear at this time. Pneumonia has been treated, and the pacer wire was taken out today, along with the right internal jugular (RIJ) line. Blood cultures will be followed up, and urine analysis yesterday was negative. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) will be sent today.

The patient's heart condition showed negative results for abscess on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and negative lyme serology. The electrophysiologist (EP) recommends a permanent pacemaker, as the temporary pacer wire was discontinued due to concern for infection. The patient is currently on telemonitoring, and atrial fibrillation (AF) is present.

The patient also experienced an NSTEMI likely due to poorly controlled rate in the setting of very significant obstructive CAD. The cardiac enzymes were significantly elevated, indicating possible plaque rupture. The patient is on aspirin, clopidogrel, high-dose statin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), and intravenous heparin has been stopped. The plan for cardiac catheterization is on hold, possibly at Hospital1 501, with follow-up recommendations.

Additionally, the patient has a hematocrit (HCT) drop with stable HCT at 26. Initially, there was oozing from the Line Jersey (LJI) which has now been discontinued. Stools are guaiac positive but without overt signs of gastrointestinal bleeding. Active transfusion and service (T&S) will be followed up, with a goal to keep HCT >25. Daily hct will be monitored.

The patient also has acute renal failure, which continues to improve with a creatinine (Cr) level"

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with h/o asthma with prior intubation and CAD s/p CABG p/w
   respiratory failure requiring intubation (now extubated), intermittent
   heart block (including CHB) requiring pacing wire, intermittent Afib
   RVR, elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced EF of unknown chronicity,
   possible asthma exacerbation and RLL PNA.
   # Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology, peak WBC 20, now 16.
   - Completed Vanco/CTX x8 days as of [**11-11**]
   - Repeat UA/Ucx, CXR, sputum
   - D/c foley
   #Arrhythmias: Intermittent CHB with temp wire, intermittently paced,
   largely in Afib.
   - Continue temp wire d/c
d by EP [**11-11**], but needs permanent pacemaker,
   EP is deferring until WBC count nl
   - Continue lopressor for a fib, goal HR is ~60 but now that temp wire
   is d/c
d, will hold off on aggressive beta-blockade
   - Discuss transfer to C-MED now that temp wire is d/c
   # Respiratory failure: Likely a combination of RLL PNA, asthma
   exacerbation and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Possible mild upper
   airway obstruction.   Now extubated and improving.
   - Vanc/CTX x 8 days ([**11-11**] last day)
   - On RA
   - Atrovent for asthma. Holding albuterol given RVR
   # ARF: Likely prerenal from diuresis and loss of atrial kick.  Now
   improving.
   - Follow creatinine
   - Mucomyst prior to cath
   #NSTEMI: elevated cardiac biomarkers to TnI 7.21, now trending down.
   Could be demand ischemia or ACS.
   - Cont ASA, statin, plavix, BB, ACEi
   - Titrate BB to HR ~60, captopril to goal SBP ~110
   - Cath deferred given ARF and ongoing medical issues, may still need

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, prior intubation, and coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is now presenting with respiratory failure requiring intubation, intermittent heart block, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR), elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction of unknown chronicity, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA).

The patient has been treated with vancomycin (Vanco) and ceftriaxone (CTX) for an unclear etiology of leukocytosis, which peaked at 20 and is now at 16. The patient also has intermittent complete heart block (CHB) with a temporary pacing wire in place, largely in AF. The temporary wire will be removed by the electrophysiologist (EP) on [**11-11**], but the patient needs a permanent pacemaker. The patient is currently on lopressor for atrial fibrillation, aiming for a heart rate of approximately 60 beats per minute.

The patient has been extubated and is improving, with ongoing respiratory support on room air (RA). Asthma exacerbation and cardiogenic pulmonary edema are possible contributing factors to the respiratory failure. The patient is being given Atrovent for asthma management and holding albuterol due to rapid ventricular response.

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure ("

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, previous intubation, and coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation, intermittent heart block, and elevated cardiac biomarkers. The patient also had leukocytosis, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA). She was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib RVR), acute renal failure (ARF), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and mild volume overload with cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

The patient was started on various medications including furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium, metoprolol, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. She was also on temporary pacing wires due to intermittent complete heart block and intermittent atrial fibrillation. The patient was weaned off the ventilator and transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening asthma exacerbation or RLL PNA.
2. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart block, or further myocardial ischemia.
3. Acute kidney injury or worsening renal function.
4. Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and use of indwelling lines or devices.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of asthma, prior intubation, and coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). She presented with respiratory failure requiring intubation, intermittent heart block, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, elevated cardiac biomarkers, reduced ejection fraction of unknown chronicity, possible asthma exacerbation, and right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA).

The patient was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for 8 days. Her leukocyte count initially peaked at 20 but is now 16. She has intermittent complete heart block that has been paced and is largely in atrial fibrillation. Temporary wire was removed but needs a permanent pacemaker. She continues on lopressor for atrial fibrillation, with a goal heart rate of ~60 bpm.

The patient was extubated and improving, with respiratory support on room air. She received Atrovent for asthma and held albuterol due to rapid ventricular response. Her acute renal failure is likely prerenal from diuresis and loss of atrial kick, now improving. She has elevated cardiac biomarkers consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which could be demand ischemia or acute coronary syndrome. She is on aspirin, statin, Plavix, beta-blocker, and ACE inhibitor. Her catheterization has"
