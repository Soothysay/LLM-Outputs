","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female admitted with altered mental status and recent fungal septic arthritis. The differential diagnoses include seizures, hypertensive urgency/emergency, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, substance abuse withdrawal, and toxic metabolic due to acidosis.

The patient's current conditions include diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypertension (benign), and alcohol withdrawal (including delirium tremens, DTS, seizures). The patient is experiencing confusion, nausea, and vomiting.

Key interventions and findings include:
- Neurological evaluation: The patient is not oriented, but responds to verbal questions and moves all extremities. LP results and cultures are pending, along with EEG and MRI/MRA.
- Acidosis: The patient likely has DKA/starvation ketosis with positive ketones on UA. Insulin gtt has been started, and electrolyte supplementation is planned.
- Hypertension: The patient is being treated with a beta-blocker and IV hydralazine.
- Nutrition: The patient is currently NPO and will be transitioned to PO intake when able. She has an NGT for feeds.
- Glycemic control: The patient is on an insulin drip, which will be transitioned to lantus.
- Lines/intubation: The patient has two lines, an 18-gauge and a 22-gauge, inserted on 07/04/2190.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female admitted with altered mental status, recent fungal septic arthritis, and several potential differential diagnoses including seizures, hypertensive urgency/emergency, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, substance abuse withdrawal, and toxic metabolic due to acidosis. The patient's current conditions include diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypertension, and alcohol withdrawal. The patient is being treated with antibiotics for meningitis, sedation for alcohol withdrawal, and insulin for acidosis. Imaging and laboratory tests are pending to confirm the diagnosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient may experience seizures due to alcohol withdrawal or an underlying neurological condition.
2. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which could lead to organ damage if not properly managed.
3. Meningitis: The patient is at risk of complications associated with meningitis, such as increased intracranial pressure and septic shock.
4. Encephalitis: The patient may develop complications related to encephalitis, including seizures, altered mental status, and respiratory failure.
5. Stroke: If the patient has a stroke, complications such as paralysis, speech difficulties, and cognitive impairments may arise.
6. Substance abuse withdrawal: The patient may experience severe withdrawal symptoms from alcohol or other substances, which can include seizures, hallucinations, and delirium tremens.
7. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): If not managed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and a recent admission for septic right knee. She presents with confusion and altered mental status, with unclear etiology. Possible causes include alcohol withdrawal, primary neurologic disorders, or infection. Other systemic causes have been ruled out.

The patient has been on fluconazole for a fungal knee infection, which is being managed by the infectious disease service. The knee was evaluated by orthopedics and infectious disease, and staples were removed yesterday. The wound is healing well, but further plans for tapping the knee need to be clarified.

The patient's diabetes is managed with insulin, and she presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) but has since resolved with insulin and IV fluids. Her hypertension is being managed with lisinopril, metoprolol, and hydrochlorothiazide.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, gentamicin, acyclovir, and fluconazole for empiric coverage of meningitis pending negative culture results. Blood, urine, and mycolytic cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of a fungal knee infection and is currently on fluconazole. There is a need for further evaluation and management of the knee infection, including potential tapping.
2. Meningitis: The patient is receiving empiric treatment for meningitis"

   diabetes on insulin, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and
   recent admission for septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**]
   parapsilosis who presents from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal, although she does not have a
   history of delirium tremens.  Other potential etiologies include
   primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT
   (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus infection.  Many systemic
   causes now ruled out including liver, lung, renal disorders, thyroid,
   electrolyte abnormalities.  Diabetic ketoacidosis has now resolved.
   All cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures.
   HSV PCR pending from CSF.   Echocardiogram negative for vegetation.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal
   - MRI/MRA of brain pending
   - EEG performed yesterday, no results yet
   - Neurologic consult
   - Vancomycin, gentamycin, acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage
   of meningitis pending culture results
   - follow up blood, urine, mycolytic cultures
   Diabetic Ketoacidosis:  Resolved with insulin drip and IVF.  Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.
   - continue home lantus with humalog sliding scale
   - replete electrolytes
   Hypertension: Blood presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - hydralazine 10 mg IV Q6H for now
   - will restart home medications this morning (lisinopril, metoprolol,
   hydrochlorothiazide)
   - ativan for CIWA scale
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Unclear if
   her presentation now is consistent with DKA.
   - holding oral agents
   -  continue home insulin regimen of lantus and humalog sliding scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and an unusual native knee infection. The patient is currently on various medications including fluconazole, gentamicin, acyclovir, and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 94 bpm and high blood pressure ranging from 192/80 to 204/141 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is normal at 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 95%. The patient's neurological assessment reveals altered mental status, but specific findings are not documented. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of diabetes and is currently receiving insulin therapy. However, there is no clear indication of hyperglycemia or ketonuria in the progress note. Further evaluation is needed to confirm if DKA is present.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings are elevated, indicating hypertension. This could be a pre-existing condition or a result of the patient's current medical situation.
3. Alcohol withdrawal: There is no specific information provided in the progress note regarding alcohol consumption or withdrawal symptoms. However, the patient's altered mental status could potentially be related to alcohol withdrawal.
4. Infection: The patient has an unusual native knee"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 47 year old female with a history of type II
   diabetes on insulin, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and
   recent admission for septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**]
   parapsilosis who presents from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status: Unclear etiology.  Differential diagnosis
   includes primary neurologic disorders versus systemic etiologies
   including liver, kidney, pulmonary disease versus medication/toxin
   induced.  Given history of significant alcohol and benzodiazepine use,
   withdrawal is also concerning (valium prescription recently ran out and
   last drink was approximately 24 hours ago).  Initial read of CT scan
   concerning for multiple brain lesions which raises the concern for CNS
   infection either primary or embolic.  In patient with recent candidal
   septic joint, disseminted candidal infection is possible although this
   would be extremely unusual in an immunocompetent host.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending
   - Narcan, thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10
   - Repeat VBG
   - Obtain second read of head CT
   - Neurologic consult
   - Vancomycin, gentamycin, acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage
   of meningitis pending culture results
   - MRI w/ gadolinium when stable (will need sedation and also will need
   to discuss with orthopedics whether staples can be removed or are MRI
   compatible)
   - consider EEG if no improvement
   - Fungal blood cultures
   - HSV PCR from spinal fluid
   - CSF cultures for bacteria, fungus, viral pathogens
   - ID consult in AM
   - Echocardiogram to assess for vegitation
   Elevated Anion Gap: UA positive for ketones.  Osmolar gap is 10 which
   is not suggestive of toxic ingestion.  Lactate is not elevated.
   Toxicology screen negative with exception of benzodiazepines.  Renal
   function within normal limits.  Given positive urine ketones most
   likely etiology is starvation ketosis versus alcoholic ketosis versus
   diabetic ketoacidosis.  DKA is unusual in patients with type II
   diabetes but the details of her diagnosis at age 25 are unknown and she
   missed her insulin dosing today.
   - will check serum acetone
   - insulin drip with normal saline until finger stick < 200 then switch
   to D51/2 NS for hydration
   - finger sticks q 1 hour while on drip
   - q4 electrolytes until anion gap has normalized
   - will transition over to home insulin dosing once anion gap has closed
   Hypertension: Blood presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to withdrawal.
   - hydralazine 10 mg IV Q6H for now
   - will hold home lisinopril and HCTZ and metoprolol now as patient is
   NPO
   - ativan for CIWA scale
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Unclear if
   her presentation now is consistent with DKA.
   - holding oral agents
   - insulin drip as above
   - will restart home insulin regimen when anion gap has closed
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.
   - continue fluconazole
   - ID consult in AM
   - orthopedics consult in AM to evaluate wound
   FEN: NS @ 200 cc/hr switching to D51/2 NS when BS < 200, Q4H
   electrolytes for now, NPO

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee. She presents from home with one day of confusion. 

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status with unclear etiology. The differential diagnosis includes primary neurologic disorders versus systemic etiologies such as liver, kidney, pulmonary disease versus medication/toxin-induced. Given her significant alcohol and benzodiazepine use, withdrawal is also concerning. 

The initial read of the CT scan is concerning for multiple brain lesions, which raises the concern for CNS infection either primary or embolic. An initial plan includes LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, along with other tests and treatments for potential meningitis and other infections.

The patient also has elevated blood pressure and an elevated anion gap, likely due to starvation ketosis versus alcoholic ketosis versus diabetic ketoacidosis. Insulin therapy is being initiated to manage the elevated blood glucose levels.

Other conditions mentioned include a fungal knee infection for which she has been on fluconazole, and she is being followed by the infectious disease service. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the altered mental status if the underlying cause is not identified and treated promptly. There is also a risk of further complications related to the elevated blood pressure and the possibility of a hypertensive crisis. Additionally, if the patient's condition deteriorates, there may be a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female admitted with altered mental status in the setting of recent fungal septic arthritis, likely DKA, and possible EtOH withdrawal. She has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and a previous septic knee. She is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, gentamicin, acyclovir, fluconazole, metoprolol, HCTZ, lisinopril, MVI, folate, thiamine, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Central Nervous System (CNS) Infection: The patient's altered mental status could be due to a CNS infection. Broad empiric coverage is being provided with vancomycin, gentamicin, and acyclovir. Further diagnostic tests like an MRI/A brain and EEG are pending.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient may have DKA, which is being managed with insulin therapy. Close monitoring of glycemic control is essential.
3. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient may also be experiencing EtOH withdrawal, for which she is being treated with a CIWA protocol and benzodiazepines as needed.
4. Fungal Septic Arthritis: The patient has a history of fungal septic arthritis, and she is currently on fluconazole treatment. Regular monitoring of her knee incision is necessary to watch for any signs of infection or complications.
5. Endocarditis:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female admitted with altered mental status in the setting of recent fungal septic arthritis and likely diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) +/- EtOH withdrawal. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.5 C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 166/78 mmHg to 204/137 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and other supportive treatments. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging studies reveal multiple hypodensities in the parietal lobe, and an echocardiogram shows no vegetations. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. CNS infection: The patient's altered mental status needs to be closely monitored, and further investigations such as an MRI of the brain and EEG should be done to rule out any central nervous system infections.

2. DKA: The patient's blood glucose levels are significantly elevated, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. Close monitoring of blood sugar levels and continued insulin therapy are necessary to prevent further complications related to DKA.

3. EtOH withdrawal: The patient's symptoms of mental status change and potential EtOH withdrawal need to be managed with appropriate benzodiazepine therapy according to the CI"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for a septic right knee. She presents from home with one day of confusion and altered mental status. She has been on fluconazole for a fungal knee infection and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show high blood pressure, and her lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and normal kidney function. She has been diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, and a fungal knee infection. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Seizure: The patient has been on seizure precautions due to the MRI findings suggestive of PRES (Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) and the possibility of seizures.
2. Stroke: The MRI findings also raise concern for possible ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of septic knee infection and is still on antibiotics. There is a possibility of developing new infections or resistant organisms.
4. Kidney dysfunction: Although her current kidney function is normal, the use of certain medications (e.g., gentamicin) and the presence of comorbidities may increase the risk of kidney dysfunction.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated, which needs to be managed appropriately to prevent complications such as heart attack or stroke.
6. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although"

   Imaging:
   MRI Head [**2190-7-7**]: Limited study secondary to motion.  T2 and FLAIR axial
   images obtained.  Sag T1 extremely degraded.  There is diffuse white
   matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensity involving the bilateral
   parietal/occipital lobes as well as frontal lobes.  Temporal lobes,
   cerebellum and [**Doctor Last Name 988**] matter including the basal ganglia are relatively
   spared.  Finding is non-specific, with broad differential including
   PRES (esp given additional clinical history of hypertension on admit
   with systolics > 220), toxic/metabolic, seizure, and infections
   etiologies.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal, although she does not have a
   history of delirium tremens.  Other potential etiologies include
   primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT
   (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus infection.  MRI yesterday was
   extremely limited study but showed diffuse T2 hyperintensities with
   broad differential including infection, PRES, seizure, toxins.  All
   cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures.  HSV
   PCR pending from CSF.  Transthoracic echocardiogram negative for
   vegetation.  Plan to intubate patient this AM to obtain repeat MRI and
   TEE.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal
   - EEG performed [**7-5**], no results yet
   - f/u Neurologic recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - Vancomycin, gentamycin, acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage
   of meningitis pending MRI and HSV PCR
   - follow up blood, urine, mycolytic cultures
   - TTE  negative, plan for TEE today
   - repeat MRI today
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 12.  Electrolytes stable.  Blood sugars elevated this morning after
   receiving only half dose lantus.
   - holding oral agents
   - will give remainder of home dose lantus this morning.  Will need
   increased doses of lantus this evening after tube feeds are restarted
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. No improvement in blood pressures despite
   home antihypertensive regimen yesterday.  Given differential diagnosis
   of findings on head CT/MRI goal is for autoregulation but to keep
   pressures below 200.
   - hydralazine 5-10 mg IV Q4H:PRN for SBP > 200
   - continue home meds lisinopril, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide
   - ativan for CIWA scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole; clarify course
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - deferring tap for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and a recent admission for a septic right knee. She presents from home with one day of confusion. Her vital signs show hypertension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient's blood cultures have been negative to date, including mycolytic cultures. An MRI yesterday showed diffuse T2 hyperintensities with a broad differential including infection, PRES, seizure, and toxins. She has been on fluconazole for a fungal knee infection, which was confirmed by cultures from 2190-6-16. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), lorazepam (Ativan), hydralazine, and gentamicin. The plan is to intubate the patient to obtain a repeat MRI and TEE. She will also have an LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending, and electrolytes will be monitored daily. The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed, including diabetes, hypertension, and a fungal knee infection."

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee. She presents from home with one day of confusion. She has altered mental status with unclear etiology, possibly related to alcohol withdrawal or primary neurologic disorders. MRI showed diffuse T2 hyperintensities with broad differential including infection, PRES, seizure, toxins. All cultures are negative to date, including CSF and mycolytic cultures. HSV PCR is pending from CSF. The patient is currently intubated for repeat MRI and TEE.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to her medical history and recent septic right knee infection. There is a risk of developing additional infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and findings on the MRI suggest the possibility of neurological complications like PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome), seizures, or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures are grossly elevated on presentation, which can lead to complications such as stroke or cardiac issues.
4. Diabetes complications: The patient has type II diabetes and is insulin-dependent. Poor glycemic control can result in complications like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS).

   MRI Head [**2190-7-7**]: Limited study secondary to motion.  T2 and FLAIR axial
   images obtained.  Sag T1 extremely degraded.  There is diffuse white
   matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensity involving the bilateral
   parietal/occipital lobes as well as frontal lobes.  Temporal lobes,
   cerebellum and [**Doctor Last Name 988**] matter including the basal ganglia are relatively
   spared.  Finding is non-specific, with broad differential including
   PRES (esp given additional clinical history of hypertension on admit
   with systolics > 220), toxic/metabolic, seizure, and infections
   etiologies.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal, although she does not have a
   history of delirium tremens.  Other potential etiologies include
   primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT
   (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus infection.  MRI yesterday was
   extremely limited study but showed diffuse T2 hyperintensities with
   broad differential including PRES, infection, seizure, toxins.  All
   cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures.  HSV
   PCR pending from CSF.  Transthoracic echocardiogram negative for
   vegetation.  Plan to intubate patient this AM to obtain repeat MRI and
   TEE.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal
   - EEG performed [**7-5**], no results yet
   - f/u Neurologic recs
   - f/u ID recs
   -d/c vancomycin, gentamycin today
   - cont acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage of meningitis
   pending MRI and HSV PCR
   - follow up blood, urine, mycolytic cultures
   - TTE negative, plan for TEE today
   - repeat MRI today under sedation
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 12.  Electrolytes stable.  Blood sugars elevated this morning after
   receiving only half dose lantus.
   - holding oral agents
   - will give remainder of home dose lantus this morning.  Will need
   increased doses of lantus this evening after tube feeds are restarted
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. No improvement in blood pressures despite
   home antihypertensive regimen yesterday.  Given differential diagnosis
   of findings on head CT/MRI goal is for autoregulation but to keep
   pressures below 200.
   - hydralazine 5-10 mg IV Q4H:PRN for SBP > 200
   - continue home meds lisinopril, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide
   - ativan for CIWA scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole; clarify course
   - will be getting TEE; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - deferring tap for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee. She presents from home with one day of confusion. The altered mental status continues to have an unclear etiology. Other potential etiologies include primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus infection. MRI yesterday showed diffuse T2 hyperintensities with a broad differential including PRES, infection, seizure, toxins. All cultures are negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures. HSV PCR is pending from CSF. Transthoracic echocardiogram is negative for vegetation. The plan is to intubate the patient this morning to obtain a repeat MRI and TEE.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to her medical history and current condition, making her more susceptible to infections.
2. Neurological issues: The patient's altered mental status and the findings on the MRI suggest the possibility of PRES (Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome), seizure, or toxic/metabolic etiologies. These conditions can lead to further neurological complications.
3. Hypertension: The patient has grossly elevated blood pressures, which may contribute to additional complications if not managed properly.
4. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes management requires close monitoring of blood sugars and electrolyte levels.
5. Fungal knee infection: The patient has an existing fungal knee infection, which needs to be addressed and treated appropriately."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female admitted with altered mental status in the setting of recent fungal septic arthritis, likely diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) +/- ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal. The patient is currently being treated for DKA and EtOH withdrawal. An MRI from yesterday showed diffuse white matter changes but was of poor quality. It is planned to perform elective intubation today for a repeat MRI to better assess the situation.

The patient is on vancomycin, gentamicin, and acyclovir for empiric central nervous system (CNS) coverage. The plan is to discontinue vancomycin and gentamicin today due to negative culture data. The patient has a history of fungal septic arthritis and is currently on fluconazole for six weeks. There is a fluctuant area on the right lateral aspect of the knee, which is being monitored clinically. Orthopedics and infectious disease specialists will be involved in discussing the possibility of aspirating fluid collection. An ophthalmologic evaluation will also be needed if not already done. Additionally, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be necessary to assess for vegetations given the Candida knee infection. At some point, an HIV test will also be required.

The patient is being managed for EtOH withdrawal using the CIWA protocol with prn benzodiazepine. DKA management involves closing the gap, maintaining stable control on home regimen"

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee. She presents from home with one day of confusion. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), arthritis (septic joint infection), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypertension, alcohol withdrawal, and a fungal knee infection.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.1 C (98.8 F)
- Heart rate: 75 bpm (with normal range of 63-111 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 180/72 mmHg (with a range of 101-208/67-108 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 13-25 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on supplemental oxygen

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

Laboratory results show:

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee. She presents from home with one day of confusion. The patient has multiple medical complications including diabetes mellitus type II, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), septic arthritis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypertension, alcohol withdrawal, and a fungal knee infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of type II diabetes and was likely presenting with DKA. This condition is now resolved with insulin therapy.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is grossly elevated on presentation, which may be related to alcohol withdrawal or benzodiazepine withdrawal. There is concern that this may be a new onset of hypertension.
3. Septic arthritis: The patient had a septic right knee infection, which was treated with fluconazole.
4. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): The patient shows signs of PRES, which is characterized by neurological symptoms and imaging findings. It is important to manage blood pressure and address the underlying cause.
5. Fungal knee infection: The patient has a fungal infection in her knee, which requires ongoing management with antifungal medication.
6. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient may be experiencing alcohol withdrawal, and benzodiazepines are being used for symptomatic"

The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected septic arthritis. He was intubated to receive MRI, PICC and TEE. The TEE was performed without evidence of vegetation. MRI results are pending. The patient is seen by neurology who feel that findings on previous MRI scan most consistent with PRES, recommending tighter control of blood pressure. Antibiotics were discontinued.

The patient has allergies to Percocet, Nausea/Vomiting, Cefazolin, Hives; itching, Vicodin, Nausea/Vomiting, Oxycodone, Nausea/Vomiting, and Acyclovir. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2190-7-6**] at 03:57 PM.

The patient is currently receiving various ICU medications including Famotidine, Propofol, Hydralazine, and Heparin Sodium. Other medications include changes to medical and family history.

   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal, although she does not have a
   history of delirium tremens.  Other potential etiologies include
   primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT
   (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus infection.  MRI yesterday was
   extremely limited study but showed diffuse T2 hyperintensities with
   broad differential including PRES, infection, seizure, toxins.  All
   cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures.  HSV
   PCR pending from CSF.  Transthoracic echocardiogram negative for
   vegetation.  Plan to intubate patient this AM to obtain repeat MRI and
   TEE.
   - LP without clear signs of infection, culture pending, HSV PCR pending
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamin
   - Ativan 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 for alcohol withdrawal
   - EEG performed [**7-5**], no results yet
   - f/u Neurologic recs

   - cont acyclovir, fluconazole for empiric coverage of meningitis
   pending MRI and HSV PCR
   - follow up blood, urine, mycolytic cultures
   - TTE negative, plan for TEE today
   - repeat MRI today under sedation
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 12.  Electrolytes stable.  Blood sugars elevated this morning after
   receiving only half dose lantus.
   - holding oral agents
   - will give remainder of home dose lantus this morning.  Will need
   increased doses of lantus this evening after tube feeds are restarted
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood presusres grossly elevated on presentation. Concern
   given new onset tachycardiac that this may be related to alcohol versus
   benzodiazepine withdrawal. No improvement in blood pressures despite
   home antihypertensive regimen yesterday.  Given differential diagnosis
   of findings on head CT/MRI goal is for autoregulation but to keep
   pressures below 200.
   - hydralazine 5-10 mg IV Q4H:PRN for SBP > 200
   - continue home meds lisinopril, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide
   - ativan for CIWA scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both

","The patient is a 47-year-old female admitted with altered mental status in the setting of recent fungal septic arthritis as well as DKA +/- EtOH withdrawal. The MRI brain suggests PRES (Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome). The patient is being treated for DKA and EtOH withdrawal. Repeat imaging is pending to confirm the diagnosis. 

The patient has a history of fungal septic arthritis and is currently on fluconazole for treatment. There is a fluctuant area on the right lateral aspect of the knee, which is being monitored clinically. The patient will need an orthopedic and infectious disease evaluation to discuss aspiration of the fluid collection.

The patient also has hypertension, which is being managed with beta-blockers, HCTZ, and lisinopril. Tighter blood pressure control is necessary due to the possibility of PRES.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 450 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 81.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent 37.3°C (99.1°F), HR 80 bpm, BP 179/68 mmHg, RR 27 breaths per minute, SpO2 100%. The patient is sedated and not fully responsive.

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 13.1 K/uL, Hct of 33.6%, Plt of 362 K/uL, Cr of 1.0 mg/dL, Glucose of 194 mg/dL, PT/PTT/INR of 12.9/22.5/1.1, Lactic Acid of 0.9 mmol/L, Ca++ of 8.6 mg/dL, Mg++ of 2.4 mg/dL, and PO4 of 4.2 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's imaging studies include a pending MRI brain, a TEE that was negative for vegetations, and a CXR showing a PICC line in place with clear lung fields.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening of PRES, development of septic arthritis in other joints, recurrence of DKA, complications from EtOH withdrawal, and potential for infection due to prolonged intubation.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional clinical details may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal with a component of PRES. Repeat
   MRI most consistent with PRES.  All cultures negative to date including
   CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR.  TTE and TEE without
   vegetation.  Mental status slowly improving.
   - d/c acyclovir as HSV PCR negative
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - will add labetolol for BP control today
   - will change to valium Q6H CIWA today in anticipation of floor
   transfer
   - consider call out to floor this evening if blood pressures stable
   Fevers:  Spiked a fever to 101 last night.  Most likely etiology is
   urinary tract infection as patient had foley catheter and positive UA.
   She has a history of ESBL so she was started on meropenem. Blood
   cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - meropenem day [**2-6**] for urinary tract infection pending cultures
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Lantus increased to 25 yesterday with
   increase in her sliding scale.
   - holding oral agents
   - continue lantus with regular insulin sliding scale
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension.  Per her husband
   her baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.
   - hydralazine 20 IV Q6H
   - will add labetolol 400 mg TID and will titrate up today
   - discontinue metoprolol
   - lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - continue hydrochlorothiazide

   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole, plan for 6+ weeks of therapy to be readdressed
   by ID as outpatient
   - TEE negative; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee. The patient presents from home with one day of confusion.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient continues to have unclear etiology, with most likely sources being alcohol withdrawal and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Repeat MRI is most consistent with PRES. All cultures negative to date, including CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR. Mental status slowly improving.

2. Fevers: The patient spiked a fever to 101 last night, likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). Foley catheter and positive urine analysis suggest UTI as the likely cause. The patient has a history of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli in her urine, so she was started on meropenem. Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending.

3. Diabetes: The patient is insulin-dependent for type II diabetes. She presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) but now it is resolved with insulin drip and intravenous fluids (IVF). Anion gap is now 13, and electrolytes are stable. Lantus dosage was increased to 25 units yesterday with an increase in her sliding scale. Oral agents are being held, and regular insulin sliding scale will continue with daily monitoring of"

   potential etiologies include primary neurologic disorders related to
   the findings on head CT (multiple areas of hypodensities) versus
   infection.  MRI [**2190-7-6**] extremely limited but showed diffuse T2
   hyperintensities with broad differential including PRES, infection,

   mycolytic cultures.  HSV PCR pending from CSF.  EEG without seizure
   activity.  Transthoracic echocardiogram negative for vegetation.  She
   was intubated [**2190-7-7**] and received TEE which was without vegitation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee. She presents from home with one day of confusion. The patient has altered mental status with unclear etiology, possibly due to alcohol withdrawal or Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). Other potential causes include primary neurologic disorders, infection, or seizure. MRI results showed diffuse T2 hyperintensities with a broad differential diagnosis. All cultures are negative to date, including CSF and mycolytic cultures. HSV PCR is pending from CSF. The patient was intubated and received transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which was negative for vegetation. Repeat MRI was also performed, results pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient continues to have unclear etiology for her altered mental status. The most likely source is alcohol withdrawal with a component of PRES. Other potential etiologies include primary neurologic disorders related to the findings on head CT or infection.
2. Septic Joint Infection: The patient had a recent admission for septic right knee. She has a fungal knee infection caused by Candida parapsilosis, for which she is being treated with fluconazole. She is followed by our infectious disease service.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is grossly elevated on presentation. There is concern that this"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and alcohol withdrawal, admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status. The patient underwent MRI, which revealed Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). The patient's recent blood cultures, urine culture, and urinalysis showed positive results for ESBL E. Coli, leading to the initiation of Meropenem therapy. The patient's vital signs indicate persistent hypertension, fever, and tachycardia. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, supple neck, and warm, well-perfused extremities. The patient's laboratory values show elevated WBC count and blood glucose levels. The patient's Foley catheter is draining cloudy yellow urine. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's recent blood cultures, urine culture, and urinalysis indicate a possible infection caused by ESBL E. Coli. This may lead to sepsis and septicemia if not properly managed.
2. Hypertension: The patient's persistent hypertension needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or cardiac issues.
3. PRES: The patient's MRI findings suggest PRES, a condition associated with neurological symptoms due to hypertension"

 pending
   Imaging:
   MRI Brain:  Extensive white matter abnormalities involving the
   posterior distribution as well as extending to involve the frontal and
   parietal lobes in a watershed distribution. Given the conciliation of
   these findings, these are again most concerning for posterior
   reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Again differential considerations
   include a toxic or metabolic process.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Likely
   initially in setting of alcohol withdrawal, now past time course. MRI
   suggestive of component of PRES.  All cultures negative to date
   including CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR.  TTE and TEE without
   vegetation.  [**Month (only) 11**] have component from pain. Mental status slowly
   improving.
   - empiric abx for meningitis discontinued
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - will change metoprolol to labetolol for BP control today
   - d/c valium
   - lidoderm patch
   Fevers:  Spiked a fever to 101 last night. Currently treating fungal
   knee infection. [**Month (only) 11**] have aspiration pneumonia in setting of AMS. UTI
   also possible given foley catheter and positive UA.  She has a history
   of ESBL so she was started on meropenem. Blood cultures and urine
   cultures pending.
   - CXR today
   - Add vancomycin for gram positive coverage
   - Cont meropenem day [**2-6**] for urinary tract infection pending cultures
   - Cont fluconazole
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole, plan for 6+ weeks of therapy to be readdressed
   by ID as outpatient
   - TEE negative; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - deferring tap for now
   - lidoderm patch for right knee
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension without improvement
   overnight despite uptitration of antihypertensives. Per her husband her
   baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.
   - hydralazine 20 IV Q6H
   - will change metoprolol to labetolol 400 mg TID and will titrate up
   prn today
   - lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - continue hydrochlorothiazide
   - PO valium for CIWA scale
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Lantus increased to 25 yesterday with
   increase in her sliding scale.
   - holding oral agents
   - continue lantus with regular insulin sliding scale
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee. She presents from home with one day of confusion. The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, extensive white matter abnormalities on MRI suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and a fungal knee infection. She also has a history of ESBL E. coli in the urine and is currently being treated with meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a fungal knee infection and is currently being treated with fluconazole. Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending, indicating the possibility of a systemic infection. The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures are grossly elevated on presentation, likely from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension. Aggressive management of blood pressure is recommended to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.

3. Diabetes: The patient is type II diabetic and insulin-dependent. Her recent presentation with DKA has resolved with an insulin drip and IV fluids. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and electrolytes is necessary to manage her diabetes effectively.

4. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and MRI findings are suggestive of PRES. This condition can lead to seizures and other neurological complications. Monitoring for seizures and ensuring proper control of blood pressure are crucial in managing this"

   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal with a component of PRES. Repeat
   MRI most consistent with PRES.  All cultures negative to date including
   CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR.  TTE and TEE without
   vegetation.  Mental status slowly improving.
   - d/c acyclovir as HSV PCR negative
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - will add labetolol for BP control today
   - will change to valium Q6H CIWA today in anticipation of floor
   transfer
   - consider call out to floor this evening if blood pressures stable
   Fevers:  Spiked a fever to 101 last night.  Most likely etiology is
   urinary tract infection as patient had foley catheter and positive UA.
   She has a history of ESBL so she was started on meropenem. Blood
   cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - meropenem day [**2-6**] for urinary tract infection pending cultures
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Lantus increased to 25 yesterday with
   increase in her sliding scale.
   - holding oral agents
   - continue lantus with regular insulin sliding scale
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension.  Per her husband
   her baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.
   - hydralazine 20 IV Q6H
   - will add labetolol 400 mg TID and will titrate up today
   - discontinue metoprolol
   - lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - continue hydrochlorothiazide
   - PO valium for CIWA scale

   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole, plan for 6+ weeks of therapy to be readdressed
   by ID as outpatient
   - TEE negative; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - deferring tap for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee. She presents from home with one day of confusion. The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, possibly due to alcohol withdrawal with a component of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). She also has diabetes mellitus type II, septic arthritis, urinary tract infection (UTI), hypertension, and alcohol withdrawal. 

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is unclear, with a possible etiology of alcohol withdrawal and PRES. The repeat MRI is most consistent with PRES. All cultures are negative to date, including CSF and mycolytic cultures, and HSV PCR. Mental status is slowly improving.
2. Fevers: The patient had a fever spike to 101 last night, likely due to a urinary tract infection. Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending. She has a history of ESBL (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) so she was started on meropenem.
3. Diabetes: The patient has type II diabetes and presented with DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) now resolved with insulin drip and IV fluids. Anion gap is now 13, and electrolytes are stable. Lantus was increased to 25 yesterday with an increase in her sliding scale.
4. Hypertension: The patient had grossly elevated"

- The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to altered mental status and respiratory distress.
- The patient developed a fever of 101.7°F and tachycardia in the evening, indicating a possible infection. Cultures were obtained from blood, urine, and pan cultures.
- The patient had a history of ESBL E. coli in their urine, so they were started on meropenem, which is an appropriate antibiotic choice for this type of infection.
- The patient's blood pressure remained elevated despite medication adjustments, and they were started on hydralazine to control their blood pressure.
- The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), septic arthritis, urinary tract infection, hypertension, and alcohol withdrawal.
- The patient's current medications include scheduled hydralazine, increased metoprolol to 50 mg Q6, fluconazole, famotidine, heparin sodium, and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.
- The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Blood cultures, urinalysis, and other lab tests are pending.
- The patient's physical examination revealed no abnormalities in peripheral vascular assessment, skin, and"

 pending
   Imaging:
   MRI Brain:  Extensive white matter abnormalities involving the
   posterior distribution as well as extending to involve the frontal and
   parietal lobes in a watershed distribution. Given the conciliation of
   these findings, these are again most concerning for posterior
   reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Again differential considerations
   include a toxic or metabolic process.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Most
   likely source is alcohol withdrawal with a component of PRES. Repeat
   MRI most consistent with PRES.  All cultures negative to date including
   CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR.  TTE and TEE without
   vegetation.  Mental status slowly improving.
   - d/c acyclovir as HSV PCR negative
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - will change metoprolol to labetolol for BP control today
   - will change to valium Q6H CIWA today in anticipation of floor
   transfer
   - consider call out to floor this evening if blood pressures stable
   Fevers:  Spiked a fever to 101 last night.  Most likely etiology is
   urinary tract infection as patient had foley catheter and positive UA.
   She has a history of ESBL so she was started on meropenem. Blood
   cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - meropenem day [**2-6**] for urinary tract infection pending cultures
   - CXR today
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Lantus increased to 25 yesterday with
   increase in her sliding scale.
   - holding oral agents
   - continue lantus with regular insulin sliding scale
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension without improvement
   overnight despite uptitration of antihypertensives. Per her husband her
   baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.
   - hydralazine 20 IV Q6H
   - will change metoprolol to labetolol 400 mg TID and will titrate up
   prn today
   - lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - continue hydrochlorothiazide
   - PO valium for CIWA scale
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole, plan for 6+ weeks of therapy to be readdressed
   by ID as outpatient
   - TEE negative; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - deferring tap for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, recent fungal septic arthritis, DKA, and suspected EtOH withdrawal. The patient has been treated for DKA and EtOH withdrawal, and MRI suggests PRES (Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome). The patient is febrile overnight with new right basilar infiltrate, raising suspicion of aspiration versus nosocomial pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.7°F, blood pressure ranging from 182/83 to 206/114 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging shows a pending chest X-ray and previous MRI brain consistent with PRES. Microbiology cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's new right basilar infiltrate raises suspicion of aspiration pneumonia, which can be a serious complication in critically ill patients.
2. Nosocomial pneumonia: Another possibility is nosocomial pneumonia, which is a hospital-acquired infection. This can occur due to various factors, including the patient's compromised immune system.
3. Seizures: Given the presence of altered mental status and MRI findings suggestive of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female who was admitted with altered mental status. She has a history of recent fungal septic arthritis and diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA), as well as possible ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal. An MRI of the brain suggests posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). The patient developed a fever overnight and has a new right basilar infiltrate on chest X-ray, which could indicate aspiration pneumonia or nosocomial pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.7°C, blood pressure ranging from 182/83 to 206/114 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's weight is 75.6 kg and height is 66 inches.

The patient has been started on meropenem for a dirty urinary analysis and prior extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production from urine. Blood cultures are pending. The patient's allergies include Percocet (oral), cefazolin, and Vicodin (oral). The patient has received antibiotics such as gentamicin, vancomycin, acyclovir, and fluconazole. She is also receiving other medications including heparin sodium, famotidine, hydralazine, thiamine, folate, MVI, fluconazole"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Continues to have unclear etiology.  Likely
   initially in setting of alcohol withdrawal, now past time course. MRI
   suggestive of component of PRES.  All cultures negative to date
   including CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR.  TTE and TEE without
   vegetation.  [**Month (only) 11**] have component from pain. Mental status slowly
   improving.
   - empiric abx for meningitis discontinued
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - will change metoprolol to labetolol for BP control today
   - d/c valium
   - lidoderm patch
   Fevers:  Spiked a fever to 101 last night. Currently treating fungal
   knee infection. [**Month (only) 11**] have aspiration pneumonia in setting of AMS. UTI
   also possible given foley catheter and positive UA.  She has a history
   of ESBL so she was started on meropenem. Blood cultures and urine
   cultures pending.
   - CXR today
   - Add vancomycin for gram positive coverage
   - Cont meropenem day [**2-6**] for urinary tract infection pending cultures
   - Cont fluconazole
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole, plan for 6+ weeks of therapy to be readdressed
   by ID as outpatient
   - TEE negative; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - deferring tap for now
   - lidoderm patch for right knee
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   initially rom alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension without
   improvement overnight despite uptitration of antihypertensives. Per her
   husband her baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.
   - hydralazine 20 IV Q6H
   - will change metoprolol to labetolol 400 mg TID and will titrate up
   prn today

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C, and recent admission for septic right knee. She presents from home with one day of confusion. The patient is currently in the ICU for altered mental status with unclear etiology, initially suspected to be related to alcohol withdrawal but now beyond the expected time course. An MRI suggests a component of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). All cultures are negative to date, including CSF and mycolytic cultures, as well as HSV PCR. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) without vegetation. The patient has been aggressively managing her blood pressure, aiming for pressures at her baseline of 150-160 mmHg. 

The patient has a fungal knee infection, for which she is being treated with fluconazole. Cultures from [date] grew [organism], and she has been on fluconazole therapy. The knee has been evaluated by both orthopedics and infectious disease. 

The patient's hypertension is not improving despite uptitration of antihypertensives, likely initially related to alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension. Her baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s. 

The patient's diabetes is managed with insulin, and she is likely presented with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) now resolved with an insulin drip and IV fluids. 

The patient's nutrition is being managed with Boost Gl"

   Microbiology:
   Blood and urine cultures from [**2190-7-8**]
 no growth to date
   Imaging:
   As compared to the previous radiograph, a PICC line has been
   inserted over the right upper extremity. The PICC line terminates in
   the
   superior vena cava and could be advanced by 3-4 cm. In the interval,
   the
   patient has been extubated. The nasogastric tube, however, is in
   unchanged
   position. There is no evidence of interval recurrence of focal
   parenchymal
   opacity suggestive of pneumonia. No pleural effusions. Normal size of
   the
   cardiac silhouette without evidence of overhydration.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Likely initially in setting of alcohol
   withdrawal, now past time course. MRI suggestive of component of PRES.
   All cultures negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures and
   HSV PCR.  TTE and TEE without vegetation.  [**Month (only) 11**] have component from
   pain. Mental status slowly improving.
   - empiric abx for meningitis discontinued
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - continue labetolol 400 mg TID, hydralazine 30 mg PO Q6H,
   hydrochlorothiazie 25 mg daily and lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - lidoderm patch for pain
   Fevers:  Spiked a fever to 101 last night. Currently treating fungal
   knee infection. [**Month (only) 11**] have aspiration pneumonia in setting of AMS
   although CXR yesterday looked clear.  UA trace positive but culture
   negative to date.  Currently on vancomycin and meropenem given history
   of ESBL in her urine.
   - continue vancomycin and meropenem pending culture date
   - follow blood, urine and sputum samples
   - Cont fluconazole
   - will need to readdress joint aspiration
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole, plan for 6+ weeks of therapy to be readdressed
   by ID as outpatient
   - TEE negative; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - will discuss joint aspiration with orthopedics, likely will defer
   given improved appearance of wound
   - lidoderm patch for right knee
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   initially from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension. Per her
   husband her baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.  Now
   improved to close to target with PO hydralazine, labetolol,
   hydrochlorithiazide and lisinopril
   - continue hydralazine 30 mg PO Q6H, labetolol 400 mg TID,
   hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily and lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - will titrate up labetolol today as tolerated today
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Blood sugars persistently in the 300s
   overnight.

   Microbiology:
   Blood and urine cultures from [**2190-7-8**]
 no growth to date
   Imaging: CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, a PICC line has
   been inserted over the right upper extremity. The PICC line terminates
   in the superior vena cava and could be advanced by 3-4 cm. In the
   interval, the patient has been extubated. The nasogastric tube,
   however, is in unchanged position. There is no evidence of interval
   recurrence of focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia. No
   pleural effusions. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette without
   evidence of overhydration.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female with a history of type II diabetes on insulin,
   peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C and recent admission for
   septic right knee on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) 444**] parapsilosis who presents
   from home with one day of confusion.
   Altered Mental Status:  Now improved, likely due to resolution of
   alcohol withdrawal and improved management of PRES.  All cultures
   negative to date including CSF and mycolytic cultures and HSV PCR.  TTE
   and TEE without vegetation.  [**Month (only) 11**] have component from pain. Mental
   status slowly improving.
   - empiric abx for meningitis discontinued
   - cultures from admission negative to date
   - aggressively manage blood pressure with target pressures at her
   baseline of 150-160
   - continue labetolol 400 mg TID, hydralazine 30 mg PO Q6H,
   hydrochlorothiazie 25 mg daily and lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - lidoderm patch for pain
   Fevers:  Fever curve improved. Currently treating fungal knee
   infection. No new positive micro to date.
   - d/c abx
   - Cont fluconazole
   - follow blood, urine and sputum samples
   - will need to readdress joint aspiration; pending ID and Ortho
   discussion
   Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from [**2190-6-16**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 444**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7123**] for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is followed
   here by our infectious disease service.  Knee evaluated by both
   orthopedics and infectious disease.
   - continue fluconazole, plan for 6+ weeks of therapy to be readdressed
   by ID as outpatient
   - TEE negative; will need ophtho consult and HIV testing as well
   - orthopedics removed staples feel wound healing well
   - will discuss joint aspiration with orthopedics and ID
   - lidoderm patch for right knee
   Hypertension: Blood pressures grossly elevated on presentation likely
   initially from alcohol withdrawal and essential hypertension. Per her
   husband her baseline blood pressures range in the 150s-160s.  Now
   improved to close to target with PO hydralazine, labetolol,
   hydrochlorithiazide and lisinopril
   - continue hydralazine 30 mg PO Q6H, labetolol 400 mg TID,
   hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily and lisinopril 40 mg daily
   - will titrate up labetolol today as tolerated today
   Diabetes:  Per notes she is type II but insulin dependent.  Likely
   presented with DKA now resolved with insulin drip and IVF. Anion gap
   now 13.  Electrolytes stable.  Blood sugars persistently in the 300s
   overnight.
   - holding oral agents
   - increase lantus to 30 U daily with regular insulin sliding scale
   - monitor lytes daily and replete prn

   -tighter BP control for poss PRES, see below
   -dc'd acyclovir for neg HSV PCR
   HTN: Rx with beta blocker, HCTZ and lisinopril, scheduled hydralazine
   -titrate up for tighter control given poss PRES as above
   Fungal septic arthritis- on fluconazole x at least 6wks total
   (currently approx 3 wks in)
   -has fluctuant area on R lateral aspect of knee which we are following
   clinically at this point, slightly improved today
   -Id svce has wanted R knee fluctuance tapped, which Ortho team has not
   wanted to do so. Have asked ID team to discuss w/ Ortho team directly
   -will need eventual Ophthal eval if hasnt had one.
   -TEE without vegetations
   -will need HIV at some point

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female admitted with altered mental status in the setting of recent fungal septic arthritis and DKA +/- EtOH withdrawal. The patient has been treated for DKA and EtOH withdrawal, and MRI brain suggests PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome). The patient also has possible aspiration vs nosocomial pneumonia, as she was febrile on [**7-8**] night but with negative cultures. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), current temperature of 35.9 C (96.7 F), heart rate of 77 bpm (77-102 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 164/69 mmHg to 185/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (20-32 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count ranging from 9.1 to 13.1 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level ranging from 30.4% to 33.9 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 288 to 343 thousand/mm3, creatinine level ranging from 0.9 to 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose level ranging from 104 to 325 mg/dL, and other lab values including PT/PTT/INR, lactic acid, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

Imaging studies reveal a chest X-ray without clear infiltrate on [**7-9**]. Microbiology tests show blood and urine negative to date. The assessment and plan include treating for DKA and EtOH withdrawal, managing possible aspiration vs nosocomial pneumonia, treating altered mental status, managing fungal septic arthritis, and monitoring blood pressure for tighter control given possible PRES.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include worsening of PRES, development of nosocomial pneumonia, worsening of DKA, and worsening of EtOH withdrawal symptoms. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical symptoms will be crucial in preventing and managing these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo female admitted with altered mental status in the setting of
   recent fungal septic arthritis as well as DKA +/- EtOH withdrawal. MRI
   brain suggests PRES.
   Possible aspiration vs nosocomial pneumonia- febrile on [**7-8**] night but
   w/ neg cultures
   -CXR yest without infiltrates despite R basilar crackles; afebrile w/
   broadened ABX (vanco + meropenem in addition to fluconazole below)
   -per ID will stop vanco + meropenem
   Altered mental status- treated for DKA and EtOH withdrawal. MRI
   suggests PRES
   -EEG without seizure activity
   -DKA and EtOH mgmt as below
   -tighter BP control for poss PRES, see below
   -dc'd acyclovir for neg HSV PCR
   HTN: Rx with beta blocker, HCTZ and lisinopril, scheduled hydralazine
   -titrate up for tighter control given poss PRES as above
   Fungal septic arthritis- on fluconazole x at least 6wks total
   (currently approx 3 wks in)
   -has fluctuant area on R lateral aspect of knee which we are following
   clinically at this point, slightly improved today
   -Id svce has wanted R knee fluctuance tapped, which Ortho team has not
   wanted to do so. Have asked ID team to discuss w/ Ortho team directly
   -will need eventual Ophthal eval if hasnt had one.
   -TEE without vegetations
   -will need HIV at some point
   DKA- gap closed, stable control on home regimen + RISS. still holding
   glyburide
   Rest of plan as per housestaff note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female admitted with altered mental status, recent fungal septic arthritis, and suspected diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and/or ethanol withdrawal. MRI brain suggests posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Possible aspiration versus nosocomial pneumonia is also a concern, with the patient being febrile on the previous night but with negative cultures. Chest X-ray (CXR) yesterday did not show infiltrates despite right basal crackles. The patient has been treated for DKA and EtOH withdrawal, with MRI suggesting PRES. An electroencephalogram (EEG) did not show seizure activity. The patient has a history of hypertension, for which she is being treated with beta-blockers, HCTZ, and lisinopril, and scheduled hydralazine. The patient is currently on fluconazole for fungal septic arthritis, which she will continue for at least 6 weeks. There is a fluctuant area on the right lateral aspect of her knee, which is being monitored clinically. The infectious disease service wants to tap the knee, but the orthopedic team has not agreed to this. The patient will need an ophthalmologic evaluation if she hasn't had one yet. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) did not show vegetations, and the patient will need an HIV test at some point. The patient's DKA is under control on her home regimen plus RISS,"
