","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of pancreatic cancer obstructing the common bile duct, who presented with abdominal pain and fever. She was found to have cholecystitis and is not a surgical candidate. She is currently in the ICU for close monitoring, resuscitation, antibiotics, and coordination of interventional radiology-guided drain placement. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and normal oxygen saturation. She has been receiving intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and is being closely monitored for urine output. Her laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. She also has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and low blood pressure suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory support with a nasal cannula and abnormal arterial blood gas values indicate potential respiratory failure.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen suggest acute kidney injury, which may worsen if not managed appropriately.
4. Liver Dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and alkaline phosphatase suggest possible liver dysfunction.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, including low potassium and magnesium, need to be monitored and managed to avoid complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with pancreatic cancer obstructing the common bile duct, who presented with abdominal pain and fever. She was diagnosed with cholecystitis and admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring, resuscitation, antibiotics, and coordination of interventional radiology-guided drain placement. The patient is not a surgical candidate and has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status. She underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy and continues to receive zosyn and IV fluids. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated respiratory rate. She has mild renal failure and diabetes mellitus. The patient's large right heel ulcer does not appear infected. Her laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and mild hyperchloremia/low bicarbonate levels. The patient's access for central venous line and arterial line is pending urine output improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/SIRS: The patient's hemodynamics are concerning for sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to her fever and elevated white blood cell count. Proper management of infection and fluid resuscitation is crucial to prevent further complications.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests potential acute kidney injury, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with pancreatic cancer who presented with abdominal pain and fever. She was found to have cholecystitis and is not a surgical candidate. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring, resuscitation, antibiotics, and coordination of interventional radiology-guided drain placement. She has been started on percutaneous cholecystostomy, and her vital signs are being closely monitored. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, acute kidney injury, and glaucoma. She is currently on DNR/DNI status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This may be due to sepsis and fluid resuscitation may be limited by aortic stenosis.
2. Cholecystitis: The patient has been diagnosed with cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as gallbladder rupture or abscess formation.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's recent history of hypotension may have contributed to acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly is necessary.
4. Infection: The patient has an ongoing infection indicated by fever and elevated white blood cell count. Prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics is essential to prevent further complications.
5. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's liver"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with pancreatic cancer obstructing the common bile duct, who recently underwent stent placement. She presented with abdominal pain and fever, leading to the diagnosis of cholecystitis. Due to her DNR/DNI status, she was sent to the ICU for close monitoring, resuscitation, antibiotics, and coordination of interventional radiology-guided drain placement.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which responded to fluid resuscitation with normal saline. This could be related to sepsis secondary to cholecystitis.

2. Cholecystitis: The patient developed cholecystitis, likely due to the obstruction of the common bile duct by pancreatic cancer. She underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy as a noninvasive intervention.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient had an elevated creatinine level of 2.0, which improved to 1.7 overnight. This could be related to hypotension and sepsis.

4. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient had a heart rate of 107 bpm, likely due to underlying hypotension and SIRS/sepsis. IV fluids and treatment for infection were recommended.

5. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient's glucose level was high at 193 mg/dL, possibly due to fasting or stress. Insulin therapy was not"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of pancreatic cancer and common bile duct obstruction post stent placement. She presented with abdominal pain and fever, indicating cholecystitis. Overnight, she received intravenous fluids (IVFs), antibiotics, and percutaneous drainage. Initially hypotensive, her condition improved, and she was taken off vasopressors but remains mildly low blood pressure. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, pulse rate of 109 beats per minute, blood pressure of 95/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is awake, alert, and oriented to time, place, and person. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, and soft abdomen with bowel sounds present but tenderness in the right upper quadrant with guarding. There is no peripheral edema noted. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, but decreased hematocrit and albumin levels. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotics, monitoring in the ICU until blood pressure and heart rate normalize, and close monitoring of perfusion endpoints such as urine output, vitals, and lactate levels. The patient is critically ill."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an elderly individual with a history of pancreatic cancer and cholecystitis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure to place a stent and is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of their condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a fever and is experiencing abdominal pain, which could indicate an infection. With the presence of cholecystitis and possible bile duct obstruction due to pancreatic cancer, there is a risk of developing sepsis if the infection spreads.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's initial creatinine level was elevated at 1.7, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. The patient received fluid resuscitation, which improved the creatinine level to 1.4. However, ongoing monitoring is necessary to ensure that the kidneys continue to function properly.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings show low values, indicating hypotension. This could be due to the underlying infection, fluid resuscitation, or other factors. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are required to maintain stable blood pressure levels.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although no evidence of DVT was found in the lower extremities based on the LENI scan, there is still a risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobility and the presence of cancer. Prophylactic measures such as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with pancreatic cancer who presented with abdominal pain and fever. She was found to have cholecystitis, likely due to a bile duct obstruction caused by her pancreatic cancer. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and had a stent placed in the common bile duct. She is currently in the ICU for close monitoring, resuscitation, and treatment of infection. She is not a surgical candidate and has consented to noninvasive interventions. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased oxygen saturation. She has a history of diabetes, acute kidney injury, and atrial fibrillation. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes. Imaging studies show no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but pending results for kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) imaging. The patient's pain is being managed with Percocet, and she is receiving antibiotics, IV fluids, and other supportive care measures. She has a documented do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and hypotension suggest an ongoing infection, which could progress to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, which may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of cholecystitis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on a DNR/DNI status. The patient has undergone a cholecystostomy tube placement and sepsis has been resolved. He is still experiencing some abdominal pain and has had episodes of atrial ectopy. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 130/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. He is receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, furosemide (Lasix), and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and glucose levels. His electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's neurological assessment is not fully complete as he is not assessed for movement, tone, or orientation. The patient's pain is being managed, and he is being monitored closely for any complications related to his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrence if the source of infection is not completely eradicated.
2. Cholecystitis: The patient's acute cholecystitis may lead to complications such as gall"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with pancreatic cancer, who presented with abdominal pain and fever. He was found to have cholecystitis and underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy. His blood pressure has been stable, and his other vital signs are within normal range. The patient is alert and awake, with no evidence of edema in his extremities. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Cholecystitis: The patient had cholecystitis but is now post-cholecystostomy tube.
2. Atrial ectopy: The patient has stable atrial ectopy, and beta-blockers should be avoided if he is asymptomatic.
3. FEN: ADAT - The plan for the patient's feeding needs to be determined.
4. ICU Care: The patient's nutrition and glycemic control are well-managed. He is receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.
5. VAP: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions are being taken.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of sepsis, which has been resolved, but there is still a risk of infection due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay.
2. Bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin for DVT prophylaxis, which increases the risk of bleeding.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute"
