   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Progress reviewed extensively
   during family meeting.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI) x2, and stage IV heart failure admitted for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. He has an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% and is currently in the critical care unit (CCU) for hypotension.

The patient's arterial line was placed at 05:30 PM and removed at 06:55 PM, then re-started at 07:00 PM. He is on neomycin and milrinone infusions. A Lasix bolus was given, followed by a continuous infusion at 5 mg/hr, which was decreased to 2.5 mg/hr overnight. The patient experienced a brief run of ventricular tachycardia (VT), and his potassium level was checked, showing 3.2 mEq/L, after which ectopy decreased. The patient has been choking and coughing with any oral intake.

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including acute on chronic systolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypotension, hypoxia, and anemia. The patient is also on various medications, including milrinone, phenylephrine, Lasix, metolazone, acetazolamide, aspirin, statin, Plavix, clopidogrel, warfarin, amiodarone, and levothyroxine.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, further episodes of VT, hypotension, respiratory distress, kidney injury, infection, bleeding, and electrolyte imbalances.

Further assessment and monitoring of the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, renal function, electrolytes, and respiratory status are necessary. Adjustments to the medication regimen may be required based on the patient's response and any changes in his condition. Close monitoring for signs of deterioration or new complications is crucial."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a history of CABG, MI x2, and stage IV heart failure admitted for CHF exacerbation. He was transferred to the CCU for hypotension. The patient has acute on chronic systolic heart failure with an LVEF of 15-20%. He is volume overloaded with elevated JVP and crackles. Diuresis on the floor was limited by hypotension, so he was started on milrinone in the CCU with low-dose phenylephrine for pressure support.

The patient has a history of CAD with patent LIMA and SMG grafts, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and hypotension. His current medications include aspirin, statin, Plavix, clopidogrel, amiodarone, and metoprolol (held due to hypotension). The patient also has seasonal allergies, hypothyroidism, GERD, diabetes, depressed mood, and bowel incontinence.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent 35.9°C (96.7°F), HR 85 bpm, BP 106/53 mmHg, RR 13 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 96%. His recent labs show a WBC of 9.3, Hct of 29.3, Plt of 121, Cr of 2.2, and Glucose of 185 mg/dL. The patient's imaging shows worsening right basilar opacities, indicating increased atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's low LVEF and symptoms of volume overload suggest that he may be at risk for further exacerbation of his heart failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate poor cardiac output or a response to diuretic therapy. This could lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ dysfunction.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases his risk for thromboembolic events, such as stroke or peripheral embolism. Monitoring his INR and anticoagulation therapy is crucial to prevent these complications.

4. Respiratory compromise: The patient's worsening atelectasis and minimal O2 requirement suggest that he may be at risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and providing adequate oxygenation support is necessary.

5. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's history of stage II CKD and rising creatinine levels indicate potential worsening renal function. Monitoring his renal function and adjusting diuretic dosages accordingly is important to avoid fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.

6. Anemia: The patient's significantly decreased hemoglobin level indicates the need for further evaluation and management of his anemia. Iron supplementation and addressing any underlying causes are important to improve"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI) x2, stage IV heart failure admitted for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is reported to be 15-20%. The patient's reported dry weight was 197 lbs., and he was noted to be overweight at 204lbs. on examination. 

The patient is currently experiencing acute on chronic systolic heart failure, as indicated by his elevated JVP (jugular venous pressure), crackles in the lungs, and volume overload. Diuretics have been initiated on the floor but were limited by hypotension. The patient has also been started on milrinone in the CCU with low-dose phenylephrine for pressure support. 

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with a creatinine level that has trended up but is currently stable at 2.1. 

Other medical conditions and their management include:
- Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, with patent left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and saphenous vein grafts (SVG) placed during a previous surgery. There is low concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) at this time. The patient is being continued on aspirin, stat"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI) x2, and stage IV heart failure admitted for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation.
- The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 15-20%.
- He has been in the ICU due to hypotension and is currently comfortable with no complaints.
- The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,734 mL.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 87/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.
- The patient has been weaned off phenylephrine and is currently on milrinone and lasix drips.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium (K+), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and glucose.
- The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia.
- The patient's electrolytes and kidney function need close monitoring.
- The patient has multiple medical conditions, including chronic systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, chronic kidney disease, anemia, and metabolic alkalosis.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and there is no escalation of care. The defibrillator has been turned off.
- The patient's disposition is planned to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility or hospice.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications:
- The patient has a history of CABG and MI, indicating a compromised cardiovascular system.
- The patient's LVEF is very low at 15-20%, indicating severe systolic dysfunction.
- The patient's current condition of acute on chronic systolic heart failure puts him at risk for further cardiac complications such as ventricular arrhythmias, heart block, or cardiac arrest.
- The patient's hypotension needs to be closely monitored, as it can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.

2. Renal Complications:
- The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function.
- The patient's negative fluid balance indicates diuresis, which can further compromise renal function.
- Close monitoring of renal function and adjusting diuretic doses accordingly are necessary to prevent renal complications such as acute kidney injury or exacerbation of chronic kidney disease.

3. Respiratory Complications:
- The patient's respiratory rate is slightly low, indicating respiratory depression or inadequate ventilation.
- The patient's oxygen saturation is within normal limits, but close monitoring is still required.
- The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) puts him at risk for respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory compromise.

4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
- The patient's history of GERD and bowel incontinence increases his risk for gastrointestinal complications.
- The patient's use of diuretics may lead to dehydration and constipation, increasing the risk of gastrointestinal complications.
- Monitoring the patient's bowel movements and adjusting the medication regimen accordingly is important to prevent gastrointestinal complications.

5. Hematological Complications:
- The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia.
- The patient's iron studies suggest iron deficiency anemia, which requires supplementation.
- Close monitoring of the patient's hematological status is necessary to prevent worsening anemia or development of other hematological complications.

6. Infection Risk:
- The patient's prolonged hospital stay and use of indwelling lines increase the risk of healthcare-associated infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
- Proper infection control measures should be followed to minimize the risk of infections.

7. Psychological Complications:
- The patient's depressed mood and flat affect indicate a potential psychological complication.
- The patient's wife has been involved in the care decisions, but the patient's psychological well-being should be closely monitored.
- A consult for a psychiatrist or social worker may be beneficial to address the patient's psychological needs.

8. Palliative Care Considerations:
- The patient has chosen a palliative care approach with no escalation of care.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the defibrillator has been turned off.
- Open communication regarding the patient's wishes and goals of care should be maintained, involving the patient, family, and healthcare team.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current condition present a range of potential complications that require close monitoring and management."

","The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI) twice, stage IV heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypotension.

The patient's reported dry weight was 197 lbs., but he was noted to be 204 lbs. in the chart. On examination, he presented with volume overload, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), crackles, and systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border (RUSB). His vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 92/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.7 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 28.6%, platelet count (Plt) of 143 K/uL, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 109 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 3.2 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) of 130 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 83 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3) of 38 mEq/L, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.4 mg/dL, calcium (Ca++) of 9.3 mg/dL, phosphate (PO4) of 3.7 mg/dL, and INR of 3.6.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15-20%. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which he is on warfarin. Additionally, he has seasonal allergies, hypothyroidism, GERD, diabetes, depressed mood, and bowel incontinence.

The patient's plan includes continuing Torsemide 60mg PO BID, metolazone, and acetazolamide. He is also on aspirin, statin, and Plavix. His blood pressure goal is set at 50-55 mmHg, and he should have an intake/output goal of -1L. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he has agreed to no escalation of care. He is expected to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility today."

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI) x2, and stage IV heart failure. He was admitted for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) due to hypotension.

2. The patient has acute on chronic systolic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15-20%. He was reported to have a dry weight of 197 lbs but was noted to be 204lbs on admission. Physical examination revealed volume overload with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and crackles in the lungs. Diuresis on the floor was limited by hypotension. In the CCU, the patient was started on milrinone and had phenylephrine weaned off.

3. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with patent left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and saphenous vein grafts placed during CABG surgery in [**6-1**]. There is low concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) at this time. The patient is currently on aspirin, statin, and clopidogrel, and metoprolol is held due to hypotension.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI) x2, stage IV heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and hypotension. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 15-20%, indicating severe systolic dysfunction.

The patient was initially volume overloaded with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and crackles in the lungs. He underwent diuresis with milrinone and lasix, and is now approaching euvolemia. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 102/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was cardioverted on 1/11. He is currently on amiodarone 400 mg/day for rate control. Other medications include torsemide 40 mg PO BID, metolazone 2.5 mg QOD (which has been discontinued), aldactone 25 mg daily, and aspirin/plavix for coronary artery disease (CAD).

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 9.3-10.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, platelet count of 121-150 K/uL, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 67-229 mg/dL, and potassium levels ranging from 3.6-4.5 mEq/L. His calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has a history of severe systolic dysfunction with an LVEF of 15-20%. He presented with volume overload but is now approaching euvolemia after diuresis. He will continue with torsemide and aldactone for fluid management.

2. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of CABG and MI x2. He has patent left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and saphenous vein grafts. He will continue on aspirin and plavix for CAD prophylaxis, but his beta-blocker and statin have been discontinued due to end-of-life care.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was cardioverted on 1/11. He is currently on amiodarone for rate control. His warfarin has been discontinued for end-of-life care.

4. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension has resolved."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of delirium/confusion and impaired skin integrity. They have a history of chronic heart failure (CHF) and are currently receiving various medications including torsemide, metoprolol, ACE inhibitor, digoxin, atorvastatin, and warfarin. 

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated body temperature (36.8°C) and a low blood pressure range (102/50-111/75 mmHg). Their respiratory rate is within normal limits (17 breaths per minute), and their oxygen saturation is at 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is being paced with an artificial heart rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,360 mL (405 mL in the last 24 hours) and an output of 2,100 mL (725 mL in the last 24 hours), resulting in a negative fluid balance of 740 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 9.3 to 10.8 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 29.3% to 35.7%, slightly decreased platelet count (Plt) ranging from 121 to 162 K/uL, and fluctuating creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 1.7 to 2.2 mg/dL.

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI) x2, and stage IV heart failure admitted for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15-20% and is currently in acute on chronic systolic heart failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/50 mmHg to 111/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar rales without wheezing or rales, a systolic murmur heard best at right upper sternal border, soft abdomen with no tenderness, normal bowel sounds, no lower extremity edema, and positive distal pulses.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, platelet count of 150 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 67 mg/dL to 255 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, sodium level of 135 mEq/L, chloride level of 87 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 35.7%, and magnesium level of 2.5 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), seasonal allergies, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes, depressed mood, and bowel incontinence.

The patient's plan includes continuing medications such as torsemide, metolazone, amiodarone, ASA, Plavix, ranitidine, levothyroxine, and glargine. The patient will also continue with diuresis and oxygen therapy to maintain saturation in the 90s. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the disposition is likely discharge to rehabilitation today.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's current condition indicates acute on chronic systolic heart failure, and there is a risk of further exacerbation leading to worsening heart failure symptoms.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently within the lower range, and it may continue to be a concern, requiring careful monitoring and adjustment of medications as needed.

3. Respiratory infections: The patient's history of COPD and the use of a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery increase the risk of respiratory infections, including pneumonia.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk for DVT due to immobility and heart failure. Prophylaxis with warfarin is being given, but close monitoring is necessary.

5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.7 mg/dL, indicating potential renal dysfunction. This may require adjustment of medications and further evaluation.

6. Anemia: The patient has iron deficiency anemia, which needs to be addressed to prevent complications associated with anemia, such as fatigue and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

7. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient appears to have chronic metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to contraction alkalosis from aggressive diuresis. This should be monitored and managed appropriately.

8. Bowel incontinence: The patient has bowel incontinence, which can be managed by holding the bowel regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI) x2, stage IV heart failure, admitted for congestive heart failure exacerbation (EF 20%). The patient has been transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for hypotension. He is currently euvolemic after diuresis and is on milrinone and lasix infusions. The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) with creatinine levels trending up but currently improved to 1.7. Other medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, seasonal allergies, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes, depressed mood, and bowel incontinence. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI) with no escalation of care and defibrillator shut off.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's low ejection fraction (EF 20%) indicates severe systolic dysfunction, which may lead to further exacerbations of heart failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension can recur, especially if fluid balance is not maintained properly.
3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's CKD may worsen due to ongoing fluid overload or renal insults from medications.
4. Atrial fibrillation:"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI) x2, and stage IV heart failure admitted for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation.
- The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 15-20%.
- He was admitted with volume overload, which has now been addressed through diuresis and the use of medications such as milrinone and lasix.
- The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but he has a history of hypotension.
- He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on warfarin for anticoagulation.
- The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and his creatinine level has improved to 1.7.
- He is also experiencing anemia, which is likely due to iron deficiency.
- The patient has a history of seasonal allergies, hypothyroidism, GERD, diabetes, and depressed mood.
- He is currently on a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids and is being monitored for various prophylactic measures, including DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
- The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) code status and is expected to be discharged to rehabilitation today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), myocardial infarction (MI) x2, stage IV heart failure, admitted for congestive heart failure exacerbation (EF 20%) and transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for hypotension. The patient's reported dry weight was 197 lbs. On examination, he had volume overload with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and crackles. He is now approaching euvolemia after diuresis with milrinone and lasix. The patient's potassium levels remain high, requiring ongoing potassium repletion. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), anemia, seasonal allergies, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes, depressed mood, and bowel incontinence. The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code status and has been discussed with the patient and his wife.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's low ejection fraction (LVEF 15-20%) indicates a compromised cardiac function, which can lead to further exacerbations of heart failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of dyspnea and orthopnea. The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Upon admission, the patient was started on metolazone, which was later discontinued and replaced with aldactone 25 due to ongoing potassium repletion requirements. The patient's evening dose of torsemide was held due to a negative incontinent episode exceeding 500cc.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 36.7°C to 36°C, heart rate between 80-86 bpm, blood pressure fluctuating between 91/56 mmHg and 99/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is on AV paced rhythm support.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1455mL and a total output of 2235mL, resulting in a negative balance of 780mL. The patient's weight is currently 83.3 kg, down from 91.6 kg at admission.

The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen with an ABG showing pH of 7.33. Physical examination findings are not available for peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic assessments.

Laboratory results show potassium levels ranging from 3.7"
