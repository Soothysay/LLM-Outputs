","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU after undergoing an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak. The patient became hypoxic during the procedure and required intubation. Anesthesia bronchoscopy revealed aspiration into the right middle lobe, leading to pneumonia. The patient has also been diagnosed with gallstone pancreatitis and cholecystitis, which were previously treated with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and ERCP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Infection and sepsis secondary to pneumonia and cholecystitis.
3. Organ dysfunction or failure, such as acute kidney injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Complications related to mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.
5. Further episodes of hypoxia or respiratory distress.
6. Persistent bile leak from the disrupted bile duct.
7. Development of a liver abscess or cholangitis due to ongoing infection and inflammation.
8. Pancreatitis-related complications, such as pseudocyst formation or pancreatic fistula."

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU after undergoing an ERCP for a bile duct leak. He became significantly hypoxic and required intubation. An aspiration event occurred during the procedure, and anesthesia bronchoscopy revealed a large amount of bilious fluid in the right middle lobe. The patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation overnight with good oxygen saturation levels.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumonia due to aspiration, and cholecystitis with calculi. He has a JP drain that is putting out bilious fluid. The plan is to continue with sedation as tolerated, trial weaning of pressure support, and monitoring for fever curve and leukocytosis. Blood cultures have been ordered, along with checking liver function tests, amylase, and lipase levels. Consultation with surgery has been requested.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.9°C (102.1°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 104/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Other lab values appear within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, further deterioration of liver function, worsening cholecystitis, and potential seps"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who underwent an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak. He became hypoxic and required intubation. An anesthesia bronchoscopy revealed the presence of bilious fluid in the right middle lobe, indicating an aspiration event. The patient is currently sedated and on invasive ventilation in the ICU. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia due to aspiration, as well as cholecystitis. He had previously undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole) and ERCP for a bile duct leak. The patient is producing bilious fluid from a Jackson-Pratt (JP) drain and has an ongoing bile leak.

Potential Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which necessitated intubation. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to pneumonia caused by aspiration.

2. Bile Leak: The patient has a persistent bile leak, which could lead to ongoing infection and complications related to the biliary system.

3. Cholecystitis: The patient has been diagnosed with cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. This condition can progress to more severe complications such as gallbladder gangrene or perforation.

4. Infection: Given the presence of pneumonia and cholecystitis, the patient is at risk of developing systemic infections. Blood cultures have been ordered to identify any potential pathogens.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing aspiration during an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak. The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient became significantly hypoxic and required intubation for ERCP. He had an aspiration event, leading to the need for an anesthesia bronchoscopy to clear bilious fluid from the right middle lobe.

2. Gallstone pancreatitis and cholecystitis: The patient had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and ERCP for a bile duct leak. A joint drain is putting out bilious fluid, indicating ongoing pancreatic inflammation and potential bile leakage.

3. Fever: The patient developed a fever overnight, which could be attributed to aspiration pneumonia or intra-abdominal processes such as bile leak or cholecystitis. Blood, urine, and abdominal cultures are pending.

4. Abdominal pain and fluid leakage: The patient has ongoing bilious fluid drainage from the OGT, suggesting ongoing abdominal issues.

5. Respiratory support: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with plans to wean sedation and potentially extubate if tolerated.

6. Depression: The patient has a history of depression, which may impact his recovery and mental well-being during the ICU stay.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Respiratory failure due to prolonged intub"

   contributing eti
   # Hypoxic resp failure: Intubated for ERCP [**1-8**] after becoming
   significantly hypoxic.  Had an aspiration event, and anesthesia
   bronchoscopy showed large amount of bilious fluid in right middle
   lobe.  Patient was maintained on the ventilator on AC overnight with
   good O2 saturations. This am, gas on PS [**9-5**] was 7.43/46/124.
   - trial to wean PS today
   - wean fent/versed sedation as tol
   - cont vanco/ zosyn/flagyl for now to cover GI and aspiration
   - check sputum culture once has sputum
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - frequent suctioning
   # Gallstone pancreatitis ? cholecystitis s/p lap chole and ERCP for
   bile duct leak.  currently JP drain putting out bilious fluid; good
   amount of bilious fluid from OGT
   - f/u ERCP recs
   - NPO for now; can consider clears in AM if extubated
   - cont flagyl/zosyn. can consider stopping flagyl since zosyn covers
   anaerobes as well but will discuss with surgeon
   - monitor fever curve and leukocytosis
   - check blood cultures; check LFTs; check amylase and lipase
   -consult surgery today. Perhaps Muller
s team to make them aware.
   # Fever- fever overnight ?etiology- aspiration PNA vs intraabd process-
   bile leak, s/p cholecystitis. Urine abd blood cx pending

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing aspiration during an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak. The patient has undergone several interventions and is currently on multiple medications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.1°F (Tmax: 38.9°C), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/55 mmHg to 86/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient's condition deteriorated overnight, with the development of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient was bolused with three liters and received a right internal jugular catheter. Blood cultures, urine analysis, and abdominal X-rays were ordered to investigate potential sepsis or bleeding. An emergent abdominal CT scan showed significant pancreatitis but no evidence of abdominal bleeding. Surgery felt that conservative management should be pursued.

The patient received transfusions of two units of blood due to a low hematocrit level. A chest X-ray revealed bibasilar consolidation versus atelectasis and pleural effusions"

   53 year-old male with a history of depression who is transferred to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] s/p aspiration after being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct
   leak.
   # Shock:  Patient was hypotensive overnight on [**2109-1-9**] likely secondary
   to combination of intravascular hypovolemia in the setting of
   pancreatitis and third-spacing, blood loss (?hemorrhagic pancreatitis
   components though no blood clearly visualized on abdominal CT, and
   possibly sepsis.
   - aggressive IVF resuscitation with LR
   - management of pancreatitis, ?sepsis as described below
   - CVP goal of 12
   - CVO2 goal of >70%
   - Will transfuse for Hct < 26
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl
   - consider coverage of VRE or fungus if patient decompensates
   # Gallstone pancreatitis: ?cholecystitis s/p lap chole and ERCP for
   bile duct leak with JP drain in place and draining bilious fluid.
   Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal CT on [**2109-1-9**].
   - aggressive IVF resuscitation with LR
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl though likely will not affect course of
   pancreatitis
   - f/u surgery reccs; anticipate conservative management for now
   - f/u ERCP reccs
   - continue to trend amylase/lipase
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Intubated for ERCP [**1-8**] after
   becoming significantly hypoxic.  Had an aspiration event, and
   anesthesia bronchoscopy showed large amount of bilious fluid in right
   middle lobe.  Will treat for presumed ARDS though patient does not
   strictly meet criteria.
   - low tidal volumes, higher respiratory rate to meet minute ventilation
   needs
   - check ABG

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing aspiration during an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak. The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions that require careful management.

1. Shock: The patient was hypotensive overnight on [**2109-1-9**] likely due to a combination of intravascular hypovolemia in the setting of pancreatitis and third-spacing, blood loss (though no blood was clearly visualized on abdominal CT), and possibly sepsis. The patient received aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, management of pancreatitis and possible sepsis, and goals for central venous pressure (CVP) and cerebral oxygenation (CVO2) were set. The patient will be transfused if hematocrit (Hct) is below 26.

2. Gallstone pancreatitis: The patient may have cholecystitis following a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole) and ERCP for bile duct leak with a percutaneous jejunostomy (JP) drain in place, draining bilious fluid. Partially necrotic pancreatitis was visualized on abdominal CT. The patient continues to receive aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, and the medical team anticipates conservative management for now.

3. Hypoxic respiratory failure/Aspiration pneumonia:"

   1. Necrotizing pancreatitis characterized by lack of enhancement of the
   pancreatic head, neck and proximal body with marked peripancreatic
   inflammatory stranding.
   2. No evidence of hematoma in the abdomen or pelvis. The previously
   described abnormality in Morison's pouch likely represented the
   surgical drain in this region.
   3. Multifocal nodular opacities throughout the bilateral lung fields,
   near- complete consolidation of the bilateral lower lobes and small
   bilateral
   pleural effusions. These findings are suspicious for an infectious
   etiology
   and given the bibasilar consolidation, aspiration pneumonia is
   suspected.
   4. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing aspiration during an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak. He has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical history includes gallstone pancreatitis, for which he had undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole) and an ERCP with placement of a Jones (JP) drain due to a bile duct leak. The CT scan revealed necrotizing pancreatitis, with lack of enhancement in the pancreatic head, neck, and proximal body, as well as marked peripancreatic inflammatory stranding. There was no evidence of hematoma in the abdomen or pelvis.

The patient also has hypoxic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. He became significantly hypoxic during the ERCP and required intubation. A bronchoscopy showed a large amount of bilious fluid in the right middle lobe, leading to the diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. The patient is being treated for presumed ARDS, although he does not strictly meet the criteria.

Other findings include colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis and a history of depression. The patient's current vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension, with a low CVP. He has been receiving aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution (LR) due to shock and third-spacing of fluids.

   1. Necrotizing pancreatitis characterized by lack of enhancement of the
   pancreatic head, neck and proximal body with marked peripancreatic
   inflammatory stranding.
   2. No evidence of hematoma in the abdomen or pelvis. The previously
   described abnormality in Morison's pouch likely represented the
   surgical drain in this region.
   3. Multifocal nodular opacities throughout the bilateral lung fields,
   near- complete consolidation of the bilateral lower lobes and small
   bilateral
   pleural effusions. These findings are suspicious for an infectious
   etiology
   and given the bibasilar consolidation, aspiration pneumonia is
   suspected.
   4. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing aspiration during an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak. He has a diagnosis of cholangitis, gallstone pancreatitis, hypoxic respiratory failure/Aspiration pneumonia, and acute pancreatitis. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient was hypotensive overnight on [**2109-1-9**] likely secondary to a combination of intravascular hypovolemia in the setting of pancreatitis and third-spacing, blood loss (hemorrhagic pancreatitis components though no blood clearly visualized on abdominal CT), and possibly sepsis. Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's (LR) is being administered.
2. Infection: The patient has signs of infection, including low-grade fevers and elevated white blood cell count. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has been intubated for ERCP after becoming significantly hypoxic. He may be at risk for developing ARDS due to aspiration pneumonia. Low tidal volumes and higher respiratory rates are being used to meet minute ventilation needs.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis with"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression and recent gallstone pancreatitis. He had a negative ERCP, subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole), and an ERCP for bile leak with stent placement. However, he developed aspiration and hypoxemia, leading to intubation and transfer to the ICU. Currently, the patient is experiencing pancreatitis and respiratory failure. He is receiving aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's (LR) and has been treated with antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole) for suspected sepsis. The patient's CVP and BP are being managed with fluid boluses, aiming for a CVP of 12. The goal is to maintain adequate tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery. The patient's Hct is below 26, and he will be transfused accordingly. There is concern for hemorrhagic pancreatitis, so the Hct is being closely monitored. The patient's gallstone pancreatitis with cholecystitis is also being managed conservatively, with ongoing drainage of bilious fluid through a Jones (JP) drain. Partially necrotic pancreatitis was visualized on an abdominal CT scan. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to aspiration pneumonia, for which he is receiving low tidal volumes and higher respiratory rates. ARDS criteria are not strictly met, but the patient's"

   53 year-old male with a history of depression transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   s/p aspiration after being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct leak.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to combination of hypovolemia from
   third-spacing in setting of pancreatitis and possible hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis.   Hypovolemia manifested first by tachycardia and then by
   hypotension.
   - IVF resuscitation with LR PRN
   - management of pancreatitis, ?sepsis as described below
   - CVP goal of 12, CVO2 goal of >70%
   - Will transfuse for Hct < 26
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl (day 1 = [**1-8**] for all antibiotics)
   - consider coverage of VRE or fungus if patient decompensates (fever
   curve currently trending down and perhaps slightly better)
   # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) with neg
   ERCP ([**12-31**] at [**Hospital1 5**]) s/p lap chole ([**1-5**]) c/b bile leak at OSH, and s/p
   ERCP for stent for leak c/b aspiration.  JP drain in place and draining
   bilious fluid.  Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal
   CT on [**2109-1-9**].
   - aggressive IVF resuscitation with LR
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl though likely will not affect course of
   pancreatitis
   - f/u surgery reccs; anticipate conservative management for now
   - f/u ERCP reccs
   - continue to trend amylase/lipase
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Intubated for ERCP [**1-8**] after
   becoming significantly hypoxic.  Had an aspiration event and anesthesia
   bronchoscopy showed large amount of bilious fluid in right middle lobe;
   growing E. coli in sputum as of [**2109-1-12**].  Will treat for presumed ARDS
   though patient does not strictly meet criteria.
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**] (low tidal
   volumes, higher respiratory rate to meet minute ventilation needs, wean
   peep as tolerated)
   - cont vanco/ zosyn/flagyl for now to cover GI and aspiration
   # FEN:  Continue TPN today but start post-pyloric enteral feedings this
   evening

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU with recent gallstone pancreatitis, negative ERCP, and s/p laparoscopic cholecystectomy with bile leak. The patient also has respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and is currently intubated. The patient's condition has deteriorated, resulting in shock, pancreatitis, and hypoxic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock secondary to hypovolemia from third-spacing in the setting of pancreatitis and possible hemorrhagic pancreatitis. This is indicated by tachycardia and hypotension.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient had gallstone pancreatitis with a negative ERCP and subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy that led to a bile leak. There is a partially necrotic pancreas visualized on abdominal CT.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient became significantly hypoxic and required intubation during an ERCP procedure. Anesthesia bronchoscopy showed a large amount of bilious fluid in the right middle lobe, and there is growing E. coli in the sputum.
4. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): Although the patient does not strictly meet the criteria for ARDS, it is planned to continue the ARDS protocol for protective ventilation.
5. Bile Leak: The patient had a bile leak"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU for an ERCP procedure. The patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole) at OSH due to a bile duct leak and was subsequently sent back to the hospital for an ERCP and stenting. During the ERCP procedure, the patient aspirated and experienced difficulty oxygenating, with bronchoscopy showing the presence of bile in the right main stem.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Tmax: 38.3°C, HR: 110 bpm, BP: 111/61 mmHg, SpO2: 95%
- Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP: 28 mmHg, total in/out fluid balance: +6,817 mL
- Respiratory support: Intubated, ventilator mode: CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, FiO2: 50%, PEEP: 8 cmH2O
- ABG: pH: 7.43, PaCO2: 43 mmHg, HCO3: 122 mEq/L, BE: -4 mEq/L
- Labs: WBC: 11.2 K/uL, Hct: 31.9%, Plt: 210 K/uL, Cr: 0.5 mg/dL, TCO2: 32 mmHg, Glucose: 104 mg/dL
- Imaging: CXR - RIJ slightly high; severe volume overload +/- infiltrates
- Microbiology: Sputum culture [**1-10**] E. coli

Assessment and Plan:
- Shock: Patient continues to have low blood pressure in the setting of continued necrotic pancreatitis.
- Gallstone pancreatitis:?cholecystitis s/p lap chole and ERCP for bile duct leak with JP drain in place and draining bilious fluid.
- Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal CT on [**2109-1-9**].
- Hypoxic respiratory failure/Aspiration pneumonia: Intubated for ERCP [**1-8**] after becoming significantly hypoxic. Had an aspiration event, and anesthesia bronchoscopy showed large amount of bilious fluid in the right middle lobe.
- Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**].
- Continue vanc/zosyn for E. coli aspiration PNA.
- Continue on AC today as has significant secretions and no thoughts to extubate at this time.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has necrotic pancreatitis and an ongoing infection indicated by the presence of E. coli in the sputum culture. This increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Organ failure: The patient's low blood pressure and high CVP suggest possible organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The presence of bilious fluid in the right middle lobe may lead to further respiratory complications.
4. Renal failure: The elevated creatinine level suggests impaired kidney function.
5. Hepatic failure: The elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) indicate possible liver dysfunction.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), indicating a risk of malnutrition.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU for an ERCP procedure due to a bile duct leak. The patient has undergone multiple surgeries, including a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole), and has experienced complications such as bile leak and aspiration. He is now critically ill with severe necrotic pancreatitis, sepsis, and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 111/61 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and slightly elevated potassium levels. Imaging reveals severe volume overload and infiltrates on the chest X-ray. The patient has been diagnosed with E. coli pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock due to sepsis and hemorrhagic pancreatitis. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's blood pressure and heart rate and continue intravenous fluids as needed.

2. Gallstone pancreatitis: The patient has evidence of severe necrosis/hemorrhage on the CT scan, indicating gallstone"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for an ERCP procedure due to a bile duct leak. The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis, which resulted in severe necrosis and hemorrhage. He underwent an ERCP and stenting, but unfortunately aspirated during the procedure. The patient is now experiencing severe necrotic pancreatitis, sepsis, and hypoxic respiratory failure with aspiration pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been started on TPN (total parenteral nutrition) due to feeding difficulties.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated temperature, high heart rate, low blood pressure, and leukocytosis indicate a possible infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's low respiratory rate, low tidal volume, and high plateau pressure suggest inadequate ventilation and oxygenation, putting him at risk for respiratory failure.
3. Organ Dysfunction: The elevated lactate levels and abnormal liver function tests (elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase) indicate potential organ dysfunction, particularly in the liver and kidneys.
4. Aspiration Pneumonia: The presence of E. coli in the sputum culture and the patient's symptoms suggest aspiration pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of secondary infections.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient's increased central venous pressure (CVP) and fluid balance"

   # Shock:  Likely secondary to combination of hypovolemia from
   third-spacing in setting of pancreatitis and possible hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis.   Hypovolemia manifested first by tachycardia and then by
   hypotension.
   - IVF resuscitation with LR PRN
   - management of pancreatitis, ?sepsis as described below
   - CVP goal of 12, CVO2 goal of >70%
   - Will transfuse for Hct < 26
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl (day 1 = [**1-8**] for all antibiotics)
   - consider coverage of VRE or fungus if patient decompensates (fever
   curve currently trending down and perhaps slightly better)
   # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) with neg
   ERCP ([**12-31**] at [**Hospital1 5**]) s/p lap chole ([**1-5**]) c/b bile leak at OSH, and s/p
   ERCP for stent for leak c/b aspiration.  JP drain in place and draining
   bilious fluid.  Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal
   CT on [**2109-1-9**].
   - aggressive IVF resuscitation with LR
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl though likely will not affect course of
   pancreatitis
   - f/u surgery reccs; anticipate conservative management for now
   - f/u ERCP reccs
   - continue to trend amylase/lipase
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Intubated for ERCP [**1-8**] after
   becoming significantly hypoxic.  Had an aspiration event and anesthesia
   bronchoscopy showed large amount of bilious fluid in right middle lobe;
   growing E. coli in sputum as of [**2109-1-12**].  Will treat for presumed ARDS
   though patient does not strictly meet criteria.
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**] (low tidal
   volumes, higher respiratory rate to meet minute ventilation needs, wean
   peep as tolerated)
   - cont vanco/ zosyn/flagyl for now to cover GI and aspiration
   # FEN:  Continue TPN today but start post-pyloric enteral feedings this
   evening

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing aspiration while being intubated for an ERCP procedure. He has a history of gallstone pancreatitis, which led to a bile leak and subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient underwent an ERCP for stent placement but developed aspiration pneumonia due to bilious fluid in the right middle lobe. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and being treated for presumed ARDS. The patient also has cholangitis and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock secondary to hypovolemia from third-spacing in the setting of pancreatitis and possible hemorrhagic pancreatitis. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis with necrotic changes seen on abdominal CT. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy are required to manage the infection and prevent further complications.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient developed aspiration pneumonia due to inhalation of bilious fluid into the lungs. This can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis if not appropriately managed.
4. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient is being treated for presumed ARDS, although he does not strictly meet the criteria. It is important to continue following the ARDS protocol for protective ventilation and monitoring for any signs of progression.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year-old male with a history of depression transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   s/p aspiration after being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct leak.
    # Shock:  Likely secondary to combination of hypovolemia from
   third-spacing in setting of pancreatitis.  Relative hypovolemia
   manifested first by tachycardia and then by hypotension.
   - IVF resuscitation with LR PRN, currently good BP
   - management of pancreatitis, ?sepsis as described below
   - CVP goal of 12, CVO2 goal of >70%
   - Will transfuse for Hct < 26
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl (day 1 = [**1-8**] for all antibiotics)
   - consider coverage of VRE or fungus if patient decompensates (fever
   curve currently trending down and perhaps slightly better)
   # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) with neg
   ERCP ([**12-31**] at [**Hospital1 5**]) s/p lap chole ([**1-5**]) c/b bile leak at OSH, and s/p
   ERCP for stent for leak c/b aspiration.  JP drain in place and draining
   bilious fluid.  Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal
   CT on [**2109-1-9**].
   - aggressive IVF resuscitation with LR if needed for hypotension but
   will try to minimize for overall respiratory status
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl though likely will not affect course of
   pancreatitis
   - f/u surgery reccs; anticipate conservative management for now
   - f/u ERCP reccs
   - continue to trend amylase/lipase
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Intubated for ERCP [**1-8**] after
   becoming significantly hypoxic.  Had an aspiration event and anesthesia
   bronchoscopy showed large amount of bilious fluid in right middle lobe;
   growing E. coli in sputum as of [**2109-1-12**].  Will treat for presumed ARDS
   though patient does not strictly meet criteria.
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**] (low tidal
   volumes, higher respiratory rate to meet minute ventilation needs, wean
   peep as tolerated)
   - cont vanco/ zosyn/flagyl for now to cover GI and aspiration
   -attempt to keep euvolemic today in order to not worsen pulmonary
   edema.
   #Anemia: Basically stable but given concern for hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure (aspiration) after being intubated for an ERCP procedure. He has a past medical history of gallstone pancreatitis and underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with subsequent bile leak at another hospital. The patient also had an ERCP for stent placement but subsequently aspirated during the procedure.

The patient's current condition includes cholangitis, respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, shock (likely secondary to hypovolemia from third-spacing in the setting of pancreatitis), and pancreatitis. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 101.8°F (Tmax: 38.8°C)
- Heart Rate: 107 bpm (with a range of 93-114 bpm)
- Blood Pressure: 107/52 mmHg (with a range of 69-94/45-151 mmHg)
- Respiratory Rate: 27 breaths per minute
- Oxygen Saturation: 94% on supplemental oxygen

The patient's laboratory results indicate:
- White Blood Cell Count: 11.2-13.0 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 9.7-10.5 g/dL
- Sodium: 119-126 mg/dL
- Potassium: 3.6-3.8 mEq/L
- Creatinine: 0.5-0.6 mg/dL
- Glucose: 104-126 mg/dL
- Amylase/Lipase: 111/33 U/L

The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows:
- pH: 7.48
- Partial Pressure of Oxygen (PaO2): 264 mmHg
- Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide (PaCO2): 38 mmHg
- Oxygen Saturation (SaO2): 94%
- HCO3-: 28 mEq/L

The patient's imaging studies reveal a partially necrotic pancreatitis on abdominal CT.

The patient's treatment plan includes:
- Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution (LR) for hypotension and to minimize respiratory status.
- Administration of vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and metronidazole to cover potential infections.
- Conservative management of pancreatitis, with consideration for surgery if necessary.
- Continued monitoring and treatment for presumed ARDS.
- Euvolemic management to avoid pulmonary edema.
- Nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- Glycemic control.
- Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive culture for E. coli in the sputum, there is a risk of developing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is crucial.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's pancreatitis may lead to organ dysfunction, particularly if it progresses to necrotizing pancreatitis or involves other organs like the kidneys or liver.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia puts him at risk for worsening hypoxemia and the potential development of ARDS.
4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's shock state increases the risk of hemodynamic instability, including hypotension and tachycardia. Close monitoring of blood pressure and heart"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe necrotic pancreatitis, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, during which he aspirated and developed hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a protective ventilation strategy. The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and has had multiple surgeries, including an ERCP and cholecystectomy. He is also experiencing volume overload and pulmonary edema. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis due to severe necrotic pancreatitis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect any worsening of infection or organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Continued monitoring of oxygenation parameters and implementation of appropriate ventilator settings are crucial.
3. Volume Overload: The patient has evidence of fluid overload, as indicated by the increased central venous pressure (CVP) and positive fluid balance. Careful monitoring of fluid administration and diuresis should be implemented to prevent further fluid accumulation.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's imaging shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema. Monitoring for worsening respiratory status and optimizing oxygenation and ventilation strategies is essential.
5. Bile Leak: The patient had a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU for aspiration after being intubated for an ERCP procedure. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to infection and hemorrhagic pancreatitis. His blood pressure has stabilized, but he requires continued IV fluid resuscitation as needed and monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP) and heart rate (HR).

2. Gallstone pancreatitis: The patient has evidence of severe necrosis and hemorrhage on a CT scan. This may require further evaluation by an ERCP or surgery.

3. Hypoxic respiratory failure/Aspiration pneumonia: The patient is growing E. coli sensitive to Zosyn in his sputum, indicating a persistent infection. He will continue to receive antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) and mechanical ventilation with an ARDS protocol to protect his airway.

4. Feeding: The patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and is being considered for post-pyloric feeding through a Doephoff tube.

5. Other issues: These are noted in the resident's progress note and include monitoring for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and restraints if necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o with ascending cholangitis tx here for ERCP [**12-31**], no stone found
   so sent back to OSH.  Had lap chole ([**1-5**]) at OSH with resulting bile
   leak - sent back here for ERCP and stenting ([**1-8**]).  During ERCP,
   patient aspirated - difficult time oxygenating - bronch showed bile in
   right main stem.  Now with severe necrotic pacreatitis/sepsis.  On
   vanc/zosyn/flagyl.
   # Shock:  Likely due to sepsis/hemorrhagic pancreatitis.    BP now
   stable.  Persistent fevers likely due to severe pancreatitis, not
   ongoing infectious source
   - Continue IVF (LR) prn
 follow CVP/HR
   - Continue vanc/zosyn and follow up cultures
   - Would add fungal coverage if dramatically worsens.
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Now growing E. coli sensitive
   to Zosyn out of sputum with persistent thick secretions, although main
   cause of resp failure likely volume overload/pulmonary edema.
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**]
 wean FiO2
   as tolerated
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for e.coli aspiration PNA
   - Continue on AC today as has significant secretions and no thoughts to
   extubate at this time.
   - Run TBB even today, but consider diuresis  tomorrow if BP allows.
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CT with evidence of severe
   necrosis/hemorrhage.
   - ERCP/surgery following.
   - T bili increased
 send direct/indirect and follow
   # FEN:
   - Post-pyloric Dophoff with TF (okay by surgery/ERCP).

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ascending cholangitis, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and subsequent bile leak.
- The patient underwent ERCP and stenting but aspirated during the procedure, resulting in severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis.
- The patient is currently on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole for infection.
- Vital signs include persistent fevers, hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased urine output.
- The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels.
- Imaging shows bilateral infiltrates and effusions consistent with volume overload.
- Microbiology reveals E. coli growth in sputum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate septic shock due to severe pancreatitis and potential hemorrhagic pancreatitis.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure/aspiration pneumonia: The patient's difficulty in oxygenating and presence of bile in the right mainstem bronchus during ERCP suggest the possibility of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Gallstone pancreatitis: The patient has evidence of severe necrosis/hemorrhage on CT, indicating gallstone pancreatitis.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's persistent thick secretions and requirement for mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing VAP.
5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's bilateral infiltrates and decreased oxygen saturation may suggest the development of ARDS, possibly due to volume overload or pulmonary edema."

   53 year-old male with a history of depression transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   s/p aspiration prior to being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct leak.
    # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Intubated for ERCP [**1-8**] after
   becoming significantly hypoxic.  Had an aspiration event and anesthesia
   bronchoscopy showed large amount of bilious fluid in right middle lobe;
   growing E. coli in sputum as of [**2109-1-12**].  Will treat for presumed ARDS
   though patient does not strictly meet criteria.
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**] (low tidal
   volumes, higher respiratory rate to meet minute ventilation needs, wean
   peep as tolerated)
   - cont vanco/ zosyn/flagyl for now to cover GI and aspiration. ID aware
   and ok with double covering for anaerobes although surgery not sure
   about this.
   -given +18L in LOS and effusions and pulm edema on CXR, will need
   diuresis prior to weaning. Will try lasix gtt today for goal 100cc UOP
   /hr as pressures tolerate.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to combination of hypovolemia from
   third-spacing in setting of pancreatitis.  Relative hypovolemia
   manifested first by tachycardia and then by hypotension.
   - IVF resuscitation with LR PRN, currently good BP
   - management of pancreatitis, ?sepsis as described below
   - CVP goal of 12, CVO2 goal of >70%
   - Will transfuse for Hct < 26
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl (day 1 = [**1-8**] for all antibiotics)
   - consider coverage of VRE or fungus if patient decompensates (fever
   curve currently trending down and perhaps slightly better)
   # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) with neg
   ERCP ([**12-31**] at [**Hospital1 5**]) s/p lap chole ([**1-5**]) c/b bile leak at OSH, and s/p
   ERCP for stent for leak c/b aspiration.  JP drain in place and draining
   bilious fluid.  Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal
   CT on [**2109-1-9**].
   - aggressive IVF resuscitation with LR if needed for hypotension but
   will try to minimize for overall respiratory status
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl though likely will not affect course of
   pancreatitis
   - f/u surgery recs; anticipate conservative management for now
   - f/u ERCP recs
   - continue to trend amylase/lipase
   - ordering CT abd/pelvis today with PO and IV contrast to make sure no
   abscess
   -Pt with sign hiccups today. Will start Thorazine 25 IV QID and rescan
   for possible subdiaphragmatic abscess.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression, who was transferred to the ICU for acute pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and aspiration pneumonia. He underwent an ERCP procedure after experiencing a bile duct leak and became significantly hypoxic, leading to intubation. The patient also has cholecystitis due to a gallstone. He is currently sedated and unable to provide a medical history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has been intubated and is receiving protective ventilation as per ARDS protocol. He does not strictly meet the criteria for ARDS but will be treated as such due to his condition.
2. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis secondary to a combination of hypovolemia from third-spacing in the setting of pancreatitis and aspiration pneumonia. Antibiotics have been initiated, and close monitoring of vital signs and lab parameters is essential.
3. Pancreatitis Complications: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis with a partially necrotic pancreas. There is a risk of developing complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, or abscesses. A CT scan of the abdomen is planned to rule out any abscess formation.
4. Shock: The patient may be experiencing shock due to hypovolemia from third-spacing in pancreatitis. Aggressive fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution is ongoing to maintain adequate blood"

   53 year-old male with a history of depression transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   s/p aspiration after being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct leak.
    # Shock:  Likely secondary to combination of hypovolemia from
   third-spacing in setting of pancreatitis.  Relative hypovolemia
   manifested first by tachycardia and then by hypotension.
   - IVF resuscitation with LR PRN, currently good BP
   - management of pancreatitis, ?sepsis as described below
   - CVP goal of 12, CVO2 goal of >70%
   - Will transfuse for Hct < 26
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl (day 1 = [**1-8**] for all antibiotics)
   - consider coverage of VRE or fungus if patient decompensates (fever
   curve currently trending down and perhaps slightly better)
   # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) with neg
   ERCP ([**12-31**] at [**Hospital1 5**]) s/p lap chole ([**1-5**]) c/b bile leak at OSH, and s/p
   ERCP for stent for leak c/b aspiration.  JP drain in place and draining
   bilious fluid.  Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal
   CT on [**2109-1-9**].
   - aggressive IVF resuscitation with LR if needed for hypotension but
   will try to minimize for overall respiratory status
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl though likely will not affect course of
   pancreatitis
   - f/u surgery reccs; anticipate conservative management for now
   - f/u ERCP reccs
   - continue to trend amylase/lipase
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Intubated for ERCP [**1-8**] after
   becoming significantly hypoxic.  Had an aspiration event and anesthesia
   bronchoscopy showed large amount of bilious fluid in right middle lobe;
   growing E. coli in sputum as of [**2109-1-12**].  Will treat for presumed ARDS
   though patient does not strictly meet criteria.
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**] (low tidal
   volumes, higher respiratory rate to meet minute ventilation needs, wean
   peep as tolerated)
   - cont vanco/ zosyn/flagyl for now to cover GI and aspiration
   -attempt to keep euvolemic today in order to not worsen pulmonary
   edema.
   #Anemia: Basically stable but given concern for hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was transferred to the ICU after undergoing an ERCP for a bile duct leak. The patient developed aspiration pneumonia after being intubated for the ERCP and required mechanical ventilation. He also has acute pancreatitis, likely secondary to gallstone pancreatitis, with evidence of necrotic pancreatitis on abdominal CT. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient may be at risk for shock due to hypovolemia from third-spacing in the setting of pancreatitis. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is necessary.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis with evidence of necrotic pancreatitis. Aggressive fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's (LR) may be required for hypotension, while minimizing respiratory compromise.
3. Sepsis: The patient may be at risk for sepsis due to the ongoing infection from aspiration pneumonia and necrotic pancreatitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole) have been initiated.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The ARDS protocol should be continued for protective ventilation, including low tidal volumes, higher respiratory rates, and weaning peep as tolerated.
5. Anemia: The patient may develop anemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o with ascending cholangitis tx here for ERCP [**12-31**], no stone found
   so sent back to OSH.  Had lap chole ([**1-5**]) at OSH with resulting bile
   leak - sent back here for ERCP and stenting ([**1-8**]).  During ERCP,
   patient aspirated - difficult time oxygenating - bronch showed bile in
   right main stem.  Now with severe necrotic pacreatitis/sepsis.  On
   vanc/zosyn/flagyl.
    # Shock:  Likely due to sepsis/hemorrhagic pancreatitis.    BP now
   stable with severe volume overload.  Persistent fevers likely due to
   severe pancreatitis, not ongoing infectious source
   - Lasix gtt with gentle diuresis if tolerated.
   - Continue vanc/zosyn and follow up cultures
   - Would add fungal coverage if dramatically worsens.
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Now growing E. coli sensitive
   to Zosyn out of sputum with persistent thick secretions, although main
   cause of persistent resp failure likely volume overload/pulmonary
   edema.
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**]
 wean FiO2
   as tolerated
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for e.coli aspiration PNA
   - Continue on AC today as has significant secretions and no thoughts to
   extubate at this time.
   - Consider diuresis  tomorrow if BP allows.
   -may need drainage of effusions with pigtail catheters to allow vent
   wean if still febrile
   #Hiccups: The patient had intermittent end inspiratory hiccups a few
   days ago that had resolved.  Now with severe hiccups causing
   respiratory alkalosis as each hiccup triggering vent.  Already on midaz
   gtt.  Etiology of hiccups concerning for diaphragmatic process,
   including abscess or misplaced drain.
   - Abd CT scan today. Will get Head CT too given concerns regarding
   mentation
   - Thorazine
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CT with evidence of severe
   necrosis/hemorrhage.
   - ERCP/surgery following.
   # FEN:
   - Post-pyloric Dophoff with TF (okay by surgery/ERCP).
   - Hold OG suction.
   All other issues per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ascending cholangitis, who was admitted for ERCP. He underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy at the outpatient surgery hospital (OSH) due to no stone found during the ERCP. However, he developed a bile leak and was sent back to the hospital for another ERCP and stenting. During the procedure, the patient aspirated and had difficulty oxygenating. A bronchoscopic examination revealed bile in the right mainstem. Currently, the patient is diagnosed with severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis. He is on vancomycin (Vanc), piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and metronidazole (Flagyl). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock due to sepsis and hemorrhagic pancreatitis. His blood pressure is stable but may fluctuate, and he may show signs of poor perfusion.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure/aspiration pneumonia: The patient has persistent fevers and thick secretions in the respiratory tract, which can lead to further respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. He is already on ARDS protocol for protective ventilation and antibiotics for E. coli, which was cultured from his sputum.
3. Hiccups: The patient has severe hiccups causing respiratory alkalosis and triggering the ventilator. This could be due to a diaphragmatic process, such as an abscess or misplaced drain. A head CT scan is planned to investigate further.
4. Gallstone pancreatitis: The patient has evidence of severe necrosis/hemorrhage on CT scan, indicating severe gallstone pancreatitis. He may require ERCP/surgery in the future.
5. Feeding tube issues: The patient has a post-pyloric feeding tube (Dophoff) with tube feeding, but there are concerns about potential complications like aspiration pneumonia. The nasogastric (OG) suction is being held.
6. Fluid overload: The patient has signs of severe volume overload, as indicated by diffuse bilateral fluffy infiltrates and effusions on chest X-ray. This can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
7. Sepsis: The patient is already septic and requires continued aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a concern about developing fungal infections, so coverage may be added if the patient worsens.

Please note that the potential medical complications mentioned above are based on the provided information and may not be an exhaustive list."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o with ascending cholangitis tx here for ERCP [**12-31**], no stone found
   so sent back to OSH.  Had lap chole ([**1-5**]) at OSH with resulting bile
   leak - sent back here for ERCP and stenting ([**1-8**]).  During ERCP,
   patient aspirated - difficult time oxygenating - bronch showed bile in
   right main stem.  Now with severe necrotic pacreatitis/sepsis.  On
   vanc/zosyn/flagyl.
    # Shock:  Likely due to sepsis/hemorrhagic pancreatitis.    BP now
   stable.  Persistent fevers likely due to severe pancreatitis, not
   ongoing infectious source
   - Continue IVF (LR) prn
 follow CVP/HR
   - Continue vanc/zosyn and follow up cultures
   - Would add fungal coverage if dramatically worsens.
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Now growing E. coli sensitive
   to Zosyn out of sputum with persistent thick secretions, although main
   cause of persistent resp failure likely volume overload/pulmonary
   edema.
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**]
 wean FiO2
   as tolerated
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for e.coli aspiration PNA
   - Continue on AC today as has significant secretions and no thoughts to
   extubate at this time.
   - Consider diuresis  tomorrow if BP allows.
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CT with evidence of severe
   necrosis/hemorrhage.
   - ERCP/surgery following.
   - T bili increased
 send direct/indirect and follow
   # FEN:
   - Post-pyloric Dophoff with TF (okay by surgery/ERCP).
   All other issues per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 53-year-old male who presented with ascending cholangitis and was initially treated with ERCP. However, no stone was found, so the patient was sent back to OSH for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a bile leak following the surgery, and was subsequently sent back to the hospital for an ERCP and stenting. During the ERCP procedure, the patient aspirated, resulting in severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis. The patient is currently on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole.

The patient's current condition includes shock, likely due to septic shock and hemorrhagic pancreatitis. His persistent fevers are likely due to severe pancreatitis rather than an ongoing infectious source. The patient's respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia are also contributing factors. He has thick secretions in his airways and requires protective ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's gallstone pancreatitis has resulted in severe necrosis and hemorrhage, as evident on CT imaging.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing with ARDS protocol for protective ventilation, weaning FiO2 as tolerated, and continuing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for E. coli aspiration pneumonia. The patient is also receiving post-pyloric feeding through a Dophoff tube due to the risk of aspiration. Considering the patient's critical condition and the need"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ascending cholangitis, who underwent an ERCP procedure that resulted in aspiration and severe necrotic pancreatitis. The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications including shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, hiccups, and gallstone pancreatitis. The patient is critically ill and requires ongoing intensive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock due to sepsis and hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Close monitoring of vital signs, particularly blood pressure, is essential. Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support may be required to maintain hemodynamic stability.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has persistent thick secretions and is at risk for further respiratory compromise. Continued implementation of ARDS protocol for protective ventilation and weaning FiO2 as tolerated is necessary. Antibiotics should be continued to treat E. coli aspiration pneumonia.

3. Hiccups: The patient's severe hiccups are causing respiratory alkalosis and may be related to a diaphragmatic process such as abscess formation or misplaced drain. An abdominal CT scan should be performed to evaluate the etiology of hiccups. Thorazine can be considered for symptomatic relief.

4. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient has evidence of severe necrosis and hemorrhage on CT scan, likely secondary to gallstone pancreatitis. ERCP or surgery may be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ascending cholangitis, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and subsequent bile leak. He underwent an ERCP procedure during which he aspirated and developed severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with endotracheal tube, receiving multiple medications including vasopressors, antibiotics, and antifungal agents. He has persistent fevers, hypotension, respiratory distress, and evidence of severe volume overload. The patient's condition is complicated by hiccups, which are causing respiratory alkalosis, and a potential diaphragmatic process such as abscess or misplaced drain. Additionally, there are concerns about gallstone pancreatitis with severe necrosis/hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis and hemorrhagic pancreatitis. With the current severe volume overload, careful management of fluid balance is crucial.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure/Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has persistent thick secretions and is at risk for further respiratory compromise. The ongoing growth of E. coli in sputum indicates an active infection that needs to be addressed.
3. Diaphragmatic process: The severe hiccups causing respiratory alkalosis may be indicative of a diaphragmatic process such as abscess or misplaced drain. Further evaluation, such as an abdominal CT scan, is needed to confirm this concern"

   53 year-old male with a history of depression transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   s/p aspiration prior to being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct leak.
    # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Intubated for ERCP [**1-8**] after
   becoming significantly hypoxic.  Had an aspiration event and anesthesia
   bronchoscopy showed large amount of bilious fluid in right middle lobe;
   growing E. coli in sputum as of [**2109-1-12**].  Will treat for presumed ARDS
   though patient does not strictly meet criteria.
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**] (low tidal
   volumes, higher respiratory rate to meet minute ventilation needs, wean
   peep as tolerated)
   - cont vanco/ zosyn/flagyl for now to cover GI and aspiration. ID aware
   and ok with double covering for anaerobes although surgery not sure
   about this.
   -given +18L in LOS and effusions and pulm edema on CXR, will need
   diuresis prior to weaning. Will try lasix gtt today for goal 100cc UOP
   /hr as pressures tolerate.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to combination of hypovolemia from
   third-spacing in setting of pancreatitis.  Relative hypovolemia
   manifested first by tachycardia and then by hypotension.
   - IVF resuscitation with LR PRN, currently good BP
   - management of pancreatitis, ?sepsis as described below
   - CVP goal of 12, CVO2 goal of >70%
   - Will transfuse for Hct < 26
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl (day 1 = [**1-8**] for all antibiotics)
   - consider coverage of VRE or fungus if patient decompensates (fever
   curve currently trending down and perhaps slightly better)
   # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) with neg
   ERCP ([**12-31**] at [**Hospital1 5**]) s/p lap chole ([**1-5**]) c/b bile leak at OSH, and s/p
   ERCP for stent for leak c/b aspiration.  JP drain in place and draining
   bilious fluid.  Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal
   CT on [**2109-1-9**].
   - aggressive IVF resuscitation with LR if needed for hypotension but
   will try to minimize for overall respiratory status
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl though likely will not affect course of
   pancreatitis
   - f/u surgery recs; anticipate conservative management for now
   - f/u ERCP recs
   - continue to trend amylase/lipase
   - ordering CT abd/pelvis today with PO and IV contrast to make sure no
   abscess
   -Pt with sign hiccups today. Will start Thorazine 25 IV QID and rescan
   for possible subdiaphragmatic abscess.
   #Anemia: Basically stable despite  concern for hemorrhagic pancreatitis
   # Comm:  Social work has identified a few family members.  We are also
   in communication with his surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4567**], who performed lap chole

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and cholangitis. He underwent an ERCP procedure but experienced significant hypoxia and aspiration, leading to intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, pneumonia (possibly aspiration-related), and cholecystitis. His current condition includes anemia, shock (likely secondary to hypovolemia from third-spacing in pancreatitis), and anasarca with increased bilateral pleural effusions and small intra-abdominal ascites. The patient is receiving aggressive IVF resuscitation, diuretics for fluid overload, antibiotics to cover GI and aspiration, and TPN for nutrition. He is also on prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated body temperature. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated AST and ALT levels, hyperglycemia, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies reveal diffuse patchy alveolar opacities throughout both lungs, consolidations, evidence of necrotizing pancreatitis, and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. The patient's clinical course is complicated by the presence of a biliary stent, which could represent obstruction."

   53 year-old male with a history of depression transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   s/p aspiration prior to being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct leak.
    # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Intubated for ERCP [**1-8**] after
   becoming significantly hypoxic.  Had an aspiration event and anesthesia
   bronchoscopy showed large amount of bilious fluid in right middle lobe;
   growing E. coli in sputum as of [**2109-1-12**].  Will treat for presumed ARDS
   though patient does not strictly meet criteria.
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**] (low tidal
   volumes, higher respiratory rate to meet minute ventilation needs, wean
   peep as tolerated)
   - cont vanco/ zosyn/flagyl for now to cover GI and aspiration. ID aware
   and ok with double covering for anaerobes although surgery not sure
   about this.
   -given +18L in LOS and effusions and pulm edema on CXR, will need
   diuresis prior to weaning. Will try lasix gtt today for goal 100cc UOP
   /hr as pressures tolerate.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to combination of hypovolemia from
   third-spacing in setting of pancreatitis.  Relative hypovolemia
   manifested first by tachycardia and then by hypotension.
   - IVF resuscitation with LR PRN, currently good BP
   - management of pancreatitis, ?sepsis as described below
   - CVP goal of 12, CVO2 goal of >70%
   - Will transfuse for Hct < 26
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl (day 1 = [**1-8**] for all antibiotics)
   - consider coverage of VRE or fungus if patient decompensates (fever
   curve currently trending down and perhaps slightly better)
   # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) with neg
   ERCP ([**12-31**] at [**Hospital1 5**]) s/p lap chole ([**1-5**]) c/b bile leak at OSH, and s/p
   ERCP for stent for leak c/b aspiration.  JP drain in place and draining
   bilious fluid.  Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal
   CT on [**2109-1-9**].
   - aggressive IVF resuscitation with LR if needed for hypotension but
   will try to minimize for overall respiratory status
   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl though likely will not affect course of
   pancreatitis
   - f/u surgery recs; anticipate conservative management for now
   - f/u ERCP recs
   - continue to trend amylase/lipase
   - ordering CT abd/pelvis today with PO and IV contrast to make sure no
   abscess
   -Pt with sign hiccups today. Will start Thorazine 25 IV QID and rescan
   for possible subdiaphragmatic abscess.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. He underwent an ERCP procedure but became significantly hypoxic and was intubated. The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and had a bile leak following a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He also underwent an ERCP for stent placement due to the leak, but developed aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated for presumed ARDS. He is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for possible sepsis and aspiration. The patient's condition is complicated by anasarca, increased bilateral pleural effusions, and small amounts of intra-abdominal ascites. Imaging studies have revealed diffuse patchy alveolar opacities throughout both lungs, persistent bibasilar consolidations, evidence of necrotizing pancreatitis, and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/50 mmHg to 144/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate levels. The patient is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation, diuretics, and supportive care. The medical team is monitoring the patient closely and planning for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and cholangitis. He underwent an ERCP procedure but became significantly hypoxic and required intubation due to an aspiration event. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently being weaned off pressure support. He has a history of gallstone pancreatitis, with a bile leak that required an ERCP with stent placement. The patient also has necrotizing pancreatitis and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. He is showing signs of anasarca, increased bilateral pleural effusions, and small amounts of intra-abdominal ascites. The patient's E. coli sputum culture is resistant to several antibiotics, so the treatment will be switched to meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's worsening diffuse patchy alveolar opacities throughout both lungs and persistent bibasilar consolidations are concerning for pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia remains a diagnostic consideration.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis with decreased areas of enhancement in the head and body of the pancreas. Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes are likely reactive and related to the ongoing inflammatory and/or infectious process.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o with ascending cholangitis tx here for ERCP [**12-31**], no stone found
   so sent back to OSH.  Had lap chole ([**1-5**]) at OSH with resulting bile
   leak - sent back here for ERCP and stenting ([**1-8**]).  During ERCP,
   patient aspirated - difficult time oxygenating - bronch showed bile in
   right main stem.  Now with severe necrotic pacreatitis/sepsis.
    # Shock:  Likely due to sepsis/hemorrhagic pancreatitis.    BP now
   stable with severe volume overload.  Persistent fevers likely due to
   severe pancreatitis, not ongoing infectious source
   - Lasix gtt with gentle diuresis if tolerated.
   - Change to vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] based on recent culture results
   - Would add fungal coverage if dramatically worsens
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Now growing E. coli sensitive
   to Zosyn out of sputum with persistent thick secretions, although main
   cause of persistent resp failure likely volume overload/pulmonary
   edema.
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**]
 wean FiO2
   as tolerated
   - Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for e.coli aspiration PNA
   - Wean PS as tolerated
   - Diuresis on lasix gtt.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need drainage of effusions with pigtail catheters to allow vent
   wean if still febrile
   #Hiccups: The patient had intermittent end inspiratory hiccups a few
   days ago that had resolved.  Now with severe hiccups causing
   respiratory alkalosis as each hiccup triggering vent.  Already on midaz
   gtt.  Etiology of hiccups concerning for diaphragmatic process,
   including abscess or misplaced drain, but CT negative. Improved with
   thorazine.
   - Continue thorazine
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CT with evidence of severe
   necrosis/hemorrhage.
   - ERCP/surgery following.
   - Increased air in biliary system on CT, so will d/w surgery
   # FEN:
   - Post-pyloric Dophoff with TF (okay by surgery/ERCP).
   - Hold OG suction.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ascending cholangitis who was admitted for an ERCP procedure. During the ERCP, the patient aspirated and had bile in the right mainstem bronchus. He now presents with severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis. The patient is in shock due to sepsis and hemorrhagic pancreatitis, but his blood pressure is stable with severe volume overload. He has persistent fevers likely due to severe pancreatitis, not an ongoing infectious source.

The patient also has hypoxic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia caused by E. coli, which is sensitive to Zosyn. The main cause of persistent respiratory failure is likely volume overload and pulmonary edema. The patient requires continued ARDS protocol for protective ventilation and weaning of FiO2 as tolerated. He should continue on vancomycin and remain on Lasix gtt for diuresis. 

The patient has hiccups causing respiratory alkalosis, which are concerning for a diaphragmatic process such as an abscess or misplaced drain. The hiccups have improved with thorazine, so it should be continued.

The patient has evidence of severe necrosis and hemorrhage on CT, indicating gallstone pancreatitis. ERCP/surgery will be necessary for further management. There is increased air in the biliary system on CT, so surgical consultation is recommended.

The patient requires post-pyloric Dophoff with TF, and OG suction should be"

The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the ICU for severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis. He underwent ERCP and stenting due to a bile leak following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. During ERCP, the patient aspirated, leading to a right mainstem bronchus blockage with bile. The patient's current conditions include shock, hypoxic respiratory failure/aspiration pneumonia, hiccups, gallstone pancreatitis, and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock due to sepsis and hemorrhagic pancreatitis. This can lead to inadequate blood flow to vital organs and potentially result in organ failure.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/Aspiration PNA: The patient's respiratory failure may be caused by volume overload and pulmonary edema, although there is also an ongoing infection with E. coli in the sputum. This increases the risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Hiccups: The patient's severe hiccups are causing respiratory alkalosis and triggering the ventilator. This could potentially lead to respiratory fatigue and worsening of the patient's overall condition.
4. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient's severe necrosis and hemorrhage seen on CT indicate gallstone pancreatitis. If left untreated, this condition can progress and lead to complications such as abscess formation or infected pancreatic necrosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o with ascending cholangitis tx here for ERCP [**12-31**], no stone found
   so sent back to OSH.  Had lap chole ([**1-5**]) at OSH with resulting bile
   leak - sent back here for ERCP and stenting ([**1-8**]).  During ERCP,
   patient aspirated - difficult time oxygenating - bronch showed bile in
   right main stem.  Now with severe necrotic pacreatitis/sepsis.
    # Shock:  Likely due to sepsis/hemorrhagic pancreatitis.    BP now
   stable with severe volume overload.  Persistent fevers likely due to
   severe pancreatitis, not ongoing infectious source
   - Lasix gtt with gentle diuresis if tolerated.
   - Change to vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] based on recent culture results
   - Would add fungal coverage if dramatically worsens
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Now growing E. coli sensitive
   to Zosyn out of sputum with persistent thick secretions, although main
   cause of persistent resp failure likely volume overload/pulmonary
   edema.
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**]
 wean FiO2
   as tolerated
   - Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for e.coli aspiration PNA
   - Wean PS as tolerated
   - Diuresis on lasix gtt.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need drainage of effusions with pigtail catheters to allow vent
   wean if still febrile
   #Hiccups: The patient had intermittent end inspiratory hiccups a few
   days ago that had resolved.  Now with severe hiccups causing
   respiratory alkalosis as each hiccup triggering vent.  Already on midaz
   gtt.  Etiology of hiccups concerning for diaphragmatic process,
   including abscess or misplaced drain, but CT negative. Improved with
   thorazine.
   - Continue thorazine
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CT with evidence of severe
   necrosis/hemorrhage.
   - ERCP/surgery following.
   - Increased air in biliary system on CT, so will d/w surgery
   # FEN:
   - Post-pyloric Dophoff with TF (okay by surgery/ERCP), but OG
   suctioning a lot out.
   - go back to TPN
   #Altered mental status:  Head CT negative, but still not waking up.
   - Follow off sedation.
   All other issues per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the ICU for severe necrotic pancreatitis, sepsis, and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, which resulted in aspiration and the finding of bile in the right mainstem bronchus. The patient also had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at an outside hospital due to an ascending cholangitis, but no gallstones were found. The patient then returned to the outside hospital for a laparotomy with resulting bile leak and was subsequently sent back to this hospital for an ERCP and stenting.

The patient's current conditions include shock, likely due to sepsis and hemorrhagic pancreatitis. The patient's blood pressure is stable but with severe volume overload. Persistent fevers are likely due to severe pancreatitis and not an ongoing infectious source. The patient's respiratory failure is due to hypoxia and aspiration pneumonia. The patient is growing E. coli sensitive to Zosyn in the sputum with persistent thick secretions. The main cause of persistent respiratory failure is likely volume overload and pulmonary edema.

The patient's plan includes continuing ARDS protocol for protective ventilation, weaning FiO2 as tolerated, continuing Vanc/[**Last Name (un)**] for E. coli aspiration PNA, weaning PS as tolerated, diuresis on Lasix gtt, and drainage of effusions with pigtail catheters if still febrile.

   53 year-old male with a history of depression transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   s/p aspiration prior to being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct
   leak.
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:  The patient was intubated
   for ERCP on [**1-8**] after becoming significantly hypoxic after his
   ERCP.    He had an aspiration event and anesthesia bronchoscopy showing
   a large amount of bilious fluid in right middle lobe.  Has been
   successfully advanced to pressure support and ABG
s stable.  We will
   continue on pressure support and continue to monitor ABG
s to follow.
   Regarding his E coli in the sputum, this continues to be unlikely to be
   a pneumonia but given that he is still very ill and ventilated we will
   treat this as real for the moment.   We will switch cipro to meropenem,
   which will cover E. coli as well as GI flora and stop
   metronidazole.
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**] (low tidal
   volumes, higher respiratory rate to meet minute ventilation needs, wean
   peep as tolerated)
   - cont vanco/meropenem for now to cover GI and aspiration. ID aware and
   ok with double covering for anaerobes although surgery not sure about
   this.
   -given +18L in LOS and effusions and pulm edema on CXR, will need
   diuresis prior to weaning. Will try lasix gtt today for goal of one
   liter negative as pressures tolerate.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to combination of hypovolemia from
   third-spacing in setting of pancreatitis.  Relative hypovolemia
   manifested first by tachycardia and then by hypotension.
   - IVF resuscitation with LR PRN, currently good BP
   - management of pancreatitis, ?sepsis as described below
   - CVP goal of 12, CVO2 goal of >70%
   - Will transfuse for Hct < 26
   - continue vanc/meropenem (day 1 = [**1-8**] for all antibiotics)
   - consider coverage of VRE or fungus if patient decompensates (fever
   curve currently trending down and perhaps slightly better)
    # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) with neg
   ERCP ([**12-31**] at [**Hospital1 5**]) s/p lap chole ([**1-5**]) c/b bile leak at OSH, and s/p
   ERCP for stent for leak c/b aspiration.  JP drain in place and draining
   bilious fluid.  Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal
   CT on [**2109-1-9**] and unchanged on scan on [**2109-1-14**].
   - aggressive IVF resuscitation with LR if needed for hypotension but
   will try to minimize for overall respiratory status
   - continue vanc/meropenem though likely will not affect course of
   pancreatitis
   - surgery repeats plan for conservative management for now
   - f/u ERCP recs
   #Anemia: Basically stable despite  concern for hemorrhagic pancreatitis
   # Comm:  Social work has identified a few family members.  We are also
   in communication with his surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4567**], who performed lap chole

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression, who was transferred to the ICU after undergoing an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak. He became hypoxic and required intubation due to an aspiration event during the procedure. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple conditions including hypoxic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, metabolic acidosis, altered mental status (not delirium), acute pancreatitis, calculous cholecystitis, and possible sepsis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications for his various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), worsening hypoxia, or barotrauma from prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: With the presence of multiple organ dysfunction (e.g., respiratory failure, altered mental status, metabolic acidosis), the patient is at risk for developing sepsis, especially considering his comorbidities and recent invasive procedures.
3. Pancreatitis Complications: The patient has acute pancreatitis with necrotic changes. Complications such as infected pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or systemic spread of infection can occur.
4. Cholecystitis Complications: The patient has calculous cholecystitis, which can lead to complications such as gallbladder"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing aspiration during an ERCP procedure. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a diagnosis of cholangitis, respiratory failure, and pancreatitis. He also has anemia, shock, and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 107/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21300 cells/µL, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, vasopressors, diuretics, and sedatives.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated for an extended period of time. The presence of E. coli in his sputum culture may suggest a possible VAP, especially considering his defervescence on meropenem.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate a potential kidney dysfunction. This"

   53 year-old male with a history of depression transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   s/p aspiration prior to being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct
   leak.
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:  The patient was intubated
   after becoming significantly hypoxic after his ERCP.    He vomited,
   aspirated and had bilious fluid in the lung at the time of anesthesia
   bronchoscopy.  Has been successfully advanced to pressure support and
   ABG
s stable.  We will continue on pressure support and continue to
   monitor ABG
s to follow.  Sputum ecoli
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**] (low tidal
   volumes, higher respiratory rate to meet minute ventilation needs, wean
   peep as tolerated)
   - cont vanco/meropenem for now to cover GI and aspiration. ID aware and
   ok with double covering for anaerobes although surgery not sure about
   this.
   -given +18L in LOS and effusions and pulm edema on CXR, will need
   diuresis prior to weaning. Will try lasix gtt today for goal of one
   liter negative as pressures tolerate.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to combination of hypovolemia from
   third-spacing in setting of pancreatitis.  Relative hypovolemia
   manifested first by tachycardia and then by hypotension.
   - IVF resuscitation with LR PRN, currently good BP
   - management of pancreatitis, ?sepsis as described below
   - CVP goal of 12, CVO2 goal of >70%
   - Will transfuse for Hct < 26
   - continue vanc/meropenem (day 1 = [**1-8**] for all antibiotics)
   - consider coverage of VRE or fungus if patient decompensates (fever
   curve currently trending down and perhaps slightly better)
    # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) with neg
   ERCP ([**12-31**] at [**Hospital1 5**]) s/p lap chole ([**1-5**]) c/b bile leak at OSH, and s/p
   ERCP for stent for leak c/b aspiration.  JP drain in place and draining
   bilious fluid.  Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal
   CT on [**2109-1-9**] and unchanged on scan on [**2109-1-14**].
   - aggressive IVF resuscitation with LR if needed for hypotension but
   will try to minimize for overall respiratory status
   - continue vanc/meropenem though likely will not affect course of
   pancreatitis
   - surgery repeats plan for conservative management for now
   - f/u ERCP recs
   #Anemia: Basically stable despite  concern for hemorrhagic pancreatitis
   # Comm:  Social work has identified a few family members.  We are also
   in communication with his surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4567**], who performed lap chole
   at OSH ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4624**] (c) )

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression, who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing an aspiration prior to being intubated for an ERCP procedure. He had a bile duct leak and underwent an ERCP for stent placement. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and is receiving antibiotics coverage for potential GI and aspiration organisms.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, acute pancreatitis, metabolic acidosis, and shock. The shock is likely secondary to hypovolemia from third-spacing in the setting of pancreatitis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.8°F), heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 107/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute (on mechanical ventilation), and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, and altered liver function tests.

The patient's abdominal CT scan revealed acute pancreatitis with partial necrosis, and there is also evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient has been started on aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution and is being monitored closely.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis secondary to pancreatitis and pneumonia, further development of metabolic acidosis, and potential cardiac complications due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o with ascending cholangitis tx here for ERCP [**12-31**], no stone found
   so sent back to OSH.  Had lap chole ([**1-5**]) at OSH with resulting bile
   leak - sent back here for ERCP and stenting ([**1-8**]).  During ERCP,
   patient aspirated - difficult time oxygenating - bronch showed bile in
   right main stem.  Now with severe necrotic pacreatitis/sepsis.
    # Shock:  Likely due to sepsis/hemorrhagic pancreatitis.    BP now
   stable with severe volume overload.  Persistent fevers likely due to
   severe pancreatitis, not ongoing infectious source
   - Lasix gtt with gentle diuresis if tolerated.
   - Change to vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] based on recent culture results
   - Would add fungal coverage if dramatically worsens
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Now growing E. coli sensitive
   to Zosyn out of sputum with persistent thick secretions, although main
   cause of persistent resp failure likely volume overload/pulmonary
   edema.
   - Continue ARDS protocol for protective ventilation for [**Doctor Last Name 76**]
 wean FiO2
   as tolerated
   - Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for e.coli aspiration PNA
   - Wean PS as tolerated
   - Diuresis on lasix gtt.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need drainage of effusions with pigtail catheters to allow vent
   wean if still febrile
   #Hiccups: The patient had intermittent end inspiratory hiccups a few
   days ago that had resolved.  Now with severe hiccups causing
   respiratory alkalosis as each hiccup triggering vent.  Already on midaz
   gtt.  Etiology of hiccups concerning for diaphragmatic process,
   including abscess or misplaced drain, but CT negative. Improved with
   thorazine.
   - Continue thorazine
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CT with evidence of severe
   necrosis/hemorrhage.
   - ERCP/surgery following.
   - Increased air in biliary system on CT, so will d/w surgery
   # FEN:
   - Post-pyloric Dophoff with TF (okay by surgery/ERCP), but OG
   suctioning a lot out.
   - go back to TPN
   #Altered mental status:  Head CT negative, but still not waking up.
   - Follow off sedation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the ICU for ERCP due to ascending cholangitis. He underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole) at OSH, resulting in a bile leak. He was then sent back to the hospital for ERCP and stenting. During the procedure, the patient aspirated and had difficulty oxygenating. A bronchoscopic examination revealed bile in the right main stem. The patient is now diagnosed with severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock due to sepsis and hemorrhagic pancreatitis. His blood pressure is stable, but there is severe volume overload.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure/aspiration pneumonia: The patient has persistent fevers, growing E. coli sensitive to Zosyn from sputum, and thick secretions. The main cause of respiratory failure is likely volume overload and pulmonary edema.
3. Hiccups: The patient had intermittent end inspiratory hiccups that resolved but now has severe hiccups causing respiratory alkalosis. The etiology of hiccups is concerning for a diaphragmatic process, including abscess or misplaced drain. Improved with thorazine.
4. Gallstone pancreatitis: The patient has severe necrosis and hemorrhage on CT, which is consistent with gallstone pancreatitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o with ascending cholangitis tx here for ERCP [**12-31**], no stone found
   so sent back to OSH.  Had lap chole ([**1-5**]) at OSH with resulting bile
   leak - sent back here for ERCP and stenting ([**1-8**]).  During ERCP,
   patient aspirated - difficult time oxygenating - bronch showed bile in
   right main stem.  Now with severe necrotic pacreatitis/sepsis.
    # Shock:  Likely due to sepsis/hemorrhagic pancreatitis.    BP now
   stable with severe volume overload.  Persistent fevers likely due to
   severe pancreatitis, but now decreasing on meropenem.
   - Lasix gtt with gentle diuresis if tolerated.
   - Change to vanc (D8/10)/[**Last Name (un) **] (D2/10) based on recent culture results
   - Would add fungal coverage if dramatically worsens
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Initially growing E. coli
   sensitive to Zosyn out of sputum, now growing E. coli resistent to
   Zosyn, sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **] with persistent thick secretions.  Main cause
   of persistent resp failure likely volume overload/pulmonary edema
   coupled with failure to wake up.
   - Continue PS
 wean as tolerated
   - Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for e.coli aspiration PNA
   - Diuresis on lasix gtt/pressors
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CT with evidence of severe
   necrosis/hemorrhage.
   - ERCP/surgery following.
   - Increased air in biliary system on CT, d/w surgery
 no intervention
   indicated
   # FEN:
   - Post-pyloric Dophoff with TF (okay by surgery/ERCP), but OG
   suctioning a lot out.
   - Resulting metabolic alkalosis.
   #Altered mental status:  Head CT negative, but still not waking up.
   - Follow off sedation.
   #Hiccups: The patient had severe hiccups causing respiratory alkalosis
   as each hiccup triggering vent.  Already on midaz gtt.  Etiology of
   hiccups concerning for diaphragmatic process, including abscess or
   misplaced drain, but CT negative. Improved with thorazine.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ascending cholangitis who presented for ERCP, but no stone was found. He underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy at OSH and developed a bile leak. He was then sent back to the ICU for ERCP and stenting. During the ERCP procedure, the patient aspirated and had difficulty oxygenating, with bile seen in the right mainstem bronchus. Now, the patient is experiencing severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock due to sepsis and hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Although the patient's blood pressure is currently stable, there is severe volume overload. Persistent fevers are likely due to severe pancreatitis, but they are decreasing with meropenem. The plan includes gentle diuresis with Lasix gtt if tolerated and changing to Vancomycin and [Last Name (un)] based on recent culture results.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure/Aspiration pneumonia: Initially, the patient had E. coli growing out of the sputum, which was sensitive to Zosyn. However, now the patient is growing E. coli resistant to Zosyn but sensitive to [Last Name (un)]. Persistent thick secretions are causing the respiratory failure, along with volume overload and pulmonary edema. The plan includes continuing PS weaning as tolerated and continuing Van"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a complex medical history. He was initially admitted for ascending cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure, but no stone was found. He was then sent back to the operating room for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which resulted in a bile leak. Subsequently, he was transferred back to the ICU for another ERCP and stenting.

During the ERCP, the patient aspirated and had difficulty oxygenating. A bronchoscopic examination revealed bile in the right mainstem bronchus. Currently, the patient is experiencing severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock due to sepsis and hemorrhagic pancreatitis. His blood pressure is stable but with severe volume overload.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure/aspiration pneumonia: The patient initially had an infection caused by E. coli, which was sensitive to Zosyn. However, now the infection is caused by E. coli resistant to Zosyn but sensitive to another antibiotic. The persistent respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload and pulmonary edema, along with the failure to wake up.

3. Gallstone pancreatitis: The patient's CT scan shows evidence of severe necrosis and hemorrhage, indicating gallstone pancreatitis. Surgery and ERCP have already been performed.

4. FEN (feeding): The patient is receiving post-p"

   53 year-old male with a history of depression transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   s/p aspiration prior to being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct
   leak.
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:  The patient was intubated
   after becoming significantly hypoxic after his ERCP.    He vomited,
   aspirated and had bilious fluid in the lung at the time of anesthesia
   bronchoscopy.  Has been successfully advanced to pressure support and
   ABG
s stable.  We will continue on pressure support and continue to
   monitor ABG
s to follow.  Sputum E. coli seemed unlikely to be a VAP
   organism initially but given defervescing on meropenem it is possible
   this is a VAP.
   - cont vanco/meropenem for now to cover GI and aspiration. ID aware and
   ok with double covering for anaerobes although surgery not sure about
   this.
   - Will try lasix gtt today for goal of one liter negative as pressures
   tolerate if continuing to not put out adequately to this would consider
   bolusing once again as pressures improved
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to combination of hypovolemia from
   third-spacing in setting of pancreatitis and now imporoved.  His
   relative hypovolemia has previously been manifested by tachycardia and
   then by hypotension.
   - IVF resuscitation with LR PRN, currently good BP
   - management of pancreatitis, ?sepsis as described below
   - CVP goal of 12, CVO2 goal of >70%
   - Will transfuse for Hct < 26
   - continue vanc/meropenem (day 1 = [**1-8**] for vanc and [**1-15**] for
   meropenem)
   - consider coverage of VRE or fungus if patient decompensates (fever
   curve currently trending down and perhaps slightly better)
    # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) with neg
   ERCP ([**12-31**] at [**Hospital1 5**]) s/p lap chole ([**1-5**]) c/b bile leak at OSH, and s/p
   ERCP for stent for leak c/b aspiration.  JP drain in place and draining
   bilious fluid.  Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal
   CT on [**2109-1-9**] and unchanged on scan on [**2109-1-14**].
   - aggressive IVF resuscitation with LR if needed for hypotension but
   will try to minimize for overall respiratory status
   - continue vanc/meropenem though likely will not affect course of
   pancreatitis
   - f/u ERCP recs and [**Doctor First Name 91**] reccs
   #Anemia: Basically stable despite  concern for hemorrhagic pancreatitis
   previously
   -continue [**Hospital1 **] Hct checks
   # Comm:  Social work has identified a few family members.  We are also
   in communication with his surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4567**], who performed lap chole
   at OSH ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4624**] (c) )

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who presented to the hospital with aspiration prior to undergoing an ERCP for a bile duct leak. He was intubated due to significant hypoxia during the procedure and subsequently developed respiratory failure. The patient also has acute pancreatitis, pneumonia due to aspiration, cholecystitis with gallstones, and metabolic acidosis. 

The patient's current condition includes impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is being treated with pressure support ventilation and antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) to cover for gastrointestinal and aspiration infections. Lasix is being given to promote diuresis and improve negative fluid balance. 

The patient is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and a pulmonary formula to provide nutritional support. Insulin sliding scale is being used for glycemic control. The patient has arterial and multi-lumen lines in place for monitoring and medication administration. Prophylactic measures include boots for deep vein thrombosis prevention, heparin for thromboembolic prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor, and elevation of the head of bed to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

The patient's family members have been identified and contact has been made with the surgeon who performed the laparoscopic cholecystectomy at the other hospital. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently admitted to the ICU for further"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o with ascending cholangitis tx here for ERCP [**12-31**], no stone found
   so sent back to OSH.  Had lap chole ([**1-5**]) at OSH with resulting bile
   leak - sent back here for ERCP and stenting ([**1-8**]).  During ERCP,
   patient aspirated - difficult time oxygenating - bronch showed bile in
   right main stem.  Now with severe necrotic pacreatitis/sepsis.
    # Shock:  Likely due to sepsis/hemorrhagic pancreatitis.    BP now
   stable with severe volume overload.  Persistent fevers likely due to
   severe pancreatitis, but now decreasing on meropenem.
   - Lasix gtt with gentle diuresis if tolerated.
   - Change to vanc (D9/10)/[**Last Name (un) **] (D3/10) based on recent culture results
   - Would add fungal coverage if dramatically worsens
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Initially growing E. coli
   sensitive to Zosyn out of sputum, now growing E. coli resistent to
   Zosyn, sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **] with persistent thick secretions.  Main cause
   of persistent resp failure likely volume overload/pulmonary edema
   coupled with failure to wake up.
   - Continue PS
 wean as tolerated
   - Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for e.coli aspiration PNA
   - Diuresis on lasix gtt/pressors
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CT with evidence of severe
   necrosis/hemorrhage.
   - ERCP/surgery following.
   - Increased air in biliary system on CT, d/w surgery
 no intervention
   indicated
   # FEN:  Dophoff found to be in stomach, explaining large volume
   suctioning of tube feeds.
   - Reposition Dophoff
   #Altered mental status:  Head CT negative, but waking up very slowly.
   - Follow off sedation.
   #Hiccups: The patient had severe hiccups causing respiratory alkalosis
   as each hiccup triggering vent.  Already on midaz gtt.  Etiology of
   hiccups concerning for diaphragmatic process, including abscess or
   misplaced drain, but CT negative. Improved with thorazine.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ascending cholangitis who was admitted for ERCP. However, no stone was found, so the patient was sent back to OSH where he underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with resulting bile leak. He was then returned to the hospital for ERCP and stenting. During the procedure, the patient aspirated, leading to oxygenation difficulties and the discovery of bile in the right mainstem bronchus. The patient is now experiencing severe necrotic pancreatitis/sepsis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to hemorrhagic pancreatitis. His blood pressure is stable but with severe volume overload. Persistent fevers are likely due to severe pancreatitis, and they are decreasing with meropenem.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with Lasix if tolerated.
   - Change to Vancomycin and [**Last Name (un)**] based on recent culture results.
   - Consider adding fungal coverage if the patient's condition worsens dramatically.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure/Aspiration pneumonia: Initially, there was growth of E. coli sensitive to Zosyn from sputum, but now there is growth of E. coli resistant to Zosyn, which is sensitive to [**Last Name (un)**]. Persistent thick secretions are causing respiratory failure.
   - Continue PS weaning as tolerated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male who was admitted for ascending cholangitis. He underwent an ERCP procedure, but no stone was found. He was then sent back to the operating room for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, resulting in a bile leak. The patient was readmitted to the ICU for an ERCP and stenting. During the ERCP, the patient aspirated and had difficulty oxygenating, with a bronchoscopic examination revealing bile in the right mainstem bronchus. The patient is now critically ill with severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock due to sepsis and hemorrhagic pancreatitis. The patient's blood pressure is stable but with severe volume overload.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure/aspiration pneumonia: The patient has persistent thick secretions in the lungs, leading to hypoxia and aspiration pneumonia. The main cause of respiratory failure is likely volume overload and pulmonary edema coupled with the failure to wake up.
3. Gallstone pancreatitis: The patient has evidence of severe necrosis and hemorrhage on CT, indicating gallstone pancreatitis. Further intervention may be required, such as ERCP or surgery.
4. Feeding tube issues: The patient has post-pyloric feeding with tube feeding (TF) but ongoing orogastric suctioning, resulting in metabolic alkalosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o with ascending cholangitis tx here for ERCP [**12-31**], no stone found
   so sent back to OSH.  Had lap chole ([**1-5**]) at OSH with resulting bile
   leak - sent back here for ERCP and stenting ([**1-8**]).  During ERCP,
   patient aspirated - difficult time oxygenating - bronch showed bile in
   right main stem.  Now with severe necrotic pacreatitis/sepsis.
    # Shock:  Likely due to sepsis/hemorrhagic pancreatitis.    BP now
   stable with severe volume overload.  Persistent fevers likely due to
   severe pancreatitis, but now decreasing on meropenem.
   - Lasix gtt with gentle diuresis if tolerated.
   - Change to vanc (D9/10)/[**Last Name (un) **] (D3/10) based on recent culture results
   - Would add fungal coverage if dramatically worsens
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Initially growing E. coli
   sensitive to Zosyn out of sputum, now growing E. coli resistent to
   Zosyn, sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **] with persistent thick secretions.  Main cause
   of persistent resp failure likely volume overload/pulmonary edema
   coupled with failure to wake up.
   - Continue PS
 wean as tolerated
   - Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for e.coli aspiration PNA
   - Diuresis on lasix gtt/pressors
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CT with evidence of severe
   necrosis/hemorrhage.
   - ERCP/surgery following.
   - Increased air in biliary system on CT, d/w surgery
 no intervention
   indicated
   # FEN:  Dophoff found to be in stomach, explaining large volume
   suctioning of tube feeds.
   - Reposition Dophoff
   #Altered mental status:  Head CT negative, but waking up very slowly.
   - Follow off sedation.
   #Hiccups: The patient had severe hiccups causing respiratory alkalosis
   as each hiccup triggering vent.  Already on midaz gtt.  Etiology of
   hiccups concerning for diaphragmatic process, including abscess or
   misplaced drain, but CT negative. Improved with thorazine.
   All other issues per resident note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male who presented with ascending cholangitis. He underwent an ERCP procedure but no stone was found, so he was sent back to OSH for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole). However, he developed a bile leak after the surgery and was referred back to the hospital for an ERCP and stenting. During the ERCP, the patient aspirated and had difficulty oxygenating, with bile observed in the right mainstem bronchus. Currently, the patient is suffering from severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis.

The patient is in shock likely due to sepsis and hemorrhagic pancreatitis. His blood pressure is stable but with severe volume overload. Persistent fevers are present, likely due to severe pancreatitis, and are decreasing on meropenem.

The patient also has hypoxic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. Initially, E. coli sensitive to Zosyn was grown from the sputum, but now resistant E. coli is growing, which is sensitive to vancomycin. The main cause of persistent respiratory failure is likely volume overload/pulmonary edema coupled with failure to wake up.

Other issues include gallstone pancreatitis with evidence of severe necrosis/hemorrhage on CT scan, feeding tube repositioning due to Dophoff being in the stomach, altered mental status with a negative head CT, hiccups causing respiratory alkalosis, and other"

   53 year-old male with a history of depression transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   s/p aspiration prior to being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct
   leak.
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:  The patient was intubated
   after becoming significantly hypoxic after his ERCP.    He vomited,
   aspirated and had bilious fluid in the lung at the time of anesthesia
   bronchoscopy.  Has been successfully advanced to pressure support and
   ABG
s stable.  We will continue on pressure support and continue to
   monitor ABG
s to follow.  Sputum E. coli seemed unlikely to be a VAP
   organism initially but given defervescing on meropenem it is possible
   this is a VAP.
   - cont vanco/meropenem for now to cover GI and aspiration. ID aware and
   ok with double covering for anaerobes although surgery not sure about
   this.
   - Will try lasix gtt today for goal of one liter negative as pressures
   tolerate if continuing to not put out adequately to this would consider
   bolusing once again as pressures improved
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to combination of hypovolemia from
   third-spacing in setting of pancreatitis and now imporoved.  His
   relative hypovolemia has previously been manifested by tachycardia and
   then by hypotension.
   - IVF resuscitation with LR PRN, currently good BP
   - management of pancreatitis, ?sepsis as described below
   - CVP goal of 12, CVO2 goal of >70%
   - Will transfuse for Hct < 26
   - continue vanc/meropenem (day 1 = [**1-8**] for vanc and [**1-15**] for
   meropenem)
   - consider coverage of VRE or fungus if patient decompensates (fever

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia following an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak. The patient vomited, aspirated, and had bilious fluid in the lung during the procedure. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been advanced to pressure support and is currently stable with ABG values within normal limits. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as the sputum culture showed E. coli, although it is being treated with meropenem. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, meropenem, furosemide, famotidine, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may be at risk for impaired skin integrity due to prolonged immobility and bed rest. Regular skin assessment and care should be performed to prevent pressure ulcers.
2. Acidosis, Metabolic: The patient's current laboratory results indicate an elevated TCO2 level of 32-30 mmHg, which suggests the presence of metabolic acidosis. Close monitoring of acid-base balance and appropriate management should be implemented.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is unresponsive and unable to provide any history. Neurological assessment should continue, and further investigations may be necessary to determine the cause of altered mental status.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was transferred to the ICU after undergoing an ERCP for a bile duct leak. The patient's chief complaint is pancreatitis secondary to aspiration and respiratory failure.

The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been successfully advanced to pressure support and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a set Vt of 450 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 24, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 108. The patient's SpO2 is maintained at 97%.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 115/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's physical examination reveals scleral edema, endotracheal and NG tube in place, symmetric chest expansion with crackles on auscultation, soft non-tender abdomen, and diminished peripheral pulses.

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count of 11.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, sodium of 146 mg/dL, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, and glucose levels ranging from 143-146 mg/dL. The patient's AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels are within normal range. The patient's blood cultures are positive for E. coli.

The patient has several medical complications including impaired skin integrity, metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, acute pancreatitis, pneumonia due to aspiration, and cholecystitis with calculi.

The plan of care includes continuing pressure support ventilation and monitoring ABGs to follow. Antibiotics have been initiated with vancomycin and meropenem to cover GI and aspiration. Lasix infusion is being tried for fluid removal, aiming for a negative fluid balance. The patient's CVP goal is set at 12, and CVO2 goal is >70%. Transfusion is planned for Hct < 26.

The patient's pancreatitis is managed with aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with LR PRN, continued vancomycin and meropenem, and consideration of coverage for VRE or fungus if the patient decompensates. The patient's anemia is being monitored with regular Hct checks.

The patient's social work has identified a few family members, and communication with the surgeon who performed the laparoscopic cholecystectomy is ongoing.

The patient is currently receiving SC heparin and famotidine as prophylaxis."

   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:  The patient was intubated
   after becoming significantly hypoxic after his ERCP.    He vomited,
   aspirated and had bilious fluid in the lung at the time of anesthesia
   bronchoscopy.  Has been successfully advanced to pressure support and
   ABG
s stable.  We will continue on pressure support and continue to
   monitor ABG
s to follow.  Sputum E. coli seemed unlikely to be a VAP
   organism initially but given defervescing on meropenem it is possible
   this is a VAP.
   - cont vanco/meropenem for now to cover GI and aspiration. ID aware and
   ok with double covering for anaerobes although surgery not sure about
   this.
   - Cont lasix gtt today  to diurese as tolerated with goal MAP>60.
   Checking Pm lytes
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to combination of hypovolemia from
   third-spacing in setting of pancreatitis and now imporoved.  His
   relative hypovolemia has previously been manifested by tachycardia and
   then by hypotension.
   - IVF resuscitation with LR PRN, currently good BP
   - management of pancreatitis, sepsis as described below
   - CVP goal of 12, CVO2 goal of >70%
   - Will transfuse for Hct < 26
   - continue vanc/meropenem (day 1 = [**1-8**] for vanc and [**1-15**] for
   meropenem)
   - consider coverage of VRE or fungus if patient decompensates (fever
   curve currently trending down and perhaps slightly better)

   bilious fluid.  Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal
   CT on [**2109-1-9**] and unchanged on scan on [**2109-1-14**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure following an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak. The patient aspirated during the procedure and had bilious fluid in the lung. He was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation. Since then, the patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, acute pancreatitis, calculous cholecystitis, metabolic acidosis, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's condition remains unstable, and he requires ongoing medical support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem and vancomycin, to cover for possible infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient has multiple risk factors for sepsis, including pancreatitis, pneumonia, and a history of surgery. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is crucial to detect any signs of sepsis early.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's shock state may persist due to hypovolemia from third-spacing in pancreatitis. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and careful monitoring of hemodynamic parameters are necessary to maintain adequate organ perfusion.
4. Pancreatitis complications: The patient has necrotic pancreatitis, which carries the risk of further complications such as infected pancreatic necrosis or systemic spread of infection"

   24 Hour Events:
   -Lasix gtt in am got 3L off. Then stopped in afternoon to see how pt
   would diurese on his own which he continued to do at a slower rate
   -In afternoon, pt awakening and moving. HR and BP up. This resolved
   with bolus of fentanyl and placing pt back on propofol for sedation.
   Also at this time, trachea noted to not be midline. CXR showed no acute
   PTX, consolidations and in fact some slight resolution of pulm edema
   -stopped TPN. Continuing tube feeds
   -pulled back ETT 1cm
   -surgery recs no further imaging at this time. Pseudocyst may form but
   likely will be sterile so do not touch it to drain it as this would
   cause infection.

   - f/u ERCP recs and [**Doctor First Name 91**] reccs
   -continuing TF today. No further need for TPN at this time.
   #Alkalosis: Primary metabolic and presumably due to large volume of
   gastric contents being removed by suction.  This will remain necessary
   as long as ileus prevents natural drainage of stomach though bowel
   sounds are encouraging.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure following an aspiration event prior to an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak. The patient had bilious fluid in the lung at the time of anesthesia bronchoscopy. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has also been diagnosed with pancreatitis and cholangitis. The patient's condition is complicated by metabolic alkalosis, rising alkaline phosphatase levels, anemia, and a potential pseudocyst formation. The patient's sedation will be turned off in the afternoon to reassess his mental status changes.

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, which is a common complication in patients who are mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours.
2. Pseudocyst formation: The patient may develop a pseudocyst due to the pancreatitis. Surgery has recommended against draining it as it could cause infection.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has primary metabolic alkalosis due to the large volume of gastric contents being removed by suction. This will need to be monitored and managed.
4. Rising alkaline phosphatase levels: The patient's alkaline phosphatase levels are rising, which may indicate biliary distension s/p stent"

   24 Hour Events:
   -Lasix gtt in am got 3L off. Then stopped in afternoon to see how pt
   would diurese on his own which he continued to do at a slower rate
   -In afternoon, pt awakening and moving. HR and BP up. This resolved
   with bolus of fentanyl and placing pt back on propofol for sedation.
   Also at this time, trachea noted to not be midline. CXR showed no acute
   PTX, consolidations and in fact some slight resolution of pulm edema
   -stopped TPN. Continuing tube feeds
   -pulled back ETT 1cm
   -surgery recs no further imaging at this time. Pseudocyst may form but
   likely will be sterile so do not touch it to drain it as this would
   cause infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year-old male with a history of depression transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   s/p aspiration prior to being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct
   leak.
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:  The patient was intubated
   after becoming significantly hypoxic after his ERCP.    He vomited,
   aspirated and had bilious fluid in the lung at the time of anesthesia
   bronchoscopy.  Has been successfully advanced to pressure support and
   ABG
s stable.  We will continue on pressure support and continue to
   monitor ABG
s to follow.  Sputum E. coli seemed unlikely to be a VAP
   organism initially but given defervescing on meropenem it is possible
   this is a VAP.
   - cont vanco/meropenem for now to cover GI and aspiration. ID aware and
   ok with double covering for anaerobes although surgery not sure about
   this.
   - Cont lasix gtt today  to diurese as tolerated with goal MAP>60.
   Checking Pm lytes
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to combination of hypovolemia from
   third-spacing in setting of pancreatitis and now imporoved.  His
   relative hypovolemia has previously been manifested by tachycardia and
   then by hypotension.
   - IVF resuscitation with LR PRN, currently good BP
   - management of pancreatitis, sepsis as described below
   - CVP goal of 12, CVO2 goal of >70%
   - Will transfuse for Hct < 26
   - continue vanc/meropenem (day 1 = [**1-8**] for vanc and [**1-15**] for
   meropenem)
   - consider coverage of VRE or fungus if patient decompensates (fever
   curve currently trending down and perhaps slightly better)
    # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) with neg
   ERCP ([**12-31**] at [**Hospital1 5**]) s/p lap chole ([**1-5**]) c/b bile leak at OSH, and s/p
   ERCP for stent for leak c/b aspiration.  JP drain in place and draining
   bilious fluid.  Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal
   CT on [**2109-1-9**] and unchanged on scan on [**2109-1-14**].
   - has not needed IVF for several days but will give PRN for hypotension
   - continue vanc/meropenem though likely will not affect course of
   pancreatitis
   - f/u ERCP recs and [**Doctor First Name 91**] reccs
   -continuing TF today. No further need for TPN at this time.
   #Alkalosis
   # Rising AlkP
    #Anemia: Basically stable despite  concern for hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis previously. Will monitor daily
    # Comm:  Social work has identified a few family members- HCP in
   brother [**Name (NI) **] in [**Name (NI) 507**].  We are also in communication with his surgeon,
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4567**], who performed lap chole at OSH ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4624**] (c) )

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and subsequently became significantly hypoxic after vomiting and aspirating bilious fluid. He was intubated and has been on mechanical ventilation with pressure support.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure/aspiration pneumonia: The patient initially experienced severe hypoxia due to aspiration during the ERCP procedure. He was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation. His ABG (arterial blood gas) values are stable, and he will continue on pressure support while monitoring ABG values.

2. Shock: The patient likely has shock secondary to hypovolemia from third-spacing in the setting of pancreatitis. His relative hypovolemia has been manifested by tachycardia and hypotension. IV fluid resuscitation with LR (normal saline) will be continued as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient had gallstone pancreatitis and underwent an ERCP, which was unsuccessful. He then had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy but developed a bile leak. Another ERCP was performed for stent placement, but the patient aspirated during the procedure. He has a partially necrotic pancreatitis as visualized on abdominal CT scans. Pancreatitis management includes monitoring for signs of complications,"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o with ascending cholangitis tx here for ERCP [**12-31**], no stone found
   so sent back to OSH.  Had lap chole ([**1-5**]) at OSH with resulting bile
   leak - sent back here for ERCP and stenting ([**1-8**]).  During ERCP,
   patient aspirated - difficult time oxygenating - bronch showed bile in
   right main stem.  Now with severe necrotic pacreatitis/sepsis.
    # Shock:  Likely due to sepsis/hemorrhagic pancreatitis.    BP now
   stable with severe volume overload.  Persistent fevers likely due to
   severe pancreatitis, but now decreasing on meropenem.
   - Lasix gtt with gentle diuresis if tolerated.
   - Change to vanc (D10/10)/[**Last Name (un) **] (D4/10) based on recent culture results
   - Would add fungal coverage if dramatically worsens
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Initially growing E. coli
   sensitive to Zosyn out of sputum, now growing E. coli resistent to
   Zosyn, sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **] with persistent thick secretions.  Main cause
   of persistent resp failure likely volume overload/pulmonary edema
   coupled with failure to wake up.
   - Continue PS 5/5
   - Consider SBT in am
   - Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for e.coli aspiration PNA
   - Diuresis on lasix gtt
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CT with evidence of severe
   necrosis/hemorrhage.
   - ERCP/surgery following.
   - Increased air in biliary system on CT, d/w surgery

   # FEN:  Dophoff found to be in stomach, now that repositioned, lower
   volume suctioning of tube feeds, but still 1L out through tube
   yesterday.
   - D/w surgery
   #Altered mental status:  Head CT negative, but waking up very slowly.
   - Follow off sedation.
   #Hiccups: The patient had severe hiccups causing respiratory alkalosis
   as each hiccup triggering vent.  Already on midaz gtt.  etiology of
   hiccups concerning for diaphragmatic process, including abscess or

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ascending cholangitis who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, during which he aspirated and developed severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis. 

The patient's current medical conditions include shock (likely due to sepsis and hemorrhagic pancreatitis), hypoxic respiratory failure/aspiration pneumonia, gallstone pancreatitis, feeding tube misplacement, altered mental status, and hiccups. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's respiratory status due to volume overload and pulmonary edema, persistent fevers, septic shock, worsening of pancreatitis, and further respiratory failure. 

The plan of care includes diuresis with Lasix to manage fluid overload, changing antibiotics based on recent culture results, considering a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) in the morning, continuing mechanical ventilation, and further evaluation by surgery for possible ERCP or other interventions."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o with ascending cholangitis tx here for ERCP [**12-31**], no stone found
   so sent back to OSH.  Had lap chole ([**1-5**]) at OSH with resulting bile
   leak - sent back here for ERCP and stenting ([**1-8**]).  During ERCP,
   patient aspirated - difficult time oxygenating - bronch showed bile in
   right main stem.  Now with severe necrotic pacreatitis/sepsis.
    # Shock:  Likely due to sepsis/hemorrhagic pancreatitis.    BP now
   stable with severe volume overload.  Persistent fevers likely due to
   severe pancreatitis, but now decreasing on meropenem.
   - Lasix gtt with gentle diuresis if tolerated.
   - Change to vanc (D9/10)/[**Last Name (un) **] (D3/10) based on recent culture results
   - Would add fungal coverage if dramatically worsens
   # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:  Initially growing E. coli
   sensitive to Zosyn out of sputum, now growing E. coli resistent to
   Zosyn, sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **] with persistent thick secretions.  Main cause
   of persistent resp failure likely volume overload/pulmonary edema
   coupled with failure to wake up.
   - Continue PS
 wean as tolerated
   - Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] for e.coli aspiration PNA
   - Diuresis on lasix gtt/pressors
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:  CT with evidence of severe
   necrosis/hemorrhage.
   - ERCP/surgery following.
   - Increased air in biliary system on CT, d/w surgery
 no intervention
   indicated
   # FEN:  Dophoff found to be in stomach, explaining large volume
   suctioning of tube feeds.
   - Reposition Dophoff
   #Altered mental status:  Head CT negative, but waking up very slowly.
   - Follow off sedation.
   #Hiccups: The patient had severe hiccups causing respiratory alkalosis
   as each hiccup triggering vent.  Already on midaz gtt.  etiology of
   hiccups concerning for diaphragmatic process, including abscess or
   misplaced drain, but CT negative. Improved with thorazine.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ascending cholangitis, who presented for ERCP but no stone was found. He subsequently underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at OSH due to a bile leak and was then transferred back to the hospital for ERCP and stenting. During the ERCP, the patient aspirated, resulting in severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis.

The patient's current condition includes shock likely due to sepsis and hemorrhagic pancreatitis, as well as hypoxic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. The respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload and pulmonary edema, coupled with the failure to wake up. The patient also has gallstone pancreatitis with severe necrosis and hemorrhage, for which ERCP and surgery have been planned. Additionally, the patient experienced hiccups causing respiratory alkalosis, which improved with thorazine.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.0°C (98.6°F)
- Heart rate: 83 bpm (80-124 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 127/72 mmHg (91/60-165/88 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (20-35 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on supplemental oxygen

The patient's laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 10.6 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 11"

   24 Hour Events:
   - stopped vancomycin because he had completed course
   - put on pressure support and sedation lightened; was able to follow
   simple commands in afternoon with RSBI of 50 but was uncomfortable so
   sedation increased overnight
   - got KUB because surgery concerned about location of duboff and OGTs.
   KUB read by radiologist overnight as: OG tube is coiled in the fundus
   of the stomach. Dobhoff tube appears to coil on itself at the pylorus
   and no longer appears post pyloric. The stomach is moderately dilated.
   There is no gross obstruction.
   - OGT drained 3L of fluid but looked bilious and not like TFs so
   thinking was that duboff was still post pyloric but patient may have
   bowel obstruction given high output.  Discussion with surgery initially
   suggested no new reccs but will continue to discuss

   53 year-old male with a history of depression transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   s/p aspiration prior to being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct
   leak.
    # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:  The patient was
   intubated after becoming significantly hypoxic after his ERCP.    He
   vomited, aspirated and had bilious fluid in the lung at the time of
   anesthesia bronchoscopy.  Has been successfully advanced to pressure
   support and ABG
s stable.  We will continue on pressure support and
   continue to monitor ABG
s to follow.  Sputum E. coli in context of
   fever and perhaps increased infiltrate led to VAP diagnosis.
   Significant pulmonary edema also undoubtedly contributing to
   respiratory distress
   -Meropenem (day [**3-8**]) for VAP and also to cover possible GI process
   -If patient has improved MS during afternoon trial off sedation could
   consider SBT in AM and possible extubation tomorrow.
   - Cont lasix gtt today  to diurese as tolerated with goal MAP>60.
   Checking Pm lytes
    # Shock:  Likely due to possible combination of SIRS and sepsis from
   pancreatitis and cholangitis respectively.  Now resolved.  -
    # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) with neg
   ERCP ([**12-31**] at [**Hospital1 5**]) s/p lap chole ([**1-5**]) c/b bile leak at OSH, and s/p
   ERCP for stent for leak c/b aspiration.  JP drain in place and draining
   bilious fluid.  Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal
   CT on [**2109-1-9**] and unchanged on scan on [**2109-1-14**].
   - has not needed IVF for several days but will give PRN for hypotension
   - Completed 10 day course of vanc to cover enterococcus in context of
   instrumentation and severe cholangitis
   - f/u ERCP recs and [**Doctor First Name 91**] reccs
   -continuing TF today. No further need for TPN at this time.
    #Alkalosis: Primary metabolic and presumably due to large volume of
   gastric contents being removed by suction.  This will remain necessary
   as long as ileus prevents natural drainage of stomach though bowel
   sounds are encouraging.
   -Discuss w/ surgery re: concern for duration of ileus and large gastric
   suction volume
   # Rising AlkP: Monitor and consider repeat ultrasound if continues to
   rise due to known biliary distension s/p stent
   #MS changes: Patient finally had some signs of awakening and purposeful
   movements yesterday.  Will turn off sedation this afternoon and
   reassess.
    #Anemia: Basically stable despite  concern for hemorrhagic

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU for aspiration prior to undergoing an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak. The patient became significantly hypoxic and was intubated. He was diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also had shock, likely due to sepsis from pancreatitis and cholangitis. He was previously treated for severe cholangitis and completed a 10-day course of vancomycin. The patient had gallstone pancreatitis, which required a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole) and resulted in a bile leak. An ERCP was performed for stent placement, but the patient aspirated during the procedure. A jejunal (JP) drain was placed and is draining bilious fluid. The patient's pancreatitis is partially necrotic, as seen on abdominal CT scans. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, requiring mechanical ventilation and pressure support.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient aspirated during the ERCP procedure, leading to pneumonia.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient developed pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation.
4. Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock due to pancreatitis and cholangitis.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient had gallstone pancreatitis, which required"

   thinking was that duboff was still post pyloric but patient may have
   bowel obstruction given high output.  Discussion with surgery initially

   Assessment and Plan
   53 year-old male with a history of depression transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   s/p aspiration prior to being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct
   leak.
    # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:  The patient was
   intubated after becoming significantly hypoxic after his ERCP.    He
   vomited, aspirated and had bilious fluid in the lung at the time of
   anesthesia bronchoscopy.  Has been successfully advanced to pressure
   support and ABG
s stable.  We will continue on pressure support and
   continue to monitor ABG
s to follow.  Sputum E. coli in context of
   fever and perhaps increased infiltrate led to VAP diagnosis.
   Significant pulmonary edema also undoubtedly contributing to
   respiratory distress
   -Meropenem (day [**3-8**]) for VAP and also to cover possible GI process
   -If patient has improved MS during afternoon trial off sedation could
   consider SBT in AM and possible extubation tomorrow.
   - Cont lasix gtt today  to diurese as tolerated with goal MAP>60.
   Checking Pm lytes
    # Shock:  Likely due to possible combination of SIRS and sepsis from
   pancreatitis and cholangitis respectively.  Now resolved.  -
    # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) with neg
   ERCP ([**12-31**] at [**Hospital1 5**]) s/p lap chole ([**1-5**]) c/b bile leak at OSH, and s/p
   ERCP for stent for leak c/b aspiration.  JP drain in place and draining
   bilious fluid.  Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal
   CT on [**2109-1-9**] and unchanged on scan on [**2109-1-14**].
   - has not needed IVF for several days but will give PRN for hypotension
   - Completed 10 day course of vanc to cover enterococcus in context of
   instrumentation and severe cholangitis
   - f/u ERCP recs and [**Doctor First Name 91**] reccs
   -continuing TF today. No further need for TPN at this time.
    #Alkalosis: Primary metabolic and presumably due to large volume of
   gastric contents being removed by suction.  This will remain necessary
   as long as ileus prevents natural drainage of stomach though bowel
   sounds are encouraging.
   -Discuss w/ surgery re: concern for duration of ileus and large gastric
   suction volume
   # Rising AlkP: Monitor and consider repeat ultrasound if continues to
   rise due to known biliary distension s/p stent
   #MS changes: Patient finally had some signs of awakening and purposeful
   movements yesterday.  Will turn off sedation this afternoon and
   reassess.
    #Anemia: Basically stable despite  concern for hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis previously. Will monitor daily
   # Comm:  Social work has identified a few family members- HCP in
   brother [**Name (NI) **] in [**Name (NI) 507**].  We are also in communication with his surgeon,
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4567**], who performed lap chole at OSH ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4624**] (c) )

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression, who was transferred to the ICU after an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak. The patient's main complaints are cholangitis and hypoxic respiratory failure. 

The patient has been intubated and placed on pressure support due to significant hypoxia following the ERCP procedure. He aspirated during anesthesia bronchoscopy and had bilious fluid in the lungs. 

The patient's condition has been stable, and he has been advanced to pressure support. His ABG results are stable, and he is expected to continue on pressure support while monitoring ABG levels. 

A diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was made due to the presence of E. coli in the sputum, fever, and increased infiltrates. 

The patient's shock is likely due to a combination of SIRS and sepsis from pancreatitis and cholangitis. However, this condition has now resolved. 

The patient has gallstone pancreatitis with a negative ERCP at Hospital 1, followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a bile leak at OSH. An ERCP was performed for a stent to address the leak, but the patient aspirated. 

A joint pancreatic drain is in place, draining bilious fluid. Partially necrotic pancreatitis was visualized on an abdominal CT scan on 1/9/2109 and remained unchanged on a scan on 1/"

   24 Hour Events:
   - stopped vancomycin because he had completed course
   - put on pressure support and sedation lightened; was able to follow
   simple commands in afternoon with RSBI of 50 but was uncomfortable so
   sedation increased overnight
   - got KUB because surgery concerned about location of duboff and OGTs.
   KUB read by radiologist overnight as: OG tube is coiled in the fundus
   of the stomach. Dobhoff tube appears to coil on itself at the pylorus
   and no longer appears post pyloric. The stomach is moderately dilated.
   There is no gross obstruction.
   - OGT drained 3L of fluid but looked bilious and not like TFs so
   thinking was that duboff was still post pyloric but patient may have
   bowel obstruction given high output.  Discussion with surgery initially
   suggested no new reccs but will continue to discuss

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was transferred to the ICU after an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak. He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration during anesthesia. The patient has been intubated and placed on pressure support. He is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with meropenem. His condition is also complicated by shock, pancreatitis, cholangitis, metabolic alkalosis, and anemia. The patient's mental status changes are attributed to persistent sedation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bowel obstruction: The patient's abdominal CT scan showed partially necrotic pancreatitis. This can lead to bowel obstruction due to inflammation and scarring.
2. Sepsis: The patient has multiple infections including VAP, cholangitis, and pancreatitis, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further respiratory failure if not adequately supported.
4. Prolonged ICU stay: The patient's complex medical condition and complications may result in a prolonged ICU stay.
5. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube, but there is a risk of malnutrition due to prolonged enteral feeding and ileus.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT.

   24 Hour Events:
   - stopped vancomycin because he had completed course
   - put on pressure support and sedation lightened; was able to follow
   simple commands in afternoon with RSBI of 50 but was uncomfortable so
   sedation increased overnight
   - got KUB because surgery concerned about location of duboff and OGTs.
   KUB read by radiologist overnight as: OG tube is coiled in the fundus
   of the stomach. Dobhoff tube appears to coil on itself at the pylorus
   and no longer appears post pyloric. The stomach is moderately dilated.
   There is no gross obstruction.
   - OGT drained 3L of fluid but looked bilious and not like TFs so
   thinking was that duboff was still post pyloric but patient may have
   bowel obstruction given high output.  Discussion with surgery initially
   suggested no new reccs but will continue to discuss

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU for aspiration prior to an ERCP for bile duct leak.
- The patient became hypoxic after the ERCP and was intubated. He vomited, aspirated, and had bilious fluid in the lung during anesthesia bronchoscopy.
- The patient has been successfully advanced to pressure support and ABG is stable. He will continue on pressure support and continue to monitor ABG to follow.
- Sputum E. coli in the context of fever and perhaps increased infiltrate led to VAP diagnosis. Significant pulmonary edema also undoubtedly contributing to respiratory distress.
- Meropenem (day [**3-8**]) has been started for VAP and also to cover possible GI process.
- The patient is still producing 9L of fluid positive for length of stay and definite pulmonary edema on CXR. Bolus furosemide will be used to aim for another 1-2 L negative today, and PM lytes will be checked.
- SBT ABG remained stable, and extubation will be attempted this morning.
- The patient likely had shock due to possible combination of SIRS and sepsis from pancreatitis and cholangitis respectively. Now resolved.
- The patient had gallstone pancreatitis with negative ERCP at [**Hospital1 5**] s/p lap chole ([**1-5**]) c/b bile leak at OSH, and s/p ERCP for stent for leak c/b aspiration.
- JP drain is in place and draining bilious fluid. Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal CT on [**2109-1-9**] and unchanged on scan on [**2109-1-14**].

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o with ascending cholangitis tx here for ERCP [**12-31**], no stone found
   so sent back to OSH.  Had lap chole ([**1-5**]) at OSH with resulting bile
   leak - sent back here for ERCP and stenting ([**1-8**]).  During ERCP,
   patient aspirated - difficult time oxygenating - bronch showed bile in
   right main stem.  Now with severe necrotic pacreatitis/sepsis.
    # Shock:
   - resolved
   -  BP now stable with volume overload
   - Persistent fevers likely due to severe pancreatitis
    # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration pna:
   - growing E. coli resistent to Zosyn, sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **] with persistent
   thick secretions
   - Main cause of persistent resp failure likely volume
   overload/pulmonary edema coupled with failure to wake up.
   - SBT in am, eval for extubation
   - Diuresis
   # Gallstone pancreatitis:
   - CT with evidence of severe necrosis/hemorrhage.
   - ERCP/surgery following.
   - Increased air in biliary system on CT, d/w surgery
 no intervention
   indicated

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old individual admitted to the ICU for severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis. The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and has undergone multiple interventions including ERCP, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and stenting. 

The patient's current condition includes shock (resolved), hypoxic respiratory failure/Aspiration pneumonia, gallstone pancreatitis, feeding tube issues, altered mental status, and hiccups. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis due to severe necrotic pancreatitis. If not properly managed, there is a risk of progression to multiorgan failure and septic shock.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. This condition can worsen if the patient does not improve oxygenation and clearance of secretions. It may lead to further respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

3. Pancreatitis complications: Severe necrotic pancreatitis increases the risk of local and systemic complications. These may include abscess formation, infection, pancreatic fistula, or hemorrhage. Surgical intervention might be required in some cases.

4. Organ dysfunction: Sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction can occur if the underlying infection is not controlled. This may lead to renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, cardiovascular collapse, or other organ dysfunctions.

5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to sepsis, sedation, or other factors. Close monitoring is essential to ensure the patient's safety and ability to follow commands.

6. Hiccups: Although the hiccups have resolved, they can recur and may interfere with the patient's ability to wean off mechanical ventilation.

7. Feeding tube issues: The feeding tube has been misplaced in the stomach, which can cause complications such as aspiration pneumonia. Ensuring proper tube placement is crucial for safe enteral nutrition.

Overall, the patient's critical illness requires close monitoring and prompt management of the identified complications to improve outcomes."

   53 year-old male with a history of depression transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   s/p aspiration prior to being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct
   leak.
    # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:  The patient was
   intubated after becoming significantly hypoxic after his ERCP.    He
   vomited, aspirated and had bilious fluid in the lung at the time of
   anesthesia bronchoscopy.  Has been successfully advanced to pressure
   support and ABG
s stable.  We will continue on pressure support and
   continue to monitor ABG
s to follow.  Sputum E. coli in context of
   fever and perhaps increased infiltrate led to VAP diagnosis.
   Significant pulmonary edema also undoubtedly contributing to
   respiratory distress
   -Meropenem (day [**3-8**]) for VAP and also to cover possible GI process
   -Overall still 9L positive for length of stay and definite pulmonary
   edema on CXR, will use bolus furosemide to aim for another 1-2 L
   negative today, will check PM lytes
   -SBT ABG remained stable, will attempt extubation this AM
    # Shock:  Likely due to possible combination of SIRS and sepsis from
   pancreatitis and cholangitis respectively.  Now resolved.
    # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) with neg
   ERCP ([**12-31**] at [**Hospital1 5**]) s/p lap chole ([**1-5**]) c/b bile leak at OSH, and s/p
   ERCP for stent for leak c/b aspiration.  JP drain in place and draining
   bilious fluid.  Partially necrotic pancreatitis visualized on abdominal
   CT on [**2109-1-9**] and unchanged on scan on [**2109-1-14**].
   - has not needed IVF for several days but will give PRN for hypotension
   - Completed 10 day course of vanc to cover enterococcus in context of
   instrumentation and severe cholangitis
   - f/u ERCP recs and [**Doctor First Name 91**] reccs
   -holding TF today as tube in stomach, will attempt to readvance and
   reassess this PM
    #Alkalosis: Primary metabolic and presumably due to large volume of
   gastric contents being removed by suction.  This will remain necessary
   as long as ileus prevents natural drainage of stomach though bowel
   sounds are encouraging.
   -Discuss w/ surgery re: concern for duration of ileus and large gastric
   suction volume
   # LFT
s : Stable with eleavated [**Last Name (LF) 4776**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] monitor
   #MS changes: Patient awake and following commands, it appears that a
   large part of mental status changes just due to persistent sedation,
   will reevaluate after extubation
    #Anemia: Basically stable despite  concern for hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis previously. Will monitor daily
   # Comm:  Social work has identified a few family members- HCP in
   brother [**Name (NI) **] in [**Name (NI) 507**].  We are also in communication with his surgeon,

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU for cholangitis, hypoxic respiratory failure, and aspiration pneumonia. He underwent an ERCP procedure but became significantly hypoxic and required intubation. The patient vomited, aspirated bilious fluid, and had a bile duct leak. He was transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current condition includes impaired skin integrity, metabolic acidosis, altered mental status (not delirium), acute pancreatitis, pneumonia due to aspiration, and calculous cholecystitis. He is still intubated and on pressure support with stable ABGs. The sputum culture showed E. coli, leading to the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has pulmonary edema, and his lungs are still positive for fluid.

The patient likely experienced shock due to sepsis from pancreatitis and cholangitis but has since resolved. He has gallstone pancreatitis with a negative ERCP performed at another hospital. He also had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with subsequent bile leak at the operating site. An ERCP was done for stent placement, but the patient aspirated during the procedure. A joint pancreatic drainage (JP) drain is in place and draining bilious fluid. Partially necrotic pancreatitis was visualized on abdominal CT scans.

The patient's metabolic alkalosis is primarily due to a large"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with cholangitis and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated but extubated in the late morning. However, the patient developed altered mental status with confusion about location and agitation, leading to the placement of soft restraints overnight to prevent tube removal. The patient has also been experiencing a large amount of NG output and started having bowel movements. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is 37.2°C, heart rate is 95 bpm, blood pressure is 135/73 mmHg, respiratory rate is 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 469 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and SpO2 at 4L. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.51, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 300, and ventilation (Ve) of 11.5 L/min.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished and overweight/obese. The cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds (S1 and S2"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression, who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing aspiration prior to an ERCP for a bile duct leak. He is currently being treated for VAP and pulmonary edema. The patient's respiratory status is still suboptimal but he is ventilating and oxygenating well off the ventilator. He has been given meropenem for VAP and to cover possible GI processes. His urine output has been good, and he is being closely monitored for fluid balance. 

The patient likely experienced shock due to SIRS and sepsis from pancreatitis and cholangitis, which has now resolved. He also has necrotic pancreatitis, and surgical intervention may be necessary in the future. The patient appears to have a partial gastric outlet obstruction with large NG outputs, presumed to be secondary to pancreatic inflammation. He is NPO and on low intermittent suction. 

The patient's mental status has changed since extubation, with confusion and agitation. No focal findings were observed, and this seems most consistent with anemia. Possible ICU psychosis and the effects of sedating medications may also be contributing factors. 

Anemia is being monitored daily, and social work has identified some family members to communicate with. The patient's surgeon has been informed about his condition. He is receiving prophylactic heparin and famotidine. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU care.

    # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:  The patient was
   intubated after becoming significantly hypoxic after his ERCP.    He
   vomited, aspirated and had bilious fluid in the lung at the time of
   anesthesia bronchoscopy.  Has been successfully advanced to pressure
   support and ABG
s stable.  We will continue on pressure support and
   continue to monitor ABG
s to follow.  Sputum E. coli in context of
   fever and perhaps increased infiltrate led to VAP diagnosis.
   Significant pulmonary edema also undoubtedly contributing to
   respiratory distress

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU after undergoing an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak. He presented with cholangitis, hypoxic respiratory failure, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient required invasive ventilation but has since been extubated. He experienced altered mental status, confusion, and agitation but showed improvement with the administration of haloperidol. The patient also had persistent ileus and required large-volume gastric suctioning, leading to metabolic alkalosis. He had acute pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis, and pneumonia. His laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's vital signs were stable, and he was receiving various medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the initial hypoxic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia, the patient is at risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and pulmonary edema.
2. Infection: The patient has already developed pneumonia and pancreatitis, which can lead to severe infections. There is a risk of developing secondary infections, including hospital-acquired infections.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's persistent ileus and large-volume gastric suctioning can lead to gastrointestinal complications such as stress ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, and aspiration.
4. Liver Dysfunction: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ascending cholangitis. He was admitted for ERCP but no stone was found, so he was sent back to OSH for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole) with resulting bile leak. He was then referred back to the hospital for ERCP and stenting. During the ERCP, the patient aspirated and had difficulty oxygenating, with bronchoscopy showing bile in the right mainstem. He is now experiencing severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis.

The patient has resolved shock but remains at risk for recurrent episodes due to persistent fevers (presumed pancreatitis) that appear to be resolving. He also has hypoxic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia, with a growing E. coli infection resistant to Zosyn but sensitive to another antibiotic. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently on minimal oxygen via nasal cannula. His gallstone pancreatitis is severe with evidence of necrosis and hemorrhage on CT, requiring further intervention.

Additionally, the patient had a feeding tube (FEN) placed but it was found to be in the stomach instead of the small intestine, leading to adjustments being made. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been initiated. The patient's altered mental status is improving but he still experiences some confusion. His hiccups have resolved.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through T"

   leak.
     # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:  Patient s/p course of
   treatment for aspiration though currently being treated for VAP.  This
   and significant pulmonary edema continue to be main contributors to
   less than optimal respiratory status though patient is ventilating and
   oxygenating well off ventilator.
   -Meropenem (day [**4-7**]) for VAP and also to cover possible GI process
   -Patient making good UOP and was almost 6L negative yesterday,  will
   evaluate  I&O balance this afternoon and if persistently positive/equal
   would give small dose (furosemide 10 mg IV) diuretic aiming for goal of
   -500 to 1000 ml for day.
    # Shock:  Likely due to possible combination of SIRS and sepsis from
   pancreatitis and cholangitis respectively.  Now resolved.
    # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) as initial
   insult status post a complicated course of procedures and insults.  He
   now has known necrotic pancreatitis.  For the moment assumption is the
   necrotic material is stable and we are attempting to defer any invasive
   intervention at this time to avoid infecting that.  [**Month (only) 8**] need surgery
   after this has organized.
   -Rescan per surgery and may need surgical decompression of pseudocyst
   if this forms in the coming months.
   -NPO
   #Ileus: Patient appears to have partial gastric outlet obstruction with
   large NG outputs.  This is presumed due to functional obstruction
   secondary to pancreatic inflammation.
   -NPO
   -NG to low intermittent suction
    #MS changes: Patient  quite confused after extubation.  No focal
   findings and this seems most consistent w/ anemia.  Probably ICU
   psychosis and possible contribution of sedating medications deposited
   in fat or slow to break down in setting of  recovery from severe
   illness.

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis and cholangitis. He underwent an ERCP procedure but developed hypoxic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia prior to intubation. The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with meropenem. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 129/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated serum glucose levels. Other lab values such as creatinine, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits. 

The patient's physical examination reveals mild abdominal pain and dry mouth. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal movement and tone.

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,756 mL since 12 AM, indicating ongoing fluid loss. The patient's urine output has been good, with a total output of 1,345 mL since 12 AM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing aspiration prior to undergoing an ERCP for a bile duct leak. The patient has been treated for aspiration pneumonia and is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He continues to have difficulty with respiratory function due to significant pulmonary edema.

The patient has likely experienced shock, which has now resolved. He has gallstone pancreatitis with known necrotic pancreatitis. The necrotic material is assumed to be stable, and any invasive intervention is being deferred to avoid infection. The patient may require surgery after approximately 2 months to address a pseudocyst that may form.

The patient appears to have a partial gastric outlet obstruction with large NG outputs, which is presumed to be due to functional obstruction secondary to pancreatic inflammation. He is currently nil per os (NPO) with a nasogastric tube (NGT) to low intermittent suction.

The patient was confused after extubation but showed no focal findings. This confusion is most consistent with anemia and possibly ICU psychosis. However, the patient seems less communicative today, raising concerns about sepsis or a new infection. Blood cultures have been sent, and the central venous line has been replaced. Other tests, including urinalysis and pancreatic enzyme levels, are also being conducted.

The patient's anemia is stable despite previous concerns about hemorrhagic pancreatitis. His ICU care"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ascending cholangitis, who was admitted for ERCP but no stone was found. He underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at OSH and subsequently developed a bile leak. The patient was then sent back to the hospital for ERCP and stenting. During the ERCP procedure, the patient aspirated and had difficulty oxygenating, with bile present in the right mainstem bronchus. He subsequently developed severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis, which has since resolved and he was successfully extubated over the weekend.

The patient's current medical conditions include shock, which has resolved with stable blood pressure and volume overload, hypoxic respiratory failure/Aspiration pneumonia caused by a growing E. coli resistant to Zosyn but sensitive to Meropenem, delirium with fluctuating mental status, gallstone pancreatitis with evidence of severe necrosis/hemorrhage on CT, and altered mental status.

The patient is receiving TPN with lipids and has been started on Meropenem for VAP. Other interventions include PICC line placement, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and reevaluation of the need for restraints. The patient's code status is full code, and he remains in the ICU for further care."

During the ERCP procedure, the patient aspirated and developed severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis, which have since resolved and he was successfully extubated.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications, including shock, hypoxic respiratory failure/Aspiration pneumonia, delirium, gallstone pancreatitis, feeding intolerance, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Additionally, there is a growing E. coli resistant to Zosyn but sensitive to another antibiotic. This suggests the need for appropriate antibiotic treatment to prevent further infection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory function is necessary to prevent further respiratory complications.

3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing worsening mental status, leading to concerns over infection, worsening pancreatitis, or other etiology. Monitoring for signs of confusion or altered mental status is important to address promptly.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis with evidence of severe necrosis/hemorrh"

   leak.
    # Hypoxic resp failure/Aspiration Pneumonia:  Patient s/p course of
   treatment for aspiration though currently being treated for VAP.  This
   and significant pulmonary edema continue to be main contributors to
   less than optimal respiratory status though patient is ventilating and
   oxygenating well off ventilator.
   -Meropenem (day [**6-7**]) for VAP and also to cover possible GI process
   -Will continue to aim for goal of -500 to 1000 ml daily
    # Shock:  Likely due to possible combination of SIRS and sepsis from
   pancreatitis and cholangitis respectively.  Now resolved.
   # Pancreatitis:  Patient had gall stone pancreatitis ([**12-30**]) as initial
   insult status post a complicated course of procedures and insults.  He
   now has known necrotic pancreatitis.  For the moment assumption is the
   necrotic material is stable and we are attempting to defer any invasive
   intervention at this time to avoid infecting that.  [**Month (only) 8**] need surgery
   after this has organized.
   -Rescan per surgery and may need surgical decompression of pseudocyst
   if this forms in the coming months.
   -NPO with NGT to suction for now
    #Ileus: Patient appears to have partial gastric outlet obstruction
   with large NG outputs.  This is presumed due to functional obstruction

   -NPO
   -NG to low intermittent suction
    #MS changes: Patient  quite confused after extubation.  No focal

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU for aspiration prior to being intubated for an ERCP for bile duct leak. He has been treated for hypoxic respiratory failure/aspiration pneumonia and is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's main contributors to less than optimal respiratory status are significant pulmonary edema and treatment for VAP. 

The patient was likely in shock due to possible combination of SIRS and sepsis from pancreatitis and cholangitis, but it is now resolved. He has necrotic pancreatitis and will need surgery in about a month if necessary. The patient is currently NPO with an NGT to suction. 

The patient appears to have a partial gastric outlet obstruction with large NG outputs, presumed to be due to functional obstruction secondary to pancreatic inflammation. 

The patient was quite confused after extubation, with no focal findings and this seems most consistent with anemia. It is also possible that ICU psychosis and possible contribution of sedating medications deposited in fat or slow to break down in the setting of recovery from severe illness are contributing factors. 

The patient's anemia is basically stable despite concerns for hemorrhagic pancreatitis previously.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of depression who was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient had undergone an ERCP procedure for a bile duct leak and subsequently experienced aspiration, leading to intubation. 

Current Assessment and Plan:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which is likely due to immobility and poor nutritional status.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient is experiencing metabolic acidosis, possibly as a result of the ongoing inflammatory response and respiratory failure.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is presenting with altered mental status, which may be attributed to sepsis, new infection, or the effects of sedating medications.
4. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, likely caused by gallstones (gallstone pancreatitis). The pancreatitis has resulted in necrotic changes and the formation of a pseudocyst, requiring surgical decompression in the coming months.
5. Pneumonia: The patient developed pneumonia secondary to aspiration, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is currently being treated with meropenem.
6. Cholecystitis: The patient also has cholecystitis, which is associated with the gallstone pancreatitis.
7. Ileus: The patient appears to have a partial gastric outlet obstruction, likely due to functional obstruction secondary to pancreatic inflammation.
8. Anemia: The patient is experiencing an"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ascending cholangitis, treated here for ERCP, no stone found, so sent back to OSH. He had laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole) at OSH with resulting bile leak, sent back here for ERCP and stenting. During ERCP, the patient aspirated, had difficulty oxygenating, bronchoscopy showed bile in the right main stem. Then developed severe necrotizing pancreatitis/sepsis, now resolved and extubated.

The patient has several medical issues including shock, which has resolved, hypoxic respiratory failure/aspiration pneumonia, delirium, gallstone pancreatitis, and feeding tube intolerance.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Bile leak: The patient had a bile leak after his laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which was causing the need for an ERCP and stenting. If not managed properly, this could lead to ongoing fluid loss, infection, and further complications.

2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient aspirated during the ERCP procedure, leading to aspiration pneumonia. This can result in respiratory distress, sepsis, and other complications if not treated effectively.

3. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient developed severe necrotizing pancreatitis, which is a life-threatening condition. Complications can include systemic inflammation, organ failure, infection, and the need for further interventions such as debrid"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of ascending cholangitis who was admitted for an ERCP procedure. During the ERCP, the patient aspirated and developed severe necrotic pancreatitis and sepsis. The patient has since been extubated and is currently being weaned off the ventilator. The patient also had a bile leak following a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at another hospital, which required another ERCP and stenting. The patient's condition is improving, but there are several potential medical complications that could arise. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient had aspiration pneumonia and is still on minimal oxygen via nasal cannula. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the patient develops further lung infections or has difficulty weaning off the ventilator.

2. Delirium: The patient has been experiencing fluctuating mental status and delirium. It is important to monitor and manage this condition to prevent complications such as falls, medication errors, and increased risk of infections.

3. Infection: The patient has an ongoing infection caused by a growing E. coli that is resistant to Zosyn but sensitive to another antibiotic. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued to treat the infection and prevent further complications.

4. Bile leak: Although the patient had a bile leak that was managed with ERCP and stenting, there is still a possibility of recurrence or development of other biliary complications.
