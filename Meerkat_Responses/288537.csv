","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with mental retardation and a seizure disorder who was admitted to the ICU following a seizure and intubation for airway protection. He had been extubated in the emergency department but developed right hemiparesis. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to concerns about refractory hypokalemia. He received FFP overnight and is currently on multiple medications including ranitidine, RISS, ASA, Prozac, heparin, Colace, KCl, and Dilantin. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/72 mmHg to 115/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. Physical examination reveals right hemiparesis and upgoing toes on the right side. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, liver enzymes, and lactate levels. Imaging studies including a chest X-ray, head CT scan, and MRI brain are pending. The patient's condition is being closely monitored for potential complications such as infection (meningitis or HSV), stroke, or other causes of neurologic changes. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and antiepileptic drugs. Further diagnostic tests and interventions are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with mental retardation and a seizure disorder who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a seizure and intubation for airway protection. He was previously treated at another hospital for refractory hypokalemia and was transferred to the current unit for closer monitoring. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and anti-seizure medication. His vital signs are stable, but he has a high heart rate and low oxygen saturation. He is on mechanical ventilation and has been transfused with fresh frozen plasma overnight. The patient's neurological examination shows right hemiparesis and upgoing toes on the right side. His blood work reveals leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes, and he has low potassium levels. Imaging studies, including a head CT scan, have shown no evidence of a mass or bleed. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his immunocompromised state from mental retardation and the use of immunosuppressive medications.
2. Stroke: The patient's neurologic changes, such as right hemiparesis and upgoing toes, may indicate a possible stroke. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels require close monitoring and replacement to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
4. Transaminitis: The elevated liver enzymes may suggest"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with mental retardation who presents with fever and seizures, concerning for meningitis. He also has right-sided hemiparesis, positive troponin, and significant hypokalemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms of fever and seizures, along with his mental retardation, increase the suspicion for meningitis. Bacterial or viral causes should be considered, and further investigation such as a lumbar puncture (LP) is recommended.

2. Neurological deficits: The patient's right-sided hemiparesis may be due to meningitis/meningo-encephalitis or an infarct. An MRI/MRA follow-up is planned to further evaluate this.

3. Cardiac issues: The patient has positive troponin, indicating possible myocardial injury. An echo has already been performed, which showed no evidence of a recent myocardial infarction (wma). However, the patient may need to continue on ASA, anticoagulation as able, a fasting lipid panel, empiric atorvastatin, and beta-blocker as able.

4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated AST and ALT levels, which could indicate liver involvement. This requires further investigation and management.

5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has significant hypokalemia and requires aggressive IV and PO repletion with daily electrolytes"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with mental retardation presenting with fever, seizures, right-sided hemiparesis, positive troponin, and significant hypokalemia. The patient's symptoms suggest a possible case of meningitis, with both bacterial and viral causes being considered. The presence of seizures raises concern for a central nervous system infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis.

The patient's hemiparesis may be attributed to meningitis or meningo-encephalitis, particularly if caused by HSV. However, the distribution of the hemiparesis is also concerning for an infarct. To further evaluate this, an MRI/MRA has been recommended.

The positive troponin indicates a possible NSTEMI. An echocardiogram has been performed, showing no evidence of wall motion abnormality, which is reassuring.

The patient has elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and LDH, which could be indicative of liver dysfunction. This may require further investigation.

The patient's chronic requirement for potassium supplementation suggests the possibility of Bartter's or Gitelman's syndrome. Aggressive IV and PO repletion with electrolytes is advised.

The patient has a history of DVT/PE and is currently anticoagulated. However, due to the need for lumbar puncture (LP), anticoagulation will need to be reversed temporarily. Given the new onset of hemiparesis, ant"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old male with mental retardation who presents with fever and
   seizures concerning for meningitis, also R hemiparesis, positive
   troponin, and significant hypokalemia.
   # fever and seizures: Patient initially had status epilepticus in the
   setting of a fever.  Differential included meningitis, viral
   meningealencephalitis, systemic viral infection causing a fever and
   febrile seizure.  Patient has been on antibiotics and antiviral agents
   for two days without real improvement.  LP was attempted multiple times
   without success.  Patient had a head CT which was negative and a MRI
   which per neuro showed no evidence of stroke or infection. Neuro
   evaluated the patient and recommended an LP, however it is unclear if
   results of an LP would change management at this time.  In the setting
   of antibiotic use for two days, a negative cx and cell count would not
   be sufficent to stop antibiotics.
   - Will discuss further the need for Fluoro guided LP today with neuro.
   If needed, will give FFP to correct INR to goal < 1.5 prior to
   procedure at 13:00
   - continue vanc/ctx/amp/acyclovir for a 2 week course for empiric
   treatment of meningitis

   - f/u MRI results
   # R hemiparesis: [**Month (only) 51**] be due to menigitis/meningo-encephalitis, esp if
   due to HSV, but distribution is also concerning for infarct.  Neuro
   read of MRI did not find stroke.  Also in the differential is [**Doctor Last Name 2420**]
   paralysis, although this should have resolved by now.

   # Transaminitis: Patient was found to have a transaminitis with
   elevated AST, ALT, and LDH.  Given the patient

   may represent a systemic viral illness causing nonspeific inflammation
   of the liver.
   - Will check hepatitis serologies.
   - Contineu to trend LFTs
   # hypokalemia: has been needing 300 mEq/day at nursing home. Suspicious
   for Bartter's or Gitelman's syndromes, esp with the associated MR,
   although admitting team talked to Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] (PCP) who said this is
   relatively new requirement (past year or so, following an admission for
   UTI).
   - aggressive IV and PO repletion with tid lytes
   - Appreciate renal c/s, will f/u recs.
   # h/o DVT/PE: has been anticoagulated chronically as an outpt, but
   given need for LP, will have to reverse his anticoagulation. At the
   same time, his new hemiparesis is another indication for
   anticoagulation, so will plan to start heparin after LP

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with mental retardation presenting with fever and seizures, concerning for meningitis. He also has right-sided hemiparesis, positive troponin, and significant hypokalemia. The patient initially had status epilepticus in the setting of a fever, and the initial differential included meningitis, viral meningealencephalitis, systemic viral infection causing a fever and febrile seizure. The patient has been on antibiotics and antiviral agents for two days without real improvement.

A head CT was negative, and an MRI showed no evidence of stroke or infection. The neurology consultation recommended an LP, but it is unclear if the results of an LP would change management at this time. In the setting of antibiotic use for two days, a negative CSF analysis would not be sufficient to stop antibiotics.

The patient has been unable to provide history as he is unresponsive. No known drug allergies have been reported.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
- Heart rate: 105 bpm (range: 96-113 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 148/70 mmHg (range: 115/56-156/81 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute (range: 16-24 breaths per minute)

 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
   68 year-old male with mental retardation who presents with fever and
   seizures concerning for meningitis, also R hemiparesis, positive
   troponin, and significant hypokalemia.
   # fever and seizures: Patient initially had status epilepticus in the
   setting of a fever.  Differential included meningitis, viral
   meningealencephalitis, systemic viral infection causing a fever and
   febrile seizure.  Patient has been on antibiotics and antiviral agents
   for two days without real improvement.  LP was attempted multiple times
   without success.  Patient had a head CT which was negative and a MRI
   which per neuro showed no evidence of stroke or infection. Neuro reads
   MRI as significant for cervical stenosis which per their note is likely
   responsible for the rt sided hemiparesis. LP cancelled due to stenosis,
   also due to low yield of LP with his history of antibiotics.
   - Will discuss further with Neuro regarding recommendations following
   finding of cervical stenosis
   - Will continue vanc/ctx/amp/acyclovir for a 2 week course for empiric
   treatment of meningitis
   - EEG currently pending
   - f/u MRI final read
   # R hemiparesis: Initially differnetial included
   menigitis/meningo-encephalitis, esp if due to HSV, but distribution is
   also concerning for infarct. Following Neuro MRI C-spine read concern
   for cervical stenosis.
   - f/u MRI C-Spine final read
   - continue ASA for now due to concern for stroke
   - appreciate neurology consult, will f/u recs and discuss cervical
   stenosis findings.
   # positive troponin/NSTEMI: echo with no evidence of wma reassuring.
   LDL of 101, goal of 70.
   - continue asa, anticoagulation as able
   - empiric atorvastatin 80mg daily for now
   - start beta blocker as able
   # Transaminitis: Patient was found to have a transaminitis with
   elevated AST, ALT, and LDH.  Given the patient
s clinical history this
   may represent a systemic viral illness causing nonspeific inflammation
   of the liver. Currently transaminitis is trending down.
   - Will check hepatitis serologies.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   # hypokalemia: has been needing 300 mEq/day at nursing home. Suspicious
   for Bartter's or Gitelman's syndromes, esp with the associated MR,
   although admitting team talked to Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] (PCP) who said this is

   - aggressive IV and PO repletion with tid lytes
   - Appreciate renal c/s, will f/u recs.
   # h/o DVT/PE: has been anticoagulated chronically as an outpt, but
   given the initial need for LP pt was placed on Heparin gtt. Will
   restart pt on Heparing gtt, will likely restart pt on Coumadin, will
   wait for Neurology discussion. If pt needs an NSG intervention he will
   need to be off Coumadin.

 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
   68 year-old male with mental retardation who presents with fever and
   seizures concerning for meningitis, also R hemiparesis, positive
   troponin, and significant hypokalemia.
   # fever and seizures: Patient initially had status epilepticus in the
   setting of a fever.  Differential included meningitis, viral
   meningealencephalitis, systemic viral infection causing a fever and
   febrile seizure.  Patient has been on antibiotics and antiviral agents
   for two days without real improvement.  LP was attempted multiple times
   without success.  Patient had a head CT which was negative and a MRI
   which per neuro showed no evidence of stroke or infection. Neuro
   evaluated the patient and recommended an LP, however it is unclear if
   results of an LP would change management at this time.  In the setting
   of antibiotic use for two days, a negative cx and cell count would not
   be sufficent to stop antibiotics.
   - Will discuss further the need for Fluoro guided LP today with neuro.
   If needed, will give FFP to correct INR to goal < 1.5 prior to
   procedure at 13:00
   - continue vanc/ctx/amp/acyclovir for a 2 week course for empiric
   treatment of meningitis
   - EEG
   - f/u MRI results
   # R hemiparesis: [**Month (only) 51**] be due to menigitis/meningo-encephalitis, esp if
   due to HSV, but distribution is also concerning for infarct.  Neuro
   read of MRI did not find stroke.  Also in the differential is [**Doctor Last Name 2420**]
   paralysis, although this should have resolved by now.
   - f/u MRI/MRA
   - continue ASA for now due to concern for stroke
   - appreciate neurology consult, will f/u recs and discuss LP as above.
   # positive troponin/NSTEMI: echo with no evidence of wma reassuring.
   LDL of 101, goal of 70.
   - continue asa, anticoagulation as able
   - empiric atorvastatin 80mg daily for now
   - start beta blocker as able
   # Transaminitis: Patient was found to have a transaminitis with
   elevated AST, ALT, and LDH.  Given the patient
s clinical history this
   may represent a systemic viral illness causing nonspeific inflammation
   of the liver.
   - Will check hepatitis serologies.
   - Contineu to trend LFTs
   # hypokalemia: has been needing 300 mEq/day at nursing home. Suspicious
   for Bartter's or Gitelman's syndromes, esp with the associated MR,
   although admitting team talked to Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] (PCP) who said this is
   relatively new requirement (past year or so, following an admission for
   UTI).
   - aggressive IV and PO repletion with tid lytes
   - Appreciate renal c/s, will f/u recs.
   # h/o DVT/PE: has been anticoagulated chronically as an outpt, but
   given need for LP, will have to reverse his anticoagulation. At the
   same time, his new hemiparesis is another indication for
   anticoagulation, so will plan to start heparin after LP

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with mental retardation who presents with fever and seizures. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions.

1. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient has had a persistent fever despite being on antibiotics and antiviral agents for two days. This indicates an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.

2. Seizure, with status epilepticus: The patient initially had status epilepticus in the setting of a fever. This suggests a possible central nervous system (CNS) infection such as meningitis.

3. Electrolyte & fluid disorder, other: The patient has significant hypokalemia and requires aggressive IV and PO repletion with tid lytes. This could be related to his current medical conditions or previous treatments.

4. Right hemiparesis: The patient has right-sided weakness, which may be due to meningitis/meningo-encephalitis, especially if caused by HSV, but the distribution is also concerning for an infarct. The neurology team is planning to follow up with an MRI/MRA to further evaluate this.

5. Positive troponin/NSTEMI: The patient had a positive troponin level, indicating myocardial injury. An echocardiogram was performed and showed no evidence of wall motion abnormality. The LDL level is elevated at 101"

","The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. They have been diagnosed with potential meningitis or encephalitis, as well as acute stroke. The patient is being treated empirically for meningitis with antibiotics (Vanc/CTX/ampicillin) and antivirals (acyclovir) while awaiting further diagnostic results. They are also receiving prophylactic treatment for possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's weakness is attributed to cervical spinal foraminal stenosis, and they are being managed accordingly. The repeat seizure is being investigated, and the patient's dilantin level needs to be corrected. The patient's hypokalemia requires ongoing replacement, and renal service consultation has been requested. The patient is on hold for anticoagulation due to planned procedures, but heparin is being administered via gtt in the meantime. The patient's transaminitis is being monitored, and screenings for HBV and HCV have been ordered. The patient's access for medication administration has been improved with PICC line placement.

   Assessment and Plan
   POSS INFECTION VS CVA- [**Year (4 digits) 4966**], Neuro changes, leukocytosis. From our
   stnadpoint, clinical suspicion for meningitis v low
   -On Vanc/CTX/ampicllin and acylovir for empiric coverage of meningitis,
   HSV --> as per Neurology svce
   -Seen by neurology with differential for infectious processes
   (meningitis, encephalitis) or alternatively acute stroke as he is
   predominantly moving his left side
   -Continue close neuro checks
   -f/u final read MRI, poss EEG?
   -[**Year (4 digits) **] 325/ atorvastatin 80 qd --> NGT to give
   WEAKNESS- cervical spinal foraminal stenosis
   -C-collar per Neuro
   -mgmt as per Neuro
   REPEAT SEIZURE- dilantn level subtherapeutic, but also in the context
   of decreased MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4966**]
   -f/u Dilantin level, correct for albumin level
   DEMAND ISCHEMIA- resolving
   - Echo without wall motion abnormalities and  Cardiac enzymes now
   trending down.
   - Suspect more demand rather than the primary phenomenon, with
   aggravation by seizure/rhabdo
   - Add statin, otherwise monitor
    HYPOKALEMIA- Specific reason remains unclear; however over the past
   year he has required more supplmental potassium in the outpt setting.
   Pt's marginal MS and difficulty taking po may have prevented more rapid
   correct of hypokalemia. Will continue to replace- may need NGT for more
   effective oral administration.
   -Renal svce consulted
    PE/DVT- holding anticoag as procedures are pending; heparin gtt in the
   meantime
   TRANSAMINITIS- poss related to nonspec viral syndrome causing fever and
   subsequent seizure, versus poss HSV
   -screen for HBV, HCV
   -resolving today
   ACCESS- place PICC and pull TLC IJ in anticipation of at least full
   course of acyclovir
   FEN- poss NGT placement if fails speech and language pathology eval
   negative

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a chief complaint of neurological changes, leukocytosis, and fever. The patient is in the ICU and has been receiving various medications including acyclovir, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, lorazepam, dilantin, famotidine, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 167/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's neurologic examination shows lethargy and movement on the left side only. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal foraminal narrowing in the cervical spine and an nondiagnostic EEG. The patient is suspected to have an infection versus acute stroke, and is being treated empirically for meningitis. The patient also has weakness due to cervical spinal foraminal stenosis, repeat seizure, demand ischemia, hypokalemia, PE/DVT, transaminitis, and access issues.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Meningitis: The patient is being treated empirically for meningitis, which is an infection of the meninges, the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord"
