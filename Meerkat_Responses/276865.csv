   - Decided to hold off on heparin gtt for anticoagulation given
   therapeutic INR, will need SC heparin or heparin gtt tomorrow
   - Restarted outpatient dronedarone
   - Started tamiflu and sent flu swab then d/c'd once negative
   - Decided to pull PICC, sent tip for culture however was short line so
   getting OSH records on if it was trimmed first.  Looked at CT from
   prior and looks like we got it all.
   - Surgery recs: Leave tube in place
   - Neuro recs: EEG neg for seizure.  Gave extra dose of Dilantin,
   recheck level in am
   - went on and off pressors for drop in BP, went onto AC.  Gave 3 more L
   IVF (now total 10L) for HRs in 120s (decreased to 90s)
   - IP did u/s of pleural effusion- stated couldnt drain and would need
   IR under CT if we really wanted it.  Since on and off pressors decided
   still too unstable to leave for it
   -guiaic positive brown stools overnight
   -hematuria overnight: approx 30 cc/hr UOP

   described above, and overall minimally changed.
   3. Large left pleural effusion with associated collapse of the left
   lower
   lobe. The lungs also reveal scattered consolidations as described above
   and
   poorly marginated nodular type opacities which are new and short
   interval and likely also infectious.
   4. Suggestion of hypervolemia with intralobular septal thickening in
   the
   lungs as well as periportal edema.
   5. Diverticulosis.
   6. Hepatic hyperdensity in the right lobe as above. A similar
   hyperdensity
   was seen in [**2136-8-3**]. Considerations include a hemangioma, or
   possible AV-malformation (?previous biopsy site). This could be assesed
   further with ultrasound.

   76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed
   anoxic brain injury and post-op bacteremia as well as cholecystitis s/p
   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis.
   # Septic shock:
   Possible sources of infection include pneumonia, persistent bacteremia
   with seeding of his endovascular grafts, or cholecystitis.  Concerned
   that persistent left effusion may be parapneumonic or possibly
   empyema.  Would also consider C Diff given recent antibiotics and large
   BM last night, though this is less likely especially given negative
   test.  Also has an indwelling Foley, so is at risk for UTI as well
   though UA not impressive.  LFTs normal apart from alk phos, so
   cholecystitis appears less likely.
   - aggressive IVF as needed
   - Maintain BP with pressors as needed, though haven't been needed
   currently
   - will contact ID given concern for endovascular infection
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Levo for nosocomial infection, day 1: [**12-3**], consider
   fungal coverage given CT findings as next step
   - culture urine, blood, sputum, and gall bladder drainage
   - Consider TEE to eval for endovascular infection on graft
   - Hold lasix
   - if stable to go, discuss drainage of effusion with IR via CT
   # Respiratory Distress:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP as above.  Maintain on PS for now in the
   setting of distress on trach.  Will wean as tolerated.
   - Continue combivent
   - respiratory alkalosis likely due to tachypnea, will follow ABGs
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension
   - appreciate neurology input, ask if needs to be on continuous EEG
   - monitor neuro exam
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place
   - follow exam and LFTs
   - consider RUQ ultrasound vs HIDA
   # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   # Guaiac positive stool:
   - active type and screen
   - monitor serial Hct
   - ranitidine
   - PICC, CVL, PIV
   # Elevated troponin and EKG changes:
   Suspect patient was somewhat ischemic in setting of hypotension and
   tachycardia.
   - follow serial EKGs and CEs
   - continue ASA
   # Acute renal failure: now improving so llikely due to hypotension.
   - follow urine output closely
   - renally dose meds prn
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - hold home lasix given need for volume resuscitation, consider
   restarting this pm
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:
   - switch from coumadin to heparin gtt in case patient needs procedure
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - hold metoprolol given hypotension
   # Infiltrated IV site:
   Monitor right arm.  Appreciate plastics recs.
   # Anemia:  current hct 27.1 recent baseline 27-28
   Note that patient required multiple transfusions during recent hospital
   stay and he has guaiac positive stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - monitor stool output
   - recheck in pm
   - active T&S
   # Hematuria and BPH:  was described at rehab [**12-2**], now present.
   Patient was followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was
   started on flomax.
   - hold flomax given hypotension
   - continue Foley
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin
   FEN:  NPO for now, IV fluids as above, replete lytes PRN (was receiving
   Nutren 2.0 at 50cc/hr by GJ tube prior to admission)

   Code status: full
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who underwent redo replacement of the aortic arch with presumed anoxic brain injury and post-operative bacteremia, as well as cholecystitis, for which he had a cholecystosomy. He was admitted for sepsis. The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently suffering from sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Possible sources of infection include pneumonia, persistent bacteremia with seeding of his endovascular grafts, or cholecystitis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to the infectious process. Empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) has been started, and the patient will be maintained on pressure support ventilation (PSV) for now, with plans to wean as tolerated.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to hypotension or anoxic cerebral injury. An EEG was negative for seizure activity, so it is less likely to be related to seizures.

4. Recent Cholecystitis: The patient had recent cholecystitis, which may be contributing to the septic picture. The abdominal exam and liver function tests (LFTs) are somewhat reassuring. Further evaluation with an RUQ ultrasound or H"

   described above, and overall minimally changed.
   3. Large left pleural effusion with associated collapse of the left
   lower
   lobe. The lungs also reveal scattered consolidations as described above
   and
   poorly marginated nodular type opacities which are new and short
   interval and likely also infectious.

   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis.
   # Septic shock:
   Possible sources of infection include pneumonia, persistent bacteremia
   with seeding of his endovascular grafts, or cholecystitis.  Initially
   concerned  that persistent left effusion may be parapneumonic or
   possibly empyema.  Would also consider C Diff given recent antibiotics
   and large BM last night, though this is less likely especially given
   negative test.  Also has an indwelling Foley, so is at risk for UTI as
   well though UA not impressive.  LFTs normal apart from alk phos, so
   cholecystitis appears less likely.
   Not currently needing IVF or pressor support.  With GNR from OSH most
   likely [**2-4**] gut versus urine.
   - will contact ID MD (and possible consult)given concern for
   endovascular infection
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Levo for nosocomial infection, day 1: [**12-3**].  Holding
   off on further coverage with Flagyl given no growth from OSH at this
   point.
   - f/u culture urine, blood, sputum, and gall bladder drainage
   - resend cdiff
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP as above.  Wean off PS today as tolerated as on
   trache mask at facility.
   - speech consult
   - Continue combivent
   - respiratory alkalosis likely due to tachypnea, will follow ABGs
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension
   - appreciate neurology input, ask if needs to be on continuous EEG
   - monitor neuro exam
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   -ask [**Doctor First Name 458**] when tube to be removed.
   # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   # Guaiac positive stool:
   - active type and screen
   - monitor serial Hct
   - ranitidine
   - PICC, CVL, PIV
   # Elevated troponin and EKG changes:
   Suspect patient was somewhat ischemic in setting of hypotension and
   tachycardia as troponins have not changed and Ces have not gone up.
   - follow EKG this am.
   - continue ASA
   # Acute renal failure: now improving so llikely due to hypotension.
   -urology consult to replace given presense of sepsis, longstanding
   foley, BPH, and hematuria
   - follow urine output closely
   - renally dose meds prn
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - consider restarting home lasix this pm.
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:
   - holding anticoagulation as INR still therapeutic
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - hold metoprolol given recent hypotension
   # Infiltrated IV site:  Pt. could only tolerate wrap and elevation for
 of the night
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   Monitor right arm.  Appreciate plastics recs, ask them to come by and
   look given large hematoma.
   # Anemia:  current hct 27.1 recent baseline 27-28
   Note that patient required multiple transfusions during recent hospital
   stay and he has guaiac positive stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - monitor stool output
   - recheck in pm
   - active T&S
   # Hematuria and BPH:  was described at rehab [**12-2**], now present.
   Patient was followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was
   started on flomax.
   - hold flomax given hypotension
   - continue Foley
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

    76 yo male admitted with significant fevers and hypotension concerning
   for sepsis requiring pressors and return to ventilator support.  He has
   had good response to antibiotics and IVF given but definative source
   remains to be defined.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with excellent tolerance of PSV support
   at this time.  He does have much improved mental status this morning
   and easy capacity to tolerate minimal ventilator support settings.
   -Move to SBT and will trial with PMV if continued stability seen
   -Maintain PSV today
   2)Sepsis-We have discussed broad differential for sources.  At this
   time we have gram negative rods in blood cultures as initial pathogen.
   We have urine culture pending at this time, we have drainage from
   biliary system pending, we have CT scan without focal intra-abdominal
   infection.  Pulmonary vs. biliary source vs. Urine appear to be
   likely.  We do have significant concern for seeding of graft in the
   setting of positive blood cultures.
   -Vanco/Levoflox/Cefepime
   -Will have to follow up sputum/biliary and urine sources for
   culture
main information will have to come from rehab
   -Will have to discuss with ID team plans around consideration of
   further testing and/or imaging with TEE for possible involvement of
   graft sites if persistent bactermia seen and to consider time course of
   antibiotics
   -Did not have capacity for testing of pleural fluid based upon imaging
   yesterday and will have to re-consider tap if clinical progress is
   limited
   -PICC line D/C
   3)Altered Mental Status-EEG negative much improved following
   improvement in blood pressure control
   -Phenobarb/Keppra to continue
   -Follow exam
   -Will look to return to trach mask trial today.

","The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted with significant fevers and hypotension concerning for sepsis, requiring pressors and return to ventilator support. He has had a good response to antibiotics and IV fluids given but a definitive source of infection remains to be defined.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, allowing him to tolerate pressure support ventilation (PSV) well. It is planned to move him to spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and trial proportional assist ventilation (PAV) if continued stability is seen. He will maintain PSV for today.

Sepsis is still ongoing, with broad differentials for sources including pulmonary, biliary, and urinary systems. Gram-negative rods have been identified in blood cultures as the initial pathogen. Blood cultures with GNR's are pending, as well as urine culture and drainage from the biliary system. There is concern for graft seeding in the setting of positive blood cultures.

The patient's altered mental status has improved following improvement in blood pressure control, and EEG is negative. Phenobarb/Keppra will continue, and the patient will undergo further examination. Tracheostomy mask trials will be attempted today.

ICU care includes nutrition via a feeding tube, glycemic control, multi-lumen lines, arterial line, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed
   anoxic brain injury and post-op bacteremia as well as cholecystitis s/p
   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis.
   # Septic shock:
   Possible sources of infection include pneumonia, persistent bacteremia
   with seeding of his endovascular grafts, or cholecystitis.  Initially
   concerned  that persistent left effusion may be parapneumonic or
   possibly empyema.  Would also consider C Diff given recent antibiotics,
   though this is less likely especially given negative test.  Also has an
   indwelling Foley, so is at risk for UTI as well though UA not
   impressive.  LFTs normal apart from alk phos, so cholecystitis appears
   less likely.
   Not currently needing IVF or pressor support.  With GNR from OSH most
   likely [**2-4**] gut versus urine, or sepsis due to pna or line.
   - per ID, now on [**Doctor Last Name **]/Cef day 1: [**12-3**] and changed Levo to Cipro on
   [**12-4**].  If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.
   - f/u culture urine, blood, sputum, and gall bladder drainage
   -resend sputum and  resend cdiff
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP as above.  Wean off PS today as tolerated as on
   trache mask at facility.
   -speech consult
   - Continue combivent
   - respiratory alkalosis likely due to tachypnea improved
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension
   - appreciate neurology input, ask if needs to be on continuous EEG
   - levels low, ask neuro for help readjusting meds.
   # Anemia:  current hct 25.7: Note that patient required multiple
   transfusions during recent hospital stay and he has guaiac positive
   stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - monitor stool output
   - recheck in pm, transfuse for <25.0
   - active T&S
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   -ask [**Doctor First Name 458**] when tube to be removed.
    # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   # Guaiac positive stool:
   - active type and screen
   - monitor serial Hct
   - ranitidine
   - PICC, CVL, PIV
   # Elevated troponin and EKG changes: Suspect patient was somewhat
   ischemic in setting of hypotension and tachycardia as troponins have
   not changed and Ces have not gone up.
   - continue ASA
   # Acute renal failure: now improving so llikely due to hypotension.
   - follow urine output closely
   - renally dose meds prn
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - consider restarting home lasix this pm.
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now 2.0, restarted home
   metoprolol last night
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - restart coumadin at home dose
   # Infiltrated IV site:  plastics said no C.S.
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   # Hematuria and BPH:  was described at rehab [**12-2**], now present.
   Patient was followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was
   started on flomax.
   - restart flomax this pm if BPs tolerate
   - continue Foley
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who underwent a redo replacement of the aortic arch with presumed anoxic brain injury and post-operative bacteremia. He was admitted for sepsis and has a history of chronic pain, acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, cholecystitis, anoxic cerebral injury, atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, and dyslipidemia. The patient's current conditions include septic shock with possible sources of infection such as pneumonia, bacteremia, or cholecystitis. He also has respiratory failure likely secondary to the infectious process, altered mental status due to hypotension or non-convulsive status epilepticus, and anemia requiring multiple transfusions. Other medical issues include recent cholecystitis, complications from aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG, guaiac positive stool, elevated troponin, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and acute pulmonary embolism. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is being treated with appropriate antibiotics, anticoagulation, and other medications. Further tests and consultations are planned to guide the management of his conditions. Potential medical complications include ongoing sepsis, worsening respiratory failure, further decline in mental status, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy, and complications related to his previous surgeries."

   # Septic shock:
   Possible sources of infection include pneumonia, persistent bacteremia
   with seeding of his endovascular grafts, or cholecystitis.  Initially
   concerned  that persistent left effusion may be parapneumonic or
   possibly empyema.  Would also consider C Diff given recent antibiotics,
   though this is less likely especially given negative test.  Also has an
   indwelling Foley, so is at risk for UTI as well though UA not
   impressive.  LFTs normal apart from alk phos, so cholecystitis appears
   less likely.
   Not currently needing IVF or pressor support.  With GNR from OSH most
   likely [**2-4**] gut versus urine, or sepsis due to pna or line.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who underwent redo replacement aortic arch surgery and is experiencing multiple medical complications. He has a history of anoxic brain injury, post-operative bacteremia, and cholecystitis. The patient is currently admitted for sepsis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, anemia, and recent cholecystitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. The source of infection could be pneumonia, persistent bacteremia with seeding of his endovascular grafts, or cholecystitis. It is crucial to identify the specific pathogen causing the infection and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to the infectious process. Empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) has been started. Weaning off positive end-expiratory pressure (PSV) should be done today as tolerated since the patient is currently on tracheal mask at the facility.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hypotension or non-convulsive status epilepticus. EEG results are negative for seizure activity. Neurology input is appreciated, and continuous EEG monitoring may be necessary. Phenytoin levels are low, and rechecking the levels after dose adjustment is recommended.

4. Anemia: The patient's"

   76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed

   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis.
   # Septic shock:
   Possible sources of infection include pneumonia, persistent bacteremia
   with seeding of his endovascular grafts, or cholecystitis.  Initially
   concerned  that persistent left effusion may be parapneumonic or
   possibly empyema.  Would also consider C Diff given recent antibiotics,
   though this is less likely especially given negative test.  Also has an
   indwelling Foley, so is at risk for UTI as well though UA not
   impressive.  LFTs normal apart from alk phos, so cholecystitis appears
   less likely.
   Not currently needing IVF or pressor support.  With GNR from OSH most
   likely [**2-4**] gut versus urine, or sepsis due to pna or line.
   - per ID, now on [**Doctor Last Name **]/Cef day 1: [**12-3**] and changed Levo to Cipro on
   [**12-4**].  If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.
   - f/u culture urine, blood, sputum, and gall bladder drainage
   -resend sputum and  resend cdiff
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP as above.  Wean off PS today as tolerated as on
   trache mask at facility.
   -speech consult
   - Continue combivent
   - respiratory alkalosis likely due to tachypnea improved
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension
   - appreciate neurology input, ask if needs to be on continuous EEG
   - levels low, ask neuro for help readjusting meds.
   # Anemia:  current hct 25.7: Note that patient required multiple
   transfusions during recent hospital stay and he has guaiac positive
   stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - monitor stool output
   - recheck in pm, transfuse for <25.0
   - active T&S
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   -ask [**Doctor First Name 458**] when tube to be removed.
    # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   # Guaiac positive stool:
   - active type and screen
   - monitor serial Hct
   - ranitidine
   - PICC, CVL, PIV
   # Elevated troponin and EKG changes: Suspect patient was somewhat
   ischemic in setting of hypotension and tachycardia as troponins have
   not changed and Ces have not gone up.
   - continue ASA
   # Acute renal failure: now improving so llikely due to hypotension.
   - follow urine output closely
   - renally dose meds prn
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - consider restarting home lasix this pm.
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now 2.0, restarted home
   metoprolol last night
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - restart coumadin at home dose
   # Infiltrated IV site:  plastics said no C.S.
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   # Hematuria and BPH:  was described at rehab [**12-2**], now present.
   Patient was followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was
   started on flomax.
   - restart flomax this pm if BPs tolerate
   - continue Foley
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Blood culture from rehab shows non-lactose fermenter, which could be pseudomonas, acinetobacter, stenotrophomonas, or others. ID recs suggest holding off on PICC until blood cultures are clear, likely sources of infection being PNA or line.
- ID recs also suggest sending repeat sputum culture and obtaining sputum culture data from rehab. They recommend changing levofloxacin to cipro and continuing vanc/cefepime. If the patient deteriorates, give meropenem.
- Gave Lasix 40mg IV x 1, as the patient takes 40mg po bid at home.
- Neuro recs: Reloaded phenytoin in IV form (300mg) today and plan to check level 4 hours after dose. Since <15, gave 100mg q8h IV. Mentioned that can't give phenytoin through PICC.
- Ordered phenytoin, phenobarb, and keppra levels in the morning.
- Gave nystatin for suspected thrush.
- Decreased pressure support from 13/5 to 10/7, and tidal volumes went from 550-600 on 13/5 to about 450-500 on 10/7. Held off on further weaning. Repeat ABG shows pH 7.39, PaCO2 37, HCO3 107, BE -1.
- Plastics signed off, thought hand looked okay without compartment syndrome.
- No CT or gen recs left.
- Gave 0.5mg Ativan as recorded in OMR for sleep.
- Foley changed by us.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Possible sources of infection include pneumonia, persistent bacteremia with seeding of endovascular grafts, or cholecystitis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely secondary to the infectious process. Empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) has been initiated.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is displaying altered mental status, which may be due to anoxic cerebral injury, seizures, or hypotension. Neurological input has been requested.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a current hematocrit (Hct) of 25.7. This may be attributed to recent transfusions during hospitalization and positive stool guaiac.

5. Cholecystitis: The patient had recent cholecystitis, which may be contributing to the septic picture. The abdominal exam and liver function tests (LFTs) are somewhat reassuring.

6. History of Aortic Arch Repair/Dissection/CABG: The patient has a long and complicated course following the procedure, including a recent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads. The patient remains at risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back positive.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo male with admission from rehab with sepsis and gram negative
   bacteremia.  He has had persistent requirement for significant pressure
   support for ventilation at this time.  This may be related to some
   component of volume overload in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
   What is encouraging is that we have seen no evidence of persistent or
   recurrent insult with clearance of blood cultures at this time.
   1)Sepsis-
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Cipro to continue for GNR process
   -Have been able to wean pressors to off
   -Will move to negative fluid balance at this time given stability of
   blood pressure
   -Would hope to replace PICC catheter  when able given femoral catheter
   -No fevers in past 24 hours
will have to follow pleural fluid magnitude
   and clinical progress over time.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis and gram-negative bacteremia. The patient has required significant pressure support for ventilation and may have volume overload due to treatment for sepsis. There is a large left-sided effusion present on imaging.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Sepsis:
- Continue with Vanco/Cefepime/Cipro to treat GNR process.
- Wean off pressors.
- Move to negative fluid balance.
- Replace PICC catheter when able.
- No fevers in the past 24 hours.

2. Respiratory Failure:
- Continue with PSV (pressure support ventilation).
- Consider increasing PSV to 15 and evaluate for optimization of tidal volume.
- Diurese today.

3. Seizure:
- No seizures during this admission.
- Continue with Keppra.

4. DVT:
- Restart anticoagulation today given INR decrease to 2.0 and extensive clot.
- Follow stool given OB positive status.

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT and VAP, and code status. The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU, and the total time spent with the patient is 45 minutes."

   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis.
   # Septic shock:
   Possible sources of infection include pneumonia, persistent bacteremia
   with seeding of his endovascular grafts, or cholecystitis.  Initially
   concerned  that persistent left effusion may be parapneumonic or
   possibly empyema.  Would also consider C Diff given recent antibiotics,
   though this is less likely especially given negative test.  Also has an
   indwelling Foley, so is at risk for UTI as well though UA not
   impressive.  LFTs normal apart from alk phos, so cholecystitis appears
   less likely.
   Not currently needing IVF or pressor support.  With GNR from OSH most
   likely [**2-4**] gut versus urine, or sepsis due to pna or line.
   - per ID, now on [**Doctor Last Name **]/Cef day 1: [**12-3**] and added Cipro [**12-4**].  If
   decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.
   - f/u culture urine, blood, sputum, and gall bladder drainage
   -resend sputum and  resend cdiff
   -f/u ctx from OSH and see if can narrow antibiotics
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP as above. Was on trache mask at facility.
   Likely rate limiting factor now is pulmonary edema from volume overload
   from fluid ressusitation.
   -speech consult
   - Continue combivent
   - increase PEEP to 18 to help increase TV and decrease RR
   - lasix IV X1
   -try to wean PS later today if diureses well
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension
   - appreciate neurology input
   - levels low, ask neuro for help readjusting meds.
   # Anemia:  current hct 25.7: Note that patient required multiple
   transfusions during recent hospital stay and he has guaiac positive
   stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - monitor stool output
   - recheck in pm, transfuse for <25.0
   - active T&S
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   -ask [**Doctor First Name 458**] when tube to be removed.
    # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   # Guaiac positive stool:
   - active type and screen
   - monitor serial Hct
   - ranitidine
   - PICC, CVL, PIV
   # Elevated troponin and EKG changes: Suspect patient was somewhat
   ischemic in setting of hypotension and tachycardia as troponins have
   not changed and Ces have not gone up.
   - continue ASA
   # Acute renal failure: now improving so llikely due to hypotension.
   - follow urine output closely
   - renally dose meds prn
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - 40mg IV lasix X1 now, pm lytes, patient will need to have home lasix
   restarted soon
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now 2.0, restarted home
   metoprolol last night
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - restart coumadin at home dose
   - heparin gtt to bridge
   # Infiltrated IV site:  plastics said no C.S.
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   # Hematuria and BPH:  was described at rehab [**12-2**], now present.
   Patient was followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was
   started on flomax.
   - restart flomax this pm if BPs tolerate
   - continue Foley
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who underwent a redo replacement of his aortic arch with presumed anoxic brain injury and post-operative bacteremia, as well as cholecystitis. He was admitted for sepsis and currently has several medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with severe sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It is important to continue aggressive management, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, source control, and supportive care.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure likely secondary to the infectious process. Empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) has been initiated. The respiratory support should be continued, and efforts should be made to wean the patient off ventilatory support gradually.

3. Altered mental status: The patient has an altered mental status, possibly due to hypotension or anoxic cerebral injury. Neurological input should be sought to optimize the management of seizures and delirium.

4. Anemia: The patient's current hemoglobin level is low, likely due to multiple transfusions during his recent hospital stay and gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of stool output, rechecking hemoglobin levels, and transfusion for <25.0 are recommended.

5. Cholecystitis: The patient had recent cholecystitis, which may be contributing to his septic picture. Continued monitoring and follow-up"

   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis.
   # Septic shock:
   Possible sources of infection include pneumonia, persistent bacteremia
   with seeding of his endovascular grafts, or cholecystitis.  Initially
   concerned  that persistent left effusion may be parapneumonic or
   possibly empyema.  Would also consider C Diff given recent antibiotics,
   though this is less likely especially given negative test.  Also has an
   indwelling Foley, so is at risk for UTI as well though UA not
   impressive.  LFTs normal apart from alk phos, so cholecystitis appears
   less likely.
   Not currently needing IVF or pressor support.  With GNR from OSH most
   likely [**2-4**] gut versus urine, or sepsis due to pna or line.
   - per ID, now on [**Doctor Last Name **]/Cef day 1: [**12-3**] and added Cipro [**12-4**].  If
   decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.
   - f/u culture urine, blood, sputum, and gall bladder drainage
   -resend sputum and  resend cdiff
   -f/u ctx from OSH and see if can narrow antibiotics
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP as above. Was on trache mask at facility.
   Likely rate limiting factor now is pulmonary edema from volume overload
   from fluid ressusitation.
   -speech consult
   - Continue combivent
   - increase PEEP to 18 to help increase TV and decrease RR
   - lasix IV X1
   -try to wean PS later today if diureses well
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension
   - appreciate neurology input
   - levels low, ask neuro for help readjusting meds.
   # Anemia:  current hct 25.7: Note that patient required multiple
   transfusions during recent hospital stay and he has guaiac positive
   stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - monitor stool output
   - recheck in pm, transfuse for <25.0
   - active T&S
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   -ask [**Doctor First Name 458**] when tube to be removed.
    # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   # Guaiac positive stool:
   - active type and screen
   - monitor serial Hct
   - ranitidine
   - PICC, CVL, PIV
   # Elevated troponin and EKG changes: Suspect patient was somewhat
   ischemic in setting of hypotension and tachycardia as troponins have
   not changed and Ces have not gone up.
   - continue ASA
   # Acute renal failure: now improving so llikely due to hypotension.
   - follow urine output closely
   - renally dose meds prn
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - 40mg IV lasix X1 now, pm lytes, patient will need to have home lasix
   restarted soon
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now 2.0, restarted home
   metoprolol last night
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - restart coumadin at home dose
   - heparin gtt to bridge
   # Infiltrated IV site:  plastics said no C.S.
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   # Hematuria and BPH:  was described at rehab [**12-2**], now present.
   Patient was followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was
   started on flomax.
   - restart flomax this pm if BPs tolerate
   - continue Foley
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male who underwent redo replacement of the aortic arch and has a history of anoxic brain injury, post-operative bacteremia, and cholecystitis. He was admitted for sepsis and currently has multiple medical complications. The patient is in the ICU and is being treated for septic shock, respiratory failure, altered mental status, anemia, recent cholecystitis, and other comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely due to an infection caused by Serratia maracenes. Possible sources of infection include pneumonia, persistent bacteremia with seeding of his endovascular grafts, or cholecystitis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to the infectious process. Empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) has been initiated.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to hypotension and a history of non-convulsive status epilepticus. An EEG was performed and showed no seizure activity.

4. Anemia: The patient is anemic, with a decreasing hematocrit level. This could be attributed to multiple transfusions during his recent hospital stay and the presence of guaiac positive stool and recent hematuria.

5. Recent Cholecystitis: The patient had recent cholec"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo male with complex recent medical history notable for aortic
   replacement and with prolonged hospital course compliacted by recurrent
   infection, respiratory failure and substantial peripheral muscle
   weakness now re-admitted with sepsis and source would appear to be
   related to Gram Negative infection seen in previous pulmonary samples
   suggesting possible pulmonary source of recurrent gram negative rod
   bacterial infection.  He has shown substantial improvement over the
   past 24 hours consistent with resolving sepsis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history, including aortic replacement and prolonged hospitalization complicated by recurrent infection, respiratory failure, and peripheral muscle weakness. The patient was readmitted with sepsis, which appears to be related to a Gram-negative infection seen in previous pulmonary samples, suggesting a possible pulmonary source of recurrent Gram-negative rod bacterial infection. 

The patient has shown substantial improvement over the past 24 hours, consistent with resolving sepsis. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient remains on Vancomycin for 6 weeks and Ciprofloxacin for two weeks to treat the Serratia infection. The patient is off pressors and will be moved to diuresis today at 1-2 liters per day as possible.

2. Respiratory Failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient has shown substantial improvement in compliance and mental status. The plan is to move the patient to trial on pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 10-15/5 for full support, trial on partial mechanical ventilation (PMV) for 1-2 hours today, and continue diuresis.

   76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed
   anoxic brain injury and post-op bacteremia as well as cholecystitis s/p
   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis.
   # Septic shock/ serratia: With serratia bacteremia, most likely source
   of sepsis is GI vs urine, although UA on admission was not impressive
   (although was after antibioitics).  LFTs were normal apart from alk
   phos, so cholecystitis less likely.  Could also be due to pneumonia or
   due to PICC line infection (PICC has been removed)
   - per ID, now on Vancomycin/Cipro: Day 1 [**12-3**] of Vanc and added Cipro
   [**12-4**].  If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.  Will confirm with ID
   appropriate duration of antibiotics
   - f/u culture urine, blood, sputum, and gall bladder drainage
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP as above. Was on trach mask at facility.
   Likely rate limiting factor now is pulmonary edema from volume overload
   from fluid resuscitation.
   - Yesterday was on [**5-7**] and put on trach mask but tired out.  Returned
   to PS but will reattempt today after diuresis last night
   - Speech consult pending
   - Continue combivent
   - Continue gentle diuresis with Lasix as needed, goal I/O negative ~1L
   - PM I/O check
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension
   - appreciate neurology input
   - monitor phenytoin/phenobarb levels, f/u with neuro for readjusting
   meds.
   - ask neuro about long-term plan for anti-epileptics
   # Anemia:  Hct stable.  Note that patient required multiple
   transfusions during recent hospital stay and he has guaiac positive
   stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - check Hct daily
   - active T&S
   - ranitidine for guaiac positive stool
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   -ask [**Doctor First Name 458**] when tube to be removed.
   # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   # Elevated troponin and EKG changes: Suspect patient was somewhat
   ischemic in setting of hypotension and tachycardia.
   - continue ASA
   # Acute renal failure: Now creatinine stable at 1.0
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds (vancomycin)
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue gentle diuresis as above
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now 1.8, restarted home
   metoprolol last night
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - restarted coumadin at home dose, INR now subtherapeutic
   - heparin gtt to bridge
   # Infiltrated IV site:  plastics said no compartment syndrome, appears
   stable
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   # Hematuria and BPH:  Was described at rehab [**12-2**], now present.
   Patient was followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was
   started on flomax.  Continues to have some hematuria but foley
   draining, may need 3-way foley.  Likely due to anticoagulation in the
   setting of foley placements.
   - cont flomax
   - continue Foley
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including recent redo replacement of the aortic arch, presumed anoxic brain injury, post-operative bacteremia, cholecystitis, sepsis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, and a history of seizure and aortic dissection. The patient is currently admitted for sepsis and has multiple comorbidities such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and medical history include:

1. Organ dysfunction: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which can lead to further deterioration of organ function and potentially develop into multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to an infectious process. This can progress to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function due to sepsis, hypotension, and fluid overload.

4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and aortic dissection. There is a risk of worsening cardiac function, arrhythmias, or myocardial ischemia.

5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who underwent redo replacement of the aortic arch with presumed anoxic brain injury and post-op bacteremia, as well as cholecystitis. He is currently admitted for sepsis and has multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with severe sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not properly managed. It is important to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy and source control measures.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to the infectious process. Empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) has been initiated. Pulmonary edema from volume overload due to fluid resuscitation may also be a concern. Tracheostomy and gentle diuresis may be necessary.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has a history of seizures and likely anoxic cerebral injury. Altered mental status and non-convulsive status epilepticus have been observed. EEG results are negative for seizure activity. Neurological input is needed to adjust medications and manage this condition.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is decreasing, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate red blood cell production.

   injury, h/o recent status epilepticus and recent cholecystitis s/p per
   chole tube now here with fever sepsis. Had PICC removed and
   pan-cultured, covered broadly, now has Serratia in OSH culture on
   cipro/vanc.  Is on the ventilator (PS) but was tolerating PMV prior to
   admission so trying to liberate with diuresis, didn't tolerate TM.  Did
   not get PICC today, will try for peripherals and pull femoral line.
   Will need to readress if his perc chole tube can come out.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history who is currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis and respiratory failure. The major issues mentioned in the note include improving sepsis with negative fluid balance over the past two days, being ventilator-dependent on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but not tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) due to weakness, altered mental status, and a left pleural effusion with pulmonary edema.

The patient has a history of aortic replacement, prolonged hospitalization, recurrent infection, and substantial peripheral muscle weakness. He is currently receiving multiple medications and has various tubes and lines inserted, including a tracheostomy tube, arterial line, central venous catheter, and peripheral IV lines.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/58 mmHg to 132/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is set to atrioventricular (AV) paced.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 210 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.8 g/dL, normal creatinine (Cr) of 1.0 mg/dL, low platelet count"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history, including aortic replacement and prolonged hospitalization. He is currently readmitted with sepsis and serratia infection in his blood. The patient has several major issues, such as improving sepsis with negative fluid balance, dependence on ventilator support, altered mental status, and left pleural effusion with pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is critically ill with sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially result in multiple organ failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation and is not tolerating spontaneous breathing trials, indicating severe respiratory failure. This can progress to ventilator-associated pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may be due to various factors like sepsis, medication, or underlying brain pathology. This can increase the risk of delirium, confusion, and poor decision-making.
4. Pleural Effusion: The presence of a large left pleural effusion may indicate a complication like pneumonia or heart failure. If left untreated, it can lead to respiratory compromise and potential infection.
5. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low hemoglobin and platelet levels, indicating anemia and thrombocytopenia. These conditions can increase the risk of bleeding and worsen overall"

   Assessment and Plan
   substantial improvement over the past 24 hours consistent with
   resolving sepsis.
   1) SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)- much improving
   -Vanco to continue for 6 weeks
   -Cipro for two weeks for Serratia
   -Remains off pressors
   -Will move to diuresis today at 1-2 liters per day as possible
   2)RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])-Substantial improvement in
   compliance and also in mental status. Trach mask today.
   -PSV at 5/5
   -Will trial on trach mask, PMV if tol TM well
   -Will continue diuresis
   3)ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM) improving
   4)CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   -Will maintain biliary drain and follow up cultures
   -Continue with drainage at this time
   -Enzymes reassuring
   5)H/O SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   -Keppra
   -Discuss with neuro- would like to minimize sedating meds if possible

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history, including aortic replacement and prolonged hospitalization. He has been readmitted with sepsis and serratia growing in his blood culture. The patient's major issues include improving sepsis with negative fluid balance over the past two days, ventilator dependency on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but not tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) due to weakness, altered mental status, and left pleural effusion with pulmonary edema.

The patient's recent events include being unable to provide history due to tracheostomy, allergies to amiodarone, hyperthyroidism, monosodium glutamate, and violent headache. He has received antibiotics such as cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin. The patient is currently on heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications like furosemide (Lasix). 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/58 to 132/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight is 100.6 kg, with a total intake of 3,453 mL, output of 4,025 mL, and negative fluid balance of -572 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation"

   Assessment and Plan
   76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed
   anoxic brain injury and post-op bacteremia as well as cholecystitis s/p
   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis.
   # Septic shock/ serratia: With serratia bacteremia, most likely source
   of sepsis is GI vs urine, although UA on admission was not impressive
   (although was after antibioitics).  LFTs were normal apart from alk
   phos, so cholecystitis less likely.  Could also be due to pneumonia or
   due to PICC line infection (PICC has been removed)
   - per ID, now on Vancomycin/Cipro: Day 1 [**12-3**] of Vanc and added Cipro
   [**12-4**].  If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.  Plan to continue cipro
   x 3-4 weeks, vanco for 6 weeks (start [**11-14**]
   - f/u culture urine, blood, sputum, and gall bladder drainage
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP as above. Was on trach mask at facility.
   Likely rate limiting factor now is pulmonary edema from volume overload
   from fluid resuscitation.
   - Yesterday was on put on trach mask and did well, will try again today
   along with further diuresis
   - Speech consult pending
   - Continue combivent
   - Continue gentle diuresis with Lasix as needed, goal I/O negative ~1L
   - PM I/O check
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension
   - appreciate neurology input
   - monitor phenytoin/phenobarb levels, f/u with neuro for readjusting
   meds.

   # Hematuria and BPH:  Was described at rehab [**12-2**], now present.
   Patient was followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was
   started on flomax.  Continues to have some hematuria, has 3 way foley
   and undergoing bladder irrigation.  Likely due to anticoagulation in
   the setting of foley placements.
   - cont flomax
   - continue Foley

   # Anemia:  Hct stable.  Note that patient required multiple
   transfusions during recent hospital stay and he has guaiac positive
   stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - check Hct daily
   - active T&S
   - ranitidine for guaiac positive stool
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.

   # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs

   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue gentle diuresis as above
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now 1.8, restarted home

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who underwent a redo replacement of the aortic arch, presumed anoxic brain injury, post-operative bacteremia, and cholecystitis. He was admitted to the ICU for sepsis and is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. The patient has a history of seizures, likely anoxic cerebral injury, and altered mental status. He also has hematuria, anemia, recent cholecystitis, and a history of diastolic heart failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains dependent on respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition suggests septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), septic encephalopathy, and potentially death if not managed promptly and effectively.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. If not adequately managed, it may progress to persistent or chronic respiratory failure, leading to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.0, indicating acute renal failure. If not managed properly, this condition may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring dialysis or renal transplantation.

4. Anoxic Brain Injury:"

The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, altered mental status, cholecystitis, a history of seizure and status epilepticus, a history of aortic dissection, chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, and dyslipidemia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/50 to 161/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on ventilator support with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a pressure support of 5 cmH2O, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 44. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.28, PaCO2 of 28 mmHg, PaO2 of 70 mmHg, and HCO3 of 19.2 mEq/L.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 203 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen level of 70 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, glucose level of 83 mg/dL, and sodium level of 134 mEq/L. The patient's other lab values are within normal range.

The patient is receiving various medications including heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), morphine sulfate, and ciprofloxacin. The patient has allergies to amiodarone, hyperthyroidism, monosodium glutamate, and violent headache. The patient's current weight is 95.1 kg.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4,027 mL and output of 4,230 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -203 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of sepsis, development of further organ dysfunction, potential bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy, and complications related to the patient's underlying medical conditions such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation."

   Assessment and Plan
   76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed
   anoxic brain injury and post-op bacteremia as well as cholecystitis s/p
   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis, found to have serratia bacteremia.
   # Septic shock/ serratia: With serratia bacteremia, most likely source
   of sepsis is GI vs urine, although UA on admission was not impressive
   (although was after antibioitics).  LFTs were normal apart from alk
   phos, so cholecystitis less likely.  Could also be due to pneumonia or
   due to PICC line infection (PICC has been removed)
   - per ID, now on Vancomycin/Cipro: Day 1 [**12-3**] of Vanc and added Cipro
   [**12-4**].  If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.  Plan to continue cipro
   x 3-4 weeks, vanco for 6 weeks (start [**11-14**])
   - will send sputum Cx today (prior Cx
s have been poor samples)
   - f/u culture urine, blood, sputum, and gall bladder drainage
   - Vanc trough elevated this AM, but drawn early; will repeat a PM vanc
   trough
   -will transfuse 1u PRBCs this AM given continued hypotension and anemia
   -gentle IV fluid boluses to mainatain UOP and MAP > 60
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP as above. Was on trach mask at facility.
   Barriers to extubation currently include muscle weakness, altered
   mental status and pulmonary edema.
   - Yesterday was on put on trach mask and did well, will try again today
   - Speech consult pending
   - Continue combivent
   - Continue gentle diuresis with Lasix as needed, goal I/O negative ~1L
   - PM I/O check
   .
   # Cold lower extremities, Left > right; Pt does have a hx of venous
   clotting, although currently on heparin and coumadin.
   - LE ultrasound with dopplers to assess venous and arterial patency
   .
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension, possibly oversedation from anti-epileptic
   medications.
   - appreciate neurology input; will stop Phenobarbital today with plan
   to stop keppra next (per neuro recs)
   - continue phenytoin and keppra for now
   .
   # Hematuria and BPH:  Was described at rehab [**12-2**], now present.
   Patient was followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was
   started on flomax.  Continues to have some hematuria, has 3 way foley
   and undergoing bladder irrigation.  Likely due to anticoagulation in
   the setting of foley placements.
   - cont flomax
   - continue Foley with bladder irrigation
   .
   # Anemia:  Hct stable.  Note that patient required multiple
   transfusions during recent hospital stay and he has guaiac positive
   stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - check Hct daily
   - active T&S
   - ranitidine for guaiac positive stool
   - transfuse 1 u PRBCs today
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   -ask IR when tube to be removed.
   # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   # Elevated troponin and EKG changes: Suspect patient was somewhat
   ischemic in setting of hypotension and tachycardia.
   - continue ASA
   # Acute renal failure: Now creatinine stable at 1.0
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds (vancomycin)
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue gentle diuresis as above
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now 1.8, restarted home
   metoprolol.
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - restarted coumadin at home dose, INR now subtherapeutic
   - heparin gtt to bridge
   # Infiltrated IV site:  plastics said no compartment syndrome, appears
   stable
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

He also has respiratory failure secondary to the infectious process, and his barriers to extubation include muscle weakness, altered mental status, and pulmonary edema. The patient has cold lower extremities with a history of venous clotting, and an ultrasound with doppler will be done to assess venous and arterial patency. He has altered mental status and a history of seizures, with no current evidence of seizure activity. The patient has hematuria and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and he is being treated with flomax and bladder irrigation. He has anemia with a stable Hct, and he will be transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells today. The patient also has recent cholecystitis, and the cholecystostomy tube may be removed soon.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times. The current admission is due to sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of aortic replacement and has been experiencing recurrent infections and respiratory failure.

The major issues with the patient include improving sepsis with negative fluid balance, being ventilator-dependent on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but not tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) likely due to weakness, altered mental status, and a left pleural effusion with pulmonary edema.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.3°C
- Heart rate: 62 bpm
- Blood pressure: 85/42 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100%
- CVP: 8 mmHg
- Fluid intake: 4,007 mL
- Fluid output: 2,360 mL
- Urine output: 4,180 mL

The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics (cefipime, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin), heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), morphine sulfate, and famotidine (Pepcid).

The patient's laboratory results show the following:
- Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 203"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has undergone redo replacement of the ascending aorta and arch with graft, and has had complications including recurrent infection, respiratory failure, cholecystitis with percutaneous drain, right internal jugular (RIJ) and left subclavian (LSC) thrombi, and substantial peripheral muscle weakness.

Currently, the patient is readmitted with sepsis and Serratia growing in the blood culture. The major active issues include improving sepsis with a negative fluid balance, dependence on mechanical ventilation due to weakness, altered mental status, and left pleural effusion with pulmonary edema.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
- Heart rate: 62 bpm (60-82 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 85/42 mmHg (52/36-161/115 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (17-38 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100%
- Heart rhythm: Atrial-paced

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin), heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), morphine sulfate, and famotidine (Pepcid"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history, including recent aortic replacement and prolonged hospitalization complicated by recurrent infection, respiratory failure, and substantial peripheral muscle weakness. He has been readmitted with sepsis and Serratia growing in the blood culture. 

The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation due to weakness and has an altered mental status. He has a left pleural effusion and pulmonary edema. His urine culture showed the presence of Serratia, and he has been receiving antibiotics for treatment. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85/42 mmHg to 161/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

His lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid. His electrolytes show a low potassium level. 

The patient's physical examination reveals cold feet, palpable pulses in the extremities, rhonchi on lung auscultation, strong cough, and decreased muscle tone. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, respiratory failure, and further deterioration in the patient's mental status."

   76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed
   anoxic brain injury and post-op bacteremia as well as cholecystitis s/p
   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis, found to have serratia bacteremia.
   # Septic shock/ serratia: With serratia bacteremia, most likely source
   of sepsis is GI vs urine, although UA on admission was not impressive
   (although was after antibioitics).  LFTs were normal apart from alk
   phos, so cholecystitis less likely.  Could also be due to pneumonia or
   due to PICC line infection (PICC has been removed)
   - per ID, now on Vancomycin/Cipro: Day 1 [**12-3**] of Vanc and added Cipro
   [**12-4**].  If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.  Plan to continue cipro
   x 3-4 weeks, vanco for 6 weeks (start [**11-14**])
   -hold next Vanc dose and check level in am
   - f/u culture urine, blood
   -try to avoid IVF as now volume overloaded
   -PICC today
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP as above. Was on trach mask at facility.
   Barriers to extubation currently include muscle weakness, altered
   mental status and pulmonary edema.
   - retry trache mask later today
   - Speech consult pending
   - Continue combivent
   - Continue gentle diuresis with Lasix as needed, goal I/O negative ~1L
   , eval in pm as already net negative 1L for day
   - PM I/O check
   .
   # Cold lower extremities, Left > right; Pt does have a hx of venous
   clotting, although currently on heparin and coumadin.
   -resolved
   .
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension, possibly oversedation from anti-epileptic
   medications.
   - appreciate neurology input; stopped Phenobarbital [**12-8**] with plan to
   cont Keppra and Dilantin.
   .
   # Hematuria and BPH:  Was described at rehab [**12-2**], now present.
   Patient was followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was
   started on flomax.  Continued to have some hematuria during this
   hospitalization, has 3 way foley and undergoing bladder irrigation.
   Likely due to anticoagulation in the setting of foley placements.  Now
   resolved.  If recurrs, might consider urology consult
   - cont flomax
   - continue Foley, no bladder irrigation currently needed
   .
   # Anemia:  Hct stable, had 1U yesterday of prbc.  Note that patient
   required multiple transfusions during recent hospital stay and he has
   guaiac positive stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - check Hct daily
   - active T&S
   - ranitidine for guaiac positive stool
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   -Per IR:  Pt needs cholangiogram to confirm that the cystic duct is
   patent and then has the tube capped.  At six weeks post insertion the
   patient typically has an elective cholecystectomy. The attending
   surgeon who was consulted at the time of the tube being inserted(Dr

   would suggest reconsulting her
   # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   # Elevated troponin and EKG changes: Suspect patient was somewhat
   ischemic in setting of hypotension and tachycardia.
   - continue ASA
   # Acute renal failure: increased to 1.3
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds (vancomycin)
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue gentle diuresis as above
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now 1.7, restarted home
   metoprolol.
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - restarted coumadin at home dose, INR now subtherapeutic
   - increase coumadin dose to 7.5
   # Infiltrated IV site:  plastics said no compartment syndrome, appears
   stable
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who underwent a redo replacement of the aortic arch and has a history of anoxic brain injury, post-operative bacteremia, cholecystitis, and chronic heart failure. He was admitted for sepsis and found to have serratia bacteremia. The likely source of sepsis is the gastrointestinal tract or pneumonia, although the urinary tract was not ruled out initially. The patient is currently on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin, with plans to continue these medications for 6 weeks. 

The patient also has respiratory failure likely secondary to the infectious process. He is receiving empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia and has been extubated multiple times but remains dependent on mechanical ventilation due to muscle weakness, altered mental status, and pulmonary edema. 

Cold lower extremities have resolved, and the patient has a history of venous clotting but is currently on heparin and coumadin. 

The patient has altered mental status with a history of seizures and likely anoxic cerebral injury. There is no current evidence of seizure activity, but he is being monitored closely for any signs of status epilepticus. 

The patient has hematuria and benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is being treated with flomax. He also has anemia, which has been stable and has received one unit of packed red blood cells. 

Recent cholecystitis may be contributing to the patient"

   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis, found to have serratia bacteremia.
   # Septic shock/ serratia: With serratia bacteremia, most likely source
   of sepsis is GI vs urine, although UA on admission was not impressive
   (although was after antibioitics).  LFTs were normal apart from alk
   phos, so cholecystitis less likely.  Could also be due to pneumonia or
   due to PICC line infection (PICC has been removed)
   - per ID, now on Vancomycin/Cipro: Day 1 [**12-3**] of Vanc and added Cipro
   [**12-4**].  If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.  Plan to continue cipro
   x 3-4 weeks, vanco for 6 weeks (start [**11-14**])
   -hold next Vanc dose and check level
   - will send sputum Cx today (prior Cx
s have been poor samples)
   - f/u culture urine, blood
   - high vanc trough, hold next dose, repeat trough
   -will transfuse 1u PRBCs this AM given continued hypotension and anemia
   -gentle IV fluid boluses to mainatain UOP and MAP > 60
   -PICC today
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP as above. Was on trach mask at facility.
   Barriers to extubation currently include muscle weakness, altered
   mental status and pulmonary edema.
   - Yesterday was on put on trach mask and did well, will try again today
   - Speech consult pending
   - Continue combivent
   - Continue gentle diuresis with Lasix as needed, goal I/O negative ~1L
   - PM I/O check
   .
   # Cold lower extremities, Left > right; Pt does have a hx of venous
   clotting, although currently on heparin and coumadin.
   - LE ultrasound with dopplers to assess venous and arterial patency
   .
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension, possibly oversedation from anti-epileptic
   medications.
   - appreciate neurology input; stopped Phenobarbital [**12-8**] with plan to
   stop keppra next (per neuro recs)
   .
   # Hematuria and BPH:  Was described at rehab [**12-2**], now present.
   Patient was followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was
   started on flomax.  Continues to have some hematuria, has 3 way foley
   and undergoing bladder irrigation.  Likely due to anticoagulation in
   the setting of foley placements.
   - cont flomax
   - continue Foley with bladder irrigation
   -consult urology today
   .
   # Anemia:  Hct stable, had 1U yesterday of prbc.  Note that patient
   required multiple transfusions during recent hospital stay and he has
   guaiac positive stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - check Hct daily
   - active T&S
   - ranitidine for guaiac positive stool
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   -Per IR:  Pt needs cholangiogram to confirm that the cystic duct is
   patent and then has the tube capped.  At six weeks post insertion the
   patient typically has an elective cholecystectomy. The attending
   surgeon who was consulted at the time of the tube being inserted(Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) **] should have the final say on future management however and I
   would suggest reconsulting her
   # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   # Elevated troponin and EKG changes: Suspect patient was somewhat
   ischemic in setting of hypotension and tachycardia.
   - continue ASA
   # Acute renal failure: increased to 1.3
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds (vancomycin)
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue gentle diuresis as above
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now 1.7, restarted home
   metoprolol.
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - restarted coumadin at home dose, INR now subtherapeutic
   - increase coumadin dose to 7.5
   # Infiltrated IV site:  plastics said no compartment syndrome, appears
   stable
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who underwent a redo aortic arch replacement with presumed anoxic brain injury and post-operative bacteremia, as well as cholecystitis after cholecystosomy. He was admitted for sepsis and found to have serratia bacteremia, with the likely source of sepsis being the gastrointestinal tract or pneumonia. Other medical conditions include respiratory failure, altered mental status, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and dyslipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has serratia bacteremia and is at risk for further complications related to sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely secondary to infectious process and requires continued respiratory support.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has a history of seizures and likely anoxic cerebral injury, which can contribute to altered mental status.
4. Cholecystitis: The patient had recent cholecystitis, which may be contributing to the septic picture.
5. Anemia: The patient has stable hematocrit levels and received a blood transfusion yesterday.
6. Cold Lower Extremities: The patient has a history of venous clotting, and there are concerns about arterial patency due to hypotension.
7. Hematuria and BPH: The patient has ongoing hematuria and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who underwent a redo replacement aortic arch surgery with a presumed anoxic brain injury and post-operative bacteremia. He was admitted for sepsis and found to have serratia bacteremia. The source of sepsis is likely gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection. He is currently on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. The patient also has respiratory failure due to an infectious process, acute renal failure with increased creatinine, altered mental status, and a history of seizures. He has been on phenobarbital but it was stopped due to oversedation. He is also experiencing hematuria and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), anemia, recent cholecystitis, and a complicated course following aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG. He has elevated troponin levels and EKG changes indicating possible ischemia. He has a history of diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). He has an infiltrated IV site and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has serratia bacteremia, which is a common cause of sepsis. It is important to monitor his vital signs, maintain appropriate antibiotic therapy, and closely observe for any signs of organ dysfunction or failure.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to the"

   Assessment and Plan
   76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed
   anoxic brain injury and post-op bacteremia as well as cholecystitis s/p
   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis, found to have serratia bacteremia.
   .
   .
   # Sepsis: Found to have serratia bacteremia on OSH culture. Possible
   sources include GU or GI. LFTs were normal apart from alk phos, so
   cholecystitis less likely.  Could also be due to pneumonia or due to
   PICC line infection (PICC has been removed).
   - per ID: Vancomycin/Cipro: Day 1 [**12-3**] of Vanc and added Cipro [**12-4**].
   If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.  Plan to continue cipro x [**3-6**]
   weeks, vanco for 6 weeks (start [**11-14**])
   - f/u culture urine, blood cultures
   -try to avoid IVF as now volume overloaded
   -PICC today in IR
   -send new blood, urine, and sputum cx given new fever this AM
   .
   # Fever: Most likely source is femoral CVL.  Plan to pull line and
   reassess.  Other possible sources of infection include pulmonary
   effusion, urinary (pt with recent bladder irrigation and GU
   manipulation).  No leukocytosis currently.
   - sent blood, urine, sputum Cx
   - consider CT-guided thoracentesis if fevers continue after femoral
   line pulled or patient decompensates
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP as above. Was on trach mask at facility.
   Barriers to extubation currently include muscle weakness, altered
   mental status and pulmonary edema.
   - retry trache mask later today
   - Speech consult pending
   - Continue combivent
   - Lasix drip today for goal of 1 L neg today; BP cannot tolerate bolus
   dosing for diuresis
   - PM I/O check
   .
   # Acute renal failure: increased to 1.6 today, possibly related to
   recent dye load on [**12-3**], although this would be a late presentation.
   Possibly also component of ATN from episodes of hypotension.
   - follow urine output
   - spin urine sediment
   - renally dose meds (vancomycin)
   .
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension, possibly oversedation from anti-epileptic
   medications.
   - appreciate neurology input; stopped Phenobarbital [**12-8**] with plan to
   cont Keppra and Dilantin.
   - Dilantin level today is low; possibly dosing altered from stopping
   phenobarbital?  Will touch base with neurology and repeat level
   tomorrow.
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: New finding today, corrected Ca [**38**].9.  Will monitor
   for now and consider PTH tomorrow if persists.
   # Hematuria and BPH:  Was described at rehab [**12-2**], now present.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who underwent aortic arch replacement surgery and is currently in the ICU. He has a history of presumed anoxic brain injury, post-operative bacteremia, cholecystitis, and chronic kidney disease. The patient is now experiencing sepsis with a serratia bacteremia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, hypercalcemia, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, and anemia. The patient's recent medical history includes cholecystitis, atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, and a history of diastolic heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a serratia bacteremia, which can lead to further complications such as septic shock, organ failure, and death if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to increased difficulty in breathing and potential respiratory arrest.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen if not managed properly, resulting in fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and potential renal replacement therapy.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may progress to coma or persistent vegetative state if not addressed promptly.
5. Hypercalcemia: If left untreated, the patient's hypercalcemia can lead to complications such as renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who underwent a redo replacement of the aortic arch, presumed anoxic brain injury, post-operative bacteremia, and cholecystitis. He was admitted for sepsis and found to have serratia bacteremia. The most likely source of sepsis is the gastrointestinal tract. The patient is currently on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin, with plans to continue vancomycin for 6 weeks. 

The patient also has respiratory failure, likely secondary to the infectious process. He is on empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia and is being weaned off mechanical ventilation. 

There is evidence of acute renal failure, with an increased creatinine level. The patient's urine output should be closely monitored, and renal dosing of medications should be considered. 

The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to hypotension, oversedation from anti-epileptic medications, or anoxic cerebral injury. Neurological input is appreciated, and phenobarbital has been stopped. 

The patient has a history of hematuria and benign prostatic hyperplasia, which may be related to anticoagulation. Foley catheterization has been continued, and bladder irrigation is not currently needed. 

The patient has anemia, with a stable hematocrit level. He received one unit of packed red blood cells yesterday. 

Recent cholecystitis may be contributing to the patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who underwent redo replacement of the aortic arch with a presumed anoxic brain injury and post-operative bacteremia, as well as cholecystitis. He was admitted for sepsis and found to have serratia bacteremia.
- The likely source of sepsis is the gastrointestinal tract, although urine infection cannot be ruled out. The patient's LFTs were normal apart from alkaline phosphatase, making cholecystitis less likely.
- The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (Vancomycin/Cipro) and will continue with Cipro for 3-4 weeks and Vancomycin for 6 weeks.
- He is also experiencing respiratory failure, likely secondary to the infectious process. Empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) has been initiated. The patient's barriers to extubation include muscle weakness, altered mental status, and pulmonary edema.
- The patient has acute renal failure with an increase in creatinine to 1.3. Renal dosing of medications, particularly Vancomycin, needs to be considered.
- He has an altered mental status and a history of seizures, with EEG showing no current evidence of seizure activity.
- The patient also has hematuria and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which may be related to anticoagulation in the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with an unknown chief complaint. The patient has had several events in the past 24 hours, including a neurologic assessment suggesting the administration of ativan and restarting phenobarbital if seizures occur, a tracheostomy trial for 35 minutes followed by dyspnea and reinsertion of the endotracheal tube, redosing of lasix due to low urine output, placement of a PICC line, and an increase in PEEP due to elevated respiratory rates and low oxygen saturation levels. The patient has allergies to amiodarone, hyperthyroidism, monosodium glutamate, and violent headaches. The patient received vancomycin and ciprofloxacin as the last doses of antibiotics. The patient is currently on heparin sodium infusion, furosemide (lasix), and other ICU medications. 

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for new symptoms or findings noted below.

Flow Sheet Data:
The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/58 mmHg to 176/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 507 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen of 40%. The respiratory system compliance index is 162, peak inspiratory pressure is 19 cmH2O, and arterial blood gas values are not provided. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,094 mL and output of 3,815 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 721 mL. 

Physical Examination:
The patient's peripheral vascular examination, skin examination, and neurologic examination were not assessed. 

Laboratory Results:
The patient's lab results show white blood cell count of 274 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, sodium of 107 mg/dL, potassium of 1.4 mg/dL, chloride of 28 mEq/L, magnesium of 4.4 mEq/L, total carbon dioxide of 28.2%, blood urea nitrogen of 19 mg/dL, glucose of 100 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, and albumin of 3.2 g/dL. Other lab values include elevated CK and CKMB levels, normal troponin-T level, slightly elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profile with prolonged PT/PTT and INR. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium.

Radiology:
There is a chest X-ray image provided, but no specific findings are mentioned in the progress note.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is being managed in the ICU with various interventions, including nutrition support, glycemic control, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and ventilation support. The patient's code status is full code, and the current hospital unit is the ICU."

   ""Typically we do a cholangiogram through the tube to make sure that the
   cystic duct is patent, and if it is then cap the tube.  If the patient
   tolerates that we do an elective cholecystectomy at 6 weeks after
   placement.  HOWEVER, Mr. [**Known lastname 2149**] is a very, very poor candidate for any
   additional surgical procedure at this time or in the near future.
   If you really want the tube out at 6 weeks from insertion you can get a
   study through it to see if the cystic duct is patent, cap it to see if
   her tolerates the normal flow of bile and then simply take the tube out
   after tolerating having it capped and asymptomatic for 2 or more days.
   Simply keeping the tube in is not a problem, especially as it does let
   us know that his gallbladder is not the source of his sepsis (when he
   comes in the next time
.).  I think that management of the tube depends
   very much on his overall status.""

   # Sepsis: Found to have serratia bacteremia on OSH culture. Possible
   sources include GU or GI. LFTs were normal apart from alk phos, so
   cholecystitis less likely.  Could also be due to pneumonia or due to
   PICC line infection (PICC has been removed).
   Sputum with GNR on [**12-10**].
   - per ID: Vancomycin/Cipro: Day 1 [**12-3**] of Vanc and added Cipro [**12-4**].
   If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.  Plan to continue cipro x [**3-6**]
   weeks, vanco for 6 weeks (start [**11-14**])
   - f/u culture blood, sputum
   -try to avoid IVF as now volume overloaded
   # Fever: Most likely source is femoral CVL.  Pullled on [**12-10**].  Other
   possible sources of infection include pulmonary effusion, urinary (pt
   with recent bladder irrigation and GU manipulation).  No leukocytosis
   currently.
   - consider CT-guided thoracentesis if fevers continue after femoral
   line pulled or patient decompensates
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP as above. Was on trach mask at facility.
   Barriers to extubation currently include muscle weakness and pulmonary
   edema.  Now on [**5-10**].
   - retry trache mask later today
   - Speech consult pending
   - Continue combivent
   - Lasix drip today for goal of 1 L neg today; BP cannot tolerate bolus
   dosing for diuresis.  Turn down dose this am given elevated creatinine
   - PM I/O check
   -check NIF
   # Acute renal failure: increased today, possibly related to recent dye
   load on [**12-3**], although this would be a late presentation.  Possibly
   also component of ATN from episodes of hypotension.
   - follow urine output
   -pm lytes
   - renally dose meds (vancomycin)
   - ask renal if would like to spin urine
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension, possibly oversedation from anti-epileptic
   medications.  Now improved.
   - appreciate neurology input; stopped Phenobarbital [**12-8**] with plan to
   cont Keppra and Dilantin.
   - Dilantin level today is pending; Will touch base with neurology and
   repeat level tomorrow.
   # Hypercalcemia: New finding yesterday, corrected Ca [**38**].9.
   -check PTH
   # Hematuria and BPH:  Was described at rehab [**12-2**]/  Patient was
   followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was started on
   flomax.  Continued to have some hematuria during this hospitalization,
   has 3 way foley and undergoing bladder irrigation.  Likely due to
   anticoagulation in the setting of foley placements.  Now resolved.  If
   recurrs, might consider urology consult
   - continue Foley, no bladder irrigation currently needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now 2.5, restarted home
   metoprolol.
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - coumadin dose at 7.5
   - stop heparin gtt when therapeutic x 48 hrs
   # Anemia:  Hct stable, had 1U during admission of prbc.  Note that
   patient required multiple transfusions during recent hospital stay and
   he has guaiac positive stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - check Hct daily
   - active T&S
   - ranitidine for guaiac positive stool
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
the tube in is not a problem, especially as it does
   let us know that his gallbladder is not the source of his sepsis (when
   he comes in the next time
.).  I think that management of the tube
   depends very much on his overall status.""
   # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   .
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue gentle diuresis as above
   # Infiltrated IV site:  plastics said no compartment syndrome, appears
   stable
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who has had a complicated medical history, including redo aortic arch replacement, anoxic brain injury, post-operative bacteremia, cholecystitis, and chronic conditions such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is currently in the ICU for sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, and hypercalcemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of serratia bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis. The possible sources of infection include the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract, pneumonia, or a PICC line infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to an infectious process. Empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) has been initiated. Barriers to extubation include muscle weakness and pulmonary edema.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, possibly due to recent dye load or episodes of hypotension.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has a history of seizures and anoxic cerebral injury. The altered mental status may be due to hypotension or oversedation from anti-epileptic medications.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient has a new finding of hypercalcemia, which needs further evaluation and management.

   - [**Doctor Last Name **] emailed back regarding chole tube.  Said:
   ""Typically we do a cholangiogram through the tube to make sure that the
   cystic duct is patent, and if it is then cap the tube.  If the patient
   tolerates that we do an elective cholecystectomy at 6 weeks after
   placement.  HOWEVER, Mr. [**Known lastname 2149**] is a very, very poor candidate for any
   additional surgical procedure at this time or in the near future.
   If you really want the tube out at 6 weeks from insertion you can get a
   study through it to see if the cystic duct is patent, cap it to see if
   her tolerates the normal flow of bile and then simply take the tube out
   after tolerating having it capped and asymptomatic for 2 or more days.
   Simply keeping the tube in is not a problem, especially as it does let
   us know that his gallbladder is not the source of his sepsis (when he
   comes in the next time
.).  I think that management of the tube depends
   very much on his overall status.""

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history. He has been admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has undergone multiple surgeries including redo aortic arch replacement, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and cholecystosomy. He also has a history of seizures and anoxic brain injury.

The patient's current condition includes fever with an unknown source, positive blood cultures for Serratia bacteremia, and a sputum culture showing 4+ GNR. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin) and is planned to continue for 3-6 weeks. The femoral central venous line has been removed.

The patient is mechanically ventilated with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 40%, and PEEP 8 cmH2O. His respiratory status is stable with a respiratory system compliance of 50 and a plateau pressure of 14 cmH2O. His mental status has improved, but he still requires sedation.

The patient's renal function is impaired with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL. His calcium level is elevated at 10.9 mg/dL, and his hemoglobin is stable at 9.1 g/dL. He has"

   placement.  HOWEVER, Mr. [**Known lastname 2149**] is a very, very poor candidate for any
   additional surgical procedure at this time or in the near future.
   If you really want the tube out at 6 weeks from insertion you can get a
   study through it to see if the cystic duct is patent, cap it to see if
   her tolerates the normal flow of bile and then simply take the tube out
   after tolerating having it capped and asymptomatic for 2 or more days.
   Simply keeping the tube in is not a problem, especially as it does let

   Patient was followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who has undergone redo aortic arch replacement with presumed anoxic brain injury and post-operative bacteremia. He is currently admitted for sepsis, acute respiratory failure, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and dyslipidemia. The patient has a history of seizures, anoxic cerebral injury, cholecystitis, and aortic dissection. He is also diagnosed with hypercalcemia, hematuria, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has serratia bacteremia and possible sources include gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract infections. Empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia is being given, and blood and sputum cultures are pending.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has acute respiratory failure secondary to the infectious process. He is currently on mechanical ventilation but barriers to extubation include muscle weakness, altered mental status, and pulmonary edema.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.6, possibly related to recent dye load or hypotension. Renal dosing of medications, especially vancomycin, is necessary.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has a history of seizures and likely anoxic cerebral injury. No current evidence of seizure activity, but EEG was negative for seizure so likely due to hypotension or overs"

   76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed

   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis, found to have serratia bacteremia.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP with Vanc/Cipro (Vanc D1 [**11-14**], Cipro [**12-4**]).
   Was on trach mask at facility occassionally.  Barriers to extubation
   currently include muscle weakness and pulmonary edema.
   - RSBI, SBT and retry trache mask daily
   - Speech consult pending
   - Continue combivent
   - Lasix drip today for goal of 1 L neg today; BP cannot tolerate bolus
   dosing for diuresis
   - PM I/O check
   # Sepsis: Found to have serratia bacteremia on OSH culture. Possible
   sources include GU or GI. LFTs were normal apart from alk phos, so
   cholecystitis less likely.  Could also be due to pneumonia or due to
   PICC line infection (PICC has been removed).
   Sputum with GNR on [**12-10**].
   - per ID:  If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.  Plan to continue
   cipro X4 weeks (change to PO when is absorbing), vanco for 6 weeks
   (start [**11-14**])
   - f/u culture blood, sputum
   -try to avoid IVF as now volume overloaded
   # Acute renal failure: decreased .  Likely combination of ATN and
   hypovolemia given small amount of granual casts
   - follow urine output
   -pm lytes
   - renally dose meds (vancomycin)
   - renal consult if no improvement
   # Fever: Currently afebrile Most likely source is femoral CVL.  Pullled
   on [**12-10**].  Other possible sources of infection include pulmonary
   effusion, urinary (pt with recent bladder irrigation and GU
   manipulation).  No leukocytosis currently.
   - consider CT-guided thoracentesis if fevers continue after femoral
   line pulled or patient decompensates
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension, possibly oversedation from anti-epileptic
   medications.  Now improved.
   - appreciate neurology input; stopped Phenobarbital [**12-8**] with plan to
   cont Keppra and Dilantin.
   - dilantin corrected needs to be between 6 and 8 corrected for
   albumin.  keep checking daily levels for now to see if going up (at
   rehab can check every few days)(coumadin should make it go up and was
   only started a few days ago).
   -add dilantin level onto am labs
   # Hypercalcemia: New finding, corrected Ca [**38**].9.   PTH is in Normal
   range of 34.  Differential includes malignancy, renal failure.
   -continue to monitor to see if decreases with improving renal failure
   # Hematuria and BPH:  Was described at rehab [**12-2**]  Patient was
   followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was started on
   flomax.  Continued to have some hematuria during this hospitalization,
   has 3 way foley and undergoing bladder irrigation.  Likely due to
   anticoagulation in the setting of foley placements.  Now resolved.  If
   recurrs, might consider urology consult
   - continue Foley, no bladder irrigation currently needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now 3.1, restarted home
   metoprolol.
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - coumadin dose at 7.5, decrease today
s dose to 5mg
   - stop heparin gtt as now therapeutic
   # Anemia:  Hct stable, had 1U during admission of prbc.  Note that
   patient required multiple transfusions during recent hospital stay and
   he has guaiac positive stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - check Hct daily
   - active T&S
   - ranitidine for guaiac positive stool
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
the tube in is not a problem, especially as it does
   let us know that his gallbladder is not the source of his sepsis (when
   he comes in the next time
.).  I think that management of the tube
   depends very much on his overall status.""
   # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   .
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue gentle diuresis as above
   # Infiltrated IV site:  plastics said no compartment syndrome, appears
   stable
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who underwent redo replacement aortic arch surgery and is experiencing multiple medical complications. He has a history of anoxic brain injury, post-operative bacteremia, cholecystitis, and sepsis. Currently, he is in the ICU for respiratory failure due to an infectious process. The patient also has sepsis with serratia bacteremia, acute renal failure, fever, altered mental status, hypercalcemia, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, and a history of diastolic heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure secondary to an infectious process. Current management includes tracheostomy, CPAP/PSV ventilation, and antibiotics (Vanc/Cipro). Daily RSBI, SBT, and attempts to retry tracheostomy mask are planned.

2. Sepsis: The patient has serratia bacteremia, and potential sources include the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts. Antibiotics (Meropenem) may be considered if the patient decompensates. Blood and sputum cultures are pending, and the plan is to continue Cipro for four weeks and Vancomycin for six weeks.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has decreased, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and hypovolemia. Monitoring urine output, performing a PM lytes test,"

   76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed
   anoxic brain injury and post-op bacteremia as well as cholecystitis s/p
   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis, found to have serratia bacteremia.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP with Vanc/Cipro (Vanc D1 [**11-14**], Cipro [**12-4**]).
   Was on trach mask at facility occassionally.  Barriers to extubation
   currently include muscle weakness and pulmonary edema.
   - RSBI, SBT and retry trache mask daily
   - Speech consult pending
   - Continue combivent
   - Lasix drip today for goal of 1 L neg today; BP cannot tolerate bolus
   dosing for diuresis
   - PM I/O check
   # Sepsis: Found to have serratia bacteremia on OSH culture. Possible
   sources include GU or GI. LFTs were normal apart from alk phos, so
   cholecystitis less likely.  Could also be due to pneumonia or due to
   PICC line infection (PICC has been removed).
   Sputum with GNR on [**12-10**].
   - per ID:  If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.  Plan to continue
   cipro X4 weeks (change to PO when is absorbing), vanco for 6 weeks
   (start [**11-14**])
   - f/u culture blood, sputum
   -try to avoid IVF as now volume overloaded
   # Acute renal failure: decreased .  Likely combination of ATN and
   hypovolemia given small amount of granual casts
   - follow urine output
   -pm lytes
   - renally dose meds (vancomycin)
   - renal consult if no improvement
   -foley was changed over the weekend
   # Fever: Currently afebrile Most likely source is femoral CVL.  Pullled
   on [**12-10**].  Other possible sources of infection include pulmonary
   effusion, urinary (pt with recent bladder irrigation and GU
   manipulation).  No leukocytosis currently.
   - consider CT-guided thoracentesis if fevers continue after femoral
   line pulled or patient decompensates
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension, possibly oversedation from anti-epileptic
   medications.  Now improved.
   - appreciate neurology input; stopped Phenobarbital [**12-8**] with plan to
   cont Keppra and Dilantin.
   - dilantin corrected needs to be between 6 and 8 corrected for
   albumin.  keep checking daily levels for now to see if going up (at
   rehab can check every few days)(coumadin should make it go up and was
   only started a few days ago).
   -add dilantin level onto am labs: within normal range
   # Hypercalcemia: New finding, corrected Ca [**38**].9.   PTH is in Normal
   range of 34.  Differential includes malignancy, renal failure.
   -continue to monitor to see if decreases with improving renal failure
   as it already has started to this am.
   # Hematuria and BPH:  Was described at rehab [**12-2**]  Patient was
   followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was started on
   flomax.  Continued to have some hematuria during this hospitalization,
   has 3 way foley and undergoing bladder irrigation.  Likely due to
   anticoagulation in the setting of foley placements.  Now resolved.  If
   recurrs, might consider urology consult
   - continue Foley, no bladder irrigation currently needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now 3.1, restarted home
   metoprolol.
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - coumadin dose at 7.5, decrease today
s dose to 5mg
   - stop heparin gtt as now therapeutic
   # Anemia:  Hct stable, had 1U during admission of prbc.  Note that
   patient required multiple transfusions during recent hospital stay and
   he has guaiac positive stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - check Hct daily
   - active T&S
   - ranitidine for guaiac positive stool
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
the tube in is not a problem, especially as it does
   let us know that his gallbladder is not the source of his sepsis (when
   he comes in the next time
.).  I think that management of the tube
   depends very much on his overall status.""
   # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   .
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue gentle diuresis as above
   # Infiltrated IV site:  plastics said no compartment syndrome, appears
   stable
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including a recent redo aortic arch replacement, anoxic brain injury, post-operative bacteremia, cholecystitis, and chronic conditions such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently in the ICU for sepsis, respiratory failure, and other complications. His current medications include multiple antibiotics, anticoagulants, antiepileptics, diuretics, and statins.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has impaired respiratory function, likely secondary to the infectious process. He requires ongoing respiratory support, and barriers to extubation include muscle weakness and pulmonary edema. Daily RSBI, SBT, and tracheostomy tube assessment are planned.
2. Sepsis: The patient has serratia bacteremia and potential sources of infection include the gastrointestinal or genitourinary systems. Empiric therapy with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin has been initiated. Further cultures and antibiotic adjustment may be necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, likely due to a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and hypovolemia. Renal dosing of medications, such as vancomycin, is required. Foley catheter changes and fluid management are important considerations.
4. Fever: The patient's fever may be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, anemia, dyslipidemia, cholecystitis, and aortic dissection. He is currently on various medications including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, Dilantin, and Coumadin. The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased oxygen saturation. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's lab results indicate acute kidney injury, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. There are multiple pending lab results and imaging studies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of infection (GNR in sputum) suggest the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's low respiratory rate and inadequate oxygenation despite being on mechanical ventilation indicate potential respiratory failure. Adjustments to ventilator settings may be necessary.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's granular casts in urine and decreased urine output suggest acute kidney injury. Monitoring renal function and ensuring adequate fluid balance is crucial.
4. Hepatic Dysfunction: The abnormal liver function tests may indicate hepatic dysfunction. Further investigation and close monitoring of liver enzymes are required."

   76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed
   anoxic brain injury and post-op bacteremia as well as cholecystitis s/p
   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis, found to have serratia bacteremia.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP with Vanc/Cipro (Vanc D1 [**11-14**], Cipro [**12-4**]).
   Was on trach mask at facility occassionally.  Barriers to extubation
   currently include muscle weakness and pulmonary edema.
   - RSBI, SBT and retry trache mask daily
   - Speech consult pending
   - Continue combivent
   - Lasix drip today for goal of 1 L neg today; BP cannot tolerate bolus
   dosing for diuresis
   - PM I/O check
   # Sepsis: Found to have serratia bacteremia on OSH culture. Possible
   sources include GU or GI. LFTs were normal apart from alk phos, so
   cholecystitis less likely.  Could also be due to pneumonia or due to
   PICC line infection (PICC has been removed).
   Sputum with GNR on [**12-10**].
   - per ID:  If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.  Plan to continue
   cipro X4 weeks (change to PO when is absorbing), vanco for 6 weeks
   (start [**11-14**])
   - f/u culture blood, sputum
   -try to avoid IVF as now volume overloaded
   # Acute renal failure: decreased .  Likely combination of ATN and
   hypovolemia given small amount of granual casts
   - follow urine output
   -pm lytes
   - renally dose meds (vancomycin)
   - renal consult if no improvement
   # Fever: Currently afebrile Most likely source is femoral CVL.  Pullled
   on [**12-10**].  Other possible sources of infection include pulmonary
   effusion, urinary (pt with recent bladder irrigation and GU
   manipulation).  No leukocytosis currently.
   - consider CT-guided thoracentesis if fevers continue after femoral
   line pulled or patient decompensates
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension, possibly oversedation from anti-epileptic
   medications.  Now improved.
   - appreciate neurology input; stopped Phenobarbital [**12-8**] with plan to
   cont Keppra and Dilantin.
   - dilantin corrected needs to be between 6 and 8 corrected for
   albumin.  keep checking daily levels for now to see if going up (at
   rehab can check every few days)(coumadin should make it go up and was
   only started a few days ago).
   -add dilantin level onto am labs
   # Hypercalcemia: New finding, corrected Ca [**38**].9.   PTH is in Normal
   range of 34.  Differential includes malignancy, renal failure.
   -continue to monitor to see if decreases with improving renal failure
   # Hematuria and BPH:  Was described at rehab [**12-2**]  Patient was
   followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was started on
   flomax.  Continued to have some hematuria during this hospitalization,
   has 3 way foley and undergoing bladder irrigation.  Likely due to
   anticoagulation in the setting of foley placements.  Now resolved.  If
   recurrs, might consider urology consult
   - continue Foley, no bladder irrigation currently needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now 3.1, restarted home
   metoprolol.
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - coumadin dose at 7.5, decrease today
s dose to 5mg
   - stop heparin gtt as now therapeutic
   # Anemia:  Hct stable, had 1U during admission of prbc.  Note that
   patient required multiple transfusions during recent hospital stay and
   he has guaiac positive stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - check Hct daily
   - active T&S
   - ranitidine for guaiac positive stool
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
the tube in is not a problem, especially as it does
   let us know that his gallbladder is not the source of his sepsis (when
   he comes in the next time
.).  I think that management of the tube
   depends very much on his overall status.""
   # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   .
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue gentle diuresis as above
   # Infiltrated IV site:  plastics said no compartment syndrome, appears
   stable
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history. He underwent a redo aortic arch replacement with presumed anoxic brain injury and post-operative bacteremia, as well as cholecystitis following a cholecystosomy. The patient is currently admitted for sepsis and respiratory failure, likely secondary to the infectious process. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including acute renal failure, fever, altered mental status, hypercalcemia, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Additionally, the patient has a history of diastolic heart failure, anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's current medications include acetaminophen, albuterol, aspirin, bisacodyl, ciprofloxacin, docusate sodium, famotidine, furosemide, heparin, levetiracetam, lidocaine jelly, lorazepam, metoprolol, nystatin, oxycodone, phenytoin, potassium chloride, senna, simvastatin, sodium chloride, vancomycin, and warfarin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 78/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on the tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 317 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, sodium of 135 mEq/L, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, and glucose of 106 mg/dL. 

The patient's plan includes ongoing respiratory support, continued antibiotic therapy for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and serratia bacteremia, daily attempts at extubation with a tracheostomy mask, and further evaluation for sources of infection. Renal function should be closely monitored, and the patient's mental status should be evaluated regularly.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications requiring ongoing management in the ICU. The patient's respiratory failure, sepsis, renal failure, and other medical issues need to be addressed with a multidisciplinary approach."

   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process.
   Empiric therapy for HAP with Vanc/Cipro (Vanc D1 [**11-14**], Cipro [**12-4**]).
   Was on trach mask at facility occassionally.  Barriers to extubation
   currently include muscle weakness and pulmonary edema.
   - RSBI, SBT and retry trache mask daily
   - Speech consult pending
   - Continue combivent
   - Lasix drip today for goal of 1 L neg today; BP cannot tolerate bolus
   dosing for diuresis
   - PM I/O check
   # Sepsis: Found to have serratia bacteremia on OSH culture. Possible
   sources include GU or GI. LFTs were normal apart from alk phos, so
   cholecystitis less likely.  Could also be due to pneumonia or due to
   PICC line infection (PICC has been removed).
   Sputum with GNR on [**12-10**].
   - per ID:  If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.  Plan to continue
   cipro X4 weeks (change to PO when is absorbing), vanco for 6 weeks
   (start [**11-14**])
   - f/u culture blood, sputum
   -try to avoid IVF as now volume overloaded
   # Acute renal failure: decreased .  Likely combination of ATN and
   hypovolemia given small amount of granual casts
   - follow urine output
   -pm lytes
   - renally dose meds (vancomycin)
   - renal consult if no improvement
   -foley was changed over the weekend
   # Fever: Currently afebrile Most likely source is femoral CVL.  Pullled
   on [**12-10**].  Other possible sources of infection include pulmonary
   effusion, urinary (pt with recent bladder irrigation and GU
   manipulation).  No leukocytosis currently.
   - consider CT-guided thoracentesis if fevers continue after femoral
   line pulled or patient decompensates
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension, possibly oversedation from anti-epileptic
   medications.  Now improved.
   - appreciate neurology input; stopped Phenobarbital [**12-8**] with plan to
   cont Keppra and Dilantin.
   - dilantin corrected needs to be between 6 and 8 corrected for
   albumin.  keep checking daily levels for now to see if going up (at
   rehab can check every few days)(coumadin should make it go up and was
   only started a few days ago).
   -add dilantin level onto am labs: within normal range
   # Hypercalcemia: New finding, corrected Ca [**38**].9.   PTH is in Normal
   range of 34.  Differential includes malignancy, renal failure.
   -continue to monitor to see if decreases with improving renal failure
   as it already has started to this am.
   # Hematuria and BPH:  Was described at rehab [**12-2**]  Patient was
   followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was started on
   flomax.  Continued to have some hematuria during this hospitalization,
   has 3 way foley and undergoing bladder irrigation.  Likely due to
   anticoagulation in the setting of foley placements.  Now resolved.  If
   recurrs, might consider urology consult
   - continue Foley, no bladder irrigation currently needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now 3.1, restarted home
   metoprolol.
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - coumadin dose at 7.5, decrease today
s dose to 5mg
   - stop heparin gtt as now therapeutic
   # Anemia:  Hct stable, had 1U during admission of prbc.  Note that
   patient required multiple transfusions during recent hospital stay and
   he has guaiac positive stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - check Hct daily
   - active T&S
   - ranitidine for guaiac positive stool
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
the tube in is not a problem, especially as it does
   let us know that his gallbladder is not the source of his sepsis (when
   he comes in the next time
.).  I think that management of the tube
   depends very much on his overall status.""
   # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue gentle diuresis as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who underwent a redo aortic arch replacement with a presumed anoxic brain injury and post-operative bacteremia. He was admitted for sepsis and found to have serratia bacteremia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely secondary to an infectious process and is currently on empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. Barriers to extubation include muscle weakness and pulmonary edema. The plan is to retry the tracheostomy mask daily, continue combined, and Lasix drip for fluid balance.

2. Sepsis: The patient has serratia bacteremia and possible sources include the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts. LFTs were normal apart from elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, making cholecystitis less likely. The ID plan includes continuing ciprofloxacin for four weeks and vancomycin for six weeks, starting from [2137-11-14]. Follow-up cultures are pending.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has decreased urine output and likely has a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and hypovolemia. Renal dose adjustments are needed for medications such as vancomycin. A renal consult is recommended if there is no improvement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who underwent a redo replacement of the aortic arch, presumably with anoxic brain injury, post-operative bacteremia, and cholecystitis. He was admitted for sepsis and found to have serratia bacteremia. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, sepsis, acute renal failure, fever, altered mental status with a history of seizures, hypercalcemia, hematuria, atrial fibrillation with upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and anemia. He also has a history of recent cholecystitis, aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG, diastolic heart failure, an infiltrated IV site, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to the infectious process. Barriers to extubation include muscle weakness and pulmonary edema. Continuous monitoring of respiratory function and ongoing management of pulmonary edema are necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient has serratia bacteremia, which may be due to gastrointestinal or genitourinary sources. Ongoing surveillance for new infection sources and appropriate antibiotic therapy are required.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may be a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and hypovolemia. Close monitoring of urine output, electrolyte levels, and medication dosing based on renal function are essential.
4. Fever: The patient's fever may be caused by femoral central venous line infection, which has already been removed. Other potential sources include pulmonary effusion and urinary tract infection. Further investigation and appropriate management are needed.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hypotension, medication oversedation, or anoxic cerebral injury. Neurological evaluation, EEG monitoring, and adjustment of anti-epileptic medications are necessary.
6. Hypercalcemia: The patient has new-onset hypercalcemia with a corrected calcium level of 9.8. Differential diagnosis includes malignancy and renal failure. Ongoing monitoring and management are required.
7. Hematuria: The patient continues to have hematuria, likely due to anticoagulation and recent foley catheterization. Close monitoring of urine output and consideration of urology consultation if recurrent hematuria persists.
8. Atrial Fibrillation and Upper Extremity DVTs: The patient's atrial fibrillation and DVTs require ongoing anticoagulation management. Adjustments in anticoagulant dosing and consideration of rate control medications may be necessary.
9. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but ongoing monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion as needed are essential.
10. Recent Cholecystitis: The patient's recent cholecystitis may contribute to the septic picture. Ongoing"

   Assessment and Plan
   76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed
   anoxic brain injury and post-op bacteremia as well as cholecystitis s/p
   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis, found to have serratia bacteremia.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process on
   admission.  Empiric therapy for HAP with Vanc/Cipro (Vanc D1 [**11-14**],
   Cipro [**12-4**]). Was on trach mask at facility occassionally.  Barriers to
   extubation currently include muscle weakness and pulmonary edema.
   - RSBI, SBT and retry trach mask daily
   - Continue combivent
   - Lasix drip today for goal of 1 L neg today, have not been diuresing
   well.  Will increase Lasix gtt and be aggressive about diuresis.  Low
   BPs may be inaccurate and will be somewhat tolerant of occasional lower
   BPs.  Will also concentrate tube feeds to decrease po intake
   - PM I/O check
   # Sepsis: Found to have serratia bacteremia on OSH culture. Possible
   sources include GU or GI. LFTs were normal apart from alk phos, so
   cholecystitis less likely.  Could also be due to pneumonia or due to
   PICC line infection (PICC has been removed).
   Sputum with GNR on [**12-10**].
   - per ID:  If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.  Plan to continue
   cipro X4 weeks (change to PO when is absorbing), vanco for 6 weeks
   (start [**11-14**])
   - f/u culture blood, sputum
   # Acute renal failure: Now stable .  Likely combination of ATN and
   hypovolemia given small amount of granual casts
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds (vancomycin)
   - renal consult if no improvement
   - foley was changed over the weekend
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension, possibly oversedation from anti-epileptic
   medications.  Now improved.
   - appreciate neurology input; stopped Phenobarbital [**12-8**] with plan to
   cont Keppra and Dilantin.
   - dilantin corrected needs to be between 6 and 8 corrected for
   albumin.  keep checking daily levels for now to see if going up (at
   rehab can check every few days)(coumadin should make it go up and was
   only started a few days ago).
   - needs f/u appointment scheduled
   # Hypercalcemia: Has resolved.   PTH is in Normal range of 34.
   Differential includes malignancy, renal failure.
   -continue to monitor
   # Hematuria and BPH:  Was described at rehab [**12-2**]  Patient was
   followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was started on
   flomax.  Continued to have some hematuria during this hospitalization,
   has 3 way foley and have stopped bladder irrigation.  Likely due to
   anticoagulation in the setting of foley placements.
   - continue Foley, no bladder irrigation currently needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now supratherapeutic.
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - coumadin dose now at 5mg
   - stop heparin gtt as now therapeutic
   # Anemia:  Hct stable, had 1U during admission of prbc.  Note that
   patient required multiple transfusions during recent hospital stay and
   he has guaiac positive stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - check Hct daily
   - active T&S
   - ranitidine for guaiac positive stool
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
the tube in is not a problem, especially as it does
   let us know that his gallbladder is not the source of his sepsis (when
   he comes in the next time
.).  I think that management of the tube
   depends very much on his overall status.""
   # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue diuresis as above
   # Infiltrated IV site:  plastics said no compartment syndrome, appears
   stable
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who underwent a redo replacement of the aortic arch with presumed anoxic brain injury and post-operative bacteremia as well as cholecystitis after a cholecystosomy. He was admitted for sepsis and found to have serratia bacteremia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, sepsis, acute renal failure, altered mental status with a history of seizures and likely anoxic cerebral injury, hypercalcemia, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure secondary to the infectious process. He is on mechanical ventilation, but barriers to extubation include muscle weakness and pulmonary edema. Close monitoring and daily attempts at weaning off the ventilator are recommended.
2. Sepsis: The patient has serratia bacteremia, which could be due to various sources such as the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is being administered, and further cultures are pending. Regular monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is currently stable, but he has a combination of acute tubular necrosis and hypovolemia. Daily urine output monitoring, careful medication dosing, and consultation with a nephrologist if there is no improvement"

   Assessment and Plan
   76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed
   anoxic brain injury and post-op bacteremia as well as cholecystitis s/p
   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis, found to have serratia bacteremia.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process on
   admission.  Empiric therapy for HAP with Vanc/Cipro (Vanc D1 [**11-14**],
   Cipro [**12-4**]). Was on trach mask at facility occassionally.  Barriers to
   extubation currently include muscle weakness and pulmonary edema.
   - RSBI, SBT and retry trach mask daily
   - Continue combivent
   - Lasix drip today for goal of 1 L neg today, have not been diuresing
   well.  Will increase Lasix gtt and be aggressive about diuresis.  Low
   BPs may be inaccurate and will be somewhat tolerant of occasional lower
   BPs.  Will also concentrate tube feeds to decrease po intake
   # Sepsis: Found to have serratia bacteremia on OSH culture. Possible
   sources include GU or GI. LFTs were normal apart from alk phos, so
   cholecystitis less likely.  Could also be due to pneumonia or due to
   PICC line infection (PICC has been removed).
   Sputum with GNR on [**12-10**].
   - per ID:  If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.  Plan to continue
   cipro X4 weeks (change to PO when is absorbing), vanco for 6 weeks
   (start [**11-14**])
   - f/u culture blood, sputum
   # Acute renal failure:  Likely combination of ATN and hypovolemia given
   small amount of granual casts.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds (vancomycin)
   - renal consult if no improvement
   - foley was changed over the weekend
   # Abdominal pain: unclear cause, LFTs unchanged.  Possibly reaction to
   change in tube feeds?
   - speak with nutrition
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension, possibly oversedation from anti-epileptic
   medications.  Now improved.
   - appreciate neurology input; stopped Phenobarbital [**12-8**] with plan to
   cont Keppra and Dilantin.
   - dilantin corrected needs to be between 6 and 8 corrected for
   albumin.  keep checking daily levels for now to see if going up (at
   rehab can check every few days)(coumadin should make it go up and was
   only started a few days ago).
   - has neuro f/u appointment scheduled
   # Hypercalcemia: Has resolved.   PTH is in Normal range of 34.
   Differential includes malignancy, renal failure.
   -continue to monitor
   # Hematuria and BPH:  Was described at rehab [**12-2**]  Patient was
   followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was started on
   flomax.  Continued to have some hematuria during this hospitalization,
   has 3 way foley and have stopped bladder irrigation.  Likely due to
   anticoagulation in the setting of foley placements.
   - continue Foley, no bladder irrigation currently needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now supratherapeutic.
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - coumadin dose now at 5mg
   # Anemia:  Hct stable, had 1U during admission of prbc.  Note that
   patient required multiple transfusions during recent hospital stay and
   he has guaiac positive stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - check Hct daily
   - active T&S
   - ranitidine for guaiac positive stool
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
the tube in is not a problem, especially as it does
   let us know that his gallbladder is not the source of his sepsis (when
   he comes in the next time
.).  I think that management of the tube
   depends very much on his overall status.""
   # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue diuresis as above
   # Infiltrated IV site:  plastics said no compartment syndrome, appears
   stable
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

","The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who underwent redo replacement of the aortic arch with presumed anoxic brain injury and post-operative bacteremia as well as cholecystitis, resulting in sepsis. The patient is currently admitted for respiratory failure, sepsis, acute renal failure, abdominal pain, altered mental status, hypercalcemia, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and recent cholecystitis. The patient has a complicated medical history including aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG, diastolic heart failure, and a history of seizures.

The patient's current condition includes being on mechanical ventilation, receiving tube feeds, and having multiple IV lines. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 140/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient also has electrolyte imbalances, including low potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include ongoing respiratory failure, sepsis, acute renal failure, abdominal pain, altered mental status, hypercalcemia, hematuria, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and potential endovascular seeding due to the patient's recent cardiac surgery. The patient requires close monitoring and management of these conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed
   anoxic brain injury and post-op bacteremia as well as cholecystitis s/p
   cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis, found to have serratia bacteremia.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to infectious process on
   admission.  Empiric therapy for HAP with Vanc/Cipro (Vanc D1 [**11-14**],
   Cipro [**12-4**]). Was on trach mask at facility occassionally.  Barriers to
   extubation currently include muscle weakness and pulmonary edema.
   - RSBI, SBT and retry trach mask daily
   - Continue combivent
   - Lasix drip today for goal of 1 L neg today, have not been diuresing
   well.  Will increase Lasix gtt and be aggressive about diuresis.  Low
   BPs may be inaccurate and will be somewhat tolerant of occasional lower
   BPs.  Will also concentrate tube feeds to decrease po intake
   - PM I/O check
   # Sepsis: Found to have serratia bacteremia on OSH culture. Possible
   sources include GU or GI. LFTs were normal apart from alk phos, so
   cholecystitis less likely.  Could also be due to pneumonia or due to
   PICC line infection (PICC has been removed).
   Sputum with GNR on [**12-10**].
   - per ID:  If decompensates, Meropenem appropriate.  Plan to continue
   cipro X4 weeks (change to PO when is absorbing), vanco for 6 weeks
   (start [**11-14**])
   - f/u culture blood, sputum
   # Acute renal failure: Now stable .  Likely combination of ATN and
   hypovolemia given small amount of granual casts
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds (vancomycin)
   - renal consult if no improvement
   - foley was changed over the weekend
   # Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral
   Injury:  No current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a
   history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.  EEG neg for seizure so
   likely due to hypotension, possibly oversedation from anti-epileptic
   medications.  Now improved.
   - appreciate neurology input; stopped Phenobarbital [**12-8**] with plan to
   cont Keppra and Dilantin.
   - dilantin corrected needs to be between 6 and 8 corrected for
   albumin.  keep checking daily levels for now to see if going up (at
   rehab can check every few days)(coumadin should make it go up and was
   only started a few days ago).
   - needs f/u appointment scheduled
   # Hypercalcemia: Has resolved.   PTH is in Normal range of 34.
   Differential includes malignancy, renal failure.
   -continue to monitor
   # Hematuria and BPH:  Was described at rehab [**12-2**]  Patient was
   followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was started on
   flomax.  Continued to have some hematuria during this hospitalization,
   has 3 way foley and have stopped bladder irrigation.  Likely due to
   anticoagulation in the setting of foley placements.
   - continue Foley, no bladder irrigation currently needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR now supratherapeutic.
   - consider stopping dronederone as this is not keeping him in sinus
   (emailed cardiologist)
   - coumadin dose now at 5mg
   - stop heparin gtt as now therapeutic
   # Anemia:  Hct stable, had 1U during admission of prbc.  Note that
   patient required multiple transfusions during recent hospital stay and
   he has guaiac positive stool as well as recent hematuria.
   - check Hct daily
   - active T&S
   - ranitidine for guaiac positive stool
   # Recent Cholecystitis:   As above this may be contributing to the
   patient's septic picture.  Abdominal exam and LFTs somewhat
   reassuring.  Gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] states perc tube in place.
   Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
the tube in is not a problem, especially as it does
   let us know that his gallbladder is not the source of his sepsis (when
   he comes in the next time
.).  I think that management of the tube
   depends very much on his overall status.""
   # S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  Long, complicated course
   following the procedure.  CT surgery consulted in the ED.  Recently had
   TEE that did not show vegetations on grafts or pacemaker leads, but at
   risk for endovascular seeding, particularly if blood cultures come back
   positive.
   - follow any CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Continue simvastatin and ASA
   # h/o diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue diuresis as above
   # Infiltrated IV site:  plastics said no compartment syndrome, appears
   stable
   -heating compresses, elevate above heart
   # Hyperlipidemia:  continue statin

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who underwent redo replacement of the aortic arch with presumed anoxic brain injury and post-operative bacteremia, as well as cholecystitis, admitted for sepsis. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure secondary to an infectious process on admission. He was initially on a tracheostomy mask at the facility occasionally. Barriers to extubation currently include muscle weakness and pulmonary edema.

2. Sepsis: The patient has serratia bacteremia on OSH culture. Possible sources include the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. LFTs were normal apart from alkaline phosphatase, making cholecystitis less likely. It could also be due to pneumonia or due to a PICC line infection (PICC has been removed).

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient now has stable renal function. It is likely a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and hypovolemia given the presence of granular casts in the urine. Follow-up urine output should be monitored, and renally dosed medications should be adjusted accordingly. A renal consult may be necessary if there is no improvement.

4. Altered Mental Status and History of Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral Injury: No current evidence of seizure activity, but the patient has a history of non-convulsive"
