   Assessment and Plan
   52 year-old gentleman with history of HTN, HL, CVA in [**2184**] with
   residual L-side weakness, HIV on HAART with most recent CD4 of 442 and
   undetectable VL on [**8-1**] who presented with LLL [**Hospital 10251**] transferred to
   MICU for hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure. Etiology likely secondary to LLL
   pneumonia which was clearly seen on CT.  Patient with large amount of
   purulent sputum. Less likely viral pneumonia per imaging, but possible
   superimposed on bacterial process. Urine legionella negative, PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 442**] (last CD4 count 442), Flu negative. BNP 34, less likely CHF
   although with bilateral pleural effusion. Troponin negative x 1 set,
   unlikely MI. PE very low likelihood given other findings as per above.
   - Continue Vanc, Cefepime, Flagyl to cover for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia (day 1 = [**1-16**])
   - Follow BAL
   - Consider echo
   - Ipratropium nebs q6h, Albuterol nebs q2h
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - Obtain blood culture
   .
   # HIV - Pt has been well controlled with CD4 count most recently 442
   and VL undetectable.
   - Continue home-regimen of Ritonavir, Saquinavir
   .
   # Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure with EF 40%. Patient looks euvolemic.
   Question acute exacerbation in the setting of infection. Will closely
   monitor fluid status and BP.
   - Consider echo
   - Continue ACEI and beta-blocker
   - Gentle IVF prn low UOP
   - I/O goal to -500cc
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease. Patient s/p CABG. Chest pain free.
   - Continue ACEI and beta-blocker
   - Continue statin
   .
   # Hypertension. Will let be slightly hypertensive for now given
   infection and wanting to avoid hypotension. Continue home regimen.
   - Continue ACEI and beta-blocker
   .
   # HCV. Patient not candidate for therapy and has had negative
   malignancy work up with USGs and AFP.
   .
   # FEN: IVF bolus prn, replete electrolytes, NPO currently and consider
   OG tube for tube feeds
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen
   # Access: Peripherals, arterial line, PICC line advancement in AM

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension, HIV, coronary artery disease, and chronic diastolic heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory failure, likely secondary to left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient has been on invasive ventilation, and various lines have been placed, including a peripheral IV, midline, and arterial line.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, stable blood pressure, and an increased heart rate. The respiratory rate is within normal limits, but the oxygen saturation is low at 93%. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and there are some abnormalities in the liver function tests.

The patient's respiratory viral screen and culture are pending, but the bronchial lavage fluid gram stain showed no microorganisms. The respiratory culture is also preliminary, and the immunofluorescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii came back negative.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl, which are being given to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia. The patient's HIV is well-controlled with a CD4 count of 442 and undetectable viral load.

There are multiple medical complications that can arise in this case. One potential complication is ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), especially considering the patient's prolonged intubation. Another complication to consider is nosocomial infections due"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year-old gentleman with history of HTN, HL, CVA in [**2184**] with
   residual L-side weakness, HIV on HAART with most recent CD4 of 442 and
   undetectable VL on [**8-1**] who presented with LLL [**Hospital 10251**] transferred to
   MICU for hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure. Stable and not clearly improving.
   Unclear etiology. Perhaps related with LLL pneumonia which was seen on
   CT but has not been clearly demonstrated on repeat CXR. Urine
   legionella negative, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 442**] (last CD4 count 442), Flu negative.
   BNP 34, less likely CHF although with bilateral pleural effusion.
   Troponin negative x 2 set, unlikely MI. PE very low likelihood given
   other findings as per above.
   - Continue Vanc, Cefepime, Flagyl to cover for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia (day 1 = [**1-16**])
   - Vancomycin trough this PM
   - Follow BAL cultures
   - Obtain echo
   - Trend CXR
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - Ipratropium nebs q6h, Albuterol nebs q2h
   - Wean vent as tolerate; continue ARDSnet protocol
   - Obtain blood culture
   - Consider re-bronch in PM to recheck cell count, keep in mind may need
   to broaden coverage empirically if no significant improvement
   .
   # HIV - Pt has been well controlled with CD4 count most recently 442
   and VL undetectable.
   - Continue home-regimen of Ritonavir, Saquinavir; will give liquid
   Ritonavir and break up Saquinavir capsule and give through OG. Will
   monitor given concern for Ritonavir in reducing Fentanyl clearance.
   - Consult ID formally regarding HIV and also lack of clear improvement
   during this time
   .
   # Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure with EF 40%. Patient looks euvolemic.
   Question acute exacerbation in the setting of infection. Will closely
   monitor fluid status and BP.
   - Obtain echo
   - Hold ACEI and beta-blocker given hypotensive episodes
   - Gentle IVF prn low UOP
   - I/O goal to -500cc
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease. Patient s/p CABG. Chest pain free.
   - Hold ACEI and beta-blocker given hypotensive episodes
   - Continue statin
   .
   # Hypertension. Will let be slightly hypertensive for now given
   infection and wanting to avoid hypotension. Continue home regimen.
   - Continue ACEI and beta-blocker
   .
   # HCV. Patient not candidate for therapy and has had negative
   malignancy work up with USGs and AFP.
   .
   # FEN: IVF bolus prn, replete electrolytes, NPO currently and consider
   OG tube for tube feeds
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen; famotidine

","The patient is a 52-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who presented with left lower lobe pneumonia. He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia and is currently on invasive ventilation. 

The patient's recent CD4 count is 442, indicating well-controlled HIV infection, and his viral load is undetectable. He has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent CABG in the past. 

His current vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 101/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 80% FiO2. 

The patient has been diagnosed with chronic diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%. He appears euvolemic and there are concerns about an acute exacerbation in the setting of infection. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 56 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 115. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.9 g/dL, sodium of 139 mg/dL, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, and troponin-T of <0.01 ng/mL. 

The patient's chest X-ray reveals bibasilar opacification, bilateral pleural effusions, and interstitial prominence. 

The patient's respiratory viral antigen screen came back uninterpretable due to lack of cells, but the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid gram stain showed 1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes and no microorganisms seen. 

The patient's plan includes continuing vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia. They will also obtain an echo, trend chest X-ray, cardiac enzymes, and continue ARDSnet protocol. Blood cultures have been obtained, and consideration is being given to repeating the bronchoscopic evaluation. 

In terms of HIV management, the patient's home regimen of ritonavir and saquinavir will be continued, but with liquid ritonavir given through oral-gastric tube and breaking up saquinavir capsule to give through OG. The patient's ID consultation is pending due to lack of clear improvement during this time. 

Other ongoing issues include chronic diastolic heart failure, coronary artery disease (post-CABG), hypertension, and hepatitis C. 

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending clinical improvement."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old man with HIV (CD4 count of 500) who is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure of unclear etiology. The patient requires invasive ventilation and has left-sided infiltrates on the CT scan. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to the presence of the endotracheal tube and the potential for aspiration.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria/anuria could indicate a decline in renal function, which may be related to sepsis or direct injury to the kidneys.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central lines increase the risk of developing blood clots, which can lead to DVT.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient is at risk for acquiring additional infections while in the ICU, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or surgical site infections if any procedures are performed.
5. Barotrauma: The high levels of PIP and plateau pressure mentioned in the respiratory support section indicate that the patient may be at risk for barotrauma, which can cause lung injury.
6. ARDS: The patient's presentation with hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral infiltrates raises concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a severe form"

The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. He presented to the hospital with lower left lobe pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the MICU for further management. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 123/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and a plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, sodium of 139 mg/dL, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, and glucose of 106 mg/dL.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient has worsening multifocal pneumonia and is on mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is already on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Proper measures such as bed positioning, mouth care, and timely weaning from the ventilator should be taken to minimize this risk.

2. Infectious complications: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV and recent CD4 count of 442, there is an increased risk of opportunistic infections. Monitoring for signs of infection and following up with the results of the cultures and sensitivities is crucial.

3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. This condition can worsen over time and may lead to right heart failure. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.

4. Renal problems: The patient has a history of renal problems. Adequate fluid management and monitoring of renal function are essential to prevent further deterioration.

5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%. There is a risk of acute exacerbation in the setting of infection. Monitoring fluid status, blood pressure, and avoiding hypotensive episodes are important.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. He presented to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure and has been diagnosed with worsening multifocal pneumonia. His HIV is well-controlled with a CD4 count of 442 and undetectable viral load. The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension and is on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube. His current medications include Vanc, Cefepime, and Flagyl for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is still experiencing hypoxia. He has bilateral pleural effusion, but there are no signs of acute cholecystitis or acute heart failure. Further diagnostic tests, such as blood cultures, CXR trends, and bronchoscopy, are pending. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU pending clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures, such as changing the sedation to bolus and performing bronchoscopy, are being taken to prevent and diagnose this complication.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension, which may contribute to his respiratory failure. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygenation and hemodynamics is necessary to manage this condition effectively.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension, HIV, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who presented with left lower lobe pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient has a CD4 count of 442 and undetectable viral load, indicating good control of his HIV infection. However, he is experiencing worsening multifocal pneumonia, difficulty reducing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and severe pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is hypoxia and respiratory failure due to worsening multifocal pneumonia. He requires continuous monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation.
2. Seizure/Surgical Complications: The patient had an episode of partial seizure this morning, which may be related to his previous CVA. Neurological evaluation and follow-up are recommended.
3. HIV: Although the patient's HIV infection is currently well-controlled, ongoing monitoring and management of his antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen are necessary.
4. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%. Close monitoring of fluid status and blood pressure is essential, especially during the acute infection.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the past. It is important to monitor"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He is currently admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension and multifocal pneumonia, with worsening opacities in the lingula, left lower lobe, and right lower lobe. The respiratory culture showed no growth, and the KOH test for fungal elements was negative.

The patient's HIV is well controlled with a CD4 count of 442 and undetectable viral load. However, the patient is currently on a regimen of ritonavir and saquinavir, which may reduce the clearance of fentanyl. The patient also has chronic diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%. There is a question of acute exacerbation in the setting of infection.

The patient's other medical conditions include coronary artery disease, for which he had coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic kidney disease, and hepatitis C virus infection (HCV). The patient is not a candidate for HCV therapy and has had negative malignancy workup.

In terms of interventions, the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 14 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. The patient is also receiving IV lasix,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with HIV and a CD4 count of 500. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure and has bilateral infiltrates of unclear etiology. He requires 15 cmH2O of PEEP to maintain oxygenation and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. He also has a history of seizures, which he has been monitored for. His other medical history includes renal problems and allergies to ilosone, dicloxacillin, and nausea/vomiting. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already ongoing, and it is essential to continue monitoring his oxygenation levels and ensuring adequate ventilation support.
2. HIV: As the patient has HIV with a CD4 count of 500, there is a risk of opportunistic infections. It is crucial to manage his HIV with appropriate antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and monitor for any signs of progression or new infections.
3. Seizures: The patient has had seizures in the past, and it is necessary to contact his neurologist and continue seizure management while in the ICU.
4. Bilateral Infiltrates: The cause of the bilateral infiltrates needs further investigation to determine the underlying etiology. This may require additional imaging studies, such as a chest CT scan, and potentially bronchoscopy or lung biopsy if indicated.
5. Renal Problems: The patient has a history of renal problems, and his kidney function should be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, and HIV on HAART therapy. He presented with left lower lobe pneumonia and was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia. The patient has worsening multifocal pneumonia, difficulty reducing PEEP overnight, and a previous negative urine Legionella test. His most recent CD4 count is 442 with an undetectable viral load. The patient also has a history of CVA with residual left-sided weakness and has had episodes of seizures post-CVA.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition remains concerning, and the team continues to monitor his respiratory status closely. He is on mechanical ventilation with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, with a set tidal volume of 550 mL and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. FiO2 is stable, and PEEP is set at 12 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 193. The team plans to continue Vanc, Cefepime, and Flagyl to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia. They will also trend CXR, administer ipratropium nebs q6h, albuterol nebs q2h, and continue AR"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year-old gentleman with history of HTN, HL, CVA in [**2184**] with
   residual L-side weakness, HIV on HAART with most recent CD4 of 442 and
   undetectable VL on [**8-1**] who presented with LLL [**Hospital 10251**] transferred to
   MICU for hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure. CT with worsening multifocal pneumonia
   from [**1-20**]. PEEP down to 10 overnight. Fi02 to 40%. Overall improving.
   Urine legionella negative, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 442**] (last CD4 count 442), Flu
   negative. BNP 34, less likely CHF although with bilateral pleural
   effusion. Troponin negative x 2 set, unlikely MI. PE very low
   likelihood given other findings as per above. Severe pulmonary
   hypertension most likely an underlying contributor. BAL negative
   - Continue Vanc, Cefepime, Flagyl to cover for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia (day 1 = [**1-16**]). No need to expand Pseudomonal coverage at
   present.
   - Trend CXR
 While Intubated.
   - Ipratropium nebs q6h, Albuterol nebs q2h
   - Wean vent as tolerate; continue ARDSnet protocol
   - Obtain blood cultures for tomorrow AM
   - Consider ID (BAL has come back negative)
   - Obtain sputum culture
   # Seizure d/o s/p CVA. Patient had 10 second episode this morning of
   what appeared to be partial seizure, self-resolved, no post-ictal
   signs. Appears to be simple partial. Patient notes that he has had
   these episodes s/p CVA. Patient last saw neurology for these episodes
   in [**2186**]. He has not had treatment for it since that time (although they
   had recommended Dilantin), and does not express desire to obtain
   treatment for it.
   - Continue Ativan prn
   # HIV. Pt has been well controlled with CD4 count most recently 442 and
   VL undetectable.
   - Continue home-regimen of Ritonavir, Saquinavir; will give liquid
   Ritonavir and break up Saquinavir capsule and give through OG. Will
   monitor given concern for Ritonavir in reducing Fentanyl clearance.
   - Appreciate ID Recommendations
   # Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure with EF 40%. ECHO without definite
   change since [**2191**]. Question acute exacerbation in the setting of
   infection. Will closely monitor fluid status and BP.
   - Continue ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker
   - Gentle IVF prn low UOP
   - I/O goal to even
   # Coronary Artery Disease. Patient s/p CABG. Chest pain free.
   - Restart ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker
   - Continue statin
   # Hypertension. Will let be slightly hypertensive for now given
   infection and wanting to avoid hypotension. Continue home regimen.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year-old gentleman with history of HTN, HL, CVA in [**2184**] with
   residual L-side weakness, HIV on HAART with most recent CD4 of 442 and
   undetectable VL on [**8-1**] who presented with LLL [**Hospital 10251**] transferred to
   MICU for hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure. CT with worsening multifocal pneumonia
   from [**1-20**]. Difficulty reducing PEEP overnight. Fi02 stable. Urine
   legionella negative, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 442**] (last CD4 count 442), Flu negative.
   BNP 34, less likely CHF although with bilateral pleural effusion.
   Troponin negative x 2 set, unlikely MI. PE very low likelihood given
   other findings as per above. Severe pulmonary hypertension most likely
   an underlying contributor. BAL negative
   - Continue Vanc, Cefepime, Flagyl to cover for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia (day 1 = [**1-16**]). No need to expand Pseudomonal coverage at
   present.
   - Trend CXR
 While Intubated.
   - Ipratropium nebs q6h, Albuterol nebs q2h
   - Wean vent as tolerate; continue ARDSnet protocol
   - Obtain blood cultures for tomorrow AM
   - Consider ID (BAL has come back negative)
   - Obtain sputum culture
   # Seizure d/o s/p CVA. Patient had 10 second episode this morning of
   what appeared to be partial seizure, self-resolved, no post-ictal
   signs. Appears to be simple partial. Patient notes that he has had
   these episodes s/p CVA. Patient last saw neurology for these episodes
   in [**2186**]. He has not had treatment for it since that time (although they
   had recommended Dilantin), and does not express desire to obtain
   treatment for it.
   - Continue Ativan prn
   # HIV. Pt has been well controlled with CD4 count most recently 442 and
   VL undetectable.
   - Continue home-regimen of Ritonavir, Saquinavir; will give liquid
   Ritonavir and break up Saquinavir capsule and give through OG. Will
   monitor given concern for Ritonavir in reducing Fentanyl clearance.
   - Appreciate ID Recommendations
   # Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure with EF 40%. ECHO without definite
   change since [**2191**]. Question acute exacerbation in the setting of
   infection. Will closely monitor fluid status and BP.
   - Continue ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker
   - Gentle IVF prn low UOP
   - I/O goal to even
   # Coronary Artery Disease. Patient s/p CABG. Chest pain free.
   - Restart ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker
   - Continue statin
   # Hypertension. Will let be slightly hypertensive for now given
   infection and wanting to avoid hypotension. Continue home regimen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension, HIV, coronary artery disease, chronic diastolic heart failure, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory failure due to worsening multifocal pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing difficulty reducing PEEP overnight, with stable FiO2. Legionella-negative urine, PCR-negative, and flu-negative. The patient's BNP is 34, making it less likely to be congestive heart failure (CHF). Troponin negative x 2 sets, unlikely myocardial infarction (MI). Pulmonary embolism (PE) is also very low likelihood given the other findings mentioned above. Severe pulmonary hypertension is most likely an underlying contributor. BAL negative.

2. Seizure disorder: The patient had a 10-second episode of what appeared to be a partial seizure this morning, which self-resolved without any post-ictal signs. The patient has had similar episodes since his CVA. He last saw neurology for these episodes in [**2186**] and has not had any treatment since then, although they recommended Dilantin. The patient does not express a desire to obtain treatment for it.

3. HIV: The patient's HIV is well-controlled with a CD4 count of 442 and und"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year-old gentleman with history of HTN, HL, CVA in [**2184**] with
   residual L-side weakness, HIV on HAART with most recent CD4 of 442 and
   undetectable VL on [**8-1**] who presented with LLL [**Hospital 10251**] transferred to
   MICU for hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure. Continues to improve. CT with worsening
   multifocal pneumonia from [**1-20**]. PEEP down to 10 overnight. Fi02 to 40%.
   Overall improving. Urine legionella negative, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 442**] (last CD4
   count 442), Flu negative. BNP 34, less likely CHF although with
   bilateral pleural effusion. Troponin negative x 2 set, unlikely MI. PE
   very low likelihood given other findings as per above. Severe pulmonary
   hypertension most likely an underlying contributor. BAL negative
   - Continue Vanc, Cefepime, Flagyl to cover for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia (day 1 = [**1-16**]). No need to expand Pseudomonal coverage at
   present.
   - Extubate
   - Ipratropium nebs q6h, Albuterol nebs q2h
   # Seizure d/o s/p CVA. Patient had 10 second episode this morning of
   what appeared to be partial seizure, self-resolved, no post-ictal
   signs. Appears to be simple partial. Patient notes that he has had
   these episodes s/p CVA. Patient last saw neurology for these episodes
   in [**2186**]. He has not had treatment for it since that time (although they
   had recommended Dilantin), and does not express desire to obtain
   treatment for it.
   - Continue Ativan prn
   # HIV. Pt has been well controlled with CD4 count most recently 442 and
   VL undetectable.
   - Continue home-regimen of Ritonavir, Saquinavir; will give liquid
   Ritonavir and break up Saquinavir capsule and give through OG. Will
   monitor given concern for Ritonavir in reducing Fentanyl clearance.
   - Appreciate ID Recommendations
   # Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure with EF 40%. ECHO without definite
   change since [**2191**]. Question acute exacerbation in the setting of
   infection. Will closely monitor fluid status and BP.
   - Continue ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker
   - Gentle IVF prn low UOP
   - I/O goal to even
   # Coronary Artery Disease. Patient s/p CABG. Chest pain free.
   - Restart ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker
   - Continue statin
   # Hypertension. Will let be slightly hypertensive for now given
   infection and wanting to avoid hypotension. Continue home regimen.
   - Restart ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker
   # HCV. Patient not candidate for therapy and has had negative
   malignancy work up with USGs and AFP.

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension, HIV on HAART, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who presented with left lower lobe pneumonia. He has been admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition shows improvement with a PEEP of 10 and FiO2 of 40%. His urine Legionella test is negative, and PCP is also negative. The patient's BNP level is 34, indicating less likelihood of congestive heart failure (CHF) although he has bilateral pleural effusion. Troponin levels are negative, making it unlikely to be a myocardial infarction (MI). The patient's pulmonary embolism (PE) likelihood is very low given other findings. Severe pulmonary hypertension is likely an underlying contributor. BAL is negative, so no need to expand Pseudomonal coverage at present.

The patient has a history of seizures post-CVA and had a 10-second episode this morning of what appeared to be a partial seizure, which self-resolved. The patient has not had treatment for it since that time and does not express a desire to obtain treatment for it.

The patient's HIV is well-controlled with a CD4 count of 442 and undetectable viral load (VL). The patient will continue with his home regimen of Ritonavir and Saquinavir, monitoring given concern for Ritonavir reducing Fentanyl clearance.

- Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and elevated troponin levels, which may indicate an ongoing infection or cardiac injury. 
- The patient has been on HAART therapy for his HIV, with a last CD4 count of 442 and undetectable viral load. 
- Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray, are pending. 
- The patient has had several episodes of partial seizures, likely related to the previous CVA. 
- He has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%. 
- The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the past and is currently pain-free. 
- He also has a history of hypertension, which is being managed with medication. 
- The patient has chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection but is not a candidate for therapy. 
- The patient's current medications include various antibiotics, anticonvulsants, antiretrovirals, and medications for his heart conditions. 
- The patient's I/O status is of concern, with a negative fluid balance. 
- The plan is to continue aggressive management of the patient's conditions, including weaning off mechanical ventilation as tolerated, obtaining further imaging and laboratory studies, and monitoring for any complications or deterioration. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. 
2. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures can increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, such as bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections. 
3. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizures related to the CVA and may be at risk for further seizure episodes. 
4. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's chronic diastolic heart failure could potentially worsen due to the stress of infection and fluid shifts. 
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and the presence of multiple risk factors (such as HIV, heart failure, and recent surgery) increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's current negative fluid balance and the use of nephrotoxic medications may increase the risk of renal dysfunction."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old man with HIV and a CD4 count of 500. He is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral infiltrates of unclear etiology. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/47 mmHg to 119/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including vanc/cefepime/flagyl empirically for respiratory failure, and his condition is showing improvement. He has also been started on a boosted single drug regimen for his HIV.

Additionally, the patient had a seizure without status epilepticus, which has resolved. He also experienced oliguria/anuria but it has resolved as well.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dL, platelet count of 258 K/uL, blood glucose level ranging from 98 to 115 mg/dL, and sodium level of 135 mEq/L.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of PSV/SBT, set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension, HIV, coronary artery disease, and chronic diastolic heart failure. He presented with acute respiratory failure and hypoxia due to worsening multifocal pneumonia. The patient's current condition shows improvement with decreased need for supplemental oxygen and decreased ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure, which improved with appropriate management. However, there is a risk of recurrence or worsening respiratory failure if infection or other respiratory complications arise.
2. HIV/AIDS: The patient has HIV with a CD4 count of 442 and undetectable viral load. He is on HAART therapy. Close monitoring of CD4 count and viral load is necessary to ensure continued control of HIV/AIDS.
3. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%. Monitoring of fluid status and blood pressure is essential to prevent exacerbation of heart failure.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient underwent CABG surgery in the past and is currently chest pain-free. However, restarting ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers should be done cautiously due to the patient's renal problems.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and blood pressure management should be closely monitored, especially during the presence of infection.
6. Seizure Disorder: The patient experienced a partial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension, HIV on HAART, coronary artery disease, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) presenting with hypoxia and respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently extubated. The patient's condition has been improving, with a recent episode of partial seizure. His medical history includes chronic diastolic heart failure, HIV, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. He is also a former candidate for liver transplantation due to chronic HCV infection. The patient's current medications include various antibiotics, anticonvulsants, antiretrovirals, and cardiac medications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he is still on supplemental oxygen. Fluid balance is negative, indicating fluid loss. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolytes and liver function tests are within normal limits. The patient's chest X-ray shows worsening multifocal pneumonia. The patient's management plan includes continuing with current antibiotics, extubation, using inhaled bronchodilators, monitoring for signs of heart failure, restarting cardiac medications, and closely monitoring fluid status and blood pressure. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation was hypox"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension, HIV on HAART therapy, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) presenting with left lower lobe pneumonia. He was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and later transferred to the ICU due to worsening multifocal pneumonia. The patient has shown improvement and was successfully extubated yesterday without any issues. His current condition is stable, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxia and respiratory failure due to pneumonia. Although he has improved, there is still a risk of worsening respiratory status, especially if there is a new infection or progression of his underlying lung disease.

2. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pleural effusions.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). There is a risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina, particularly if he experiences increased stress or if his hypertension is not well-controlled.

4. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%. This condition can lead to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has undergone invasive ventilation. He was extubated in the early morning and is currently able to talk and eat. The patient has a history of renal problems, allergies to certain medications, and previous antibiotic use. His vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing shortness of breath and has a SpO2 level of 90%. The patient's weight is 115 kg, and his height is 60 inches. Fluid balance shows a net negative of 1.5 L at midnight without diuresis. The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure indicates a high risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The low SpO2 level of 90% suggests inadequate oxygenation, which may require adjustment of oxygen delivery devices or additional respiratory support.
2. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's history of renal problems increases the risk of renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury (AKI). Close monitoring of renal function tests and fluid balance is essential to prevent worsening of renal status.
3. Seizure Risk: The patient has experienced a seizure without status epile"

   52 year-old gentleman with history of HTN, HL, CVA in [**2184**] with
   residual L-side weakness, HIV on HAART with most recent CD4 of 442 and
   undetectable VL on [**8-1**] who presented with LLL [**Hospital 10251**] transferred to
   MICU for hypoxia.  Was extubated yesterday without issues with plan to
   transfer to floor today.
   # Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure. Continues to improve and patient
   extubated without issues yesterday. CT with worsening multifocal
   pneumonia from [**1-20**]. Urine legionella negative, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 442**] (last CD4
   count 442), Flu negative. BNP 34, less likely CHF although with
   bilateral pleural effusion. Troponin negative x 2 set, unlikely MI. PE
   very low likelihood given other findings as per above. Severe pulmonary
   hypertension most likely an underlying contributor. BAL negative.
   - Continue Vanc, Cefepime, Flagyl to cover for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia (day 1 = [**1-16**]) for 14 day course. No need to expand
   Pseudomonal coverage at present.
   - Patient should get PFTs done as outpatient for ?underlying COPD (Most
   recent ABG with CO2 61)
   - Ipratropium nebs q6h, Albuterol nebs q2h
 patient will benefit from
   continuing these or MDI versions as outpatient for ?underlying COPD
   # Seizure d/o s/p CVA. Patient had 10 second episode yesterday morning
   of what appeared to be partial seizure, self-resolved, no post-ictal
   signs. Appears to be simple partial. Patient notes that he has had
   these episodes s/p CVA. Patient last saw neurology for these episodes
   in [**2186**]. He has not had treatment for it since that time (although they
   had recommended Dilantin), and does not express desire to obtain
   treatment for it.
   - Continue Ativan prn
   # HIV. Pt has been well controlled with CD4 count most recently 442 and
   VL undetectable.
   - Continue home-regimen of Ritonavir, Saquinavir; will give liquid
   Ritonavir and break up Saquinavir capsule and give through OG. Will
   monitor given concern for Ritonavir in reducing Fentanyl clearance.
   - Appreciate ID Recommendations
   # Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure with EF 40%. ECHO without definite
   change since [**2191**]. Question acute exacerbation in the setting of
   infection. Will closely monitor fluid status and BP.
   - Continue ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker
   - Gentle IVF prn low UOP
   - I/O goal to even
 better in last 12 hours
   # Coronary Artery Disease. Patient s/p CABG. Chest pain free.
   - Continue ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker  (re-started yesterday)
   - Continue statin
   # Hypertension. Will let be slightly hypertensive for now given
   infection and wanting to avoid hypotension. Continue home regimen.
   - Restart ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker
   # HCV. Patient not candidate for therapy and has had negative
   malignancy work up with USGs and AFP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hypertension, HIV on HAART therapy, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in residual left-sided weakness. He presented with left lower lobe pneumonia and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia. The patient was extubated without issues yesterday and is currently improving. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxia and respiratory failure due to worsening multifocal pneumonia. He has shown improvement since then and was successfully extubated.
2. Legionella Negative: Urine test for Legionella bacteria came back negative.
3. PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia): The patient's CD4 count is 442, which puts him at risk for PCP. However, PCP-negative results were obtained.
4. Flu Negative: The patient tested negative for influenza.
5. Bilateral Pleural Effusion: The patient has developed bilateral pleural effusion, but it is less likely to be caused by congestive heart failure (CHF) due to a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 34.
6. Troponin Negative: Two sets of troponin tests came back negative, making myocardial infarction (MI) unlikely.
7. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension, which"

   Improving resp failure. We do not have a good explanation for his acute
   episode.  One possibility is aspiration. We will nevertheless complete
   14d course of abx for severe CAP.  Unclear what his underlying lung dis
   is - diffuse wheezing on exam now.  He also has CT and echo c/w pulm
   HTN - possibly HIV related but need to understand the nature of his
   pulm dis to determine if pulm HTN is secondary to lung dis.  Needs PFTs
   and full pulm eval this adm.

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has a history of HIV/AIDS and is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 113/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. His physical examination reveals diffuse wheezing on lung auscultation but no signs of congestion or edema. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 277 K/uL. His electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L. The patient's renal function is also compromised, as evidenced by an elevated creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. Other notable lab values include an elevated lactate level of 9.0 mmol/L and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level of 215 IU/L.

The patient's medical history includes a seizure episode, respiratory failure, HIV/AIDS, dyspnea, oliguria/anuria, and an undiagnosed underlying lung disease. The patient is currently receiving a 14-day course of antibiotics for severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The plan is to complete the antibiotic course and further evaluate the patient's underlying lung disease"
