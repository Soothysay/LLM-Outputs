   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay
   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - Check cardiac enzymes
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - change labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and change diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - attempt to obtain sputum culture
   - chest PT
   - followup pending micro data
   - consider checking C Diff toxin if develops diarrhea
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hypernatremia: lkikely from poor free water intake and ongoing
   fevers
   - incresae free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   - add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   .
   ## Hypertension: goal SBP<160 given head bleed
   - cont lisinopril, valsartan as above; change diltiazem and beta
   blocker as above
   - d/c terazosin as above
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - change rate control agents as above
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 4781] is an 87-year-old woman who underwent a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course has been complicated by decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing multifactorial respiratory failure caused by pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (possibly systolic or diastolic) and likely aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. The net positive fluid balance indicates ongoing fluid overload.
2. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. Blood and urine cultures have been negative so far. It is important to attempt to obtain a sputum culture and check chest X-ray.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient is experiencing hypernatremia likely due to poor free water intake and ongoing fevers. Increasing free water boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h is recommended.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, which could be due to acute illness or baseline glucose intolerance. Significant sliding scale insulin is required, and adding glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale is advised.
5. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, which needs to be"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay
   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - Check cardiac enzymes
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - change labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and change diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - attempt to obtain sputum culture
   - chest PT
   - followup pending micro data
   - consider checking C Diff toxin if develops diarrhea
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hypernatremia: lkikely from poor free water intake and ongoing
   fevers
   - incresae free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   - add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   .
   ## Hypertension: goal SBP<160 given head bleed
   - cont lisinopril, valsartan as above; change diltiazem and beta
   blocker as above
   - d/c terazosin as above
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - change rate control agents as above
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress

   Imaging: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular
   systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular
   septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [Known Lastname 4781] is an 87-year-old woman who underwent a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course has been complicated by decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressures and heart rates. She requires respiratory support with a net positive 5 liters for the length of stay. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The echocardiogram reveals an elongated left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular cavity size, and hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction greater than 75%. There is evidence of moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and trace aortic regurgitation.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF and likely aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia, hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a subdural hematoma. She is on various medications, including diuretics, beta-blockers, anticoagulants, antibiotics, and antiepileptic drugs.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay
   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - chest PT
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hypernatremia: lkikely from poor free water intake and ongoing
   fevers
   -          incresae free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
   -          not resolved
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   -          add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   -          Now stable
   .
   ## Hypertension: goal SBP<160 given head bleed
   - cont lisinopril, valsartan as above; change diltiazem and beta
   blocker as above
   - d/c terazosin as above
   - Now
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - change rate control agents as above
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman who underwent a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course has been complicated by decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (possibly diastolic) and likely aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. She also has hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with poor rate control, and a subdural hematoma.

The plan of care includes:
1. Treating respiratory failure with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and diuretics for pulmonary edema, as well as addressing aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. Managing hypernatremia by increasing free water boluses with tube feeds.
3. Addressing hyperglycemia with basal and bolus insulin.
4. Controlling hypertension with antihypertensive medications.
5. Managing atrial fibrillation with rate control agents.
6. Continuing seizure prophylaxis with phenytoin for the subdural hematoma.
7. Providing tube feeds and increasing free water flushes.
8. Administering DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 4781] is an 87-year-old woman who underwent a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course has been complicated by decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is currently in respiratory failure, with multifactorial causes including pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF and aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. She is receiving a furosemide drip for fluid management and has been placed on empiric antibiotics for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia. The patient also has hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, poorly controlled atrial fibrillation, and a subdural hematoma. She is being managed with tube feeds and increased free water boluses, sliding scale insulin, rate control agents, prophylactic heparin for DVT, and a stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF and aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. This may lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

   Imaging: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular
   systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular
   septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) with diastolic failure. The patient was called for hypertension in 180s and the dose of Lopressor was increased to 75mg Q6H. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [date]. Infusions and other ICU medications are mentioned, but specific details are not provided. There are no changes to the medical and family history. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and ABG results. The peripheral vascular examination reveals that the right radial pulse, left radial pulse, right DP pulse, and left DP pulse were not assessed. The skin examination was also not assessed. The neurologic examination shows that the patient responds to stimuli but movement, tone, and other aspects were not assessed.

The labs/radiology section provides various lab results including white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, troponin-T, glucose levels, and other parameters. The imaging report suggests an elongated left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular cavity size, normal regional left ventricular wall motion, hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function, increased left ventricular filling pressure, grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction, trace aortic regurgitation, trivial mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and no pericardial effusion.

The assessment and plan section includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and comments. The code status and disposition are mentioned at the end.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include worsening of LV diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, hypertension, and the risk of DVT and VAP due to ICU care. However, further evaluation is required to determine the exact nature and severity of these potential complications."

   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay. TTE with diastolic failure
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - FWill d/dc lasix drip start IV with goal -100/hr
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - chest PT
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   -          glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   -          Now stable
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - Increased lopressor to 100mg Q6H for better rate control and
   hopefully better BP control
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old woman who underwent a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma.
- Post-operative complications include decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
- The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, caused by pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (systolic vs diastolic) and aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
- Plan: TTE with diastolic failure, BNP > 70,000, cardiac enzymes normal, start IV lasix drip with goal -100/hr, change labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and diltiazem XR to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control, empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia, check cultures and random vanco level, plan to discontinue antibiotics on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative cultures.
- Fevers are likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures negative to date. Consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam if fevers persist.
- Hyperglycemia unclear if it's due to baseline glucose intolerance or acute illness. Now stable with glargine 6 units qhs and q"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a weight loss of 4.5 kg since admission. The patient had a fall on the right hip and a CT scan is pending. The phenytoin level has decreased to 4.4, possibly due to albumin levels. There are no known drug allergies.

Vital signs show a stable heart rate (HR) of 75 bpm, blood pressure (BP) within normal range at 132/58 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) at 100%. Fluid balance is negative by 366 mL in the last 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, slightly decreased hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt) within normal range. Creatinine (Cr) levels are mostly within normal range, except for one reading of 0.9 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels are negative, while other cardiac enzymes and markers are within normal limits.

The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.34, indicating mild respiratory acidosis. Other electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay. TTE with diastolic failure
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - FWill d/dc lasix drip start IV with goal -100/hr
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - chest PT
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   -          glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   -          Now stable
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - Increased lopressor to 100mg Q6H for better rate control and
   hopefully better BP control
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer
   ## Access: PIVs
   ## Communication: with daughter/POA [**Name (NI) 536**] [**Name (NI) 4782**] (cell [**0-0-**])
   ## Code: DNR/DNI
   ## Dispo: [**Month (only) 60**] be able to transfer to floor today if UOP good after IV
   lasix off lasix drip

Ms. [Known Lastname 4781] is an 87-year-old woman who underwent a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course has been complicated by decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, involving pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (systolic vs diastolic) and likely aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. She has a significant net positive fluid balance of 5 liters for the length of stay. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) has shown diastolic dysfunction. The patient's B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is greater than 70,000, cardiac enzymes are normal, and she has been started on intravenous lasix with a goal output of -100/hr. The dosage of beta-blockers has been adjusted for better rate control to aid in diuresis. Empiric antibiotics have been initiated for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia. The patient's hyperglycemia is being managed with insulin, her atrial fibrillation is poorly controlled, and she is on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis. The patient is receiving tube feeds, and prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis ("

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay. TTE with diastolic failure. Pt appears clinically and by CXR
   euvolemic.
      A. CHF:
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - Will d/dc lasix drip start IV with goal -500mL/day as patient
   euvolemic currently.
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
       B. HAP
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
      C. Apnea: Concerned for central cause esp if has re-bleed vs
   hypocapnea.
   - Will check ABG
   -Will check head CT for re-bleed
   ## Fevers and leukocytosis: Low grade only but has rising WBCslikely
   due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures negative to date.
   - Will check differential and re-culture today including C.Diff.
   - If WBCs trend up or she has more fevers today will consider starting
   empiric C.Diff treatment.
   - chest PT
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   ## ?Hip fracture:
   - Will get CT hip today to assess.
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   -          glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   -          Now stable
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - Increased lopressor to 100mg Q6H for better rate control and
   hopefully better BP control. Only has received 3 doses lopressor today
   so will hold off adding another anti-hypertensive (She
s on Norvasc at
   home) until she has reached steady state.
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs. Will re-dose phenytoin today as has been low for several
   days.
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer
   ## Access: PIVs
   ## Communication: with daughter/POA [**Name (NI) 536**] [**Name (NI) 4782**] (cell [**0-0-**])
   ## Code: DNR/DNI
   ## Dispo: [**Month (only) 60**] be able to transfer to floor today if UOP good after IV
   lasix off lasix drip
","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman who underwent a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course has been complicated by decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia, and potential hip fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF and likely aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. This has resulted in a net positive fluid balance of 5 liters for the length of stay.
2. CHF: The patient's CHF is likely diastolic in nature, as indicated by the elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and the presence of cardiac enzymes within normal limits. The patient is currently euvolemic, and diuresis is being initiated with intravenous (IV) lasix at a goal of -500mL/day.
3. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient is receiving empiric antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for HAP and aspiration pneumonia. Cultures and vancomycin levels will be monitored, and the antibiotics will be discontinued on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment if cultures remain negative.
