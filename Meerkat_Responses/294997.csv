","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). She was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital three days after undergoing a right total knee replacement for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient continues to experience intermittent chest pain, which improves with nitroglycerin. She has been started on aspirin, Plavix, and a heparin drip. She is being considered for cardiac catheterization.

The patient had a blood transfusion reaction one day post knee replacement, but it is not clear if this reaction was associated with hemolysis. She does not show signs of significant blood loss, and there is no hematochezia or melena.

The patient's recent medical history includes a transfusion reaction prior to admission, severe pruritus that improved with IV Benadryl, and dermatitis herpetiformis on her elbows, which she experiences after eating wheat.

The patient appears highly anxious about her hospitalization and transfer, and she does not fully understand her diagnosis. She has a history of gastric ulcers, for which she takes omeprazole at home. She was recently started on Plavix.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/68 to 139/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula, and a sinus rhythm. Her weight remains unchanged from admission at 103 kg.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL, platelet count of 126 K/uL, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, blood glucose of 82 mg/dL, and troponin T level of 0.03 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.9 mEq/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of NSTEMI and ongoing chest pain, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as myocardial ischemia, infarction, or arrhythmias.
2. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to recent surgery and immobilization.
3. Infection: The patient is in the ICU, which increases the risk of hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastric ulcers and use of Plavix increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia, which may be related to the transfusion reaction or ongoing blood loss.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests possible renal impairment, which could be due to pre-existing kidney disease or acute kidney injury.

These potential complications should be closely monitored and managed appropriately to ensure the patient's well-being."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and undergoing a right total knee replacement. The patient's current condition includes intermittent chest pain responsive to nitroglycerin, anxiety, anemia, pruritus, and hypertension. She is being treated with various medications including heparin, aspirin, Plavix, atenolol, omeprazole, and insulin. The patient also has a history of dermatitis herpetiformis and a recent transfusion reaction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI and ongoing chest pain indicate a potential risk for further cardiac complications such as unstable angina or recurrent myocardial infarction.
2. Bleeding complications: Due to the use of anticoagulant therapy with heparin, there is a risk of bleeding complications, especially considering the patient's recent transfusion reaction.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to diabetes and recent surgery may increase the risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or surgical site infections.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient underwent knee replacement surgery, there is a risk of developing DVT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was transferred from an outside hospital three days after undergoing a right total knee replacement. The patient presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) following coronary artery disease (CAD). She had a cardiac catheterization and received a bare metal stent (BMS) in the right coronary artery (RCA) due to a 70% stenosis. Post-cath EKG showed lateral ST elevations, which were deemed insignificant by Dr. [Last Name (Title)]. The patient's post-cath check was normal, with stable hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.

The patient remains concerned about the possibility of a pulmonary embolism (PE), as evidenced by the presence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction on echocardiogram (TTE). The TTE also revealed no evidence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, with normal wall thickness, cavity size, and ejection fraction (>55%). The right ventricle was moderately dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall, and there was abnormal septal motion/position. No mass or thrombus was seen in the right ventricle.

","The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was transferred from an outside hospital three days after undergoing a right total knee replacement for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) post coronary catheterization with bare metal stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient's current condition includes concerns about pulmonary embolism (PE), ongoing chest pain, anemia, gastric ulcers, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient continues to be concerned about PE, and further evaluation is needed with a V/Q scan and LEIs.
2. Chest pain: The patient is experiencing ongoing chest pain, which could be related to unstable angina or recurrent NSTEMI.
3. Anemia: The patient has stable blood counts, but there is a positive guaiac stool indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring and transfusion if signs of ischemia are necessary.
4. Gastric ulcers: The patient has known gastric ulcers, and measures should be taken to manage this condition.
5. Hypertension: The patient's home dose of atenolol was held due to low blood pressures. Further management of hypertension is required.
6. Diabetes mellitus: Good glucose control is important for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was admitted to the ICU after undergoing a right total knee replacement and experiencing a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She has been diagnosed with gastric ulcers, anemia, and is suspected to have a pulmonary embolism (PE). She has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA) for a 70% stenotic lesion. Her current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), heparin drip, metoprolol, low-dose ACE inhibitor, statin, famotidine, and insulin sliding scale.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient continues to have chest pain and there is concern for a PE. She has been started on heparin drip for potential PE, and further diagnostic tests may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Gastric ulcers: The patient has been found to have gastric ulcers, which may be related to her current medication use, including Plavix. She is being treated with famotidine and will continue to have guaiac positive stool monitoring.
3. Anemia: The patient has stable blood counts but has received a blood transfusion due to severe anemia. Iron counts"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was transferred from an outside hospital three days after undergoing a right total knee replacement for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and subsequently had a bare-metal stent (BMS) placed in the right coronary artery (RCA) due to a 70% stenotic lesion.
- The patient continues to experience intermittent chest pain, which improved with nitroglycerin on arrival at the current hospital and was subsequently treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of a BMS in the RCA.
- A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed depressed right ventricular (RV) function with stable left ventricular (LV) function. The differential diagnosis includes the possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) with right strain and a history of possible multiple small PEs in the past. Lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) of the lower extremities was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient's blood counts are stable, although she received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday. She has had guaiac-positive stool in the setting of known gastric ulcers, and iron counts are low.
- The patient underwent right total knee replacement at an outside hospital"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and recent total knee replacement. She presented post-operative day #3 with an NSTEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the right coronary artery for a 70% stenotic lesion. The patient continues to experience intermittent chest pain, which has improved with nitroglycerin. She also has a very low probability of pulmonary embolism based on a V/Q scan. The patient has several other medical issues, including anemia, gastric ulcers, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: Although the V/Q scan showed very low probability of pulmonary embolism, it is still a potential complication to monitor for.
2. Chest pain and ischemic heart disease: The patient continues to experience chest pain, which could be related to the recent NSTEMI and stent placement. Monitoring for signs of recurrent ischemia or myocardial infarction is important.
3. Gastric ulcers: The patient has a history of gastric ulcers, which can be exacerbated by medications such as Plavix. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or worsening ulcer symptoms is necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient has stable blood counts but low iron counts. Monitoring for signs of worsening anemia and addressing the underlying cause is important.
