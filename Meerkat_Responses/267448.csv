   Changes to medical and family history:
   [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 8791**] is a 25 yo male with severe cerebral palsy, non-verbal at
   baseline who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] where he was being
   evaluated for Left foot swelling and incidentally found to have Hct of
   20. There was concern that his stools were melanotic. He was given 2
   units of PRBC, a PPI and transferred for further evaluation.
   .
   In the emergency department, initial vitals: 100.0 110 117/84 18 98%
   ra. He spiked a fever to 102 and had a leukocytosis of 33. He was given
   vancomycin 1 gm x1, Levofloxacin 750mg X1, Flagyl 500mg IV x1 to
   empirically cover both HAP and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 4158**] abdominal process. He was also
   give NS 1L and ativan. For evaluation of his GIB, his NG lavage was
   negative, stool dark & guiaic positive but not obvious melena. His
   abdomen was rigid on exam so general surgery was conulted and a CT of
   the abd/pelvis was performed which showed a large mass in the right
   proximal colon and possilby a partial bowel obstruction. GI felt that
   surgery was not necessary urgently and requested that the patient have
   either a barium enema or a colonoscopy. The mass was noted to be
   obstructing the ureter and causing hydronephrosis in the right kidney.
   Urology was consulted and will see the patient this morning. He will
   likely need percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed by IR. His vital signs
   prior to transfer as as follows: 98.4 110 108/79 20 100% ra.
   .
   In conversation with his caregiver he had a change in behavior
   approximately 3 months ago when his mood seemed to become more labile.
   He was crying frequently and often reporting abdominal pain. He was
   admitted at [**Hospital3 **] and spent 3-4 weeks there. Per [**Hospital1 **] ED notes, he had 2 abd CT scans there without acute change, a
   bone marrow bx w/o myeloproliferative findings and pan cultures were
   persistently negative. The caregiver knows that he required blood
   transfusions but does not know of any diagnosis. He developed diarrhea
   2-3 weeks ago. He has had about a 40lb weight loss over the past few
   months despite a good appetite. He vomited (foodstuff; non-bloody) once
   on the day prior to admission and this is a new symptom for him. He is
   able to sign yes or no when asked questions. He reported pain in his
   right foot and his belly. He has had intermittent fevers for the past
   few weeks.
   .
   Since admission, the patient has been followed by general surgery, GI
   and urology.  The patient was originally put on cipro and flagyl and
   was transitioned to cefepime and flagyl.  An NGT was recommended for
   decompression which the patient had removed 4 times.  Pt was scheduled
   to have colonoscopy on Friday with Gen [**Doctor First Name 3**] on stand-by in case of a
   perforation but it was decided to hold off, continue antibiotics and
   repeat CT scan specifically trying to get contrast in the RLQ and also
   to assess renal issues.  Pt was also to have percutaneous nephrostomy
   tube placement for his right-sided hydronephrosis by IR but is was felt
   that poitioning could be an issues.  Tube placement was deferred unless
   he decompensates though he supposed to get a Mag S study on Monday.  Pt
   was also noted to have an IVC thrombosis for which he was started on a
   heparin drip.  Pt's diet was liberalized and he aspirated Ensure
   pudding this evening.  Pt briefly desatted to 80% on ra but O2 sats
   recovered with suctioning.  Pt tachycardic to the 140s with a
   respiratory rate to 34.  Pt was then transferred to the ICU for further
   management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with severe cerebral palsy, non-verbal at baseline. He presented with abdominal pain, fever, and anemia, and was found to have a large abdominal mass. The mass is concerning for infection (walled off missed appendiceal rupture) or malignancy (lymphoma or sarcoma). The patient also has right-sided hydronephrosis and a history of IVC thrombosis. He has been experiencing small bowel obstruction, GI bleed, aspiration pneumonia, hypernatremia, leukocytosis, and blastocystis hominis infection in his stool.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal Mass - The mass may lead to further complications if it is determined to be malignant. Surgical intervention may be necessary to obtain a tissue diagnosis.
2. Small Bowel Obstruction - The obstruction could worsen, leading to more severe symptoms such as persistent diarrhea and seepage of stool.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia - The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate due to repeated aspiration events, leading to worsening pneumonia.
4. GI Bleed - The bleeding may persist or recur, requiring further transfusions or interventions.
5. Hydronephrosis - The condition may progress if the mass continues to compress the ureter, potentially leading to kidney damage.
6. Hypernatremia - The patient's sodium levels may continue to be elevated due to ongoing losses and fever, requiring careful management"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy who was admitted with gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, leukocytosis, anemia, and a large abdominal mass concerning for infection or malignancy. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that require attention:

1. Abdominal Mass: The patient has a large abdominal mass that is concerning for infection or malignancy. Surgical intervention is high risk due to the patient's poor nutritional status. A tissue diagnosis is needed to determine the exact cause of the mass.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient has been experiencing extensive diarrhea, which could be related to the abdominal mass. Monitoring stool output, serial abdominal exams, and potentially replacing the nasogastric tube if possible are recommended.

3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has witnessed aspiration this evening, initially with Ensure pudding and subsequently with own vomitus. Continuing antibiotics, NPO status, and IV fluids are advised.

4. GI Bleed: The patient likely had an intra-tumor hemorrhage, but has been persistently anemic since presentation. Active transfusion service and monitoring are recommended.

5. Hydronephrosis: The patient has right-sided hydronephrosis likely secondary to the large right-sided mass. Urology is following up and has recommended an interventional radiology-guided percutaneous drain placement, but it may be deferred due to renal decompensation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding. He has a history of being anemic since presentation to OSH in March. He received 3 units of packed red blood cells since then. The patient has multiple medical complications including an abdominal mass, small bowel obstruction, aspiration pneumonia, hydronephrosis, hypernatremia, leukocytosis, IVC thrombosis, and blastocytosis in stool. He is currently unable to provide a medical history and is non-verbal at baseline. The patient's nutritional status is poor, and he requires total parenteral nutrition (TPN). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient is acutely bleeding, likely due to intra-tumor hemorrhage. He received blood transfusions and is being monitored for ongoing blood loss.
2. Abdominal Mass: The mass appears larger on reimaging today, and it is concerning for infection or malignancy. A tissue diagnosis is needed, but the patient's poor nutritional status makes surgery or colonoscopy high risk. A team meeting with GI and general surgery will be held to plan for tissue diagnosis.
3. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient has extensive diarrhea, and the obstruction is caused by the large abdominal mass. He is NPO, and an NG tube replacement is planned if possible. Serial abdominal exams and monitoring fecal output will be done.

   Abdominal Mass - Possible etiologies infection  missed appendiceal
   rupture) v malignancy (lymphoma v sarcoma). Felt to be a high risk for
   either surgery or colonoscopy.  Mass appears larger on remiaging
   today.  It is important at this point to obtain a tissue diagnosis.  GI
   and general surgery have refused to intervene given patient's poor
   nutritional status.
   - team meeting with GI and gen [**Doctor First Name **] to come up with plan for tissue
   diagnosis.
   - Continue antibiotics

The patient also has small bowel obstruction, aspiration pneumonia, ongoing GI bleed, hydronephrosis, hypernatremia, leukocytosis, IVC thrombosis, and blastocytosis in stool.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Infection: The patient has signs of infection, including leukocytosis and positive cultures. There is a risk of worsening infection and sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has ongoing GI bleed, which can lead to anemia, hypotension, and shock if not controlled.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has aspiration pneumonia and a non-rebreather mask in place. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient has hydronephrosis and hypernatremia, indicating potential renal impairment. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has an IVC thrombosis, and there is a risk of developing DVT due to immobility and poor nutritional status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a non-verbal individual admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain. They experienced severe gastrointestinal bleeding and received vitamin K and 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The patient's condition has deteriorated, leading to a decision for comfort measures only. They are currently on hydromorphone (Dilaudid) infusion for pain management and lorazepam (Ativan) as needed for sedation. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia and hypotension, with a low oxygen saturation level of 68%. Fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 888 mL since midnight. The patient's lab results reveal thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated white blood cell count, increased lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's renal function is within normal limits. The patient is not responsive to commands, and their peripheral pulses and skin are not assessed. The patient has been placed on comfort care measures, including pain control and continued use of sedatives. The patient's code status is comfort measures only, and they will be transferred to the floor for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension indicate possible hemodynamic instability, which can be a result of the severe gastrointestinal bleeding and ongoing fluid imbalance.
2. Hypoxemia: The low oxygen saturation level of 68% suggests respiratory distress"
