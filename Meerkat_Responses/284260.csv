","Summary:
The patient is a 211-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and previous myocardial infarction/cerebrovascular accident who was found down in his nursing home and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). He has a perfusing rhythm upon EMS arrival, and it is unclear if he ever truly arrested. Possible diagnoses include pulmonary embolism (PE), structural heart disease, or event leading to arrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia, or seizure. There is evidence of structural heart disease on the EKG. The patient also has pneumothorax post chest tube placement, multiple contiguous rib fractures, and requires close monitoring and pain control. He is intubated for airway protection after vomiting in the oropharynx. There are concerns about cardiac arrest of unclear etiology, possibly due to cardiac arrhythmia, structural heart disease, or myocardial infarction. The patient's hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 medications are being held. He has chronic conjunctivitis and is on ocular erythromycin. The patient is also on prophylactic heparin and bowel regimen. He requires ICU level care and a family meeting for discussion. Code status is presumed full.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and previous myocardial infarction/cerebrovascular accident.
- He was found down at his nursing home and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) due to apparent cardiac arrest. However, the duration and evidence of cardiac arrest are unclear.
- He arrived with a perfusing rhythm and has been intubated for airway protection after vomiting in the oropharynx.
- He has a pneumothorax that required chest tube insertion, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, which was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient has rib fractures likely resulting from CPR.
- His cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury.
- He has been sedated and on mechanical ventilation support.
- His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/46 to 142/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.
- Physical examination findings include wheezes, diminished breath sounds, subcutaneous emphysema, and prolonged expiration phase.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, troponin-T, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated blood glucose levels.
- The assessment and plan include monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias, considering a cardiology consult, following chest X-rays for pneumothorax progress, obtaining further information about the cardiac arrest, managing rib fractures with pain control, and providing ICU level care with a family meeting scheduled in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrhythmia: Given the patient's history of structural heart disease, previous myocardial infarction, and unclear etiology of the cardiac arrest, there is a potential for developing cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Pneumothorax recurrence: Despite the insertion of a chest tube, there is still a possibility of pneumothorax recurrence due to the underlying lung pathology or iatrogenic causes.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
4. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and prolonged bed rest can lead to pressure ulcers, especially in vulnerable areas like the sacrum, heels, or greater trochanters.
5. Delirium: The patient's age, sedation, and critical illness may predispose him to delirium, which can complicate the clinical decision-making process and prolong recovery.
6. Organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated LDH and troponin-T levels indicate possible myocardial injury, and other organ dysfunctions"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and previous myocardial infarction/stroke. He was found down at his nursing home and required CPR, which resulted in rib fracture, pneumothorax, and the placement of chest tubes. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is unclear, with possible diagnoses including pulmonary embolism (PE), structural heart disease, or an event leading to arrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia. Continuous monitoring, ROMI (rapid response monitoring), an echocardiogram, and morning EKG are planned to further evaluate the cause of the cardiac arrest. Consultation with cardiology may be necessary if new findings are observed on the echo or EKG.

2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a pneumothorax that required chest tube placement. CT scan is involved, and it is likely that the patient will have a long recuperation if multiple contiguous rib fractures have led to damage to chest wall dynamics. Limiting pressure support, following chest X-ray (CXR) results, considering CT recommendations, and providing pain relief are part of the management plan.

3. Intubation: The patient is intubated for airway protection after vomiting in the oropharynx. Ventilator precautions are in place.

   seizure.  EKG showing evidence of structural heart disease.  ECHO
   unremarkable, but limited study due to subcutaneous air.  Cardiac
   enzymes did not increase.  Tele monitoring unenlightening.  Unclear why
   this patient arrested or if he ever did.

   limiting factors. Will use bolus fentanyl for pain control and CT
   drainage for PTX / possible flail chest mechanics. Discuss with CT
   surgery re CT--consider change to water seal with close monitoring.
   Increase bowel regimen given distention and narcotics. Family mtg to
   update and discuss goals of care. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient was found down and required CPR. It is unclear whether he truly arrested or not. Possible diagnoses include pulmonary embolism (PE), structural heart disease, or an event leading to arrhythmia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the cardiac arrest.

2. Pneumothorax (collapsed lung): The patient has a pneumothorax that required chest tube insertion. This condition may lead to prolonged recuperation if multiple contiguous rib fractures have damaged the chest wall dynamics.

3. Intubation: The patient was intubated for airway protection after vomiting in the oropharynx. Ventilator precautions should be followed, and weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to pain from rib fractures.

4. Rib fractures: The patient has rib fractures, which can cause significant pain. Pain control is essential, and close monitoring is required.

5. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's cardiac arrest could be due to CAD, including a possible cardiac arrhythmia, structural heart disease, or myocardial infarction (MI). Cardiac enzymes did not increase, suggesting that a recent MI is less likely.

6. Hypertension (HTN): The patient has a history of hypertension, and their home medications will be held initially. Restarting them gradually may be considered if the patient"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an elderly individual with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and a history of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident. The patient was found down at their nursing home and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) due to apparent cardiac arrest. However, by the time EMS arrived, the patient had a perfusing rhythm, making it unclear if they ever truly arrested.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmia: Given the patient's history of cardiac events and the recent cardiac arrest, there is a possibility of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.

2. Pneumothorax: The patient has evidence of pneumothorax, which requires chest tube placement. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and compromised lung function.

3. Rib fractures: The patient has multiple rib fractures, which can cause significant pain and difficulty in breathing. Pain management and respiratory support may be necessary.

4. Sepsis: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.

5. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and the absence of oral antihyperglycemics could increase the risk of DKA, especially"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and previous myocardial infarction/cerebrovascular accident. He was found down and reportedly required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but upon EMS arrival, he had a perfusing rhythm. The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumothorax, rib fractures, intubation for airway protection, and chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. He is currently critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's arrest is unclear, and possible diagnoses include pulmonary embolism (PE), structural heart disease, or an event leading to arrhythmia/bradyarrhythmia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a pneumothorax requiring chest tube insertion. There may be complications related to the chest tube, such as infection or pneumothorax recurrence.
3. Rib fractures: The patient has multiple rib fractures causing pain and potentially affecting chest wall dynamics. This can lead to complications like pneumonia or atelectasis.
4. Intubation: The patient is intubated for airway protection. Complications related to mechanical ventilation and weaning from the ventilator can occur.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed carefully, considering his current critical condition.
6. Diabetes mellitus"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 91-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and previous myocardial infarction/cerebrovascular accident. He was found down at his nursing home and reportedly required CPR, but by the time EMS arrived, he had a perfusing rhythm. Possible diagnoses include pulmonary embolism, structural heart disease, or event leading to arrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia, or seizure. An electrocardiogram showed evidence of structural heart disease, but a limited echocardiogram study due to subcutaneous air was unremarkable. Cardiac enzymes did not increase, and tele monitoring was unenlightening. The patient's condition remains unclear.

The patient has been intubated for airway protection after vomiting in the oropharynx. He has multiple rib fractures with a pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement. His condition is complicated by difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation due to flail chest, no bowel movements since admission, and minimal drainage from the chest tube.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 77-99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/42-136/85 mmHg, respiratory rate at 16-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. He is sedated and responding to pain.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.5"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and previous myocardial infarction/stroke who was found down at his nursing home and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). He has multiple comorbidities and is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions. He is intubated due to airway protection after vomiting in the oropharynx, and is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. He has been diagnosed with a pneumothorax and underwent chest tube placement. He also has rib fractures and is experiencing subcutaneous emphysema. His cardiac enzymes are not elevated, indicating no ongoing myocardial injury. The patient's renal function is stable, and his blood glucose levels are controlled.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient has already been managed with chest tube placement, which is an appropriate intervention. However, ongoing monitoring through daily chest X-rays is necessary to ensure resolution of the pneumothorax and to check for any recurrence.
2. Rib fractures: The patient's pain management should be optimized to facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation and to prevent complications such as atelectasis or pneumonia. Pulmonary rehabilitation may be considered after stabilization to aid in recovery.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Strict adherence to ventil"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and previous myocardial infarction/cerebrovascular accident. He was found down at his nursing home and required CPR, which resulted in rib fracture, pneumothorax, and chest tubes. The patient's cardiac arrest is unclear, with possible diagnoses including pulmonary embolism, structural heart disease, or arrhythmia. An echocardiogram showed normal systolic function but was limited due to subcutaneous air. Cardiac enzymes did not increase. The patient has been intubated for airway protection after vomiting in the oropharynx. He has multiple rib fractures, pneumothorax treated with chest tube, and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient had a pneumothorax requiring chest tube insertion. There is a risk of recurrence or worsening of the pneumothorax if the chest tube becomes dislodged or if air leakage continues.
2. Rib Fractures: The patient has multiple rib fractures, which can lead to complications such as pain, difficulty breathing, and impaired lung function.
3. Sepsis: Due to the presence of subcutaneous air and potential infection from the chest tubes, there is a risk of developing sepsis.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-inch tall individual with unknown weight, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient underwent CT surgery and was placed on water seal with the recommendation to follow up with an evening chest X-ray. MRSA precautions were also initiated. Ventilatory support has been gradually weaned.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 160/63 to 96/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance data shows a total input of 1,550 mL and output of 935 mL, with urine output of 885 mL. Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation mode set at a tidal volume of 400 mL and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 40%, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at 20 cmH2O, and plateau pressure at 15 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.5 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level (Hct) of 32.8%, elevated platelet count (Plt) of 232 K/uL, normal creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8 mg/dL, and elevated troponin T level of 0.02 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD), pneumothorax, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), rib fracture, and a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or stroke.

ICU care includes nutrition provided through Fibersource HN at 45 mL/hour, glycemic control, central venous catheterization, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has full code status and no specific disposition mentioned in the progress note.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, pneumothorax expansion or recurrence, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and cardiac complications related to CAD."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 91-year-old male admitted to the ICU following a cardiac arrest. He has been diagnosed with pneumothorax and persistent respiratory failure. The source of the original insult is still unknown, and there has been minimal evidence of myocardial injury or significant infectious insult. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/70 mmHg to 160/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide history.

Physical examination findings include an endotracheal tube in place, chest tube to water seal, and peripheral vascular assessment not assessed. Neurologic examination is also not assessed due to sedation. The patient's labs show normal values for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. However, there are abnormalities in kidney function, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and cardiac markers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The presence of a pneumothorax increases the risk of tension pneumothorax, which can lead to cardiovascular collapse if not managed appropriately.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not managed effectively.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's recent cardiac arrest"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: [**Age over 90 211**] yo with HTN, DM2, hx of MI/CVA found down at his nursing home
   with apparent cardiac arrest requiring CPR which resulted in rib
   fracture, PTX, chest tubes.
   .
   # ?Cardiac arrest: He was found down and reportedly required CPR.
   However, by EMS arrival, he had a perfusing rhythm.  Unclear how long
   he was down, and if he ever truly arrested.  Possible diagnoses include
   PE, structural disease or event leading to arrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia,
   seizure.  EKG at admission showed RBBB of unclear origin, indicating
   possible structural heart disease.  ECHO unremarkable and showed good
   systolic function, but limited study due to subcutaneous air.  Cardiac
   enzymes did not increase.  Tele monitoring unenlightening.  Unclear why
   this patient arrested or if he ever did
   -          aspirin, continue to monitor
   -          As subq emphysema improves, consider a repeat echo if still
   concerned for structural heart disease.
   # Resp function: improved after short period of desaturation
   post-thoracostomy tube removal.  Given 20 of Lasix.
   - continue shovel mask ventilation
   # Pneumothorax: s/p chest tube.  CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] involved.  Tube removed,
   initially was air leak and short period of desat to mid 80
s but
   dressing was changed and patient improved clinically. CXR shows small
   pneumothorax in L apex
   - follow CXR daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and myocardial infarction/cerebrovascular accident. He was found down and required CPR, but it is unclear if he ever truly arrested.
- The patient has several medical complications, including rib fractures, pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, anemia, and chronic conjunctivitis.
- The patient's respiratory function has improved after thoracostomy tube removal, but he still requires supplemental oxygen.
- The patient's blood pressure is currently hypotensive, and his medications for hypertension are being held initially.
- The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and there is a need to increase surveillance for infection.
- The patient's platelet count is low, indicating potential bleeding risks.
- The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are not elevated, suggesting no acute myocardial infarction.
- The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range.
- The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are declining, indicating possible chronic disease-related anemia or frequent blood draws.
- The patient's kidney function is normal.
- The patient's liver function tests are within normal range.
- The patient's troponin level is negative, indicating no acute coronary syndrome.
- The patient's temperature, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen saturation are within normal range.

   # ?Cardiac arrest: He was found down and reportedly required CPR.
   However, by EMS arrival, he had a perfusing rhythm.  Unclear how long
   he was down, and if he ever truly arrested.  Possible diagnoses include
   PE, structural disease or event leading to arrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia,
   seizure.  EKG at admission showed RBBB of unclear origin, indicating
   possible structural heart disease.  ECHO unremarkable and showed good
   systolic function, but limited study due to subcutaneous air.  Cardiac
   enzymes did not increase.  Tele monitoring unenlightening.  Unclear why
   this patient arrested or if he ever did
   -          aspirin, continue to monitor
   -          As subq emphysema improves, consider a repeat echo if still
   concerned for structural heart disease.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and previous myocardial infarction/cerebrovascular accident who was found down at his nursing home and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). He has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is of unclear origin, with possible diagnoses including pulmonary embolism (PE), structural heart disease, arrhythmia, or bradyarrhythmia. The EKG showed right bundle branch block (RBBB), indicating possible structural heart disease, but cardiac enzymes did not increase, and an echocardiogram (echo) showed good systolic function. Further investigations are needed to determine the cause of the arrest.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a pneumothorax that required chest tube placement. He is currently on water seal and has had 100cc drainage since 6 AM. There is concern for long recuperation if multiple contiguous rib fractures have damaged chest wall dynamics.
3. Rib Fractures: The patient has rib fractures, which are causing pain. Pain control measures need to be implemented.
4. Hypertension (HTN): The patient's home antihypertensive medications are being held initially, but may be restarted gradually if he becomes hypertensive.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (DM2): Oral antihyper"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male who experienced cardiac arrest and was admitted with respiratory failure. He was successfully resuscitated and intubated but is now extubated with good ventilatory stability. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, pneumonia, pneumothorax, rib fracture, and a cerebrovascular accident (stroke). 

Currently, the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin, with normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat. There is dullness on percussion and very diffuse ronchi in all lung fields. No signs of abuse are observed. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated potassium, and other abnormalities in electrolyte levels. 

The patient's CXR indicates evidence of small recurrent pneumothorax seen on the morning's CXR. 

The assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for possible pneumonia, suctioning of chest tube as needed, and monitoring for any complications related to respiratory failure, coronary artery disease, pneumothorax, and rib fracture. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, further episodes of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male who was admitted with respiratory failure following cardiac arrest and successful CPR. He was intubated but is now extubated and shows good ventilatory stability without evidence of flail chest. The patient has significant ronchi, which may indicate hydrostatic pulmonary edema, non-hydrostatic edema, or aspiration pneumonitis in the post-extubation state.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory Failure Acute: The patient may experience respiratory failure again due to intubation-related issues or possible pneumonia. Empirical treatment for pneumonia will be continued, and chest physiotherapy with suctioning as needed will be performed.

2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD, Ischemic Heart Disease): The patient has a history of CAD, which increases the risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

3. Pneumothorax, Traumatic: Although the chest tube has been removed, the presence of a small apical pneumothorax on plain film suggests that there is a risk of recurrent pneumothorax. Close monitoring with follow-up chest X-rays is necessary to maintain stability.

4. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS/Doctor Last Name): The patient may experience acute respiratory failure due to other factors, which will require further evaluation and management.

5. Rib Fracture: The patient may have a rib fracture, which can cause"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and previous myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident. He was found down at his nursing home and required CPR, which resulted in rib fracture and pneumothorax. He has been intubated for airway protection and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is of unclear origin. Possible causes include pulmonary embolism, structural heart disease, or an event leading to arrhythmia. The EKG showed right bundle branch block of unclear origin, indicating possible structural heart disease. The cardiac enzymes did not increase, and further evaluation with tele monitoring and echocardiogram is needed to determine the cause of the arrest.
2. Respiratory function: The patient was intubated for airway protection after vomiting in the oropharynx. Ventilation parameters should be closely monitored, and weaning to pressure support should be continued. The plan is to check ABG and consider extubation if appropriate.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient had a pneumothorax that required chest tube insertion. Currently, the chest tube is at water seal with minimal drainage. Daily follow-up chest X-rays are recommended, and a CT scan is scheduled to assess the extent of the pneumothorax. If there are multiple contiguous rib fractures, there may be damage to chest wall dynamics,"

He was found down at his nursing home and required CPR, which resulted in rib fracture, pneumothorax, and subsequent chest tube insertion. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest may be due to various causes such as pulmonary embolism (PE), structural heart disease, or arrhythmia. It is important to monitor the patient closely and consider further investigations to determine the underlying cause.

2. Pneumothorax: The patient developed a pneumothorax, which required chest tube insertion. Although the pneumothorax is currently stable, it is necessary to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status and follow up with daily chest X-rays.

3. Rib fractures: The patient has rib fractures, which can cause significant pain and discomfort. Adequate pain control is essential to prevent complications such as pneumonia and atelectasis.

4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and it is important to monitor his blood pressure regularly. If the patient becomes hypertensive, restarting home antihypertensive medications may be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: [**Age over 90 211**] yo with HTN, DM2, hx of MI/CVA found down at his nursing home
   with apparent cardiac arrest requiring CPR which resulted in rib
   fracture, PTX, chest tubes.
   .
   # ?Cardiac arrest: He was found down and reportedly required CPR.
   However, by EMS arrival, he had a perfusing rhythm.  Unclear how long
   he was down, and if he ever truly arrested.  Possible diagnoses include
   PE, structural disease or event leading to arrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia,
   seizure.  EKG at admission showed RBBB of unclear origin, indicating
   possible structural heart disease.  ECHO unremarkable and showed good
   systolic function, but limited study due to subcutaneous air.  Cardiac
   enzymes did not increase.  Tele monitoring unenlightening.  Unclear why
   this patient arrested or if he ever did
   -          aspirin, continue to monitor
   -          As subq emphysema improves, consider a repeat echo if still
   concerned for structural heart disease.
   # Resp function: intubated for airway protection after seeing vomit in
   oropharynx.  Extubated successfully [**2192-10-29**] and currently breathing
   without difficulty on room air.
   .
   # Pneumothorax: s/p chest tube.  CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] involved.  Bolused fentanyl in
   small doses to ease pain and aid in weaning from vent.   Initially
   transferred to water seal and then removed on [**2192-10-30**] with new small
   left pneumothorax.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an elderly male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and previous myocardial infarction/stroke. He was found down at his nursing home and required CPR, resulting in rib fractures and pneumothorax. A chest tube was inserted but subsequently removed, leading to a small new left pneumothorax.
- The patient has been intubated for airway protection and later extubated successfully. He is currently breathing without difficulty on room air.
- The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with increased disorientation in the evening, also known as ""sundowning.""
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/49 to 142/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count.
- The patient's chest X-ray shows a decrease in size of the left pneumothorax.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient has experienced a pneumothorax, which can lead to respiratory distress and decreased oxygenation.
2. Rib fractures: The patient's rib fractures can cause pain and difficulty in breathing.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 91-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure following cardiac arrest. He had a significant pneumothorax and traumatic rib fractures. The patient has been extubated and his chest tube was removed. He experiences intermittent delirium, but his oxygenation and ventilation are excellent. He is able to clear secretions with encouragement and suctioning.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumothorax: The patient has a small persistent pneumothorax as seen on chest X-ray. This can lead to recurrent respiratory problems and may require surgical intervention.

2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing intermittent agitation and confusion consistent with delirium. This can increase the risk of falls, self-extubation, and other complications in the ICU setting.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which increases the risk of myocardial ischemia or infarction.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure, which could progress to chronic respiratory failure if not managed properly.

5. Rib Fractures: The patient has traumatic rib fractures, which can cause severe pain and limit chest wall movement, increasing the risk of respiratory complications.

6. Stroke: The patient has a history of hemorrhagic stroke, which may contribute to his current delirium and increase the risk of further neurological complications.

7. Deep Vein Thrombosis ("
