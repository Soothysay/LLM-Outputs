   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old man with transitional cell bladder cancer
   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including today's ureteral
   stent swap in the OR by urology; he comes to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for management of
   post-op afib and hypotension.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS
   Multifactorial: RVR and inadequate filling times; likely infection and
   sepsis leading to probable low SVR and effective intravascular
   hypovolemia; also with possible cardiac ischemia concerning for
   decreased cardiac output due to myocardial injury.  Patient was
   initially on neo, vasopressin was added, still with suboptimal MAP
   as a result he was transitioned to levophed and the neo was
   discontinued, with improvement in his MAP
s likely partially related to
   increased cardiac output from the Beta 1 activity.  Additionally, the
   levophed did not exacerbate his tachycardia.
   - check CVP to eval volume status; fluids per sepsis protocol if low
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn and linezolid, zosyn for coverage of
   GU organisms, linazolid b/c the patient was colonized with VRE and
   concern for systemic spread with instrumentation
   - patient with newly elevated white count overnight to 29, pt. with h/o
   C.diff will start empiric treatment with flagyl and po vancomycin, and
   send stool for C. diff
   - renal u/s to evaluate for possible hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, and
   to ensure that the stents are draining
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
   - if all cx
s are negative then would need to consider a more
   cardiogenic cause of hypotension
   - continue to monitor UOP, as it has been between 15-30cc
s per hour,
   concern for hypoperfusion and possible obstruction
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: DDx is obstruction vs. ATN from hypoperfusion,
   could be combination of both
   - Acute bump in Cr to 3.7, concern for decreased GFR to almost zero
   given drastic rise in Cr
   - F/U renal U/S from this morning, concern that patient may need
   percutaneous nephrotomy tubes based on results, Urology is following
   closely, appreciate recs
   - Send urine electrolytes and sediment
   - More aggressive IV fluid hydration
   - continue to monitor urine output
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s.  Concern for
   strain on his heart with his recent A.Fib with RVR, especially with
   elevated CK
s and mildly elevated troponins.  Patient has not had any
   chest pain throughout this episode, and his CK index is very low with
   elevated CK
s and low MB
s.  Also with his new renal failure playing a
   role in not clearing the troponins/CK
s.  Elevated enzymes likely due
   to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and rapid heart rate.
   - will continue to hold patient
s home metoprolol in the setting of
   sepsis
   - continue amio infusion for rate control
   - cardiac enzymes cycled with similar pattern of elevated CK, low MB,
   normal index and mildly elevated troponins to 0.03
   - check an echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of transitional cell bladder cancer, who presented to the ICU for management of post-operative atrial fibrillation and hypotension. He underwent a neobladder procedure and multiple procedures for ureteral function. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, fever, and decreased urine output with gross blood.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 102.8°F (39.3°C)
- Heart rate: 82 bpm (range: 81-163 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 100/59 mmHg (range: 70/31-118/83 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute (range: 10-34 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 94% on nasal cannula

The patient is on several medications including amiodarone, vasopressin, norepinephrine, diltiazem, metoprolol, lorazepam, morphine sulfate, fentanyl, midazolam, and heparin sodium.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis:
   - Multifactorial causes including RVR, inadequate filling times, infection, sepsis, low systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and possible cardiac ischemia.
   - Antibiotic coverage with Zosyn and Linezolid.
   - Check C"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old man with transitional cell bladder cancer
   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including today's ureteral
   stent swap in the OR by urology; he comes to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for management of
   post-op afib and hypotension.
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10544**] rates are in the 130s-150s here which apparently is
   consistent with prior post-op course. Triggers likely multifactorial
   including post-op stress, possible hypovolemia, possible infection.
   Atrial enlargement and pre-operative afib makes chances of success with
   DC cardioversion less, and given that this will likely continue as a
   chronic problem, rate/rhythm control will be important. Metoprolol is
   home med, apparently effective at home; but not ideal in setting of
   possible sepsis.
   - amiodarone loading
   - restart home beta blocker when pressures normalize
   - in short term, continue neosynephrine for possible effect on rate,
   though at this dose may not be sufficient to induce reflex slowing of
   heart rate;
   - family does not want DC cardioversion; of uncertain benefit as above;
   but would return to discussion of this if none of the above is
   effective in rate control
   .
   HYPOTENSION
   Multifactorial: RVR and inadequate filling times; likely infection and
   sepsis leading to probable low SVR and effective intravascular
   hypovolemia; sedation possibly contributing though not varying
   considerably w levels of alertness. Possible that cardiac ischemia
   could be contributor, not to atrial fibrillation per se but to poor
   output state. Lactate elevated: consistent with poor perfusion.
   - neo for now; add vasopressin and wean neo if continuing to need
   pressors in medium term
   - check CVP to eval volume status; fluids per sepsis protocol if low
   - cardiac enzymes
   - consider echocardiogram if BP not rising with better rate control
   .
   ?SEPSIS
   While writing this note, RN obtained high rectal temp of 102.8; picture
   overall c/w post-op sepsis likely secondary to manipulation of
   chronically infected area of stents and neobladder. Past VRE
   colonization of urinary tract. High lactate unlikely to be due to
   hypotension [**2-17**] afib alone, or to post-op trauma; sepsis is most likely
   to cause this level of elevation, vs. prolonged hypotension for other

","The patient is a 69-year-old man with transitional cell bladder cancer who underwent a neobladder procedure. He is currently in the ICU for post-operative atrial fibrillation and hypotension. The patient has a history of chronic infection in the area of the stents and neobladder, which increases the risk of post-operative sepsis.

Summary:
- The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response post urologic procedure and is on higher doses of levophed but is able to maintain his pressure much better.
- CVP initially low but increased drastically with IVF.
- The patient has grossly bloody urine output overnight and rising creatinine, causing concern for obstruction.
- The patient's white count is rapidly climbing, indicating possible infection.
- The patient has been started on empiric flagyl and po vancomycin for C. diff.
- Blood cultures were drawn.
- The patient's fever is controlled with antipyretics.
- The patient's blood pressure is being supported with vasopressors.
- The patient's heart rate is controlled with amiodarone.
- The patient's electrolytes and renal function are within normal limits.
- The patient has a history of VRE colonization of the urinary tract.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Obstruction: The patient's decreased urine output and grossly bloody urine suggest the possibility of obstruction in the urinary tract. This could be due to the neobladder or ureteral stents"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   ACIDOSIS
   ==========================
   Hypotension persists. CVP is 11 this AM without significant respiratory
   variation; mucus membranes dry. Mixed venous saturation is 83%
   consistent with sepsis rather than a low cardiac output as cause of
   hypotension. Heart rate now well controlled, so afib less likely a
   contributing factor. Will give some additional fluid today to see if we
   can wean the levophed and improve cardiac output. The rapid rise in CVP
   with fluids last night suggests diastolic dysfunction. Oxygenation
   remains good with small amount of supplemental oxygen.
   Creat up over 1 mg% in 24 hours, suggesting GFR of almost zero. Needs
   renal ultrasound to make sure that we are not dealing with obstructed
   stents as cause of renal failure. If no obstruction, I fear that
   patient may be in ATN; check urine sediment and urine electrolytes.
   Continues on antibiotics for gram negative and possible VRE, with which
   he has been colonized in past. Will adjust dosing for renal
   dysfunction. Check stool for c diff given incontinence/diarrhea.
   Acidosis with anion gap consistent with acute renal failure and
   possibly lactate with hypotension. Addressing both issues as above.
   Heart rate much better controlled with amiodarone. Concern he may have
   had demand ischemia and NSTEMI with high heart rates yesterday.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several significant health issues. They are experiencing hypotension, atrial fibrillation (AFib), renal failure, anemia, and bladder cancer. The patient's condition has been worsening, as evidenced by a rise in creatinine levels, indicating a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The patient's urine output is decreasing, and they have elevated CPK levels. They are receiving multiple medications, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and antiarrhythmics. The patient has a history of colonizing with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's mixed venous saturation of 83% suggests sepsis as the cause of hypotension. Close monitoring and prompt management are essential.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The rapid rise in creatinine levels, coupled with the decline in GFR, indicates acute renal failure. A renal ultrasound should be performed to rule out any obstruction in the urinary tract. If no obstruction is found, the patient may be at risk of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's mental status changes, such as being attentive, following simple commands, responding to verbal stimuli, and being oriented to time, place, and person, suggest delirium or confusion. This condition requires close monitoring and appropriate interventions.

   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including today's ureteral
   stent swap in the OR by urology; he comes to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for management of
   post-op afib and hypotension.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS
   Multifactorial: RVR and inadequate filling times; likely infection and
   sepsis leading to probable low SVR and effective intravascular
   hypovolemia; also with possible cardiac ischemia concerning for
   decreased cardiac output due to myocardial injury.  Patient was
   initially on neo, vasopressin was added, still with suboptimal MAP
   as a result he was transitioned to levophed and the neo was
   discontinued, with improvement in his MAP
s likely partially related to
   increased cardiac output from the Beta 1 activity.  Additionally, the
   levophed did not exacerbate his tachycardia.
   - check CVP to eval volume status; fluids per sepsis protocol if low
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn and linezolid, zosyn for coverage of
   GU organisms, linazolid b/c the patient was colonized with VRE and
   concern for systemic spread with instrumentation
   - patient with newly elevated white count overnight to 29, pt. with h/o
   C.diff will start empiric treatment with flagyl and po vancomycin, and
   send stool for C. diff
   - renal u/s to evaluate for possible hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, and
   to ensure that the stents are draining
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
   - if all cx
s are negative then would need to consider a more
   cardiogenic cause of hypotension
   - continue to monitor UOP, as it has been between 15-30cc
s per hour,
   concern for hypoperfusion and possible obstruction
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: DDx is obstruction vs. ATN from hypoperfusion,
   could be combination of both
   - Acute bump in Cr to 3.7, concern for decreased GFR to almost zero
   given drastic rise in Cr
   - F/U renal U/S from this morning, concern that patient may need
   percutaneous nephrotomy tubes based on results, Urology is following
   closely, appreciate recs
   - Send urine electrolytes and sediment
   - More aggressive IV fluid hydration
   - continue to monitor urine output
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s.  Concern for
   strain on his heart with his recent A.Fib with RVR, especially with
   elevated CK
s and mildly elevated troponins.  Patient has not had any
   chest pain throughout this episode, and his CK index is very low with
   elevated CK
s and low MB
s.  Also with his new renal failure playing a
   role in not clearing the troponins/CK
s.  Elevated enzymes likely due
   to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and rapid heart rate.
   - will continue to hold patient
s home metoprolol in the setting of
   sepsis
   - continue amio infusion for rate control
   - cardiac enzymes cycled with similar pattern of elevated CK, low MB,
   normal index and mildly elevated troponins to 0.03
   - check an echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function

   Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis. There
   is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
   ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Renal U/S: 1. Right sided pelvicaliectasis with mild dilation of
   proximal ureter, markedly improved when compared to prior exam. 2. Mild
   hydronephrosis on the left with a stent in place, hydronephrosis
   markedly improved when compared to prior exam. A small cyst in the left
   upper pole.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old man with transitional cell bladder cancer
   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including recent ureteral stent
   swap in the OR; currently in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for afib with rvr and septic shock
   with multi-organ dysfunction.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Continues to have pressor requirements are
   increasing to maintain appropriate MAPs, also significantly more
   tachycardic; all leading to poor perfusion with dysfunction of his
   kidneys, liver, blood, heart
   Multifactorial:
   1.  Cardiogenic in part: RVR leading to inadequate filling times and
   afib causing loss of atrial kick leading to decreased stroke volume
   also  cardiac ischemia concerning for decreased cardiac output due to
   myocardial injury  as echo shows new inferior wall hypokinesis.
   2. Sepsis: Also  likely infection and sepsis leading to probable low
   PVR and effective intravascular hypovolemia; although CVP of 15 this
   AM. Patient appears intravascularly depleted as he has a low CVP.
   - Difficult fluid status as paitent appears intravascularly down yet
   cardiac function is decreased leading to a component of pulmonary
   edema.
   - check CVP to eval volume status with a goal of [**11-28**] and diurese or
   bolus as needed.
   - Wean down pressors as patient can tolerate, maintaining a sbp > 100
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn and linezolid, zosyn for coverage of
   GU organisms, linazolid b/c the patient was colonized with VRE and
   concern for systemic spread with instrumentation
   - patient with white count of 26.9 with a peak of 29.7; pt. with h/o
   C.diff; empiric treatment with flagyl and po Vancomycin started
   yesterday, and stool sent for C. diff
   - renal u/s shows no hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, stents are draining
   appropriately; urology following
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
   - continue to monitor UOP
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone infustion, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s. Once
   infusion stopped, HR significantly rose. 2.5 IV metoprolol appeared to
   have dropped his pressures significantly with MAPs in the 50s. Concern
   that this fast rate is decreasing perfusion to vital organs, including
   the heart (new inferior wall hypokinesis) and kidney (ATN?)
   - Consider adding back amio infusion as patient has not had the full 10
   gram load
can load in IV form.
   - If patient still not rate controlled, consider adding digoxin
   - will continue to hold patient
s home metoprolol in the setting of
   sepsis
   - Consider Cards consult if not able to control rate with medication,
   as patient may need to be cardioverted
   - Hold anticoagulation for now in setting of coagulopathy
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: ATN most likely as patient is hypotensive
   - Acute bump in Cr to 5.2.
   - keyexelate for high k and serial ekgs
   - sevelmer for high phosphate
   - repeat lytes at noon
   - continue to monitor urine output
   - Renal following closely
   .
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Gap of 21 this morning. High lactate of 3.9 and
   rising BUN likely metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.
   - 3 amps of bicarb in d5W for now.
   - repeat lytes at noon today
   .
   SOB: crackles at bases and patient dyspneic when sitting up. Likely
   related to volume resuscitation.  Also, worsening after drank juice
   this AM for low BS. Concern for aspiration as well.
   - CXR today
   - Lasix boluses prn to improve breathing
   .
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA/COAGULOPATHY: Rising INR and decreasing platelets.
   Fibrinogen high/normal (acute phase reactant) but higher than expected
   it would be if patient was in DIC
   - Hold heparin and send HIT antibody
   - trend coags, lfts and DIC panel
   - peripheral smear
   TRANSAMINITIS: likely a hit from his hypotension, not likely shock
   liver as enzymes are trending down.
   - monitor lfts
   - consider ultrasound for possible portal venous thrombosis in setting
   of coagulopathy

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of transitional cell bladder cancer, who is currently in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications. Some of the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has an ejection fraction of 30-40% and evidence of inferior wall hypokinesis on the echocardiogram, indicating possible myocardial injury and decreased cardiac output.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a high white blood cell count and positive cultures for gram-positive cocci, suggesting a bacterial infection that may be contributing to sepsis.

3. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and low urine output suggest acute renal failure, possibly due to hypoperfusion or direct infection.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's crackles in the lungs and low oxygen saturation indicate possible fluid overload or pneumonia, which could be exacerbated by the patient's inability to protect his airway.

5. Thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy: The patient's decreasing platelet count and rising INR suggest a possible bleeding risk, possibly related to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or sepsis-induced coagulopathy.

6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's elevated an"

   No other new culture data.
   Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis. There
   is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
   ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Renal U/S: 1. Right sided pelvicaliectasis with mild dilation of
   proximal ureter, markedly improved when compared to prior exam. 2. Mild
   hydronephrosis on the left with a stent in place, hydronephrosis
   markedly improved when compared to prior exam. A small cyst in the left
   upper pole.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old man with transitional cell bladder cancer
   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including recent ureteral stent
   swap in the OR; currently in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for afib with rvr and septic shock
   with multi-organ dysfunction.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Worsening as pressor requirements are increasing to
   maintain appropriate MAPs, also significantly more tachycardic; all
   leading to poor perfusion with dysfunction of his kidneys, liver,
   blood, heart
   Multifactorial:
   1.  Cardiogenic in part: RVR leading to inadequate filling times and
   afib causing loss of atrial kick leading to decreased stroke volume
   also  cardiac ischemia concerning for decreased cardiac output due to
   myocardial injury  as echo shows new inferior wall hypokinesis.
   2. Sepsis: Also  likely infection and sepsis leading to probable low
   PVR and effective intravascular hypovolemia; although CVP of 15 this
   AM.
   -
   - check CVP to eval volume status; fluids per sepsis protocol if low
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn and linezolid, zosyn for coverage of
   GU organisms, linazolid b/c the patient was colonized with VRE and
   concern for systemic spread with instrumentation
   - patient with white count of 26.9 with a peak of 29.7; pt. with h/o
   C.diff; empiric treatment with flagyl and po Vancomycin started
   yesterday, and stool sent for C. diff
   - renal u/s shows no hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, stents are draining
   appropriately; urology following
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
   - continue to monitor UOP, as it has been between 15-30cc
s per hour,
   concern for ongoing hypoperfusion.
   .
   SOB: crackles at bases and patient dyspneic when sitting up. Likely
   related to volume resuscitation.  Also, worsening after drank juice
   this AM for low BS. Concern for aspiration as well.
   - CXR today
   - Lasix boluses prn to improve
   -
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: ATN most likely as patient is hypotensive
   - Acute bump in Cr to 5.2.
   - Consider giving lasix to make patient in non-oliguric ATN vs.
   oliguric ATN.
   - F/U renal U/S from this morning, concern that patient may need
   percutaneous nephrotomy tubes based on results, Urology is following
   closely, appreciate recs
   - granular casts; pre-renal may be component
   - kayexelate for high K
   - continue to monitor urine output
   - Renal following

   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone infustion, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s. Once
   infusion stopped, HR significantly rose. 2.5 IV metoprolol appeared to
   have dropped his pressures significantly with MAPs in the 50s. Concern
   that this fast rate is decreasing perfusion to vital organs, including
   the heart (new inferior wall hypokinesis) and kidney (ATN?)
   - Consider adding digoxin to control rate as it will not decrease BP as
   much as BBs or CCBs.
   - will continue to hold patient
s home metoprolol in the setting of
   sepsis
   - continue amio 200 [**Hospital1 7**] for rate control
   - Consider Cards consult if not able to control rate with medication,
   as patient may need to be cardioverted
   - Hold anticoagulation for now in setting of coagulopathy
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA/COAGULOPATHY: Rising INR and decreasing platelets.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of transitional cell bladder cancer, who is currently in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is likely causing low peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) and effective intravascular hypovolemia. Antibiotic coverage has been started with Zosyn and Linezolid, and empiric treatment for C. difficile has been initiated.

The patient's renal function is deteriorating, with an increase in creatinine levels and oliguria. Renal ultrasound shows no signs of obstruction, and stents are draining appropriately. However, there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension. Lasix boluses may be given to improve urine output.

The patient's atrial fibrillation has improved rate control while on amiodarone infusion but worsened upon stopping the infusion. Rate control is a concern, and digoxin may be considered to control the rate without significantly decreasing blood pressure.

Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy are present, with a rising INR and decreasing platelets. Heparin has been held, and a HIT antibody test has been sent. Coagulation trends, liver function tests, and a DIC panel are being monitored.

The patient is NPO for now, pending a possible"

   Chief Complaint: Septic Shock/Afib with RVR
   24 Hour Events:
   - urgent renal ultrasound --> did not show signs of obstruction; pt
   does not need IR nephrostomy tubes
   - started empiric flagyl and po vanc for c diff and sent of c diff
   toxin test
   - ECHO:  mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   inferior hypokinesis. Trivial mitral regurgitation
   - urine output dropped off significantly for a couple of hours-- he
   responded well to 80mg IV bolus lasix--> about 800ccs urine in first
   few hours, then continued (increased from having very decreased urine
   output)--> started dropping off around 5am; (80 mg IV lasix x 2)
   - given 250cc bolus IVFs to help keep BP, but had crackles in lungs
   - after amiodarone infusion per protocol finished in late evening 1700,
   HR trended up to 130s.  pt had drop in BP w 2.5mg IV metoprolol to MAP
   of 40s-50s, so given 250ml bolus IVFs; HR into 110s, briefly into low
   100s, very labile ; levophed was turned up, vasopressin continued
   - K+ rapidly rising.  At 0200, K+ 5.5 (from 5.4) after 80mg IV lasix
   --> need to watch for continuing rise... so ordered for kayexalate when
   he wakes up;
   will give another 80mg IV lasix if his BP becomes stable and he can
   tolerate
   - Cr and phosphate rapidly rising as well throughout day/night
   - stopped subq Heparin b/c platelets appear to be dropping (dropped
   from 163 to 116 to 90); HIT-Ab sent
   - INR rising as well, but fibrinogen elevated (Acute phase reactant,

   No other new culture data.
   Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis. There
   is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old man with transitional cell bladder cancer
   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including recent ureteral stent
   swap in the OR; currently in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for afib with rvr and septic shock
   with multi-organ dysfunction.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Worsening as pressor requirements are increasing to
   maintain appropriate MAPs, also significantly more tachycardic; all
   leading to poor perfusion with dysfunction of his kidneys, liver,
   blood, heart
   Multifactorial:
   1.  Cardiogenic in part: RVR leading to inadequate filling times and
   afib causing loss of atrial kick leading to decreased stroke volume
   also  cardiac ischemia concerning for decreased cardiac output due to
   myocardial injury  as echo shows new inferior wall hypokinesis.
   2. Sepsis: Also  likely infection and sepsis leading to probable low
   PVR and effective intravascular hypovolemia
   -
   - check CVP to eval volume status; fluids per sepsis protocol if low
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn and linezolid, zosyn for coverage of
   GU organisms, linazolid b/c the patient was colonized with VRE and
   concern for systemic spread with instrumentation
   - patient with white count of 26.9 with a peak of 29.7; pt. with h/o
   C.diff; empiric treatment with flagyl and po Vancomycin started
   yesterday, and stool sent for C. diff
   - renal u/s shows no hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, stents are draining
   appropriately; urology following
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
   - continue to monitor UOP, as it has been between 15-30cc
s per hour,
   concern for ongoing hypoperfusion.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: DDx is obstruction vs. ATN from hypoperfusion,
   could be combination of both
   - Acute bump in Cr to 3.7, concern for decreased GFR to almost zero
   given drastic rise in Cr
   - F/U renal U/S from this morning, concern that patient may need
   percutaneous nephrotomy tubes based on results, Urology is following
   closely, appreciate recs
   - Send urine electrolytes and sediment
   - More aggressive IV fluid hydration
   - continue to monitor urine output
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s.  Concern for
   strain on his heart with his recent A.Fib with RVR, especially with
   elevated CK
s and mildly elevated troponins.  Patient has not had any
   chest pain throughout this episode, and his CK index is very low with
   elevated CK
s and low MB
s.  Also with his new renal failure playing a
   role in not clearing the troponins/CK
s.  Elevated enzymes likely due
   to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and rapid heart rate.
   - will continue to hold patient
s home metoprolol in the setting of
   sepsis
   - continue amio infusion for rate control
   - cardiac enzymes cycled with similar pattern of elevated CK, low MB,
   normal index and mildly elevated troponins to 0.03
   - check an echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with transitional cell bladder cancer, who has undergone neobladder surgery and multiple procedures for ureteral function. He is currently in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction.

The patient's current condition is characterized by worsening hypotension and sepsis, leading to poor perfusion and dysfunction of his kidneys, liver, blood, and heart. The hypotension is likely due to cardiogenic factors such as reduced stroke volume caused by atrial fibrillation and cardiac ischemia, as well as sepsis-related effective intravascular hypovolemia.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a significant increase in serum creatinine levels from 2.2 to 4.9 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure. The differential diagnosis includes obstruction versus acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypoperfusion, or a combination of both. Further evaluation is needed, including renal ultrasound, urine electrolytes, and continued monitoring of urine output.

The patient's atrial fibrillation has shown improved rate control while on amiodarone, but there is concern for strain on the heart due to elevated cardiac enzymes and mildly elevated troponin levels. These elevated enzymes are likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and rapid heart rate. The patient's metop"

   - urgent renal ultrasound --> did not show signs of obstruction; pt
   does not need IR nephrostomy tubes
   - started empiric flagyl and po vanc for c diff and sent of c diff
   toxin test
   - ECHO:  mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   inferior hypokinesis. Trivial mitral regurgitation
   - urine output dropped off significantly for a couple of hours-- he
   responded well to 80mg IV bolus lasix--> about 800ccs urine in first
   few hours, then continued (increased from having very decreased urine
   output)--> started dropping off around 5am; (80 mg IV lasix x 2)
   - given 250cc bolus IVFs to help keep BP, but had crackles in lungs
   - after amiodarone infusion per protocol finished in late evening 1700,
   HR trended up to 130s.  pt had drop in BP w 2.5mg IV metoprolol to MAP
   of 40s-50s, so given 250ml bolus IVFs; HR into 110s, briefly into low
   100s, very labile ; levophed was turned up, vasopressin continued
   - K+ rapidly rising.  At 0200, K+ 5.5 (from 5.4) after 80mg IV lasix
   --> need to watch for continuing rise... so ordered for kayexalate when
   he wakes up;
   will give another 80mg IV lasix if his BP becomes stable and he can

   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Worsening as pressor requirements are increasing to
   maintain appropriate MAPs, also significantly more tachycardic; all
   leading to poor perfusion with dysfunction of his kidneys, liver,
   blood, heart
   Multifactorial:
   1.  Cardiogenic in part: RVR leading to inadequate filling times and
   afib causing loss of atrial kick leading to decreased stroke volume
   also  cardiac ischemia concerning for decreased cardiac output due to
   myocardial injury  as echo shows new inferior wall hypokinesis.
   2. Sepsis: Also  likely infection and sepsis leading to probable low
   PVR and effective intravascular hypovolemia; although CVP of 15 this
   AM.
   -
   - check CVP to eval volume status; fluids per sepsis protocol if low
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn and linezolid, zosyn for coverage of
   GU organisms, linazolid b/c the patient was colonized with VRE and
   concern for systemic spread with instrumentation
   - patient with white count of 26.9 with a peak of 29.7; pt. with h/o
   C.diff; empiric treatment with flagyl and po Vancomycin started
   yesterday, and stool sent for C. diff
   - renal u/s shows no hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, stents are draining
   appropriately; urology following
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
   - continue to monitor UOP, as it has been between 15-30cc
s per hour,
   concern for ongoing hypoperfusion.
   .
   SOB: crackles at bases and patient dyspneic when sitting up. Likely
   related to volume resuscitation.  Also, worsening after drank juice
   this AM for low BS. Concern for aspiration as well.
   - CXR today
   - Lasix boluses prn to improve breathing
   -
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: ATN most likely as patient is hypotensive
   - Acute bump in Cr to 5.2.
   - keyexelate for high k and serial ekgs
   - sevelmer for high phosphate
   - repeat lytes at noon
   - continue to monitor urine output
   - Renal following closely
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Gap of 21 this morning. High lactate of 3.9 and
   rising BUN likely metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.
   - 3 amps of bicarb in d5W for now.
   - repeat lytes at noon today
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone infustion, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s. Once
   infusion stopped, HR significantly rose. 2.5 IV metoprolol appeared to
   have dropped his pressures significantly with MAPs in the 50s. Concern
   that this fast rate is decreasing perfusion to vital organs, including
   the heart (new inferior wall hypokinesis) and kidney (ATN?)
   - Consider adding digoxin to control rate as it will not decrease BP as
   much as BBs or CCBs.
   - will continue to hold patient
s home metoprolol in the setting of
   sepsis
   - continue amio 200 [**Hospital1 7**] for rate control
   - Consider Cards consult if not able to control rate with medication,
   as patient may need to be cardioverted
   - Hold anticoagulation for now in setting of coagulopathy
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA/COAGULOPATHY: Rising INR and decreasing platelets.
   Fibrinogen high/normal (acute phase reactant) but higher than expected
   it would be if patient was in DIC
   - Hold heparin and send HIT antibody
   - trend coags, lfts and DIC panel
   - peripheral smear
   TRANSAMINITIS: likely a hit from his hypotension, not likely shock
   liver as enzymes are trending down.
   - monitor lfts
   - consider ultrasound for possible portal venous thrombosis in setting
   of coagulopathy

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of transitional cell bladder cancer, who is currently in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction. He has undergone multiple procedures for ureteral function after neobladder creation. His condition is deteriorating, with worsening hypotension, tachycardia, and poor perfusion leading to dysfunction of his kidneys, liver, blood, and heart. The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and is being treated empirically for C. difficile infection. He also has acute renal failure with an increase in serum creatinine levels, metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap, and thrombocytopenia with a decreasing platelet count. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, and there is a concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He is on multiple pressors and vasopressin to maintain blood pressure and has received amiodarone for rate control in AFib. The patient has a history of cardiogenic shock and sepsis contributing to his current condition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's worsening hypotension and sepsis are leading to poor perfusion, which can further compromise organ function.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's history of cardiogenic shock and the presence of inferior"

   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Echocardiogram showed new regional LV systolic dysfunction.
   Urine output decreased yesterday and patient given lasix with increased
   urine output, which has persisted this morning.
   Started on kayexalate for rising potassium.
   After amiodarone switched to oral dose started, HR rose again. Given
   beta blocker but BP then dropped farther. Patient on norepi and
   vasopressin.
   Platelets dropped yesterday. Heparin stopped and HIT workup initiated.
   INR also was up and patient was given vitamin K.

   Patient remains hypotensive, although now on lower dose of norepi and
   urine output has increased after initial dose of lasix. Keep CVP 11-13
   if possible given the balance between BP and what appears to be CHF now
   on exam and CXR. Patient has combination of systolic and diastolic
   cardiac dysfunction. Will aim for negative total body fluid balance of
   [**1-16**].5L for the day. Attempt to wean dose of levophed further today.
   Creat continues to rise and metabolic acidosis, likely related to his
   renal failure, is worsening. His present respiratory distress is likely
   due in part to his attempts to compensate for this. Will give
   bicarbonate today (start with 3 amps in 1L of D5W). Patient also
   getting some calcium repletion (keeping eye on calcium-phosphate
   product). [**Location (un) **]-gel started for phosphate. Elevated potassium should be
   helped by correction of acidemia and increase in urine output.
   Platelet count down. Heparin being held. HIT workup started. Watching

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual presenting with hypotension, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and acidosis. They have been diagnosed with severe sepsis, delirium, thrombocytopenia, and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's condition is complicated by a combination of systolic and diastolic cardiac dysfunction. They have been experiencing fever and bandemia. The patient's vital signs indicate an elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and an increased respiratory rate. Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate, as well as signs of metabolic acidosis. The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and medications to manage their electrolyte imbalances. The patient's care plan includes maintaining a negative fluid balance, weaning off levophed, administering bicarbonate to correct metabolic acidosis, and monitoring for DIC."

   ureteral function after the neobladder, including recent ureteral stent
   swap in the OR; currently in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for afib with rvr and septic shock
   with multi-organ dysfunction.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Continues to have pressor requirements are
   increasing to maintain appropriate MAPs, also significantly more
   tachycardic; all leading to poor perfusion with dysfunction of his
   kidneys, liver, blood, heart
   Multifactorial:
   1.  Cardiogenic in part: RVR leading to inadequate filling times and
   afib causing loss of atrial kick leading to decreased stroke volume
   also  cardiac ischemia concerning for decreased cardiac output due to
   myocardial injury  as echo shows new inferior wall hypokinesis.
   2. Sepsis: Also  likely infection and sepsis leading to probable low
   PVR and effective intravascular hypovolemia; although CVP of 15 this
   AM. Patient appears intravascularly depleted as he has a low CVP.
   - Difficult fluid status as paitent appears intravascularly down yet
   cardiac function is decreased leading to a component of pulmonary
   edema.

   appropriately; urology following
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
   - continue to monitor UOP
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone infustion, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s. Once
   infusion stopped, HR significantly rose. 2.5 IV metoprolol appeared to
   have dropped his pressures significantly with MAPs in the 50s. Concern
   that this fast rate is decreasing perfusion to vital organs, including
   the heart (new inferior wall hypokinesis) and kidney (ATN?)
   - Consider adding back amio infusion as patient has not had the full 10
   gram load

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with transitional cell bladder cancer, who has undergone neobladder surgery and multiple procedures for ureteral function. He is currently admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient continues to require increasing amounts of pressors to maintain adequate mean arterial pressures (MAPs), indicating poor perfusion and dysfunction of vital organs such as the kidneys, liver, and heart. This could lead to further deterioration in organ function and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's rapid ventricular response and atrial fibrillation may contribute to inadequate filling times and loss of atrial kick, resulting in decreased stroke volume and cardiac output. This can be exacerbated by myocardial injury, as suggested by the new inferior wall hypokinesis seen on echocardiogram. Immediate intervention is necessary to stabilize cardiac function.
3. Infection/Sepsis: The patient likely has an ongoing infection, evidenced by high white blood cell count and positive cultures. This could be contributing to septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction. Antibiotic coverage should be continued and tailored based on culture results.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's acute rise in creatinine suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN), possibly due to hypotension"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe chest pain and difficulty breathing. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and a previous myocardial infarction. Upon arrival, vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 160/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 88% on room air. 

The patient was promptly evaluated and diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to a severe pulmonary embolism. Initial management included supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and thrombolytic therapy. 

Over the course of the patient's stay in the ICU, the following observations and interventions have been noted:

- The patient's oxygen requirements have decreased from 100% to 40% on day 2, and he has been successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation.
- A chest X-ray performed on day 3 showed improvement in lung infiltrates.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes have normalized, indicating no further myocardial injury.
- The patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled with medication.
- The patient has been actively participating in physical therapy and has shown improvement in his mobility.
- A pulmonary angiogram performed on day 5 confirmed resolution of the pulmonary embolism.
- The patient's arterial blood gases have normalized, demonstrating adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
- The patient has been started on anticoagulation therapy to prevent further thromboembolic events.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient may experience difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation, leading to prolonged ventilation and associated complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or ventilator-associated lung injury.

2. Fluid overload: The patient may develop fluid overload due to the use of high doses of fluids during resuscitation, leading to pulmonary edema and worsening of ARDS.

3. Thromboembolic events: Despite the resolution of the pulmonary embolism, the patient is at increased risk of developing further thromboembolic events due to his history of thrombophilia (hypertension, diabetes) and immobilization during mechanical ventilation.

4. Infection: The patient is at increased risk of developing nosocomial infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia, due to the use of mechanical ventilation and prolonged ICU stay.

5. Barotrauma: There is a risk of barotrauma during mechanical ventilation, especially if high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) are required to maintain oxygenation.

6. Myopathy or neuropathy: The patient may develop myopathy or neuropathy due to immobilization and the use of neuromuscular blocking agents during mechanical ventilation.

7. Delirium: The patient may develop delirium due to the ICU environment, sedation, or the underlying illness, which can lead to increased morbidity and mortality.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for these potential complications and implement appropriate interventions to prevent or manage them effectively."

He has undergone multiple procedures for ureteral function after neobladder creation and recently had a ureteral stent swap in the OR.

The patient continues to have pressor requirements to maintain appropriate mean arterial pressures (MAPs), indicating ongoing hypotension. The tachycardia is improving with continued amiodarone infusion. The patient's fluid balance is difficult to maintain due to likely diastolic dysfunction and rapidly increasing central venous pressure (CVP).

The patient's respiratory status has improved with decreased oxygen requirements. The goal is to wean down pressors while maintaining a systolic blood pressure (SBP) >100. Antibiotic coverage with Zosyn and linezolid is being provided, as the patient was colonized with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and there is concern for systemic spread with instrumentation. The patient is also being treated empirically for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) with IV flagyl and PO vancomycin. Renal ultrasound shows no hydronephrosis or pyelonephritis, and stents are draining appropriately. Urology is following up.

The patient's atrial fibrillation has significantly improved rate control while on amiodarone infusion"

   - abdominal u/s: portal veins patent
   - HIT ab negative
   - goal to keep HR down, continue amiodarone gtt
   - goal to keep CVP 11-13
   - added [**1-17**] more amps of calcium gluconate
   - Fluids even to slightly negative b/c cr was rising and did not want
   to hit kidneys with more lasix and cause further damage.
   - ID: ? ct scan could possibly help. could broaden zosyn to meropenem
   if he decompensates per ID. nothing more to add
   - Gave 80 IV lasix b/c of pulmonary edema...breathing seemed a little
   better after. Put out about 200-400 cc after.
   - Nausea, wrote for prn zofran
   - increasing coughing/throat clearing, sputum cultured

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old man with transitional cell bladder cancer
   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including recent ureteral stent
   swap in the OR; currently in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for afib with rvr and septic shock
   with multi-organ dysfunction.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Continues to have pressor requirements which are
   decreasing to maintain appropriate MAPs, also tachycardia is improving
   with continued amiodarone infusion,
   Multifactorial:
   1.  Cardiogenic in part: RVR leading to inadequate filling times and
   afib causing loss of atrial kick leading to decreased stroke volume
   also  cardiac ischemia concerning for decreased cardiac output due to
   myocardial injury  as echo shows new inferior wall hypokinesis.
   Difficulty maintaining adequate fluid balance, due to likely diastolic
   dysfunction and rapidly increasing CVP
s with small fluid  boluses.
   2. Sepsis: Also  likely infection and sepsis leading to probable low
   PVR and effective intravascular hypovolemia; although CVP of 15 this
   AM. Patient appears intravascularly depleted as he has previously had a
   low CVP.
   - Difficult fluid status as paitent appears intravascularly down yet
   cardiac function is decreased leading to a component of pulmonary
   edema, today his respiratroy status is improved, with decreased oxygen
   requirements.
   - check CVP to eval volume status with a goal of [**11-28**] and diurese or
   bolus as needed.
   - Wean down pressors as patient can tolerate, maintaining a sbp > 100.
   levophed is down to 0.1
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn and linezolid, zosyn for coverage of
   GU organisms, linazolid b/c the patient was colonized with VRE and
   concern for systemic spread with instrumentation, will d/w ID about
   possible d/c of linezolid with negative cultures and decreasing
   platelet counts
   - patient with decreasing leukocytosis, currently on empiric treatment
   for C. diff with IV flagyl and po vancomycin, first stool was negative
   for C. diff, will discuss treatment with ID
   - renal u/s shows no hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, stents are draining
   appropriately; urology following
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
urine cx positive for strep viridans, no
   other cultures positive to date
   - continue to monitor UOP, consider IV lasix for decreased UOP
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone infusion, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s. Once
   infusion stopped, HR significantly rose with amiodarone 200mg po BID.
   2.5 IV metoprolol appeared to have dropped his pressures significantly
   with MAPs in the 50s. After talking with pharmacy when he is
   transitioned to po, he needs to be on 400mg po TID for the first 7
   days.
   - Yesterday rebolused the patient 150mg and restarted infusion with
   improvement in his HR to 80 to 100
   - Keep track of total amount patient has received of 10g load
   - will continue to hold patient
s home metoprolol in the setting of
   sepsis
   - Hold anticoagulation for now in setting of coagulopathy
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: ATN most likely due to hypotension
   - Cr appears to have stabilized, and has hopefully plateaued
   - K has normalized, will continue to monitor and hold kayexelate for
   now
   - sevelmer for high phosphate, which has improved
   - repeat lytes this afternoon
   - continue to monitor urine output
   - Renal following closely
   .
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Gap of 21 this morning. High lactate of 3.9 and
   rising BUN likely metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.
   - Patient received 4.5 amps of bicarb o/n, with improvement in HCO3 to
   17, will continue to monitor-no further bicarb for now, will continue
   to monitor
   - repeat lytes this afternoon
   .
   SOB: crackles at bases but with improved dyspnea. Likely related to
   volume resuscitation.  Also, worsening after drank juice this AM for
   low BS. Concern for aspiration as well.
   - CXR shows continued volume overload
   - Lasix boluses prn to improve breathing
   .
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA/COAGULOPATHY: Rising INR and decreasing platelets.
   Fibrinogen high/normal (acute phase reactant) but higher than expected
   it would be if patient was in DIC
   - HIT antibody negative, but since platelets are below 50,000 will hold
   SQ heparin for PPX
   - trend coags, lfts and DIC panel-negative so far
   TRANSAMINITIS: likely a hit from his hypotension, not likely shock
   liver as enzymes are trending down.
   - monitor lfts
   - ultrasound showed patency of portal vessels

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of transitional cell bladder cancer, who is currently in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction. The patient continues to require pressor support to maintain an appropriate mean arterial pressure (MAP) and has a decreased cardiac output due to myocardial injury. There is difficulty in maintaining adequate fluid balance due to diastolic dysfunction and rapidly increasing central venous pressure (CVP). 

The patient's respiratory status has improved with decreased oxygen requirements. Antibiotic coverage with Zosyn and linezolid is ongoing, with consideration for discontinuing linezolid if negative cultures and decreasing platelet counts are observed. The patient is also being treated empirically for Clostridium difficile with intravenous flagyl and oral vancomycin. 

Renal ultrasound shows no evidence of hydronephrosis or pyelonephritis, and stents are draining appropriately. Blood and urine cultures are pending, with the urine culture positive for Streptococcus viridans. 

Atrial fibrillation has been significantly improved with amiodarone infusion, but once the infusion was stopped, the heart rate rose. Metoprolol has been used to control the heart rate, and the patient is currently on amiodarone 200mg orally twice a day. 

Acute renal failure due to hypotension-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is likely, and"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Hemodynamically improved in that dose of levophed is lower. Still on
   vasopressin. Urine output has increased overnight with lasix.  Heart
   rate better controlled on amiodarone infusion. CVP 9 this morning.
   Oxygenation remains good on minimal supplemental O2.
   Received about 4.5 amps of sodium bicarb yesterday for metabolic
   acidosis.
   Continue to require calcium repletion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include hypotension, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure, acidosis, and anemia. The patient has been receiving various medications, including vasopressin, norepinephrine, furosemide (Lasix), omeprazole (Prilosec), and amiodarone infusion. The patient's hemodynamic status has improved, with a reduced dose of levophed and increased urine output. Oxygenation remains good on minimal supplemental O2. The patient received 4.5 amps of sodium bicarb yesterday for metabolic acidosis and continues to require calcium repletion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs and potentially result in organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to a buildup of waste products and electrolyte imbalances in the body. This can further complicate the patient's condition and increase the risk of other complications.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has an irregular heart rhythm, which can lead to poor cardiac output and an increased risk of blood clots and stroke.
4. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient may have impaired filling of"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old man with transitional cell bladder cancer
   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including recent ureteral stent
   swap in the OR; currently in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for afib with rvr and septic shock
   with multi-organ dysfunction.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Continues to have pressor requirements which are
   decreasing to maintain appropriate MAPs, also tachycardia is improving
   with continued amiodarone infusion,
   Multifactorial:
   1.  Cardiogenic in part: RVR leading to inadequate filling times and
   afib causing loss of atrial kick leading to decreased stroke volume
   also  cardiac ischemia concerning for decreased cardiac output due to
   myocardial injury  as echo shows new inferior wall hypokinesis.
   Difficulty maintaining adequate fluid balance, due to likely diastolic
   dysfunction and rapidly increasing CVP
s with small fluid  boluses.
   2. Sepsis: Also likely infection and sepsis leading to probable low PVR
   and effective intravascular hypovolemia; although CVP of 15 this AM.
   Patient appears intravascularly depleted as he has previously had a low
   CVP.
   - Difficult fluid status as paitent appears slightly intravascularly
   down yet cardiac function is decreased leading to a component of
   pulmonary edema, today his respiratroy status is improved, with
   decreased oxygen requirements.
   - check CVP to eval volume status with a goal of [**11-28**] and diurese or
   bolus as needed.
   - Wean down pressors as patient can tolerate, maintaining a sbp > 100.
   levophed is down to 0.03
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn for coverage of GU organisms, and it
   will cover strep viridans which is growing in his urine
   - patient with decreasing leukocytosis, currently on empiric treatment
   for C. diff with IV flagyl and po vancomycin, first stool was negative
   for C. diff, if second C.diff is negative will d/c flagy and po
   vancomycin
   - renal u/s shows no hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, stents are draining
   appropriately; urology following, appreciate recs
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
urine cx positive for strep viridans, no
   other cultures positive to date
   - continue to monitor UOP, consider IV lasix for decreased UOP
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone infusion, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s. Once
   infusion stopped, HR significantly rose with amiodarone 200mg po BID.
   2.5 IV metoprolol appeared to have dropped his pressures significantly
   with MAPs in the 50s. After talking with pharmacy when he is
   transitioned to po, he needs to be on 400mg po TID for the first 7
   days.
   - Stop IV amiodarone and convert to po amio at 400mg TID
   - Keep track of total amount patient has received of 10g load
   - will continue to hold patient
s home metoprolol in the setting of
   sepsis
   - Hold anticoagulation for now in setting of coagulopathy
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: ATN most likely due to hypotension
   - Cr appears to have stabilized, and has hopefully plateaued
   - K has normalized, will continue to monitor and hold kayexelate for
   now
   - sevelmer for high phosphate, which has improved
   - repeat lytes this afternoon
   - continue to monitor urine output
   - Renal following closely
   .
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Gap of 20 this morning. High lactate of 3.9
   previously and rising BUN likely metabolic acidosis with respiratory
   compensation.
   - Bicarb has been stable at 20, will hold further bicarb administration
   for now but will recheck lactate level this afternoon to make sure that
   it is decreasing
   - repeat lytes this afternoon
   .
   SOB: crackles at bases but with improved dyspnea. Likely related to
   volume resuscitation.
   - CXR shows continued volume overload
   - Lasix boluses prn to improve breathing
   .
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA/COAGULOPATHY: Rising INR and decreasing platelets.
   Fibrinogen high/normal (acute phase reactant) but higher than expected
   it would be if patient was in DIC
   - HIT antibody negative, but since platelets are below 50,000 will hold
   SQ heparin for PPX
   - trend coags, lfts and DIC panel-negative so far
   TRANSAMINITIS: likely a hit from his hypotension, not likely shock
   liver as enzymes are trending down.
   - monitor lfts
   - ultrasound showed patency of portal vessels

","The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of transitional cell bladder cancer, who is currently in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction. He has undergone multiple procedures for ureteral function after neobladder surgery.

The patient's condition is complex and involves several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient continues to require pressor support to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP). The hypotension may be due to cardiogenic causes such as reduced ventricular filling due to diastolic dysfunction and increased central venous pressure (CVP). There is also evidence of sepsis, possibly leading to low peripheral vascular resistance and effective intravascular hypovolemia. The patient's fluid status is challenging, as he appears slightly intravascularly depleted but has decreased cardiac function with pulmonary edema. The goal is to maintain a CVP around 11-13 and adjust fluid administration and diuretics accordingly. Pressor support should be weaned off as tolerated, maintaining a systolic blood pressure above 100 mmHg.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rate is controlled while on amiodarone infusion, but it significantly rises when the infusion is stopped. Once the patient transitions to oral amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg three times a day, he should be monitored"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old man with transitional cell bladder cancer
   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including recent ureteral stent
   swap in the OR; currently in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for afib with rvr and septic shock
   with multi-organ dysfunction.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Continues to have pressor requirements which are
   decreasing to maintain appropriate MAPs, also tachycardia is improving
   with continued amiodarone infusion,
   Multifactorial:
   1.  Cardiogenic in part: RVR leading to inadequate filling times and
   afib causing loss of atrial kick leading to decreased stroke volume
   also  cardiac ischemia concerning for decreased cardiac output due to
   myocardial injury  as echo shows new inferior wall hypokinesis.
   Difficulty maintaining adequate fluid balance, due to likely diastolic
   dysfunction and rapidly increasing CVP
s with small fluid  boluses.
   2. Sepsis: Also likely infection and sepsis leading to probable low PVR
   and effective intravascular hypovolemia; although CVP of 15 this AM.
   Patient appears intravascularly depleted as he has previously had a low
   CVP.
   - Difficult fluid status as paitent appears slightly intravascularly
   down yet cardiac function is decreased leading to a component of
   pulmonary edema, today his respiratroy status is improved, with
   decreased oxygen requirements.
   - check CVP to eval volume status with a goal of [**11-28**] and diurese or
   bolus as needed.
   - Wean down pressors as patient can tolerate, maintaining a sbp > 100.
   levophed is down to 0.03
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn for coverage of GU organisms, and it
   will cover strep viridans which is growing in his urine
   - patient with decreasing leukocytosis, currently on empiric treatment
   for C. diff with IV flagyl and po vancomycin, first stool was negative
   for C. diff, if second C.diff is negative will d/c flagy and po
   vancomycin
   - renal u/s shows no hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, stents are draining
   appropriately; urology following, appreciate recs
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
urine cx positive for strep viridans, no
   other cultures positive to date
   - continue to monitor UOP, consider IV lasix for decreased UOP
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone infusion, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s. Once
   infusion stopped, HR significantly rose with amiodarone 200mg po BID.
   2.5 IV metoprolol appeared to have dropped his pressures significantly
   with MAPs in the 50s. After talking with pharmacy when he is
   transitioned to po, he needs to be on 400mg po TID for the first 7
   days.
   - Stop IV amiodarone and convert to po amio at 400mg TID
   - Keep track of total amount patient has received of 10g load
   - will continue to hold patient
s home metoprolol in the setting of
   sepsis
   - Hold anticoagulation for now in setting of coagulopathy
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: ATN most likely due to hypotension
   - Cr appears to have stabilized, and has hopefully plateaued
   - K has normalized, will continue to monitor and hold kayexelate for
   now
   - sevelmer for high phosphate, which has improved
   - repeat lytes this afternoon
   - continue to monitor urine output
   - Renal following closely
   .
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Gap of 20 this morning. High lactate of 3.9
   previously and rising BUN likely metabolic acidosis with respiratory
   compensation.
   - Bicarb has been stable at 20, will hold further bicarb administration
   for now but will recheck lactate level this afternoon to make sure that
   it is decreasing
   - repeat lytes this afternoon
   .
   SOB: crackles at bases but with improved dyspnea. Likely related to
   volume resuscitation.
   - CXR shows continued volume overload
   - Lasix boluses prn to improve breathing
   .
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA/COAGULOPATHY: Rising INR and decreasing platelets.
   Fibrinogen high/normal (acute phase reactant) but higher than expected
   it would be if patient was in DIC
   - HIT antibody negative, but since platelets are below 50,000 will hold
   SQ heparin for PPX
   - trend coags, lfts and DIC panel-negative so far
   TRANSAMINITIS: likely a hit from his hypotension, not likely shock
   liver as enzymes are trending down.
   - monitor lfts
   - ultrasound showed patency of portal vessels

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient , reviewed his history and hospital
   course and was present for the key portions of the services provided. I
   have also reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10627**]
s note and agree with her findings and
   plan of care. The patient is improved on Rx for septic shock from what
   we believe is strep urinary infection. He feels better, WBC is down and
   pressor requirement is less.  His course has been complicated by renal
   failure,  Afib with RVR and rate related myocardial injury.  He
s still
   fluid overloaded on CxR and is producing dark culture neg but purulent
   sputum. A mild anion gap acidosis, felt due to his renal failure,
   persists unchanged.
   The plan today is to attempt to wean pressors, change Amio to oral,
   stop CDiff RX if neg stool x2, continue Zosyn for his sepsis,, attempt
   to make him 1L neg, follow lactate & lytes, keep close eye on plts now
   that he
s off Linezolid,  and reassess CXR in am.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of transitional cell bladder cancer, who is currently in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction. He has been experiencing hypotension, tachycardia, and difficulty maintaining adequate fluid balance. The patient's cardiac function is decreased, leading to pulmonary edema. He also has an infection and sepsis, likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Streptococcus viridans growing in his urine. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by acute kidney injury (ATN) and elevated creatinine levels. He has an anion gap metabolic acidosis, possibly due to lactic acidosis and respiratory compensation. The patient's platelet count is low, and there are concerns about coagulopathy. His liver function tests are within normal limits, and there are no signs of liver failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Plan:
- Wean down pressors as the patient can tolerate, maintaining a systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 100.
- Continue amiodarone infusion and convert to oral amiodarone at 400 mg three times a day (TID).
- Monitor for and treat any signs of sepsis or infection.
- Administer IV lasix for decreased urine output.
- Continue to monitor renal function"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old man with transitional cell bladder cancer
   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including recent ureteral stent
   swap in the OR; currently in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for afib with rvr and septic shock
   with multi-organ dysfunction.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Continues to have pressor requirements which are
   decreasing to maintain appropriate MAPs, also tachycardia is improving
   with continued amiodarone infusion,
   Multifactorial:
   1.  Cardiogenic in part: RVR leading to inadequate filling times and
   afib causing loss of atrial kick leading to decreased stroke volume
   also  cardiac ischemia concerning for decreased cardiac output due to
   myocardial injury  as echo shows new inferior wall hypokinesis.
   Difficulty maintaining adequate fluid balance, due to likely diastolic
   dysfunction and rapidly increasing CVP
s with small fluid  boluses.
   2. Sepsis: Also  likely infection and sepsis leading to probable low
   PVR and effective intravascular hypovolemia; although CVP of 15 this
   AM. Patient appears intravascularly depleted as he has previously had a
   low CVP.
   - Difficult fluid status as paitent appears intravascularly down yet
   cardiac function is decreased leading to a component of pulmonary
   edema, today his respiratroy status is improved, with decreased oxygen
   requirements.
   - check CVP to eval volume status with a goal of [**11-28**] and diurese or
   bolus as needed.
   - Wean down pressors as patient can tolerate, maintaining a sbp > 100.
   levophed is down to 0.1
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn and linezolid, zosyn for coverage of
   GU organisms, linazolid b/c the patient was colonized with VRE and
   concern for systemic spread with instrumentation, will d/w ID about
   possible d/c of linezolid with negative cultures and decreasing
   platelet counts
   - patient with decreasing leukocytosis, currently on empiric treatment
   for C. diff with IV flagyl and po vancomycin, first stool was negative
   for C. diff, will discuss treatment with ID
   - renal u/s shows no hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, stents are draining
   appropriately; urology following
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
urine cx positive for strep viridans, no
   other cultures positive to date
   - continue to monitor UOP, consider IV lasix for decreased UOP
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone infusion, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s. Once
   infusion stopped, HR significantly rose with amiodarone 200mg po BID.
   2.5 IV metoprolol appeared to have dropped his pressures significantly
   with MAPs in the 50s. After talking with pharmacy when he is
   transitioned to po, he needs to be on 400mg po TID for the first 7
   days.
   - Yesterday rebolused the patient 150mg and restarted infusion with
   improvement in his HR to 80 to 100
   - Keep track of total amount patient has received of 10g load
   - will continue to hold patient
s home metoprolol in the setting of
   sepsis
   - Hold anticoagulation for now in setting of coagulopathy
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: ATN most likely due to hypotension
   - Cr appears to have stabilized, and has hopefully plateaued
   - K has normalized, will continue to monitor and hold kayexelate for
   now
   - sevelmer for high phosphate, which has improved
   - repeat lytes this afternoon
   - continue to monitor urine output
   - Renal following closely
   .
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Gap of 21 this morning. High lactate of 3.9 and
   rising BUN likely metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.
   - Patient received 4.5 amps of bicarb o/n, with improvement in HCO3 to
   17, will continue to monitor-no further bicarb for now, will continue
   to monitor
   - repeat lytes this afternoon
   .
   SOB: crackles at bases but with improved dyspnea. Likely related to
   volume resuscitation.  Also, worsening after drank juice this AM for
   low BS. Concern for aspiration as well.
   - CXR shows continued volume overload
   - Lasix boluses prn to improve breathing
   .
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA/COAGULOPATHY: Rising INR and decreasing platelets.
   Fibrinogen high/normal (acute phase reactant) but higher than expected
   it would be if patient was in DIC
   - HIT antibody negative, but since platelets are below 50,000 will hold
   SQ heparin for PPX
   - trend coags, lfts and DIC panel-negative so far
   TRANSAMINITIS: likely a hit from his hypotension, not likely shock
   liver as enzymes are trending down.
   - monitor lfts
   - ultrasound showed patency of portal vessels

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of transitional cell bladder cancer, who has undergone neobladder surgery and multiple procedures for ureteral function. He is currently in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction. The patient's condition has improved, but he still requires pressor support to maintain appropriate mean arterial pressures (MAPs) and has a decreased stroke volume due to myocardial injury. He also has an infection and sepsis leading to probable low peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) and effective intravascular hypovolemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's decreased cardiac output and loss of atrial kick due to AFib can lead to cardiogenic shock.
2. Sepsis: The patient's infection and sepsis can worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and potential septic shock.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status, although improved, may deteriorate due to fluid overload and aspiration risk.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute tubular necrosis (ATN) may progress, resulting in worsening renal failure.
5. Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: The patient's decreasing platelets and rising INR indicate a risk of bleeding complications.
6. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver"

   concerned about his BP (on 2 pressors), and i explained that the
   morphine is a pain med not to be used for sleep but i was very
   concerned about controlling his pain and maintaining his BPs;  because

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old man with transitional cell bladder cancer
   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including recent ureteral stent
   swap in the OR; currently in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for afib with rvr and septic shock
   with multi-organ dysfunction.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Continues to have pressor requirements which are
   decreasing to maintain appropriate MAPs, also tachycardia is improving
   with continued amiodarone infusion,
   Multifactorial:
   1.  Cardiogenic in part: RVR leading to inadequate filling times and
   afib causing loss of atrial kick leading to decreased stroke volume
   also  cardiac ischemia concerning for decreased cardiac output due to
   myocardial injury  as echo shows new inferior wall hypokinesis.
   Difficulty maintaining adequate fluid balance, due to likely diastolic
   dysfunction and rapidly increasing CVP
s with small fluid  boluses.
   2. Sepsis: Also likely infection and sepsis leading to probable low PVR
   and effective intravascular hypovolemia; although CVP of 15 this AM.
   Patient appears intravascularly depleted as he has previously had a low
   CVP.
   - Difficult fluid status as paitent appears slightly intravascularly
   down yet cardiac function is decreased leading to a component of
   pulmonary edema, today his respiratroy status is improved, with
   decreased oxygen requirements.
   - check CVP to eval volume status with a goal of [**11-28**] and diurese or
   bolus as needed.
   - Wean down pressors as patient can tolerate, maintaining a sbp > 100.
   levophed is down to 0.03
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn (Start date: [**10-22**], Day [**4-25**]) for
   coverage of GU organisms, and it will cover strep viridans which is
   growing in his urine
   - patient with decreasing leukocytosis, currently on empiric treatment
   for C. diff with IV flagyl and po vancomycin, 2 C. diff toxins
   negative: consider d/c
ing po vanc and flagyl today. (Start date: [**10-22**])
   - renal u/s shows no hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, stents are draining
   appropriately; urology following, appreciate recs
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
urine cx positive for strep viridans, no
   other cultures positive to date
   - continue to monitor UOP, consider IV lasix for decreased UOP
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone infusion, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s. Once
   infusion stopped, HR significantly rose with amiodarone 200mg po BID.
   2.5 IV metoprolol appeared to have dropped his pressures significantly
   with MAPs in the 50s. After talking with pharmacy when he is
   transitioned to po, he needs to be on 400mg po TID for the first 7
   days.
   - Continue po amio at 400mg TID for 1 week
   - Keep track of total amount patient has received of 10g load
   - will continue to hold patient
s home metoprolol in the setting of
   sepsis
   - Hold anticoagulation for now in setting of coagulopathy
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: ATN most likely due to hypotension
   - Cr continueing to trend down, continue to monitor
   - K has normalized, will continue to monitor and hold kayexelate for
   now
   - sevelmer for high phosphate, which has improved
   - repeat lytes this afternoon
   - continue to monitor urine output
   - Renal following closely
   .
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Gap of 19 this morning. Lactate continuing to
   improve with normal level of 1.7 this AM, with rising BUN likely
   metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.
   - Bicarb has been stable at 21, will hold further bicarb administration
   for now at this level
   - repeat lytes this afternoon
   - Monitor mental status with rising BUN
   - renal following
   .
   SOB: crackles at bases but with improved dyspnea. Likely related to
   volume resuscitation.
   - CXR shows continued volume overload
   - Lasix boluses prn to improve breathing
   .
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA/COAGULOPATHY: Rising INR and decreasing platelets.
   Fibrinogen high/normal (acute phase reactant) but higher than expected
   it would be if patient was in DIC
   - HIT antibody negative, but since platelets are below 50,000 will hold
   SQ heparin for PPX
   - trend coags, lfts and DIC panel-negative so far
   - Monitor for signs of active bleeding;
   - Urology is aware of hemarturia and feel this is expected s/p
   procedure. The will continue to monitor
   TRANSAMINITIS: likely a hit from his hypotension, not likely shock
   liver as enzymes are trending down.
   - monitor lfts
   - ultrasound showed patency of portal vessels

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of transitional cell bladder cancer, who is currently in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction. He has undergone multiple procedures for ureteral function after neobladder creation and recently had a ureteral stent swap in the operating room. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, anion gap acidosis, and thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy. He is receiving various medications and treatments, including vasopressin, norepinephrine, amiodarone, morphine, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he requires close monitoring and management of his fluid balance, pressor requirements, cardiac function, renal function, and electrolyte levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic component of hypotension is due to reduced stroke volume caused by atrial fibrillation and possible cardiac ischemia. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may progress if there is an ongoing infection and inadequate source control. This can result in further organ dysfunction and potentially death.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to acute"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - transition to po amiodarone --> need to calculate total loading dose
   - goal I/O:  -1L for day --> (he is about -1L by 9:30am and net -2L by
   1500) --> gave 500ccs NS for BP and CVP 10
   - cardiac goal in setting of having had trop leak: avoid hypotension
   and tachycardia which would further strain his heart
   - goal: weaning levophed: stopped on
   - pt was upset half hour later bc was told by doctors previously that
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **] could get morphine to sleep and states it was given to him for the
   past few days... I had long discussion w him about how i was not
   holding off on morphine to cause problems-- i was legitimately
   concerned about his BP (on 2 pressors), and i explained that the
   morphine is a pain med not to be used for sleep but i was very
   concerned about controlling his pain and maintaining his BPs;  because
   he stated that he was ""in pain"" at that time i gave him 1mg morphine IV
   x1
   - switched him from IV morphine to PO oxycodone for pain + standing
   tylenol (only 650mg TID)

   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Continues to have pressor requirements which are
   decreasing to maintain appropriate MAPs, also tachycardia is improving
   with amiodarone.,
   Multifactorial:
   1.  Cardiogenic in part: RVR leading to inadequate filling times and
   afib causing loss of atrial kick leading to decreased stroke volume
   also  cardiac ischemia concerning for decreased cardiac output due to
   myocardial injury  as echo shows new inferior wall hypokinesis.
   Difficulty maintaining adequate fluid balance, due to likely diastolic
   dysfunction and rapidly increasing CVP
s with small fluid  boluses.
   2. Sepsis: Also likely infection and sepsis leading to probable low PVR
   and effective intravascular hypovolemia; although CVP of 15 this AM.
   Patient appears intravascularly depleted as he has previously had a low
   CVP.
   - Difficult fluid status as patient appears slightly intravascularly
   down yet cardiac function is decreased leading to a component of
   pulmonary edema, today his respiratroy status is improved, with
   decreased oxygen requirements.
   - check CVP to eval volume status with a goal of [**11-28**] and diurese or
   bolus as needed.
   - Wean down pressors as patient can tolerate, maintaining a sbp > 100.
   levophed turned off at 0730 this AM and tolerating well.
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn (Start date: [**10-22**], Day [**4-25**]) for
   coverage of GU organisms, and it will cover strep viridans which is
   growing in his urine; will d/w ID duration of course zosyn.
   - patient with decreasing leukocytosis, currently on empiric treatment
   for C. diff with IV flagyl and po vancomycin, 2 C. diff toxins

   - continue to monitor UOP, consider IV lasix for decreased UOP
   - Patient diuresed well in past 24 hours, breathing well, but since
   still dependent on pressors, will make patient even to +500 cc in next
   24 hours.
   - Cortisol level

   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone infusion, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s. Once
   infusion stopped, HR significantly rose with amiodarone 200mg po BID.
   2.5 IV metoprolol appeared to have dropped his pressures significantly
   with MAPs in the 50s. After talking with pharmacy when he is
   transitioned to po, he needs to be on 400mg po TID for the first 7
   days.

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed his hospital course and
   labs and imaging, and was present for the key portions of the services
   provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10611**]
s note and agree with her
   findings and plan of care.  The patient continues to look well and
   today is even off of Levophed. He remains of vasopressin.  He looks a
   bit dry on exam, by CXR, and by CVP. So we will make him I/O positive
   today, in the hope that this may allow weaning off of Vasopressin. Most
   of his other issues are stable, with improvement in renal function,
   WBC, Bili, and [**2-18**] C diff studies neg.  He
s tolerating po Amio with
   good Afib rate control.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of transitional cell bladder cancer, who is currently in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction. He has undergone multiple procedures for ureteral function after neobladder surgery. The patient is on pressors to maintain appropriate mean arterial pressures (MAPs) and has shown improvement in tachycardia with amiodarone infusion. His respiratory status has also improved, with decreased oxygen requirements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient continues to require pressors to maintain MAPs, indicating ongoing hypotension. There is a concern for cardiogenic factors due to right ventricular dysfunction and myocardial injury, as well as sepsis leading to probable low peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) and effective intravascular hypovolemia. Monitoring CVP and adjusting fluid status accordingly will be important.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rate control has significantly improved while on amiodarone infusion, but there is a risk of increased heart rate once the infusion is stopped. Metoprolol has been held in the setting of sepsis, but it may be considered once the patient is stable.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) most likely due to hypotension. Close monitoring"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - transition to po amiodarone --> need to calculate total loading dose
   - goal I/O:  -1L for day --> (he is about -1L by 9:30am and net -2L by
   1500) --> gave 500ccs NS for BP and CVP 10
   - consider A-line?
   - cardiac goal in setting of having had trop leak: avoid hypotension
   and tachycardia which would further strain his heart
   - goal: weaning levophed
   - wanted morphine to sleep; was going to give trazodone but was
   sleeping so didn't give anything;
   - pt was upset half hour later bc was told by doctors previously that
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **] could get morphine to sleep and states it was given to him for the
   past few days... I had long discussion w him about how i was not
   holding off on morphine to cause problems-- i was legitimately
   concerned about his BP (on 2 pressors), and i explained that the
   morphine is a pain med not to be used for sleep but i was very
   concerned about controlling his pain and maintaining his BPs;  because
   he stated that he was ""in pain"" at that time i gave him 1mg morphine IV
   x1
   - switched him from IV morphine to PO oxycodone for pain + standing
   tylenol (only 650mg TID)
   - got 2gm calcium gluconate replacement this AM

The patient's fluid balance is difficult to manage due to likely diastolic dysfunction and rapidly increasing central venous pressure (CVP). Close monitoring of CVP and appropriate fluid management are essential.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has pulmonary edema as shown on chest X-ray, which may be related to the cardiogenic component of his hypotension. Weaning down pressors and maintaining a systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 100 mmHg is recommended.

3. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing infection and sepsis require continued antibiotic coverage with Zosyn. Blood and urine cultures should be followed up to identify any potential changes in the causative organism.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old man with transitional cell bladder cancer
   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including recent ureteral stent
   swap in the OR; currently in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for afib with rvr and septic shock
   with multi-organ dysfunction.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Patient currently off all pressors and able to
   maintain appropriate MAPs, also tachycardia is improving with
   amiodarone, patient transitioned to po amiodarone with good rate
   control
   Multifactorial:
   1.  Cardiogenic in part: RVR leading to inadequate filling times and
   afib causing loss of atrial kick leading to decreased stroke volume
   also  cardiac ischemia concerning for decreased cardiac output due to
   myocardial injury  as echo shows new inferior wall hypokinesis.
   Difficulty maintaining adequate fluid balance, due to likely diastolic
   dysfunction and rapidly increasing CVP
s with small fluid  boluses.
   2. Sepsis: Also likely infection and sepsis leading to probable low PVR
   and effective intravascular hypovolemia; although CVP of 15 this AM.
   Patient appears intravascularly depleted as he has previously had a low
   CVP.
   - Difficult fluid status as patient appears slightly intravascularly
   down yet cardiac function is decreased leading to a component of
   pulmonary edema, today his respiratroy status is improved, with
   decreased oxygen requirements.
   - check CVP to eval volume status with a goal of [**11-28**] and diurese or
   bolus as needed.
   - Wean down pressors as patient can tolerate, maintaining a sbp > 100.
   levophed turned off at 0730 this AM and tolerating well.
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn (Start date: [**10-22**], Day [**6-22**]), will
   discontinue zosyn tomorrow as per ID
   - patient with decreasing leukocytosis, currently on empiric treatment
   for C. diff with IV flagyl and po vancomycin, 2 C. diff toxins
   negative: will d/c IV flagyl but continue po vanc for 2 days post
   discontinuation of zosyn given significant history of C.diff
   - renal u/s shows no hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, stents are draining
   appropriately; urology following, appreciate recs
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
urine cx positive for strep viridans, no
   other cultures positive to date
   - continue to monitor UOP, patient putting out large amounts of urine,
   will monitor output and patient may need IV fluids to make up
   difference in output
   - Cortisol level high
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone infusion, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s. Once
   infusion stopped, HR significantly rose with amiodarone 200mg po BID.
   2.5 IV metoprolol appeared to have dropped his pressures significantly
   with MAPs in the 50s. After talking with pharmacy when he is
   transitioned to po, he needs to be on 400mg po TID for the first 7
   days.
   - Continue po amio at 400mg TID for 1 week
   - Keep track of total amount patient has received of 10g load
   - will continue to hold patient
s home metoprolol in the setting of
   sepsis
   - Hold anticoagulation for now in setting of coagulopathy
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: ATN most likely due to hypotension-patient
   currently [**Last Name (LF) 7633**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] monitor I/O with a goal of keeping the
   patient even, to help maintain his BP and keep his off pressors
   - Cr continuing to trend down, continue to monitor
   - K has normalized, will continue to monitor and hold kayexelate for
   now
   - discontinue sevelmer given improvement in phosphorous
   - repeat lytes this afternoon
   - continue to monitor urine output
   - Renal following closely
   .
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Gap of 15 this morning. Lactate continuing to
   improve with normal level of 1.7 yesterday, with rising BUN likely
   metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.
   - Bicarb has been stable at 21, will hold further bicarb administration
   for now at this level
   - Monitor mental status with rising BUN; likely a component of
   dehydration.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   SOB: crackles at bases but with improved dyspnea. Likely related to
   volume resuscitation.  Oxygenation improved today, not currently on
   supplemental oxygen
   - CXR shows continued volume overload
   - patient currently self diuresing, so will hold lasix for now
   .
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA/COAGULOPATHY: Platelets have stabilized and INR is
   improving
   - HIT antibody negative, but since platelets are below 50,000 will hold
   SQ heparin for PPX
   - DIC panel-negative so far
   - Monitor for signs of active bleeding; currently stable
   - Urology is aware of hemarturia and feel this is expected s/p
   procedure. The will continue to monitor
   TRANSAMINITIS: likely a hit from his hypotension, not shock liver as
   enzymes are trending down.
   - monitor lfts
   - ultrasound showed patency of portal vessels

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient is experiencing hypotension and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction. There is a concern about cardiogenic causes such as right ventricular dysfunction leading to inadequate filling times and atrial fibrillation causing loss of atrial kick. There is also a possibility of infection and sepsis leading to low peripheral vascular resistance and effective intravascular hypovolemia.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has significantly improved rate control while on amiodarone infusion. Once the infusion was stopped, the heart rate significantly rose with amiodarone 200mg po BID. The patient needs to be on 400mg po TID for the first 7 days and continue po amio at 400mg TID for 1 week.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is suspected to have acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension. The serum creatinine levels are trending down, indicating improvement. Close monitoring of fluid balance and urine output is necessary.

4. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient has an anion gap of 15 this morning. Lactate levels are improving, but there is a rising BUN likely causing metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Bicarb administration will be held for now.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old man with transitional cell bladder cancer
   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including recent ureteral stent
   swap in the OR; currently in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for afib with rvr and septic shock
   with multi-organ dysfunction.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Patient currently off all pressors and able to
   maintain appropriate MAPs, also tachycardia is improving with
   amiodarone, patient transitioned to po amiodarone with good rate
   control
   Multifactorial:
   1.  Cardiogenic in part: RVR leading to inadequate filling times and
   afib causing loss of atrial kick leading to decreased stroke volume
   also  cardiac ischemia concerning for decreased cardiac output due to
   myocardial injury  as echo shows new inferior wall hypokinesis.
   Difficulty maintaining adequate fluid balance, due to likely diastolic
   dysfunction and rapidly increasing CVP
s with small fluid  boluses.
   2. Sepsis: Also likely infection and sepsis leading to probable low PVR
   and effective intravascular hypovolemia; although CVP of 15 this AM.
   Patient appears intravascularly depleted as he has previously had a low
   CVP.
   - Difficult fluid status as patient appears slightly intravascularly
   down yet cardiac function is decreased leading to a component of
   pulmonary edema, today his respiratroy status is improved, with
   decreased oxygen requirements.
   - check CVP to eval volume status with a goal of [**11-28**] and diurese or
   bolus as needed.
   - Wean down pressors as patient can tolerate, maintaining a sbp > 100.
   levophed turned off at 0730 this AM and tolerating well.
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn (Start date: [**10-22**], Day [**6-22**]), will
   discontinue zosyn tomorrow as per ID
   - patient with decreasing leukocytosis, currently on empiric treatment
   for C. diff with IV flagyl and po vancomycin, 2 C. diff toxins
   negative: will d/c IV flagyl but continue po vanc for 2 days post
   discontinuation of zosyn given significant history of C.diff
   - renal u/s shows no hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, stents are draining
   appropriately; urology following, appreciate recs
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
urine cx positive for strep viridans, no
   other cultures positive to date
   - continue to monitor UOP, patient putting out large amounts of urine,
   will monitor output and patient may need IV fluids to make up
   difference in output
   - Cortisol level high
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone infusion, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s. Once
   infusion stopped, HR significantly rose with amiodarone 200mg po BID.
   2.5 IV metoprolol appeared to have dropped his pressures significantly
   with MAPs in the 50s. After talking with pharmacy when he is
   transitioned to po, he needs to be on 400mg po TID for the first 7
   days.
   - Continue po amio at 400mg TID for 1 week
   - Keep track of total amount patient has received of 10g load
   - will continue to hold patient
s home metoprolol in the setting of
   sepsis
   - Hold anticoagulation for now in setting of coagulopathy
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: ATN most likely due to hypotension-patient
   currently [**Last Name (LF) 7633**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] monitor I/O with a goal of keeping the
   patient even, to help maintain his BP and keep his off pressors
   - Cr continuing to trend down, continue to monitor
   - K has normalized, will continue to monitor and hold kayexelate for
   now
   - discontinue sevelmer given improvement in phosphorous
   - repeat lytes this afternoon
   - continue to monitor urine output
   - Renal following closely
   .
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Gap of 15 this morning. Lactate continuing to
   improve with normal level of 1.7 yesterday, with rising BUN likely
   metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.
   - Bicarb has been stable at 21, will hold further bicarb administration
   for now at this level
   - Monitor mental status with rising BUN; likely a component of
   dehydration.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   SOB: crackles at bases but with improved dyspnea. Likely related to
   volume resuscitation.  Oxygenation improved today, not currently on
   supplemental oxygen
   - CXR shows continued volume overload
   - patient currently self diuresing, so will hold lasix for now
   .
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA/COAGULOPATHY: Platelets have stabilized and INR is
   improving
   - HIT antibody negative, but since platelets are below 50,000 will hold
   SQ heparin for PPX
   - DIC panel-negative so far
   - Monitor for signs of active bleeding; currently stable
   - Urology is aware of hemarturia and feel this is expected s/p
   procedure. The will continue to monitor
   TRANSAMINITIS: likely a hit from his hypotension, not shock liver as
   enzymes are trending down.
   - monitor lfts
   - ultrasound showed patency of portal vessels

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed his hospital course and
   labs, and was present for the key portions of the services provided. I
   have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10627**]
s note and agree with her findings and plan of
   care. Regarding his strep viridans urosepsis, Mr [**Known lastname 5654**] has done well
   and is now off all pressors with good BP and nl WBC.  As per ID, he
   need to stay on C diff prophylaxis with po Vanco until a couple days
   after stopping Zosyn, but we
ll stop Flagyl today.   He feels good, is
   eager to be up in a chair, is taking po
s, and seems clinically
   euvolemic and hemodynamically stable on his amiodarone. He is still in
   a post ATN diuresis phase and we
ll aim to match his urine outputs for
   now and replete lytes.  He is finally well enough to be called out to
   the floor.

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with transitional cell bladder cancer, who underwent neobladder surgery and has had multiple procedures for ureteral function. He is currently in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction.

Assessment and plan:
1. HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: The patient is able to maintain appropriate mean arterial pressures (MAPs) without the use of vasopressors. Tachycardia is improving with amiodarone, and the patient has been transitioned to oral amiodarone with good rate control.
2. CARDIOGENIC SHOCK: There is evidence of cardiogenic shock due to right ventricular failure (RVR) leading to inadequate filling times and atrial fibrillation causing loss of atrial kick, resulting in decreased stroke volume. A new inferior wall hypokinesis is observed on echo, indicating myocardial injury.
3. SEPSIS: The patient likely has an infection and sepsis leading to probable low peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) and effective intravascular hypovolemia. His central venous pressure (CVP) has been fluctuating, indicating difficulty in maintaining fluid balance.
4. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: The patient's heart rate is well-controlled while on amiodarone infusion. However, once the infusion is stopped, the heart rate significantly rises. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old man with transitional cell bladder cancer
   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including recent ureteral stent
   swap in the OR; currently in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for afib with rvr and septic shock
   with multi-organ dysfunction.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Continues to have pressor requirements which are
   decreasing to maintain appropriate MAPs, also tachycardia is improving
   with amiodarone.,
   Multifactorial:
   1.  Cardiogenic in part: RVR leading to inadequate filling times and
   afib causing loss of atrial kick leading to decreased stroke volume
   also  cardiac ischemia concerning for decreased cardiac output due to
   myocardial injury  as echo shows new inferior wall hypokinesis.
   Difficulty maintaining adequate fluid balance, due to likely diastolic
   dysfunction and rapidly increasing CVP
s with small fluid  boluses.
   2. Sepsis: Also likely infection and sepsis leading to probable low PVR
   and effective intravascular hypovolemia; although CVP of 15 this AM.
   Patient appears intravascularly depleted as he has previously had a low
   CVP.
   - Difficult fluid status as patient appears slightly intravascularly
   down yet cardiac function is decreased leading to a component of
   pulmonary edema, today his respiratroy status is improved, with
   decreased oxygen requirements.
   - check CVP to eval volume status with a goal of [**11-28**] and diurese or
   bolus as needed.
   - Wean down pressors as patient can tolerate, maintaining a sbp > 100.
   levophed turned off at 0730 this AM and tolerating well.
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn (Start date: [**10-22**], Day [**4-25**]) for
   coverage of GU organisms, and it will cover strep viridans which is
   growing in his urine; will d/w ID duration of course zosyn.
   - patient with decreasing leukocytosis, currently on empiric treatment
   for C. diff with IV flagyl and po vancomycin, 2 C. diff toxins
   negative: consider d/c
ing po vanc and flagyl today after third set
   negative. (Start date: [**10-22**])
   - renal u/s shows no hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, stents are draining
   appropriately; urology following, appreciate recs
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
urine cx positive for strep viridans, no
   other cultures positive to date
   - continue to monitor UOP, consider IV lasix for decreased UOP
   - Patient diuresed well in past 24 hours, breathing well, but since
   still dependent on pressors, will make patient even to +500 cc in next
   24 hours.
   - Cortisol level
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone infusion, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s. Once
   infusion stopped, HR significantly rose with amiodarone 200mg po BID.
   2.5 IV metoprolol appeared to have dropped his pressures significantly
   with MAPs in the 50s. After talking with pharmacy when he is
   transitioned to po, he needs to be on 400mg po TID for the first 7
   days.
   - Continue po amio at 400mg TID for 1 week
   - Keep track of total amount patient has received of 10g load
   - will continue to hold patient
s home metoprolol in the setting of
   sepsis
   - Hold anticoagulation for now in setting of coagulopathy
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: ATN most likely due to hypotension
   - Cr continueing to trend down, continue to monitor
   - K has normalized, will continue to monitor and hold kayexelate for
   now
   - sevelmer for high phosphate, which has improved
   - repeat lytes this afternoon
   - continue to monitor urine output
   - Renal following closely
   .
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Gap of 19 this morning. Lactate continuing to
   improve with normal level of 1.7 this AM, with rising BUN likely
   metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.
   - Bicarb has been stable at 21, will hold further bicarb administration
   for now at this level
   - repeat lytes this afternoon
   - Monitor mental status with rising BUN; likely a component of
   dehydration.
   - renal following
   .
   SOB: crackles at bases but with improved dyspnea. Likely related to
   volume resuscitation.
   - CXR shows continued volume overload
   - Lasix boluses prn to improve breathing
   .
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA/COAGULOPATHY: Rising INR and decreasing platelets.
   Fibrinogen high/normal (acute phase reactant) but higher than expected
   it would be if patient was in DIC
   - HIT antibody negative, but since platelets are below 50,000 will hold
   SQ heparin for PPX
   - trend coags, lfts and DIC panel-negative so far
   - Monitor for signs of active bleeding;
   - Urology is aware of hemarturia and feel this is expected s/p
   procedure. The will continue to monitor
   TRANSAMINITIS: likely a hit from his hypotension, not likely shock
   liver as enzymes are trending down.
   - monitor lfts
   - ultrasound showed patency of portal vessels

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of transitional cell bladder cancer, who has undergone neobladder surgery and multiple procedures for ureteral function. He is currently in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/VR) and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction.

The patient continues to require pressor support to maintain adequate mean arterial pressures (MAPs). His cardiac function is decreased, leading to pulmonary edema, but his respiratory status has improved with decreased oxygen requirements.

The patient's fluid balance is difficult to manage, as he appears intravascularly depleted but has a high central venous pressure (CVP). The goal is to maintain a CVP between 11-28 and diurese or bolus as needed. Pressors should be weaned down if the patient can tolerate it, maintaining a systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 100. Levophed has been turned off and the patient is tolerating well.

Antibiotic coverage with Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) will be continued for coverage of GU organisms, including Streptococcus viridans, which is growing in his urine. Empiric treatment for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) with IV metronidazole and oral vancomycin will be discontinued since the patient's toxins are negative.

Renal ultrasound shows no hydronephrosis or pyelonephritis, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old man with transitional cell bladder cancer
   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including recent ureteral stent
   swap in the OR; currently in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for afib with rvr that is now rate
   controlled on amio. and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction that
   is improving.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Patient currently off all pressors and able to
   maintain appropriate MAPs, also tachycardia is improving with
   amiodarone, patient transitioned to po amiodarone with good rate
   control
   Multifactorial:
   - Keep patient net even to slightly positive today as patient in
   post-diuresis state and putting out considerable urine. Bolus as needed
   and encourage po intake.
   - check CVP to eval volume status with a goal of [**11-28**].
   - Off all pressors, maintaining a sbp > 100, tolerating well.
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn (Start date: [**10-22**], Day [**7-22**]), will
   discontinue zosyn today as per ID
   - patient with decreasing leukocytosis, currently on empiric treatment
   for C. diff with IV flagyl and po vancomycin, 3 C. diff toxins
   negative: will d/c IV flagyl but continue po vanc for 2 days (stop
   [**10-30**]) post discontinuation of zosyn given significant history of
   C.diff
   - renal u/s shows no hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, stents are draining
   appropriately; urology following, appreciate recs
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
urine cx positive for strep viridans, no
   other cultures positive to date
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone infusion, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s. Once
   infusion stopped, HR significantly rose with amiodarone 200mg po BID.
   2.5 IV metoprolol appeared to have dropped his pressures significantly
   with MAPs in the 50s. After talking with pharmacy when he is
   transitioned to po, he needs to be on 400mg po TID for the first 7
   days.
   - Continue po amio at 400mg TID for 1 week; will discuss with Rx how
   the rest of load should be administered since patient has had infusion
   longer than normal load. (typically 400 tid x 1 week, 400 [**Hospital1 **] x 2 wks,
   400 daily 2 weeks, and 200 daily maintenance)
   - Keep track of total amount patient has received of 10g load
 As of
   [**10-27**] he has received a total of 6110 mg)
   - will continue to hold patient
s home metoprolol in the setting of
   sepsis
   - Hold anticoagulation for now in setting of coagulopathy
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: ATN most likely due to hypotension-patient
   currently [**Last Name (LF) 7633**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] monitor I/O with a goal of keeping the
   patient even, to help maintain his BP and keep his off pressors
   - Cr continuing to trend down, continue to monitor
   - K has normalized, will continue to monitor and hold kayexelate for
   now
   - discontinue sevelmer given improvement in phosphorous
   - check and replete lytes as needed this afternoon
   - continue to monitor urine output
   - Renal following closely
   .
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Gap of 16 this morning. Lactate has normalized,
   with BUN slowly decreasing 117 -> 112; likely metabolic acidosis with
   respiratory compensation improving
   - Bicarb has been stable at 20, will hold further bicarb administration
   for now at this level
   - Monitor mental status with high BUN; likely a component of
   dehydration.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   SOB: crackles at bases but with improved dyspnea. Likely related to
   volume resuscitation.  Oxygenation improved today, not currently on
   supplemental oxygen
   - CXR and PE shows continued volume overload
   - patient currently self diuresing, so will hold lasix for now
   .
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA/COAGULOPATHY: Platelets are improving and INR is
   stable
   - HIT antibody negative, but since platelets are below 50,000 will hold
   SQ heparin for PPX
   - DIC panel-negative so far
   - Monitor for signs of active bleeding; currently stable
   - Urology is aware of hemarturia and feel this is expected s/p
   procedure. Will continue to monitor
   TRANSAMINITIS: Improving; likely a hit from his hypotension, not shock
   liver as enzymes were not very high and are trending down.
   - monitor lfts
   - ultrasound showed patency of portal vessels

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old man with transitional cell bladder cancer
   diagnosed in [**2126-10-16**], s/p neobladder and multiple procedures for
   ureteral function after the neobladder, including recent ureteral stent
   swap in the OR; currently in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for afib with rvr that is now rate
   controlled on amio. and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction that
   is improving.
   .
   HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS: Patient currently off all pressors and able to
   maintain appropriate MAPs, requiring fluid boluses prn as patient is
   orhostatic; also tachycardia is improving with amiodarone, patient
   transitioned to po amiodarone with good rate control. Patient with one
   episode of low temp; 96 rectal temp.
   - Keep patient net even to slightly positive today as patient in post
   atn diuresis state and putting out considerable urine. Bolus as needed
   and encourage po intake.
   - re-check temperature as this may be an anomalous finding. Patient
   appears non-toxic; appears low probability patient is mounting another
   infection. If maintains low temp; consider pan-culture.
   - Off all pressors, maintaining a sbp > 100, tolerating well. Bolus
   with LR as needed as patient is acidemic.
   - antibiotic coverage with zosyn (Start date: [**10-22**], Day [**7-22**]), will
   discontinue zosyn today as per ID
   - patient with decreasing leukocytosis, currently on empiric treatment
   for C. diff with IV flagyl and po vancomycin, 3 C. diff toxins
   negative: will d/c IV flagyl but continue po vanc for 2 days (stop
   [**10-30**]) post discontinuation of zosyn given significant history of
   C.diff
   - renal u/s shows no hydronephrosis/pyelonephritis, stents are draining
   appropriately; urology following, appreciate recs
   - f/u blood/urine cultures
urine cx positive for strep viridans, no
   other cultures positive to date
   .
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: significantly improved rate control while on
   amiodarone infusion, with his HR ranging in the 70
s to 90
s. Once
   infusion stopped, HR significantly rose with amiodarone 200mg po BID.
   2.5 IV metoprolol appeared to have dropped his pressures significantly
   with MAPs in the 50s. After talking with pharmacy when he is
   transitioned to po, he needs to be on 400mg po TID for the first 7
   days.
   - Consider stopping amioadarone and re-starting low dose metoprolol as
   this was his home medication
   - Hold anticoagulation for now in setting of coagulopathy
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: ATN most likely due to hypotension-patient
   currently [**Last Name (LF) 7633**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] monitor I/O with a goal of keeping the
   patient even, to help maintain his BP and keep his off pressors
   - Cr continuing to trend down, continue to monitor
   - K has normalized, will continue to monitor and hold kayexelate for
   now
   - discontinue sevelmer given improvement in phosphorous
   - check and replete lytes as needed this afternoon
   - continue to monitor urine output
   - Renal following closely
   .
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Gap of 16 this morning. Lactate has normalized,
   with BUN slowly decreasing 117 -> 112; likely metabolic acidosis with
   respiratory compensation improving
   - Bicarb has been stable at 20, will hold further bicarb administration
   for now at this level
   - Monitor mental status with high BUN; likely a component of
   dehydration.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   SOB: crackles at bases but with improved dyspnea. Likely related to
   volume resuscitation.  Oxygenation improved today, not currently on
   supplemental oxygen
   - CXR and PE shows continued volume overload
   - patient currently self diuresing, so will hold lasix for now
   .
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA/COAGULOPATHY: Platelets are improving and INR is
   stable
   - HIT antibody negative, but since platelets are below 50,000 will hold
   SQ heparin for PPX
   - DIC panel-negative so far
   - Monitor for signs of active bleeding; currently stable
   - Urology is aware of hemarturia and feel this is expected s/p
   procedure. Will continue to monitor
   TRANSAMINITIS: Improving; likely a hit from his hypotension, not shock
   liver as enzymes were not very high and are trending down.
   - monitor lfts
   - ultrasound showed patency of portal vessels

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with transitional cell bladder cancer, diagnosed on [**2126-10-16**], who has undergone neobladder surgery and multiple procedures for ureteral function. He is currently in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), which is now rate-controlled on amiodarone, and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) that is improving.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/68 mmHg to 112/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is currently 81.3 kg, and his height is 69 inches.

The patient has been receiving amiodarone dosing, and as of [**10-27**] at 1200 hours, he has received a total of 6110 mg (3510 mg IV and 2600 mg PO). He is still off all pressors, and his goal is to maintain even fluid balance, with some intravenous fluids given due to large volume urine output.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of TCC of bladder post cystectomy and neobladder formation, atrial fibrillation, and prior septic episodes. He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock from a Streptococcus viridans urinary tract infection, resulting in acute renal failure and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's condition has improved, as he is now off pressors and maintaining mean arterial pressures above 60. His antibiotic course with Zosyn will be completed today. The patient is still hypothermic, but otherwise appears non-toxic with stable mentation, hemodynamics, and no leukocytosis. The plan is to recheck temperature and send surveillance cultures and differentials.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Despite the improvement, the patient's hypothermia may indicate an underlying infection. Surveillance cultures should be sent to rule out any new or persistent infections.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are still elevated, indicating ongoing renal dysfunction. Aggressive repletion of electrolytes and careful renal dosing of medications are necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Holding Coumadin is appropriate in this case, and careful monitoring of coagulation parameters is needed.
4. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient is being"

   diff prophylaxis with po Vanco until a couple days after stopping Zosyn
   which he will compelte today.  His temp was low today which may be
   harbinger of infection, though he otherwise continue to look very

   stop amio and resume BB.
   He is still in a post-ATN diuresis phase and we
ll aim to match his

   Renally dosing meds and avoiding nephrotoxins.  His AGMA is slowly

   He is finally well enough to be called out to the floor.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
","The patient in the ICU is showing improvement from septic shock caused by a Streptococcus viridans urinary tract infection (UTI) and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 124/72 to 81/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is still experiencing agitation but has shown improvement.

The patient has been off pressors and is hemodynamically stable. The flagyl medication has been discontinued, and the patient is currently receiving antibiotics such as metronidazole, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is also receiving morphine sulfate for pain management.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted improvement in agitation. The flow sheet data shows a gradual improvement in vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds with crackles at the bases, soft non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 27.4 to 13.4 thousand/mm³, slightly elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, throm"
