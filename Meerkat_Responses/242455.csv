   # Respiratory Distress
 dCHF vs. PNA vs. COPD.  Story does not seem
   likely for COPD. Pt is now s/p intubation. Likely a component of
   CHF/fluid overload. For this, the patient has received Lasix boluses.
   Also, possibly a component of PNA, as pt was noted to have purulent
   sputum from ET tube.
   - continue bolus lasix to attempt to get fluid off of pt
 goal for
   today of negative 500 to 1000 cc
   - trend ABG's
   - vanc/cefepime for empiric therapy for PNA
   - resuming bronchodilators
   - continue to cycle cardiac enzymes
   - repeat echo in AM
   - sputum cx sent, will f/u
   - attempt to wean down pressors
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt with a history of CAD, no other details seen in OMR.
   - attempt to obtain outside records
   - conitnue ROMI

   # PUMP: Reported history of CHF, although most recent echo in OMR does
   not show notable systolic or diastolic dysfunction.
   - repeat echo in AM
   - continue to bolus lasix for fluid removal

   # RHYTHM: Pt is in a demand-paced rhythm.
   - continue telemetry
   - continue coumadin for atrial fibrillation
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation - Pt with a history of atrial fibrillation. He is
   on coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - continue coumadin with goal INR [**2-6**]
   - FFP on standby in case pt needs a CVL
   .
   # Hypertension - Pt with a history of hypertension but is not on any
   antihypertensives.
   - attempt to obtain outside records
   - monitor BP, currently borderline hypotensive
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - continue levothyroxine

","The patient is a 93-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and atrial fibrillation. He presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's respiratory status did not improve with adjustments to his BiPAP, resulting in intubation and mechanical ventilation. 

Upon examination, the patient is sedated and intubated, with harsh breath sounds anteriorly and decreased breath sounds at the right base. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/58 mmHg to 120/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient has received Lasix boluses to attempt fluid removal due to suspected fluid overload, possibly secondary to CHF. There is also a possibility of pneumonia, as purulent sputum was noted from the endotracheal tube. Empiric therapy with vancomycin and cefepime has been initiated for potential pneumonia. 

The patient's cardiac enzymes are being monitored, and an echocardiogram will be repeated in the morning. Sputum cultures have been sent, and there is an attempt to wean down the pressors. 

Other medical issues include a history of coronary artery disease, pump dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyp"

   # Respiratory Distress - The etiology for the patient's respiratory
   distress seems likely to be related to CHF.  However, echo in [**2168**] did
   not reveal notable systolic or diastolic dysfunction.  Other
   considerations to consider would be PNA, COPD.  At the NH, he was given
   lasix as well as SL morphine.  The patient was placed on BiPAP to help
   with his breathing, as he was reportedly DNR/DNI at his nursing home.
   Here, he has been treated with lasix, morphine, and nitro gtt.
   However, on further discussion with the patient's HCP, it was stated
   that the patient would want to be full code.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and possible acute on chronic renal insufficiency. The patient presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU. Initial management included the use of BiPAP for respiratory support, but the patient's respiratory status did not improve, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has a history of living in a location with high pseudomonas prevalence and bronchiectasis, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Empiric therapy with vancomycin and cefepime has been started.
2. Cardiac events: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), CHF, and atrial fibrillation. Cardiac enzymes are being monitored, and an echo will be repeated in the morning to assess for systolic or diastolic dysfunction.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine levels are elevated, and there is ongoing monitoring of renal function. Fluid balance is being closely monitored to prevent further renal impairment.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed,"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 323**] y/o M with history of CHF, ?COPD who was sent to the ED from [**Hospital 12**]
   Rehab for respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress - The etiology for the patient's respiratory
   distress seems likely to be related to CHF.  However, echo in [**2168**] did
   not reveal notable systolic or diastolic dysfunction.  Other
   considerations to consider would be PNA, COPD.  At the NH, he was given
   lasix as well as SL morphine.  The patient was placed on BiPAP to help
   with his breathing, as he was reportedly DNR/DNI at his nursing home.
   Here, he has been treated with lasix, morphine, and nitro gtt.
   However, on further discussion with the patient's HCP, it was stated
   that the patient would want to be full code.
   - continue bolus lasix to attempt to get fluid off of pt
   - arterial line placed, will follow ABG's
   - consider intubation is respiratory status continues to decline
   - vanc/cefepime for empiric therapy for PNA
   - consider adding double coverage to pseudomonas, as pt lives in [**Location 621**] and
   has h/o bronchiectasis (note: allergy to levofloxacin)
   - holding off of tx for COPD at this time (steroids, nebs), as story
   does not fit with COPD
   - continue to cycle cardiac enzymes
   - repeat echo in AM
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt with a history of CAD, no other details seen in OMR.
   - attempt to obtain outside records
   - conitnue ROMI
   .
   # PUMP: Reported history of CHF, although most recent echo in OMR does
   not show notable systolic or diastolic dysfunction.
   - repeat echo in AM
   - continue to bolus lasix to get fluid off
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt is in a demand-paced rhythm with underlying a.fib.
   - continue telemetry
   - continue coumadin for atrial fibrillation
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation - Pt with a history of atrial fibrillation. He is
   on coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - continue coumadin with goal INR [**2-6**]
   - FFP on standby in case pt needs a CVL
   .
   # Hypertension - Pt with a history of hypertension but is not on any
   antihypertensives.
   - attempt to obtain outside records
   - monitor BP
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   # ?COPD - Pt with reported history of COPD.
   - attempt to obtain outside records
   - currently not treating with steroids/nebs, but can consider adding
   these if respiratory status declines
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency - Baseline Cr is 1.3 - 1.6.
   Current Cr is 1.9.  Likely, this is pre-renal in the setting of CHF
   (?poor forward flow).
   - continue to trend creatinine

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 93-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other medical conditions. The patient presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2Â°C (98.9Â°F), heart rate of 89 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 105/58 mmHg to 120/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to his declining respiratory status.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.25, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 554, and a base excess (BE) of -9. The patient's serum potassium level is elevated at 4.0 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals somnolence, responds to verbal stimuli at times, and has a JVP of 10-15 cm. There are no chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis, but there are decreased air movements and scattered slight crackles throughout on the back. The patient also has an obese abdomen with no masses"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and subsequent development of septic shock. Upon admission, the patient had an elevated temperature, tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia. Initial echocardiogram revealed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, small left ventricle, hyperdynamic function, moderately dilated right ventricle, mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, abnormal septal motion/position, mild mitral regurgitation, and severe tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension was also noted.

Throughout the hospital course, the patient has been on multiple vasoactive agents including dopamine and norepinephrine to maintain hemodynamic stability. An arterial line was placed for continuous blood pressure monitoring and blood sampling. The patient's urine output has been poor, resulting in oliguria. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, the patient remains hypotensive and requires ongoing vasopressor support.

The patient's respiratory status has been complicated by severe tricuspid regurgitation, leading to elevated right-sided pressures and subsequent pulmonary hypertension. The patient has required high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to maintain adequate oxygenation. His ABG results show a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis.

Multiple blood cultures have been drawn due"

 dCHF vs. PNA vs. COPD.  Story does not seem
   likely for COPD. Pt is now s/p intubation. Likely a component of
   CHF/fluid overload. For this, the patient has received Lasix boluses.
   Also, possibly a component of PNA, as pt was noted to have purulent
   sputum from ET tube.
   - continue bolus lasix to attempt to get fluid off of pt
 goal for
   today of negative 500 to 1000 cc
   - trend ABG's
   - vanc/cefepime for empiric therapy for PNA
   - resuming bronchodilators
   - continue to cycle cardiac enzymes
   - repeat echo in AM
   - sputum cx sent, will f/u
   - attempt to wean down pressors

   # PUMP: Reported history of CHF, although most recent echo in OMR does
   not show notable systolic or diastolic dysfunction.
   - repeat echo in AM
   - continue to bolus lasix for fluid removal
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt is in a demand-paced rhythm.
   - continue telemetry
   - continue coumadin for atrial fibrillation
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation - Pt with a history of atrial fibrillation. He is
   on coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - continue coumadin with goal INR [**2-6**]
   - FFP on standby in case pt needs a CVL
   .
   # Hypertension - Pt with a history of hypertension but is not on any
   antihypertensives.
   - attempt to obtain outside records
   - monitor BP, currently borderline hypotensive
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   # ?COPD - Pt with reported history of COPD.
   - attempt to obtain outside records
   - restarting bronchodilators
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency - Baseline Cr is 1.3 - 1.6.
   Current Cr is 1.9.  Likely, this is pre-renal in the setting of CHF
   (?poor forward flow).

","The patient is a 93-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency. He presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress and was sent to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8Â°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/51 mmHg to 144/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. The physical examination findings include an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), harsh breath sounds anteriorly, and decreased breath sounds at the right base. The patient has edema at the ankles and no other significant findings.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 30000/mmÂ³, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 93-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory distress, which could be due to CHF, pneumonia (PNA), or COPD. The patient has been intubated and is currently sedated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are relatively stable, but he has borderline hypotension. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated potassium levels, and normal liver function tests. An echocardiogram showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, small left ventricle, hyperdynamic ejection fraction (>75%), moderately dilated right ventricle, mild global free wall hypokinesis, abnormal septal motion/position, moderate pulmonary artery hypertension, and 1+ mitral regurgitation. The patient's urine culture showed growth of gram-negative rods (GNRs) between 10,000 to 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU). He is currently receiving dopamine, fentanyl, midazolam, lasix, and other medications. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU hold.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, which is likely due to CHF or pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's respiratory distress could be a result of pneumonia, especially given the presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count. However, there are no significant findings on the chest X-ray.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's history of CHF and current respiratory distress, there is a risk of developing ARDS, which is characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CHF and atrial fibrillation. His echocardiogram shows signs of left ventricular hypertrophy and reduced ejection fraction, indicating compromised cardiac function. There is also evidence of right ventricular dilation and moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
4. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine levels are elevated, and there has been a further increase during his ICU stay. This could be due to acute kidney injury or pre-renal causes secondary to poor forward flow from CHF.

","Summary:
The patient is a 93-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and possible acute on chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, which is suspected to be a component of CHF or pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, but he has borderline hypotension. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, indicating possible infection. An echocardiogram revealed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, small left ventricle, hyperdynamic ejection fraction (>75%), moderately dilated right ventricle with mild global free wall hypokinesis, abnormal septal motion/position, moderate pulmonary artery hypertension, and 1+ mitral regurgitation. The patient has received lasix boluses for fluid removal and is on empiric therapy for possible pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CHF, COPD, and atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of worsening cardiac function, including further deterioration of heart failure, arrhythmias, or even cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's baseline creatinine levels indicate chronic renal insufficiency, which could worsen due to factors such as dehydration, medications, or sepsis.
4. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein suggest an ongoing infection. If untreated or inadequately treated, this could lead to sepsis or septic shock.
5. Bleeding: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin for atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of bleeding, especially if the INR levels become excessively high.
6. Thrombotic Events: Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
7. Medication Reactions: The patient has allergies to penicillins, levofloxacin, and phenazopyridine. Therefore, there is a risk of medication reactions or adverse effects if these drugs are inadvertently administered."

- He presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress and was sent to the ICU for further management.
- The patient underwent intubation and invasive ventilation but experienced complications such as narrow complex tachycardia and an increased opacity on the left side of his chest X-ray.
- He was extubated and showed signs of alertness, able to answer questions appropriately and follow commands.
- Physical examination revealed clear lungs with decreased air entry at the bases, obesity, non-pitting edema in the lower extremities, and no masses noted.
- Laboratory results indicated elevated levels of potassium (K+), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and white blood cell count (WBC), while other parameters were within normal limits.
- The patient grew Klebsiella pneumoniae in his urine, which is sensitive to most antibiotics except for Bactrim.
- The assessment and plan included ruling out pneumonia (PNA) and continuing bronchodilators for potential COPD exacerbation.
- The patient's cardiac condition was evaluated with an echocardiogram, which showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), small left ventricle (LV) with an ejection fraction (EF) greater than 75%, moderately dilated right vent"

 dCHF vs. PNA vs. COPD.  Pt is now s/p
   intubation. There was likely a component of CHF/fluid overload. PNA a
   possibility; however, pt has not had grown anything out of sputum, no
   leukocytosis and no significant fevers.  Pt does not seem fluid
   overloaded on exam today.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress, which could be caused by congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia (PNA), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- There was likely a component of CHF or fluid overload, but the patient does not appear to be overloaded on examination.
- No significant growth was observed in the sputum, leukocytosis, or significant fevers, making PNA less likely.
- The patient has an active urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Klebsiella, which is sensitive to most antibiotics except Bactrim.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), but no further details were seen in the outpatient medical record (OMR).
- A cardiac echocardiogram showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), small left ventricle, hyperdynamic function (efficiency > 75%), moderately dilated right ventricle, mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, abnormal septal motion/position, 1+ mitral regurgitation (MR), 3+ tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
- The patient is in a demand-paced rhythm and requires continuous telemetry monitoring.
- The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) increased to 8 today, likely due to decreased oral"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other comorbidities. The patient presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU.

The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress, which could be attributed to CHF, pneumonia (PNA), or COPD. However, there is no evidence of PNA as the patient has not grown anything out of sputum, no leukocytosis, and no significant fevers. The patient does not seem fluid overloaded on examination.

The patient has been extubated and is alert, oriented, and able to follow commands. The physical examination shows clear lungs anteriorly, decreased at the bases, and some non-pitting edema in the lower extremities.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), but no other details are seen in the old medical records. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has been ruled out with a cardiac echo.

The patient's echocardiogram shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), small left ventricle, hyperdynamic function (ejection fraction >75%), moderately dilated right ventricle, mild global free wall hypokinesis, abnormal septal motion/position, 1+ mitral regurgitation (MR), 3+ tricuspid regurgitation (TR"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 97 kg male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to worsening hypercarbia. The patient was extubated at 9pm, but showed increased opacity on the left side of the chest X-ray. Post-extubation ABG initially worsened hypercarbia but then improved. The patient experienced narrow complex tachycardia during the day, with a rate in the 120s, which was identified as AVNRT. If the tachycardia recurs, an EKG will be checked, and a vagal maneuver may be attempted. The patient has rising creatinine levels, indicating possible renal failure, which is believed to be prerenal. Fluid administration may be considered tomorrow if the patient's respiratory status allows, and the patient should be encouraged to take frequent ice chips. 

Allergies include penicillins (itching), levofloxacin (rash), and phenazopyridine (unknown). The patient received vancomycin and cefepime on 03/08/2171. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/65 to 143/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is currently receiving supplemental oxygen through a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 96-year-old male with a chief complaint of impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and narrow complex tachycardia. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. He experienced a sudden episode of tachycardia during the day, which was identified as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient's renal function is worsening, as indicated by rising creatinine levels. He also has hypernatremia and hypercarbia before extubation. The patient's blood pressure dropped to the 90s after a carotid sinus massage, suggesting atrial tachycardia. The patient's allergies include penicillins, levofloxacin, and phenazopyridine. The patient has been receiving various ICU medications, including pantoprazole, and other medications. There are no significant changes in the patient's medical and family history. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: This could lead to pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility and pressure on certain areas of the body.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as hypoxemia or pneumonia.
3. Narrow complex tachycardia/SVT: If not appropriately treated, the t"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 323**] y/o M with history of CHF, ?COPD who was sent to the ED from [**Hospital 12**]
   Rehab for respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress
 dCHF vs. PNA vs. COPD.  Story does not seem
   likely for COPD. Pt is now s/p intubation. Likely a component of
   CHF/fluid overload. PNA a possibility; however, pt has not had grown
   anything out of sputum, no leukocytosis and no significant fevers.
   - continue bolus lasix to attempt to get fluid off of pt
 goal of -1L
   for today
   - vanc/cefepime for empiric therapy for PNA; will repeat CXR today and
   consider stopping abx if CXR remains clear
   - continue bronchodilators
   - f/u sputum cx
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt with a history of CAD, no other details seen in OMR.
   Ruled out for ACS with CE
   - continue to monitor for CP
   .
   # PUMP: Echo yesterday showed mild symmetric LVH, small LV,
   hyperdynamic (EF>75%). RV moderately dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. Abnormal septal motion/position. 1+ MR. 3+ TR. Moderate
   pulm artery HTN.
   - bolus lasix as above
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt is in a demand-paced rhythm.
   - continue telemetry
   - coumadin on hold [**2-5**] supratherapeutic INR
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation - Pt with a history of atrial fibrillation. He is
   on coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - holding coumadin as above
   - FFP on standby in case pt needs a CVL
   .
   # Hypertension - Pt with a history of hypertension but is not on any
   antihypertensives.
   - monitor BP, currently borderline hypotensive
   - continue to monitor BP
   .
   # Hypothyroidism
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   # ?COPD - Pt with reported history of COPD.
   - continue bronchodilators bronchodilators
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency - Baseline Cr is 1.3 - 1.6.
   Current Cr is 1.9.  Likely, this is pre-renal in the setting of CHF
   (?poor forward flow).
   - continue to trend creatinine
