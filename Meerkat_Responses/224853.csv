   1. Diffusely echogenic liver, consistent with fatty infiltration. Note
   that coexisting forms of hepatic disease such as cirrhosis are not
   excluded.
   2. No evidence of cholecystitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawl,
   seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis and left AMA late last
   night who was readmitted to [**Hospital1 17**] this morning with altered mental
   status, blood alcohol level >100 and transferred for management of
   presumed alcohol withdrawl.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Per report patient delerius this morning.
   Given that he was only out of the hospital for several hours, this was
   most likely due to intoxication rather than ETOH withdrawl(urine and
   serum tox o/w negative.  However, the patient also has history of
   seizure and CVA w/known PFO (not anticoagulated) and transaminitis
   which could all cause AMS.  CVA less likely  as his neuro exam is
   non-focal except for mildly deficient strength in his left arm which
   chronic.  Seizure also less likely to be responsible for entire picture
   as would expect patient's delirium to have resolved.
   -CIWA scale with Ativan given LFT abnormalities
   -Thiamine, Folate, MVI
   -f/u final read of head CT given
   -Continue Keppra and Lamictal as outlined per neuro during previous
   admission
   -Neuro Consult in AM
   -Check LFTs
   -If patient worsening or developing focal neurologic signs, could
   consider MRI head.
   .
   # Throbocytopenia: Patient intermittently thrombocytopenic over the
   last year, associated occasionally with lymphopenia, though now just
   thrombocytopenia.  Most likely related to ETOH, as no apparent
   medication effect temporally.  Also unlikely HIT/heparin antibodies as
   not temporally related to admissions but need to assess further when he
   actually received heparin products.
   -daily plt
   -pneumoboots for now pending investigation into timing of heparin
   .
   # Transaminitis:During previous admission, LFTs trended down when
   patient not drinking, simvastatin held.  Hep serologies are negative,
   HIV negative, RUQ U/S with fatty infiltrate but no other abnormality.
   -hold remeron for now, continue to hold simvastatin.
   -check LFTs today, if trending down most likely [**3-13**] simvastatin
   -if trending up could be related to ETOH use, medication effect
   .
   # Increased Lipase: Lipase 70 when patient left hospital.  Patient
   denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
   -recheck Lipase
   -NPO for now pending lipase, can likely advance diet if lipase trending
   down.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely related to agitation/ETOH withdrawl, but patient
   with dry MM, so ? volume depletion:
   -bolus NS
   -125 cc/hr IVF
   -EKG when patient calm
   .
   # History of PFO: Patient seen by cardiology in [**Month (only) **], and they
   recommended full dose aspirin but no further intervention unless
   patient has a second stroke.
   .
   # Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius: Found at last
   admission, per report ?ortho did a nerve block at this time.  Patient
   without complain of arm pain today.
   .
   #History of pyomyositis/clavicular osteo: Patient completed 6 week
   course of Vanco on [**2130-10-6**], currently stable.  If patient spikes fever
   would consider this source.

   47 year old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawl,
   seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis and left AMA late last
   night who was readmitted to [**Hospital1 17**] this morning with altered mental
   status, blood alcohol level >100 and transferred for management of
   presumed alcohol withdrawl.

   didn
t finish during last admission when he left AMA.  Also, with pt
   h/o seizure and stroke,  both could also cause AMS.  Stroke is unlikley
   bc neuro exam intact eexcept for chronic weakness in left arm s/p

   with treatment of ETOH withdrawal, Keppra can be given IV if PO not
   tolerated
   -If patient worsening or developing focal neurologic signs, could
   consider MRI head.

   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient intermittently thrombocytopenic over the
   last year. Most likely related to ETOH.  HIT also on diff however
   unlikely bc not correlating to Heparin exposure and clinically no signs
   of clotting, etc.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 47-year-old male with a recent history of alcohol withdrawal, seizures, transaminitis, and possible pancreatitis.
- He was readmitted to the hospital with altered mental status and a blood alcohol level exceeding 100.
- The patient has been diagnosed with presumed alcohol withdrawal and is being managed in the ICU.
- Other potential causes for altered mental status, such as seizure and stroke, have been considered but are less likely.
- The patient's medications include Keppra and Lamictal, which will be continued as per neuro recommendations.
- The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, elevated CK levels, transaminitis, increased lipase, tachycardia, PFO, non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius, and pyomyositis/clavicular osteomyelitis.
- Current assessments and plans include monitoring the patient's platelet count, starting SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis, trending CK levels, aggressive hydration with IVF, checking daily LFTs, ordering viral HCV load, and considering liver c/s or outpatient f/u.
- The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and he is currently on various prophylactic measures including DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

   47 year old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawl,
   seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis and left AMA late last
   night who was readmitted to [**Hospital1 17**] this morning with altered mental
   status, blood alcohol level >100 and transferred for management of
   presumed alcohol withdrawl.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to ETOH withdrawl that he
   didn
t finish during last admission when he left AMA.  Also, with pt
   h/o seizure and stroke,  both could also cause AMS.  Stroke is unlikley
   bc neuro exam intact eexcept for chronic weakness in left arm s/p
   infection there. Seizure also less likely bc pt
s AMS persisted too
   long.
   -continue CIWA scale with 10mg PO Vlaium q2h and Ativan IV PRN for now
   -Continue lamictal and incr dose of  Keppra per Neuro recs, no plan of
   EEG
   -f/u any new Neuro recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient intermittently thrombocytopenic over the
   last year. Most likely related to ETOH.
   -monitor daily plt and any signs of acute bleeding
   .
   # Elev CK: Likely [**3-13**] to injury/ETOH.  Hypothyroidism is a possible
   cause as well, however TSH wnl recently.
   - trend CK
   - continue hydration with IVF
   .
   # Transaminitis: During Likely [**3-13**] ETOH abuse.  Hep serologies indicate
   pt is HCV positive. Pt is HIV negative. Recent RUQ U/S with fatty
   infiltrate but no other abnormality.
   -hold remeron and simvastatin for now
   -check daily LFTs
   - pt to f/u with liver as outpatient
   .
   # Increased Lipase: Lipase 70 when patient left hospital.  Currently
   resolved.
   .
   # History of PFO:  stable
   - continue full dose aspirin
   .
   # Non-displaced fracture of the proximal radius: Found at last
   admission, per report ?ortho did a nerve block at this time.
   -pt not complaining of any pain currently
   .
   #History of pyomyositis/clavicular osteo: Patient completed 6 week
   course of Vanco on [**2130-10-6**], currently stable.  If patient spikes fever
   would consider this source.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a recent history of alcohol withdrawal, seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis, and leaving against medical advice (AMA). He presented to the hospital with altered mental status and an elevated blood alcohol level (>100). The patient was transferred for the management of presumed alcohol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's AMS is likely due to ETOH withdrawal, but other causes such as seizure and stroke should also be considered. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's mental status and provide appropriate treatment for alcohol withdrawal.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of intermittent thrombocytopenia over the last year, which is most likely related to alcohol abuse. Close monitoring of platelet count and any signs of acute bleeding is necessary.
3. Elevated Creatine Kinase (CK): The elevated CK level is likely due to injury or ETOH abuse. It is important to trend CK levels and continue hydration with intravenous fluids.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis during likely recent ETOH abuse. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) serologies indicate that the patient is positive for HCV, but HIV negative. Regular monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is recommended, and the patient should follow up with a liver specialist as an outpatient.
5. Increased Lipase:"

","The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse and withdrawal, as well as a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and clear seizure history. The patient is currently being treated for alcohol withdrawal, seizure disorder, and CVA in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/66 to 160/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving various medications including haloperidol, pantoprazole, lorazepam, and heparin sodium. 

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Delirium tremens (DTs): This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes. Symptoms may include severe agitation, confusion, hallucinations, rapid heartbeat, fever, and seizures. Close monitoring for these symptoms is crucial.

2. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and it is essential to continue seizure prophylaxis with medications such as keppra and lamictal. Monitoring for any signs of seizure activity is necessary.

3. Thiamine deficiency: Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to thiamine deficiency, which can result in Wernicke's encephalopathy. Early recognition"

   47 year old male who was recently hospitalized for ETOH withdrawl,

   status, blood alcohol level >100 and transferred for management of
   presumed alcohol withdrawl.
   .
   # Altered mental status: most likely due to ETOH withdrawl that he
   didn
t finish during last admission when he left AMA.  Also, with pt
   h/o seizure and stroke,  both could also cause AMS.  Stroke is unlikley
   bc neuro exam intact eexcept for chronic weakness in left arm s/p
   infection there. Seizure also less likely bc pt
s AMS persisted too
   long.
   -continue CIWA scale with 10mg PO Vlaium q2h and Ativan IV PRN for now
   -per Neuro: increase keppra to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **], cont lamictal at current
   dose of 200mg daily and f/u level from [**10-20**]. ativan IV prn seizure >5
   min or seizure cluster. avoid medications that may reduce his seizure
   threshold (i.e., fluoroquinolones, flagyl, antipsychotics). would
   prefer zyprexa or seroquel over halodol if needed for agitation.

   cause as well, however TSH wnl recently.
   - CK trending down

   # Transaminitis: During Likely [**3-13**] ETOH abuse.  Hep serologies indicate
   pt is HCV positive. Pt is HIV negative. Recent RUQ U/S with fatty

","The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of recent hospitalization for alcohol withdrawal, seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis, and leaving against medical advice (AMA) last night. He was readmitted this morning with altered mental status, blood alcohol level >100, and transferred for management of presumed alcohol withdrawal.

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including:

1. Altered mental status: Most likely due to ETOH withdrawal, but also could be caused by seizures or a stroke. Stroke is unlikely because the neurologic exam is intact except for chronic weakness in the left arm due to an infection. Seizure is less likely because the patient's AMS persisted too long.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has been intermittently thrombocytopenic over the last year, most likely related to alcohol abuse. Monitor daily platelet count and any signs of acute bleeding.

3. Elevated CK: Likely due to injury/ETOH. Hypothyroidism is a possible cause as well, but thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was within normal limits recently. CK is trending down, and continue hydration with intravenous fluids (IVF) as needed.

4. Transaminitis: During likely [**3-13**] ETOH abuse. Hepatitis C serologies indicate that the patient is positive for HCV, but HIV-negative. Recent right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ U/S)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male who was recently hospitalized for alcohol withdrawal, seizures, transaminitis, possible pancreatitis, and left against medical advice (AMA) last night. He was readmitted to the hospital this morning with altered mental status, blood alcohol level >100, and transferred for management of presumed alcohol withdrawal. The patient has a history of ETOH abuse, seizures, stroke, and is currently being treated for presumed alcohol withdrawal. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to ETOH withdrawal, seizures, or stroke. The physician plans to continue CIWA scale with 10mg PO Valium q2h and Ativan IV PRN for now. Seizure medications will be continued, and any new neurologic recommendations will be followed up on.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has intermittently low platelet counts over the last year, most likely related to ETOH abuse. Daily monitoring of platelet levels and any signs of acute bleeding will be done.
3. Elevated CK: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are likely due to injury/ETOH. The CK levels are trending down, and hydration with IVF PRN will continue.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, likely due to recent ETOH abuse. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) serologies indicate"

   47 yo patient with history of EtOH abuse and EtOH withdrawl as well as
   an independent history of seizure disorder now admitted with acute
   intoxication and has been supported through withdrawl with CIWA scale
   guided dosing of Valium with better response seen to Valium than Ativan
   interestingly.
   1) ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)-
   -Continue with Thiamine/Folate
   -Continue with CIWA scale guided valium dosing
   -will have to clarify any desire for detox and systematic approach to
   discontinuation of EtOH abuse.
   2)Seizure Disorder-
   Patient with signfiicant seizure disorder outside of EtOH withdrawl
   -Continue with seizure meds as defined by neurology consult service
   (Lamictal/Keppra)
