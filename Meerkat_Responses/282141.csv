   Present for the key portions of history and exam. Agree with assessment
   and plan as outlined by Dr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].  I am not sure how truly volume
   depleted he has been as creat has improved markedly with a pos balance
   of only 1300 cc.  Seems likely Bactrim and his other meds (NSAIDS and
   ACE0 are major contributors. We have added Bactrim to his allergies and
   warned him about sulfa drugs in the future.  Looks as though he will
   safely do without dialysis.  Surgery aware and will address his ostomy
   output.

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diverticular disease who underwent partial colectomy, anastomotic leak with subsequent ileostomy, and decreased oral intake with acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, and anemia. The patient is currently in the ICU for ARF, hyperkalemia, increased colostomy output, and anemia.

Assessment and plan:
1. Acute renal failure: Negative fluid balance with high ostomy output, decreased PO intake, and additional insults from ACE inhibitor, NSAID, and Bactrim. Stopped NSAIDs and ACE inhibitor. Aggressive fluid resuscitation started, continue with D5W with bicarb and NS in ICU. Trend BUN/Cr. Renal will continue to follow. Consider possibility of HD if clinical picture changes.
2. Hyperkalemia: Setting of acidemia with high stool output and renal failure. Addt'l kayexalate. Trend renal function. Repeat EKG in ICU. May need to give addt'l Ca, Insulin, D50, and kayexalate.
3. Increased colostomy output: Unclear etiology, possible recolonization of terminal ileum by colonic bacteria, though unlikely. High ostomy output is not uncommon with ileostomy.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diverticular disease who underwent partial colectomy, anastomotic leak with subsequent ileostomy. The patient has high ostomy output and decreased oral intake, leading to acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is due to a negative fluid balance with high ostomy output, decreased oral intake, and additional insults from the use of ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, and Bactrim. Stopping NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors, aggressive fluid resuscitation, monitoring BUN/Cr levels, considering hemodialysis if the clinical picture changes, are part of the treatment plan.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia is setting of acidemia with high stool output and renal failure. Additional kayexalate, repeating EKG in ICU, and possibly giving calcium, insulin, D50, and kayexalate are part of the treatment plan.

3. Increased colostomy output: The cause of the increased colostomy output is unclear, but it could be due to recolonization of the terminal ileum by colonic bacteria or high ostomy output with ileostomy. Matching fluid output with ins, considering c-diff, and discussing options with surgery regarding medications and diet modifications are part of the management plan.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 105/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has a central venous line.

The patient's lab results show elevated potassium levels (K+ 6.7 mEq/L), increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN 28 mg/dL), and creatinine (Cr 3.2 mg/dL) indicating acute renal failure. The patient also has hyperkalemia, acidemia, and increased colostomy output.

The plan of care includes aggressive fluid resuscitation, discontinuation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), administration of calcium, insulin, dextrose, and kayexalate to manage hyperkalemia. The patient's colostomy output is being matched with intake, and consideration is being given to dietary modifications and surgical consultation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, persistent hyperkalemia, and possible infections due to the use of urinary catheters and central venous lines. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, renal function, electrolyte levels, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diverticular disease who underwent a partial colectomy, anastomotic leak with subsequent ileostomy, and is currently experiencing decreased PO intake and acute renal failure. The patient also has hyperkalemia, anemia, and increased colostomy output. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 105/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium, BUN, creatinine, and lactate, as well as low levels of hemoglobin and platelets. The patient is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation, medication adjustments, and monitoring for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's current condition of ARF is already present, and there is a need to continue aggressive fluid resuscitation, monitor BUN/Cr levels, and consider the possibility of hemodialysis if the clinical picture changes.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high levels of potassium, which needs to be managed by administering additional kayexalate, monitoring renal function, and repeating an EKG in the ICU. It may also be necessary to give calcium, insulin, D50, and kayexalate as needed.
3. Increased Colostomy Output: The cause of the increased"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute renal failure. The note provides detailed information about the patient's medical history, vital signs, fluid balance, medications, lab results, and physical examination findings.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but their blood pressure is on the lower side (105/63 mmHg). The heart rate is stable at 88 bpm, respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is at 99%. The patient's height is 67 inches, and their total fluid intake and output are documented.

In terms of respiratory support, the patient is not on any supplemental oxygen, and their ABG values show a slightly lower pH level (7.32) with normal levels of PaCO2 (28 mmHg) and PaO2 (94 mmHg).

The physical examination findings are limited due to the patient not being assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

The lab results indicate abnormalities in several parameters. The white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 241 K/uL, hemoglobin level is low at 6.7 g/dL, sodium level is high at 121 mg/dL, potassium level is low at 2.9 mg/dL, chloride level is within normal range at 18 mEq/L, bicarbonate level is decreased at 5.9 mEq/L,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic anemia, acute renal failure, and hyperkalemia. The patient has been experiencing diarrhea and requires continuous monitoring. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, blood pressure ranging from 108/69 mmHg to 149/71 mmHg, heart rate between 78-94 bpm, respiratory rate at 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has been receiving insulin and dextrose infusions, as well as other medications. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 6,440 mL, including 655 mL of IV fluids, and a total output of 6,200 mL, with 2,700 mL of urine output. The patient is not on respiratory support. Lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactic acid, with low hemoglobin and white blood cell count. The patient is on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances (particularly hyperkalemia), infections (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia), gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diverticular disease who underwent a partial colectomy, anastomotic leak, and subsequent ileostomy. He presented with acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, anemia, and increased ileostomy output. The patient's condition has shown some improvement, with a decrease in creatinine levels from 3.2 to 1.8. He is currently being treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation, medications to manage hyperkalemia, and dietary recommendations for renal health. The patient's ileostomy output is being closely monitored, and he is receiving medications to control diarrhea. Anemia is suspected to be caused by acute and chronic blood loss, possibly exacerbated by the use of Bactrim in the presence of renal failure. The patient's blood transfusion type and cross-matching is pending. The patient's overall trend of blood this admission reflects pancytopenia. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, which has shown some improvement with aggressive fluid resuscitation. However, the patient remains at risk for further deterioration in renal function.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. Close monitoring of renal function and potassium levels is essential to prevent complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of diverticular disease who underwent a partial colectomy. He also has an anastomotic leak with subsequent ileostomy, high ostomy output, decreased PO intake, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's current conditions include hyperkalemia, anemia, and chronic renal failure.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has shown significant improvement in the first 24 hours. It is recommended to stop NSAIDs, ACEI, and Bactrim. Aggressive fluid resuscitation should continue, and the trend of BUN/Cr should be monitored.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels are improving slowly. It is important to continue monitoring renal function and potassium levels. Repeat EKG if potassium trends upward, and additional calcium, insulin, and D50 should be administered as needed.
3. Increased ileostomy output: The cause of this issue is unclear, but it could be related to recolonization of the terminal ileum by colonic bacteria. It is recommended to match fluid output with ins, and IVF can be discontinued if ostomy output picks up.
4. Anemia: The patient's initial critical hemoglobin level has decreased from 33 to 26.7%. This may be due to acute and chronic blood loss, possibly exacerbated by NSAID use and a"
