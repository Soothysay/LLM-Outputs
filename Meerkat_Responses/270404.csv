   Disposition:
","The patient is an elderly woman with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer treated with CyberKnife therapy. She presented to the emergency department with symptoms of worsening shortness of breath and exertional dyspnea. On examination, she was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, hypotensive, and hypoxic. The patient has been started on esmolol drip for rate control and IV digoxin 250mg x2 in the ED. Her INR is therapeutic. The plan is to continue monitoring her heart rate with a goal in the 100s-110s, provide vasopressor support for hypotension, continue esmolol drip at the current maximum dose, transition digoxin to PO to start in the AM, consider Diltiazem bolus + gtt if HR not yet well-controlled, and repeat ECG once under improved control. The patient also has a history of chronic dCHF with left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 75%. She has been experiencing progressively worsening symptoms since her outpatient appointment one month ago. The plan is to continue rate control for A-Fib as above, continue home spironolactone dose, initiate diuresis with Lasix bolus+gtt once hemodynamically improved, and perform a transthoracic echocardiogram"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (A-fib), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), hypothyroidism (HL), and metastatic thyroid cancer treated with CyberKnife therapy. She presents with symptoms of worsening shortness of breath and difficulty breathing (DOE) over the past two weeks, along with a recent weight gain of 20 pounds. Upon arrival in the emergency department (ED), she was found to be in A-fib with rapid ventricular response, hypotensive, and hypoxic. She was started on esmolol to control her heart rate, followed by the addition of diltiazem in the critical care unit (CCU). 

The patient has several medical complications including severe pulmonary hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, and evidence of prerenal azotemia. She also has an enlarged right ventricle (RV) with moderate global free wall hypokinesis and severe left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is low, suggesting possible thyrotoxicity from CyberKnife therapy. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Rhythm: The patient's A-fib with rapid ventricular response needs to be controlled. She has been started on esmolol and diltiazem, which have been effective in controlling her heart rate. It is recommended to continue rate"

   A-fib on anticoagulation, severe pulm HTN, DM, HTN, HL, and metastatic
   thyroid Ca s/p CyberKnife therapy, p/w 20-pound weight gain x2 weeks
   and progressively worsening SOB and DOE, found to be in A-fib w/ [**Year (4 digits) 1725**] in
   the ED, hypotensive, and hypoxic.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt w/ chronic atrial fibrillation, no previous attempts at
   cardioversion. A-Fib w/ [**Year (4 digits) 1725**] on presentation to ED, w/ hypotension as
   below, in setting of worsening symptoms since stopping Digoxin and
   uptitrating Toprol XL. Started on Esmolol gtt and titrated to max in
   ED. Also given IV Digoxin 250mg x2 in ED. Currently therapeutic INR.
   Upon arrival to CCU, Diltiazem bolus + gtt started with good effect,
   esmolol titrated off. Low TSH suggests probable thyrotoxicity likely
   from CyberKnife therapy to thyroid cancer.
   - change Diltiazem gtt to PO Diltiazem, uptitrate PRN for rate control
   - d/c Dopamine gtt as below
   - continue PO Digoxin
   - continue home Coumadin for anticoagulation
   - continue to monitor on telemetry

   system. Has progressively worsening symptoms since outpatient
   appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] one month ago. Has been urinating well on
   Lasix gtt but only mild improvement in overload status.
   - continue Lasix gtt, consider change to PO Torsemide later today if
   stable off Dopamine
   - d/c Dopamine gtt as below
   - monitor UOP closely
   - continue home spironolactone
   - consider adding metolazone for additional diuresis
   - continue rate control for A-Fib/[**First Name (STitle) 1725**] as above
   - continue Viagra for severe pulmonary hypertension
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes and renal function
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD, but w/ many risk factors.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt w/ SBP 80s-90s in ED, started on Neosynephrine for BP
   support while on rate-controlling agents. Likely [**1-15**] poor forward flow
   from A-Fib/[**Last Name (LF) 1725**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] likely improve with HR control and diuresis.
   Continues to require dopamine gtt but mentates well without problem
   when hypotensive.
   - d/c Dopamine gtt today
   - monitor hemodynamics closely
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/[**First Name3 (LF) 1725**]
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   .
   # HYPOXIA: Likely [**1-15**] pulmonary edema from worsening diastolic CHF [**1-15**]
   A-Fib/[**Month/Day (2) 1725**]. Will likely improve with HR control and diuresis. Also
   probable contribution from severe pulmonary hypertension.
   - wean supplemental O2 as tolerated
   - continue Viagra for severe pulmonary hypertension
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/[**Month/Day (2) 1725**]
   - check Chest CT w/ contrast today to assess lungs for source of
   chronic severe pulm HTN and RVH / RV dilation
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Likely [**1-15**] poor forward flow from A-Fib/[**Month/Day (2) 1725**].
   Will likely improve with HR control and diuresis. Urine lytes c/w
   prerenal physiology.
   - holding Lisinopril for now
   - d/c Dopamine gtt as above
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/[**Month/Day (2) 1725**]
   - consider renal ultrasounds / renal consult if not improving
   .
   # DIABETES: On oral meds at home for glycemic control.
   - holding home Glyburide
   - insulin SS to cover
   - diabetic diet, FSBS QIDACHS

   cardioversion. A-Fib w/ RVR on presentation to ED, w/ hypotension as
   below, in setting of worsening symptoms since stopping Digoxin and
   uptitrating Toprol XL. Started on Esmolol gtt and titrated to max in
   ED. Also given IV Digoxin 250mg x2 in ED. Currently therapeutic INR.
   Upon arrival to CCU, Diltiazem bolus + gtt started with good effect,
   esmolol titrated off. Low TSH suggests probable thyrotoxicity likely
   from CyberKnife therapy to thyroid cancer. Continues to be
   well-controlled on PO Diltiazem.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure (LVH, EF 75%), atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer treated with CyberKnife therapy. She presented with shortness of breath and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the emergency department. She is now admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pump Failure: The patient has chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 70-75%. She is experiencing an acute exacerbation with worsening symptoms, severe diastolic dysfunction, and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. She will continue on Lasix, spironolactone, and possibly metolazone for additional diuresis. Close monitoring of urine output is necessary.

2. Rhythm Disturbance: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation. She was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response upon presentation to the ED. She has been started on esmolol and digoxin, but her INR is supratherapeutic. She will continue on PO diltiazem for rate control and her digoxin will be discontinued due to normal ejection fraction. Telemetry monitoring will continue.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 80s-90s. She has been started on"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 83-yo woman w/ chronic dCHF (LVH, EF 75%), chronic
   A-fib on anticoagulation, severe pulm HTN, DM, HTN, HL, and metastatic
   thyroid Ca s/p CyberKnife therapy, p/w 20-pound weight gain x2 weeks
   and progressively worsening SOB and DOE, found to be in A-fib w/ RVR in
   the ED, hypotensive, and hypoxic.
   .
   #. PUMP: Pt w/ known chronic dCHF (LVH and EF 75%), now with acute
   exacerbation. Has progressively worsening symptoms since outpatient
   appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] one month ago. Has been urinating well on
   Lasix gtt with improvement in volume status. TTE here showed EF 70-75%,
   markedly dilated RV w/ moderate global HK, preserved LV regional and
   global systolic function, severe diastolic dysfunction, moderate to
   severe pulmonary hypertenion.
   - continue Lasix gtt, especially given hypotension and mild ARF
   - titrate gtt to goal 1-1.5 L net negative daily; plan for total 3-4 L
   diuresis
   - monitor UOP closely
   - continue home spironolactone
   - continue rate control for A-Fib/RVR as above
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt w/ chronic atrial fibrillation, no previous attempts at
   cardioversion. A-Fib w/ RVR on presentation to ED, w/ hypotension as
   below, in setting of worsening symptoms since stopping Digoxin and
   uptitrating Toprol XL. Started on Esmolol gtt and titrated to max in
   ED. Also given IV Digoxin 250mg x2 in ED. Currently therapeutic INR.
   Upon arrival to CCU, Diltiazem bolus + gtt started with good effect,
   esmolol titrated off. Low TSH suggests probable thyrotoxicity likely
   from CyberKnife therapy to thyroid cancer. Continues to be
   well-controlled on PO Diltiazem and metoprolol.  Now off digoxin.
   - continue PO Diltiazem
   - increase metoprolol to 225 mg today, plan to continue increased dose
   if BP tolerates
   - hold Coumadin for anticoagulation today given supratherapeutic INR
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD, but w/ many risk factors.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt w/ SBP 80s-90s in ED, started on Neosynephrine for BP
   support while on rate-controlling agents. Mentates well even though
   hypotensive, unclear etiology. Does not seem septic, although fever
   last night may be indicative of underlying infection yet to be
   identified. Thought to have been [**1-15**] poor forward flow from acute on
   chronic diastolic CHF and A-Fib/RVR, now much improved with rate
   control and diuresis. Random cortisol yesterday >20 reassuring for no
   adrenal insufficiency.  .
   - no vasopressors given mentation at baseline and producing urine
   - monitor hemodynamics closely
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/RVR
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   .
   # HYPOXIA: Likely [**1-15**] pulmonary edema from worsening diastolic CHF [**1-15**]
   A-Fib/RVR. Will likely improve with HR control and diuresis. Also
   probable contribution from severe pulmonary hypertension.  Prelim read
   no PE on CTA.
   - wean supplemental O2 as tolerated
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/RVR
   - f/u formal result of Chest CTA
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Likely [**1-15**] poor forward flow from A-Fib/RVR.
   Will likely improve with HR control and diuresis. Urine lytes c/w
   prerenal physiology.
   - holding Lisinopril for now
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/RVR
   - consider renal ultrasounds / renal consult if not improving

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic diastolic heart failure (LVH, EF 75%), chronic atrial fibrillation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer treated with CyberKnife therapy. She presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath, hypotension, and hypoxia. She has been experiencing progressive worsening of symptoms since her last outpatient appointment one month ago. Upon admission, she was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was started on esmolol and digoxin. Her random cortisol level yesterday was above 20, reassuring for no adrenal insufficiency. She is currently on various medications including diuretics, rate-controlling agents, and anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient's history of chronic diastolic heart failure and acute exacerbation indicates potential complications related to heart failure such as pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury, and hypotension.
2. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's prolonged bedridden status increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's age and underlying medical conditions put her at risk for delirium or confusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a medical history of chronic diastolic heart failure (LVH, EF 75%), chronic atrial fibrillation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer treated with CyberKnife therapy. She presented with a 20-pound weight gain over two weeks, progressively worsening shortness of breath, and dyspnea on exertion. She was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the emergency department, hypotensive, and hypoxic.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, delirium/confusion, decubitus ulcer, and thyroid cancer. Her vital signs include a temperature of 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 106/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination revealed a large firm multinodular mass in the thyroid area, jugular venous distention below the angle of the jaw, and crackles and decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally. Laboratory results showed elevated levels of potassium, glucose, and creatinine, with low levels of sodium and hemoglobin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer. She presented with symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, and delirium. On examination, she had a systolic blood pressure of 106 mmHg, heart rate of 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula, and jugular venous distension below the angle of the jaw. A large firm multinodular mass was found in the thyroid area. The patient's urine output was low for most of the day yesterday and did not respond to Lasix until reaching 12 mg/hr. She had a low-grade temperature of 100.3 degrees Celsius yesterday afternoon. Chest CTA final read is pending. Her recent morning cortisol level was 32.1 and she was not stimulated further.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure and presents with symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, and jugular venous distension. These findings suggest possible acute exacerbation of heart failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and is currently being treated with anticoagulation therapy. The supratherapeutic"

   A-fib on anticoagulation, severe pulm HTN, DM, HTN, HL, and metastatic
   thyroid Ca s/p CyberKnife therapy, p/w 20-pound weight gain x2 weeks
   and progressively worsening SOB and DOE, found to be in A-fib w/ RVR in
   the ED, hypotensive, and hypoxic.
   .
   #. PUMP: Acute on chronic dCHF (LVH and EF 75%). Has been urinating
   well on Lasix gtt with improvement in volume status. TTE here showed EF
   70-75%, markedly dilated RV w/ moderate global HK, preserved LV
   regional and global systolic function, severe diastolic dysfunction,
   moderate to severe pulmonary hypertenion.
   - continue Lasix gtt, especially given hypotension and mild ARF
   - titrate gtt to goal 1-1.5 L net negative daily; plan for total 3-4 L
   diuresis
   - monitor UOP closely
   - continue home spironolactone
   - continue rate control for A-Fib/RVR as above
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt w/ chronic atrial fibrillation, presented with RVR and
   hypotension.  Anticoagulated with supratherapeutic INR.  Now s/p
   diltiazem and esmolol drips on PO diltiazem and metoprolol with HR
   90-100.  Low TSH suggests probable thyrotoxicity likely from CyberKnife
   therapy to thyroid cancer.
   - continue PO Diltiazem
   - increase metoprolol to 225 mg today, plan to continue increased dose
   if BP tolerates
   - hold Coumadin for anticoagulation today given supratherapeutic INR
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD, but w/ many risk factors.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION:  Presented with hypotension, likely [**1-15**] poor forward
   flow from acute on chronic diastolic CHF and A-Fib/RVR, now much
   improved with rate control and diuresis. Random cortisol yesterday >20
   reassuring for no adrenal insufficiency.  Low suspicion for sepsis but
   low-grade febrile yesterday.
   - no vasopressors given mentation at baseline and producing urine
   - monitor hemodynamics closely
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/RVR
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   .
   # HYPOXIA: Likely [**1-15**] pulmonary edema from worsening diastolic CHF [**1-15**]
   A-Fib/RVR. Will likely improve with HR control and diuresis. Also
   probable contribution from severe pulmonary hypertension.  Prelim read
   no PE on CTA.
   - wean supplemental O2 as tolerated
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/RVR
   - f/u formal result of Chest CTA
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Likely [**1-15**] poor forward flow from A-Fib/RVR.
   Will likely improve with HR control and diuresis. Urine lytes c/w
   prerenal physiology.
   - holding Lisinopril for now
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/RVR
   - consider renal ultrasounds / renal consult if not improving

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer treated with CyberKnife therapy. She presented with worsening shortness of breath, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and is currently being treated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PUMP: The patient has acute on chronic diastolic heart failure with preserved systolic function. She is experiencing hypotension and mild acute renal failure. The potential complications include worsening heart failure symptoms, fluid overload, and further deterioration of renal function.
2. RHYTHM: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation and presented with rapid ventricular response. She is on anticoagulation therapy with a supratherapeutic INR. The potential complications include thromboembolic events, bleeding, and arrhythmia-related complications.
3. CORONARIES: Although the patient has no known coronary artery disease, she has multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Potential complications include myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or other coronary events.
4. HYPOTENSION: The patient presented with hypotension likely due to poor forward flow from acute on chronic diastolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation"

The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer status post CyberKnife therapy. She presented with a 20-pound weight gain over two weeks, progressively worsening shortness of breath (SOB) and dyspnea on exertion (DOE), and was found to be in AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the emergency department. She was hypotensive and hypoxic.

   Assessment and Plan
   83-yo woman w/ chronic dCHF (LVH, EF 75%), chronic A-fib on
   anticoagulation, severe pulm HTN, DM, HTN, HL, and metastatic thyroid
   Ca s/p CyberKnife therapy, p/w 20-pound weight gain x2 weeks and
   progressively worsening SOB and DOE, found to be in A-fib w/ RVR in the
   ED, hypotensive, and hypoxic.
   .
   #. PUMP: Acute on chronic dCHF (LVH and EF 75%). Has been urinating
   well on Lasix gtt with improvement in volume status. TTE here showed EF
   70-75%, markedly dilated RV w/ moderate global HK, preserved LV
   regional and global systolic function, severe diastolic dysfunction,
   moderate to severe pulmonary hypertenion.
   - continue Lasix gtt, especially given hypotension and mild ARF
   - titrate gtt to goal 1-1.5 L net negative daily; plan for total 3-4 L
   diuresis
   - monitor UOP closely
   - continue home spironolactone
   - continue rate control for A-Fib/RVR as above
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt w/ chronic atrial fibrillation, presented with RVR and
   hypotension.  Anticoagulated with supratherapeutic INR.  Now s/p
   diltiazem and esmolol drips on PO diltiazem and metoprolol with HR
   90-100.  Low TSH suggests probable thyrotoxicity likely from CyberKnife
   therapy to thyroid cancer.
   - continue PO Diltiazem
   - increase metoprolol to 225 mg today, plan to continue increased dose
   if BP tolerates
   - hold Coumadin for anticoagulation today given supratherapeutic INR
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD, but w/ many risk factors.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION:  Presented with hypotension, likely [**1-15**] poor forward
   flow from acute on chronic diastolic CHF and A-Fib/RVR, now much
   improved with rate control and diuresis. Random cortisol yesterday >20
   reassuring for no adrenal insufficiency.  Low suspicion for sepsis but
   low-grade febrile yesterday.
   - no vasopressors given mentation at baseline and producing urine
   - monitor hemodynamics closely
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/RVR
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   .
   # HYPOXIA: Likely [**1-15**] pulmonary edema from worsening diastolic CHF [**1-15**]
   A-Fib/RVR. Will likely improve with HR control and diuresis. Also
   probable contribution from severe pulmonary hypertension.  Prelim read
   no PE on CTA.
   - wean supplemental O2 as tolerated
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/RVR
   - f/u formal result of Chest CTA
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Likely [**1-15**] poor forward flow from A-Fib/RVR.
   Will likely improve with HR control and diuresis. Urine lytes c/w
   prerenal physiology.
   - holding Lisinopril for now
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/RVR
   - consider renal ultrasounds / renal consult if not improving
   .
   # DIABETES: On oral meds at home for glycemic control.
   - holding home Glyburide
   - insulin SS to cover
   - diabetic diet, FSBS QIDACHS
   .
   # CROHN'S DISEASE: continue home Pentasa, PPI.

","The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a medical history of chronic diastolic heart failure (LVH, EF 75%), chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer status post CyberKnife therapy. She presented with a 20-pound weight gain over two weeks and progressively worsening shortness of breath and exertional dyspnea. In the emergency department, she was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotensive, and hypoxic.

Her current assessment includes acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure (LVH and EF 75%). She has been urinating well on Lasix gtt with improvement in volume status. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 70-75%, markedly dilated right ventricle with moderate global hypokinesis, preserved left ventricular regional and global systolic function, severe diastolic dysfunction, and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.

Based on this information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. PUMP Dysfunction: The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure with severe diastolic dysfunction and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. There is a risk of worsening cardiac function, leading to further fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.

2. RHYTHM Disturbances: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation and presented with"

   Assessment and Plan
   83-yo woman w/ chronic dCHF (LVH, EF 75%), chronic A-fib on
   anticoagulation, severe pulm HTN, DM, HTN, HL, and metastatic thyroid
   Ca s/p CyberKnife therapy, p/w 20-pound weight gain x2 weeks and
   progressively worsening SOB and DOE, found to be in A-fib w/ RVR in the
   ED, hypotensive, and hypoxic.
   .
   #. PUMP: Acute on chronic dCHF (LVH and EF 75%). Has been urinating
   well on Lasix gtt with improvement in volume status. TTE here showed EF
   70-75%, markedly dilated RV w/ moderate global HK, preserved LV
   regional and global systolic function, severe diastolic dysfunction,
   moderate to severe pulmonary hypertenion.
   - continue Lasix gtt, especially given hypotension and mild ARF
   - titrate gtt to goal 1-1.5 L net negative daily; plan for total 3-4 L
   diuresis
   - monitor UOP closely
   - continue home spironolactone
   - continue rate control for A-Fib/RVR as above
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt w/ chronic atrial fibrillation, presented with RVR and
   hypotension.  Anticoagulated with supratherapeutic INR.  Now s/p
   diltiazem and esmolol drips on PO diltiazem and metoprolol with HR
   90-100.  Low TSH suggests probable thyrotoxicity likely from CyberKnife
   therapy to thyroid cancer.
   - continue PO Diltiazem
   - increase metoprolol to 225 mg today, plan to continue increased dose
   if BP tolerates
   - hold Coumadin for anticoagulation today given supratherapeutic INR
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD, but w/ many risk factors.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION:  Presented with hypotension, likely [**1-15**] poor forward
   flow from acute on chronic diastolic CHF and A-Fib/RVR, now much
   improved with rate control and diuresis. Random cortisol yesterday >20
   reassuring for no adrenal insufficiency.  Low suspicion for sepsis but
   low-grade febrile yesterday.
   - no vasopressors given mentation at baseline and producing urine
   - monitor hemodynamics closely
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/RVR
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   .
   # HYPOXIA: Likely [**1-15**] pulmonary edema from worsening diastolic CHF [**1-15**]
   A-Fib/RVR. Will likely improve with HR control and diuresis. Also
   probable contribution from severe pulmonary hypertension.  Prelim read
   no PE on CTA.
   - wean supplemental O2 as tolerated
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/RVR
   - f/u formal result of Chest CTA
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Likely [**1-15**] poor forward flow from A-Fib/RVR.
   Will likely improve with HR control and diuresis. Urine lytes c/w
   prerenal physiology.
   - holding Lisinopril for now
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/RVR
   - consider renal ultrasounds / renal consult if not improving
   .
   # DIABETES: On oral meds at home for glycemic control.
   - holding home Glyburide
   - insulin SS to cover
   - diabetic diet, FSBS QIDACHS
   .
   # CROHN'S DISEASE: continue home Pentasa, PPI.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and metastatic thyroid cancer. She presented with shortness of breath, hypotension, and hypoxia. The patient was found to have acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and severe pulmonary hypertension. She was started on diuretics, rate control medications, and anticoagulation. The patient's hypotension, hypoxia, acute renal failure, diabetes, Crohn's disease, and nutrition management are being closely monitored and treated accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PUMP: Acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure may lead to worsening heart function, pulmonary edema, and further hypoxia.
2. RHYTHM: Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can cause hemodynamic instability and worsening heart failure.
3. CORONARIES: The patient's risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) should be regularly assessed, and any signs or symptoms of angina or myocardial infarction should be promptly evaluated.
4. HYPOTENSION: Poor forward flow due to diastolic heart failure and uncontrolled atrial fibrillation may persist or worsen if rate control and diuretic therapy are inadequate.
5. HYPOXIA: Continued pulmonary edema and severe pulmonary hypertension may contribute to persistent hypoxia despite diuretic therapy and rate control.
6. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Poor forward flow from uncontrolled atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure may lead to worsening renal function.
7. DIABETES: Poor glycemic control can occur due to stress-induced hyperglycemia or inadequate insulin therapy.
8. CROHN'S DISEASE: Flares or complications related to Crohn's disease may require adjustments in medication management.

The patient's complex medical history and current presentation indicate the need for close monitoring and multidisciplinary care to prevent potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including chronic diastolic heart failure (LVH, EF 75%), chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer status post CyberKnife therapy. She presented with a 20-pound weight gain over two weeks and progressively worsening shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. 

She was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the emergency department, hypotensive, and hypoxic. She has been diagnosed with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, with an ejection fraction of 70-75%, markedly dilated right ventricle with moderate global hypokinesis, preserved left ventricular regional and global systolic function, severe diastolic dysfunction, and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing Lasix gtt to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1-1.5 L daily, monitoring urine output closely, following electrolytes and repleting potassium and magnesium as needed, continuing home spironolactone, and rate control for atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response.

   Ca s/p CyberKnife therapy, p/w 20-pound weight gain x2 weeks and
   progressively worsening SOB and DOE, found to be in A-fib w/ RVR in the
   ED, hypotensive, and hypoxic.
   .
   #. PUMP: Acute on chronic dCHF (LVH and EF 75%). Has been urinating
   well on Lasix gtt with improvement in volume status. TTE here showed EF
   70-75%, markedly dilated RV w/ moderate global HK, preserved LV
   regional and global systolic function, severe diastolic dysfunction,
   moderate to severe pulmonary HTN.
   - continue Lasix gtt given hypotension and mild ARF
   - titrate gtt to goal 1-1.5 L net negative daily; plan for total 3-4 L
   diuresis
   - monitor UOP closely
   - follow lytes [**Hospital1 **] and replete K/Mg PRN
   - continue home spironolactone
   - continue rate control for A-Fib/RVR as above
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt w/ chronic atrial fibrillation, presented with RVR and
   hypotension.  Anticoagulated with supratherapeutic INR.  Now s/p
   diltiazem and esmolol drips on PO diltiazem and metoprolol with HR
   90-100.  Low TSH suggests probable contribution from thyrotoxicity
   likely from CyberKnife therapy to thyroid cancer.
   - increase PO diltiazem to 60 mg qid for better rate control
   - continue metoprolol 225 mg
   - hold Coumadin for anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD.

   # HYPOTENSION:  Presented with hypotension, likely [**1-15**] poor forward
   flow from acute on chronic diastolic CHF and A-Fib/RVR, now much
   improved with rate control and diuresis. Random cortisol >20 reassuring
   for no adrenal insufficiency.  Low suspicion for sepsis.  Now low
   normal BP with normal mentation.
   - monitor BP carefully during diuresis
   - rate control of a-fib as above
   .
   # HYPOXIA: Likely [**1-15**] pulmonary edema from worsening diastolic CHF [**1-15**]
   A-Fib/RVR. Will likely improve with HR control and diuresis. Also
   probable contribution from severe pulmonary hypertension.  Prelim read
   no PE on CTA.
   - wean supplemental O2 as tolerated
   - continue diuresis as above for CHF
   - continue rate control as above for A-Fib/RVR
   - f/u formal result of Chest CTA

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer. She presented with worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, and hypoxia. She is currently in the ICU for acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, delirium/confusion, atrial fibrillation, and hypotension. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 96/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. She has a large multinodular mass in the thyroid area and an irregularly irregular heart rhythm. Her labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's urine output is low, and her electrolytes indicate prerenal physiology. This could be due to poor forward flow from atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient may have metabolic alkalosis due to diuretic use, particularly Lasix.
3. Hypotension: The patient presented with hypotension, which could be due to poor forward flow from acute on chronic di"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), and metastatic thyroid cancer status post CyberKnife therapy. She presented with symptoms of worsening shortness of breath (SOB) and exertional dyspnea (DOE), found to be in AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the emergency department. She was hypotensive and hypoxic.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic diastolic CHF, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 70-75%, markedly dilated right ventricle (RV) with moderate global hypokinesis (HK), preserved left ventricular (LV) regional and global systolic function, severe diastolic dysfunction, and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.

The patient is currently receiving lasix gtt for diuresis, with a goal of 1-1.5 L net negative daily. Her urine output (UOP) is being closely monitored. Her electrolytes are being followed and repleted as needed, and she continues to take home spironolactone. Rate control measures are in place for AFib/RVR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's chronic heart failure may worsen due to the acute exacerbation caused by diastolic dysfunction and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer. She presented with symptoms of worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is also hypoxic and hypotensive. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, likely due to her underlying severe diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. She has been started on diuretics to improve volume status and reduce pulmonary congestion. Her blood pressure and renal function are improving with the diuretic therapy. 

She also has metabolic alkalosis, likely caused by the diuretic therapy. Close monitoring of electrolytes is required. 

The patient's hypoxia is improving with rate control of the atrial fibrillation and diuretic therapy. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism on computed tomography angiography. 

Her acute renal failure is improving with the rate control and diuretic therapy. Urine electrolytes suggest a prerenal physiology. 

The patient's diabetes is being managed with insulin for glycemic control. 

The patient has Crohn's disease and is continuing her home medications for it.
