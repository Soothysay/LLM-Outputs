   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo M with metastatic prostate cancer on clinical trial drug a past
   history of CAD, CHF EF 45%, anemia, presenting with fatigue and DOE x 1
   week, now with hypoxia and resolved hypotension.
   .
   #. HYPOTENSION:  Resolved.  Patient
s SBP have ranged between 90-100s.
   Unclear etiology in patient with known CHF, 3 vessel CAD, metastatic
   cancer and known DVT/PE. Patient denies any fevers or chills, however
   infection remains in differential as this could be early sepsis.
   Suspect CHF vs early sepsis are most likely etiologies in this case.
   -- Blood cultures
   -- Urine cultures.
   -- Chest X-ray
   -- Would consider CTA chest to r/o new PE, although less likely in
   setting of therapeutic anticoagulation
   -- MAP > 55, if continues to be hypotensive will need CVL
   -- Would treat CHF with lasix gtt to avoid hypotension
   .
   #. HYPOXIA: Differential diagnosis in this gentleman includes CHF
   exacerbation, early sepsis, recurrent PE. Patient in randomized study
   including Taxotere which has reported cardiomyopathy as a toxicity;
   given underlying EF of 45% would also consider primary cardiac event,
   dietary indiscretion and exacerbation secondary to anemia. Patient
   received 1 unit of PRBC and > 1L IV fluids in ED, which is likely
   worsening his overload.
   -- CXR from earlier with volume overload, repeat now with
   decompensation.
   -- Currently stable on 65% high flow mask
   -- Diuresis as above
   -- If unable to maintain O2 sat > 92, consider BIPAP
   .
   #. INFERIOR ST CHANGES: Like in the setting of demand ischemia and
   known CAD. lack of bradycardia does not correlate well with active
   inferior iscemia, cardiac biomarkers minimally elevated
   -- Transfuse > 25
   -- Treat CHF exacerbation as above
   -- Continue aspirin, ACE for forward flow
   .
   #. METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER: Currently on experimental therapy, no
   plans for inpatient treatment.
   .
   #. CHRONIC PAIN: Will continue opiated for bone mets with caution given
   recent hypotension
   .
   #. ANEMIA: Likely in setting of malignancy.  Patient received 1u PRBCs
   and HCT did not respond.
   -- Recheck Hct, goal > 25
   .
   #. DM 2: Insulin sliding scale while critically ill
   -- Hold oral agents
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (CHF) ejection fraction 45%, and anemia. He presented with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion for one week, and now has hypotension and hypoxia. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but he is experiencing bibasilar crackles in his lungs and a systolic crescendo decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and troponin levels, with other values being within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HYPOTENSION: The patient's blood pressure has been ranging between 90-100 mmHg. The etiology is unclear, considering his known CHF, 3-vessel CAD, metastatic cancer, and previous DVT/PE. Infection remains a possibility, as it could be early sepsis. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of hypotension.

2. HYPOXIA: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% on a high-flow mask. Differential diagnoses include CHF exacerbation, early sepsis, recurrent PE, dietary indiscretion, and exacerbation secondary to anemia. The patient received a blood transfusion and intravenous fluids in the emergency department, which may have worsened his overload.

   has reported cardiomyopathy as a toxicity and patient is also on
   Prednisone.  Patient with a II/VI SEM, however echo one year ago had no
   evidence of AS.  [**Month (only) 51**] be flow murmur.  Suspect that increased sodium
   retention from steroids +/- toxicity from Taxotere may be the etiology
   of patient
s CHF.  Prior echo with +1 MR and +1 AR.
   -- Echo today to assess cardiac function
   -- Would consider CTA chest to r/o new PE (if patient worsens),
   although less likely in setting of therapeutic anticoagulation
   - d/c lasix gtt, monitor UOP
 goal 500cc -1L negative.

   #. Hypotension:  Resolved.  Likely secondary to lasix bolus that
   patient received last night on admission.  Less likely to be related to
   sepsis as patient afebrile and has no Leukocytosis.
   - f/u Blood cultures
   -f/u Urine cultures.
   #. CAD: ST changes likely in the setting of demand ischemia and known
   CAD. lack of bradycardia does not correlate well with active inferior

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 45%, and anemia. He presents with fatigue, dyspnea on exertion (DOE), hypotension, and hypoxia.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 91/47 mmHg, heart rate of 86 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on high-flow nasal cannula. His temperature is within normal range. The patient has received a total of 20 mL of fluids and has lost 750 mL of urine output over the past 24 hours.

On physical examination, the patient appears pleasant and well-appearing, with mild conjunctival pallor but no other significant findings. His cardiac examination reveals a regular rhythm with a normal rate, along with a II/VI systolic crescendo decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border and a low-pitched systolic murmur at the heart base. There is also evidence of bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation. The patient's abdomen is soft, nontender, and non-distended, with no hepatosplenomegaly or peripheral edema. Neurological examination is grossly intact, with preserved sensation and 5/5 strength throughout.

   73 yo M with metastatic prostate cancer on clinical trial drug a past
   history of CAD, CHF EF 45%, anemia, presenting with fatigue and DOE x 1
   week, now with hypotension and hypoxia.
   .
   #. HYPOTENSION: Unclear etiology in patient with known CHF, 3 vessel
   CAD, metastatic cancer and known DVT/PE. Patient denies any fevers or
   chills, however infection remains in differential as this could be
   early sepsis. Suspect CHF vs early sepsis are most likely etiologies in
   this case.
   -- Blood cultures
   -- Urine cultures.
   -- Chest X-ray
   -- Would consider CTA chest to r/o new PE, although less likely in
   setting of therapeutic anticoagulation
   -- MAP > 55, if continues to be hypotensive will need CVL
   -- Would treat CHF with lasix gtt to avoid hypotension
   .
   #. HYPOXIA: Differential diagnosis in this gentleman includes CHF
   exacerbation, early sepsis, recurrent PE. Patient in randomized study
   including Taxotere which has reported cardiomyopathy as a toxicity;
   given underlying EF of 45% would also consider primary cardiac event,
   dietary indiscretion and exacerbation secondary to anemia. Patient
   received 1 unit of PRBC and > 1L IV fluids in ED, which is likely
   worsening his overload.
   -- CXR from earlier with volume overload, repeat now with
   decompensation.
   -- Currently stable on 65% high flow mask
   -- Diuresis as above
   -- If unable to maintain O2 sat > 92, consider BIPAP
   .
   #. INFERIOR ST CHANGES: Like in the setting of demand ischemia and
   known CAD. lack of bradycardia does not correlate well with active
   inferior iscemia, cardiac biomarkers minimally elevated
   -- Transfuse > 25

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 45%, and anemia. He presents with fatigue, dyspnea on exertion (DOE) for one week, hypotension, and hypoxia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/47 mmHg to 83/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild conjunctival pallor, bibasilar crackles in the lungs, and a regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. There is also a II/VI systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border and a low-pitched systolic murmur at the heart base. The patient's neurologic examination is grossly intact with preserved sensation, 5/5 strength, and equal deep tendon reflexes. His abdomen is soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly. The skin is clear, and he has 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.7 K"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, hypotension, and hypoxia. The hypotension and hypoxia are likely related to pulmonary edema, possibly non-cardiogenic in origin. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). There is an unclear etiology for the hypotension, with possibilities including CHF, early sepsis, recurrent PE, and dietary indiscretion. The patient's oxygen saturation is stable on a high flow mask, and diuresis is being used to manage CHF. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to CHF exacerbation, early sepsis, or recurrent PE. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate interventions such as diuretics, fluids, and vasopressors may be necessary.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia could be due to CHF exacerbation, sepsis, recurrent PE, or dietary indiscretion. Oxygen supplementation through a high flow mask or mechanical ventilation may be required. Chest X-ray and further investigations are needed to determine the cause.
3. Inferior ST changes: The patient has inferior ST changes, which could indicate demand ischemia or a cardiac event. Cardiac biomarkers are minimally elevated. Close"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer, presenting with hypotension and hypoxia. The patient has known congestive heart failure (CHF), three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD), and deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and more than 1 liter of intravenous fluids in the emergency department, which is likely worsening his overload. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 87/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient has a first-degree atrioventricular block and is receiving furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 3 mg/hour.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal cardiovascular examination. However, the patient has evidence of pulmonary edema with crackles bilaterally on lung auscultation. The patient's extremities are warm and well-perfused, with trace edema bilaterally. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, presenting with hypotension and hypoxemia. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE). The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, with an abnormal heart rhythm. The patient is receiving diuretic therapy and has received a blood transfusion. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated cardiac biomarkers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels may result in tissue hypoxia and compromise various organ functions.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and findings on physical examination suggest pulmonary edema, which can be caused by CHF or non-cardiogenic causes.
4. CHF Exacerbation: Given the patient's history of CHF, the current presentation could be due to an exacerbation of CHF, leading to fluid overload and compromised cardiac function.
5. Early Sepsis: The patient's presentation could also be indicative of early sepsis, characterized by infection and systemic inflammatory response.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer. He has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxemia and remains on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/45 to 114/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is experiencing recurrent hypotension, possibly related to net diuresis and underlying cardiomyopathy. There is also evidence of pulmonary edema, which is likely non-cardiogenic in nature. The patient's cardiac biomarkers are minimally elevated, indicating a concern for ischemia rather than an acute myocardial infarction. 

Other notable findings include anemia, elevated INR, and chronic pain from bone metastases. The patient's chronic pain management should be done with caution due to recent hypotension. Additionally, the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and requires insulin sliding scale while critically ill.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, morphine sulfate, and other ICU medications. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. 

The patient's review of systems is unremarkable except for fatigue and no fever or weight loss. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal heart sounds with no murmurs"

   O2 requirement improving. BP has been remaining stable. Cardiac enzymes
   negative x4 so unlikley ischemic event. No Hx of CHF so possibly fluid
   overload from prednisone given normal echo.
   - Repeat CXR
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Monitor I/O w/ goal negative 500cc
   - Continue ASA, statin
   #2 Hypotension: Resolved w/ fluid bolus, likely [**2-14**] overaggressive
   diuresis. Does not appear septic.
   - gentle diuresis
   - F/u blood urine cultures
   #3 Metastatic prostate CA: Per oncologist will stop study drug and
   taper prednisone.
   - Taper prednisone to 7.5mg QD
   #4Chronic pain: controlled on home regimen w/ some PRNs
   - continue current standing oxycodone plus PRN morphine
   #5 Anemia: Hct trending down slowly.
   - Transfuse one unit w/ goal Hct >25, tx w/ lasix
   #6 DMII: finger sticks have been well controlled on sliding scale,
   given decreasing steroid dose would not add standing insulin now.
   - SSI
   #7 Elevated INR: Has been off of warfarin at least two days, but
   warfarin can have delayed effect. Has not been getting any Abx. LFTs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of metastatic prostate cancer, presenting with acute pulmonary edema. The patient has received a lasix drip, and his condition has improved with stable blood pressure and oxygen requirements. The cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating that an ischemic event is unlikely. The patient's hypotension has resolved with a fluid bolus, and it is believed to be due to aggressive diuresis. 

The patient's metastatic prostate cancer treatment involves stopping study drugs and tapering prednisone. The patient's chronic pain is controlled on his home regimen, and he will continue with the same medication. The patient has anemia, with a hemoglobin concentration trending down slowly, and plans are made to transfuse one unit with a goal hemoglobin concentration greater than 25 and treat with lasix.

The patient also has diabetes mellitus type II, which is well-controlled on sliding scale insulin. There are no plans to add standing insulin at this time. The patient's elevated INR is being monitored due to recent discontinuation of warfarin, and it is noted that warfarin can have delayed effects. The patient's liver function tests are otherwise normal.

Potential medical complications that can arise include acute pulmonary edema, hypotension, anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and elevated INR. These conditions require close monitoring and appropriate management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo M w/ PMH of metastatic prostate CA p/w acute pulmonary  edema
   #1 Acute pulmonary edema:   Pt diuresed to total los 4.7 liters
   negative.  BP has been stable but generally runs in 80s-90s and
   assymptomatic. O2 requirement improving.  No Hx of CHF so possibly
   fluid overload from prednisone given normal echo.
   - diurese to 500cc negative today given lasix 10 IV x1
   #2 Hypotension: Resolved w/ fluid bolus, likely [**2-14**] overaggressive
   diuresis. Does not appear septic.
   -BP has been stable but generally runs in 80s-90s and assymptomatic.
   WBC continue to trend down.
   - F/u blood cx, urine cx has no growth
   #3 Metastatic prostate CA: Per oncologist will stop study drug and
   taper prednisone.
   - Taper prednisone to 7.5mg QD
   #4Chronic pain: controlled on home regimen w/ some PRNs
   - continue current standing oxycodone plus PRN morphine
   #5 Anemia: Hct trending down slowly. Got one unit HCT now stable.
   #6 DMII: finger sticks have been well controlled on sliding scale,
   given decreasing steroid dose would not add standing insulin now.
   - SSI
   #7 Elevated INR: Has been off of warfarin at least3 days, but warfarin
   can have delayed effect. Has not been getting any Abx. LFTs otherwise
   normal.
   - Trend INR

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 45%), anemia, and is currently presenting with fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, hypotension, and hypoxia. 

The patient has been transfused with one unit of blood and diuresed a total of 621cc. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction is noted to be 45%. Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), while the white blood cell count (WBC) is within normal limits. The patient's electrolyte levels, including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO43-) are also within normal ranges.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and the arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH level of 7.27. Physical examination reveals a murmur at the right upper sternal border, CT abnormalities posteriorly, and no peripheral edema or distal pulse abnormalities.

The patient's medical history includes metastatic prostate cancer, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, anemia, chronic pain, diabetes mellitus type II, and elevated INR. The patient is currently on several medications including heparin sodium,"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo M w/ PMH of metastatic prostate CA p/w acute pulmonary  edema
   #1 Acute pulmonary edema: Pt. diuresing well now 5L negative for LOS.
   O2 requirement improving. BP has been remaining stable. Cardiac enzymes
   negative x4 so unlikley ischemic event. No Hx of CHF so possibly fluid
   overload from prednisone given normal echo.
   - Repeat CXR
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Monitor I/O w/ goal negative 500cc
   - Continue ASA, statin
   #2 Hypotension: Resolved w/ fluid bolus, likely [**2-14**] overaggressive
   diuresis. Does not appear septic.
   - gentle diuresis
   - F/u blood urine cultures
   #3 Metastatic prostate CA: Per oncologist will stop study drug and
   taper prednisone.
   - Taper prednisone to 7.5mg QD
   #4Chronic pain: controlled on home regimen w/ some PRNs
   - continue current standing oxycodone plus PRN morphine
   #5 Anemia: Hct trending down slowly.
   - Transfuse one unit w/ goal Hct >25, tx w/ lasix
   #6 DMII: finger sticks have been well controlled on sliding scale,
   given decreasing steroid dose would not add standing insulin now.
   - SSI
   #7 Elevated INR: Has been off of warfarin at least two days, but
   warfarin can have delayed effect. Has not been getting any Abx. LFTs
   otherwise normal.
   - Trend INR
   PPx: INR remains elevated anticoagulated, bowel regimen

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 45%, and anemia. He presented with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion for one week, now experiencing hypotension and hypoxia. The patient received a unit of transfused blood and diuresed negative 621cc. His LFTs were normal, but his INR is still elevated off coumadin. He requires a noncontrast CT chest when transferred back to the floor. He is on various ICU medications, including heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, and furosemide. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the current symptoms. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 77 bpm (72-79 bpm), blood pressure of 90/36 mmHg (83/36-107/53 mmHg), respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute (11-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96% on 4 liters of nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination was not fully assessed. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal troponin-T levels. The patient's assessment includes acute pulmonary edema"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yom  metastatic prostate cancer now with pulmonary edema.
   HYPOTENSION -- Recurrent; possibly related to net diuresis.  Underlying
   cardiomyopathy.   Improved.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- Continue net direusis with lasix gtt  goal (-) 1 to
   1.5 liters.  Improved.  Continue net diuresis with iv lasix.
   HYPOXIA
 likely pulmonary edema, suspect CHF exacerbation,
   precipitated by study drug effect (Taxotere reported cardiomyopathy as
   a toxicity).  Plan diuresis as above, goal (-) 1 to 1.5 liters
   ECG ABNORMALITIES -- inferior ST changes, but cardiac biomarkers
   minimally elevated.  No evidence for acute MI, but concern for
   ischemia.  Plan transfuse > 27, Rx CHF, continue ASA ACE
   METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER -- Hold on experimental therapy.
   ELEVATED INR -- off coumadin; possible drug-drug interactions, low flow
   state (CFH);  check LFTs.  HOld coumadin.  Consider reversal if
   continues to rise.
   CHRONIC PAIN -- Continue opiates for bone mets with caution given
   recent hypotension
   ANEMIA: Likely in setting of malignancy.  Hct goal > 27
   NIDDM -- Insulin sliding scale.
   FEN --  Resume PO.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of CABG (coronary artery bypass graft), DVT (deep vein thrombosis), and metastatic prostate cancer. He presents with a flare-up of congestive heart failure (CHF) likely due to his experimental chemotherapy drugs. He received a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and was diuresed, with subsequent weaning of oxygen therapy to 4 liters. The patient did well overnight.

1. HYPOTENSION (RESOLVED): The patient had an episode of hypotension, which has since resolved.
2. HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE: The patient's CHF symptoms have not fully resolved, as evidenced by ongoing volume overload on examination. Diuretic therapy with IV lasix will be continued.
3. CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), PROSTATE: The patient's oncology team will reassess his chemotherapy regimen in light of the recent CHF flare-up.

Other Findings:
- The patient has a fever with a maximum temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F) and a current temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F).
- His heart rhythm is a first-degree AV block.
- His respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, maintaining a SpO2 of 94%. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and metastatic prostate cancer. He presents with a congestive heart failure flare likely due to his experimental chemotherapy drugs. The patient has been transfused one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and diuresed, with oxygen weaning to 4 liters. His overall condition was well last night.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low at 97/49 mmHg, indicating hypotension. This may be a result of fluid overload or an adverse effect of the experimental chemotherapy drugs.
2. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic, Acute: The patient is still volume overloaded on examination, indicating ongoing heart failure. Diuretics will be continued to manage this condition.
3. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm), Prostate: The patient's metastatic prostate cancer requires further evaluation and treatment by the oncology team regarding the chemotherapy regimen.
4. Respiratory Support: The patient is on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula with a SpO2 of 94%. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels is necessary.
5. Fluid Balance: The patient has received a total of 1,639 mL of fluids since midnight, including 1,000 mL of intravenous fluids. His urine output has been 2"
