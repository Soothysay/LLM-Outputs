   Chief Complaint: 69 y.o. man w/ multiple myeloma, amyloidosis with
   nephrotic syndrome and renal failure, transferred to ICU for
   hypotension in setting of pneumonia, possible colitis, and BRBPR.
   24 Hour Events:
 PICC LINE - START [**2168-1-11**] 04:00 PM
 EKG - At [**2168-1-12**] 02:16 AM
   - Renal:  Mild Cr bump likely secondary to transient hypotension; no
   need for HD at this time.  Can use lasix 100mg IV x1 to see if responds
   to lasix if need to increase UOP.
   - Onc:  no chemo for now, consider head MRI for AMS, patient is
   high-risk for embolic events so high suspicion for embolic
   event/ischemic colitis
   - Surgery: likely ischemic colitis. Low threshold to take pt to OR for
   colectomy if develops worsening abdominal pain, clinically
   decompensates, etc.  IVF to maintain UOP. Serial exams. Antibx.
   - GI:  no colonoscopy b/c of bowel perf risk, repeat abd CT if
   decompensates
   - multiple episodes of hypotension overnight while sleeping to SBP of
   70s, asymptomatic and rose after patient awoken
   - transfused two units of blood

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y.o. man w/ multiple myeloma, amyloidosis with nephrotic syndrome
   and renal failure, transferred to ICU for hypotension in setting of
   pneumonia, possible colitis, and BRBPR.
   # Transverse colitis:  Likely ischemic colitis in setting of
   hypotension though other etiologies also on differential, including
   infectious colitis and c. diff.  Stool studies and c. diff toxin
   negative.  Lactate improving and patient no longer having BRBPR or
   abdominal pain.
   - continue NPO for today per surgery reccs
   - low threshold for OR if clinically decompensates per surgery
   - continue flagyl, cefepime, vancomycin, though dosing vancomycin by
   level
   - gentle IVF given volume overload in setting of renal failure and
   decreased urine output
   - will follow Hct and lactate q8h
   - will continue to send c. diff toxin assay when patient stools
   - f/u GI and surgery reccs
   #. Hypotension:  Hemodynamic instability was initial reason for [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   admission and patient continues to become hypotensive to SBP of 70s and
   MAP of 40s while sleeping.  Blood pressure responds promptly to waking
   patient/agitation but is not fluid responsive.  Differential includes
   amyloid neuropathy, fluid shifting in setting of colitis, sepsis given
   steroid use, and hypocortisolism given amyloid and elevated TSH.
   - transfuse for Hct<30
   - gentle IVF with sodium bicarb
   - follow-up a.m. cortisol
   - attempt agitation if hypotensive
   #.Acute Renal Failure: secondary to amyloidosis causing nephrotic
   syndrome. Albumin 1.6. Also with bence [**Doctor Last Name **] proteinuria.  Renal
   service is following, they recommend using lasix for peripheral edema,
   and administering IVF along with Lasix in setting of chemotherpay
   administration to minimize hemorrhagic cystitis.  Renal suggests trial
   of lasix 100 mg IV x 1 if concern for decreased UOP.
   -Bicarbonate po per renal
   - f/u renal reccs
   #.Transaminitis: occurred in setting of velcade administration during
   previous hospitalization in early [**Month (only) **]. Causes may include velcade
   toxicity, chronic hep B, or amyloid infiltration.
   -lamivudine
   #.Multiple Myeloma: Currently not receiving cytoxan in setting of
   colitis.  Holding velcade secondary to transaminitis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with multiple myeloma, amyloidosis with nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of pneumonia, possible colitis, and BRBPR. 

The patient has shown episodes of hypotension overnight while sleeping, but responds well after being awakened. He has received blood transfusions and is on various medications including Lasix, cefepime, vancomycin, and proton pump inhibitors.

The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal impairment. His white blood cell count is within normal range, but his platelet count is slightly low. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination findings include mild crepitation in the right lung base, no peripheral edema, and no abnormal neurological findings. He is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) per surgical recommendations.

The assessment and plan for the patient include:

1. Transverse colitis: The patient is suspected to have ischemic colitis due to hypotension, although other etiologies like infectious colitis and C. diff are also considered. Stool studies and C. diff toxin are negative. The patient will continue to be on flagyl, cefepime, and vancomycin, with vancomycin dosing adjusted by level. Gentle IVF will be given due to volume"

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure. He was transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of pneumonia, possible colitis, and BRBPR (blood-tinged stools with a red-black appearance).

The patient received a total of 2.5 liters of fluids overnight before being transferred. His blood pressure initially responded to boluses but then fell to systolic 80's shortly after. Potential causes for the hypotension include septic shock from pneumonia, gut flora translocation from colitis, or hypovolemia from BRBPR.

The patient has been placed on vanc, zosyn, and flagyl. Two peripheral IV lines have been inserted, and he is being given hct q8h (likely heparin). An active type and screen has been ordered, and a GI consult has been requested due to the possibility of bleeding from colitis, diverticulosis, or hemorrhoids.

Abdominal CT shows evidence of transverse colitis, which could be caused by infectious or ischemic factors. C. diff is negative, and stool cultures are pending.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, multiple myeloma, and renal failure from amyloidosis. The patient presented with fevers, left lower lobe infiltrate, cough, and was transferred to the ICU due to hypotension in the setting of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from transverse colitis. 

The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including hypotension, transverse colitis, acute renal failure, clonus/asterixis, transaminitis, and multiple myeloma. 

Hypotension may be due to hypovolemic shock from GI bleed or septic shock from colitis or possibly pneumonia (PNA) given the recent change in antibiotics. 

Transverse colitis is suspected to be caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection or other infectious etiologies. 

Acute renal failure is secondary to amyloidosis causing nephrotic syndrome and Bence Jones proteinuria. 

Clonus/asterixis may be caused by hypothyroidism, hypocalcemia, ammonia toxicity, or renal failure. 

Transaminitis may be medication-induced (velcade), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), amyloidosis, or chronic Hepatitis B. 

Multiple myeloma is also present and requires further management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple myeloma, and renal failure from amyloidosis. He presented with fevers, left lower lobe infiltrate, cough, hypotension, and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding due to transverse colitis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intermittent hypotension: Etiologies include hypovolemic shock from GI bleed or septic shock from colitis or possibly pneumonia given recent change in antibiotics. Possible autonomic instability.
2. Transverse/ischemic colitis: Etiologies include Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection or other infectious etiology. Superimposed ischemia with hypotension. Lactate levels are trending down.
3. Acute renal failure: Secondary to amyloidosis causing nephrotic syndrome. Also with Bence Jones proteinuria.
4. Transaminitis: Medically induced (bortezomib) vs non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) vs amyloidosis vs chronic Hepatitis B.
5. Multiple myeloma: Hold cytoxan today and follow-up oncology recommendations.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a more comprehensive analysis."

   infectious colitis and c. diff.  Stool studies and c. diff toxin
   negative.  Lactate improving and patient no longer having BRBPR or
   abdominal pain.
   - trial of clear diet today
   - continue flagyl, cefepime, vancomycin, though dosing vancomycin by
   level
   - antibiotics x 10-14 days per surgery
   - gentle IVF given volume overload in setting of renal failure and

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with multiple myeloma, amyloidosis with nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. He was transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of pneumonia, possible colitis, and blood in the stool (BRBPR). 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F)
- Heart Rate: 103 bpm
- Blood Pressure: 125/75 mmHg
- Respiratory Rate: 14 breaths per minute
- Oxygen Saturation: 96%

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance with no acute distress. His cardiovascular system is normal, and there are no peripheral vascular issues. His respiratory system shows no crackles or wheezes. The abdomen is soft with bowel sounds present. The extremities show 2+ pulses, and the skin is not assessed. Neurologically, the patient responds but movement, tone, and assessment are not evaluated.

Laboratory results indicate the following abnormalities:
- Hemoglobin: 11.0 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 26.6%
- White Blood Cell Count: 4.7 K/uL
- Platelet Count: 117 K/uL
- Creatinine: 4.3 mg/dL
- Glucose: 134 mg/dL
- Sodium: 138 mEq/L
- Potassium: 4.4 mEq/L
- Calcium: 6.7 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 5.4 mg/dL
- Lactate: 1.4 mmol/L

The patient's assessment and plan include several diagnoses:
1. Transverse colitis: The patient likely has ischemic colitis in the setting of hypotension. Other etiologies such as infectious colitis and Clostridium difficile are also considered, but stool studies and C. diff toxin are negative. The patient will be started on a trial of clear diet today.

2. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive, especially while sleeping, with a blood pressure of 70s systolic and 40s mean arterial pressure. The hypotension is not fluid-responsive. Differential diagnoses include amyloid neuropathy, fluid shifting in the setting of colitis, and sepsis due to steroid use. The patient's cortisol level is normal, ruling out hydrocortisolism. Management includes transfusion for hematocrit <30, gentle intravenous fluid administration with sodium bicarbonate, and considering a neurology consult to rule out amyloid neuropathy.

3. Acute renal failure: This is secondary to amyloidosis causing nephrotic syndrome. The patient's albumin level is low at 1.6, and there is Bence Jones protein"
