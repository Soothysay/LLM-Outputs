","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and tracheobronchomalacia, who was admitted for respiratory distress. She has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection and is experiencing anxiety, tachypnea, and labored breathing. Her vital signs are stable, but she has episodes of tachycardia. She is receiving various treatments including invasive ventilation, antibiotics, anxiolytics, and medications for her other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dependence on invasive ventilation indicate a risk of respiratory failure. The recent removal of Y-stent and history of multiple intubations contribute to her tracheobronchomalacia, which can compromise airway patency and increase the likelihood of respiratory failure.
2. Anxiety: The patient's frequent anxiety episodes could worsen her respiratory distress by causing increased intrathoracic pressure and upper airway collapse. Proper management of anxiety is crucial to prevent further respiratory complications.
3. C. difficile Infection: The patient's positive C. difficile test indicates an infection that requires treatment with antibiotics. However, the use of antibiotics can also disrupt the normal gut flora, increasing the risk of diarrhea and other gastrointestinal complications.
4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's elevated lipid levels pose a long-term risk for cardiovascular diseases. Appropriate management of hyperlipidemia should be continued in the ICU setting.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), tracheobronchomalacia from multiple intubations, and a recent metal stent placement at OSH that was removed two days ago. The patient was admitted for respiratory distress. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress with tachypnea and labored breathing. The chest X-ray did not show any new pulmonary nodules or infiltrates, and there is no fever or leukocytosis. The presence of wheezing may suggest a COPD exacerbation, but it could also be due to increased intrathoracic pressure causing upper airway collapse in a severely narrowed airway. 

The patient's anxiety may contribute to her respiratory distress, and she may benefit from increased PEEP to open up the upper airway. Anxiolytics such as zyprexa TID, Klonopin qhs, escitalopram qd, ativan, and fentanyl boluses PRN have been prescribed. 

The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection and will start receiving Flagyl PO tid for two weeks. 

There are also episodes of tachycardia, which may be related to anxiety or atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). Telemetry monitoring has been recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and tracheobronchomalacia. She was admitted for respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with anxiety, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Escherichia coli. She also has a history of COPD, diarrhea (C. diff positive), and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Respiratory distress due to tracheobronchomalacia and recent stent removal.
   - Possible exacerbation of COPD leading to increased difficulty in breathing.

2. Cardiovascular Complications:
   - Tachycardia episodes that may be related to anxiety or arrhythmias such as AVNRT.

3. Gastrointestinal Complications:
   - Diarrhea caused by C. difficile infection.
   - Risk of further gastrointestinal complications due to prolonged ICU stay and antibiotic use.

4. Infection-related Complications:
   - UTI caused by E. coli.
   - Risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

5. Metabolic Complications:
   - Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus requiring close monitoring and insulin therapy.

6. Allergic Reaction:
   - Rash developed after starting ciprofloxacin, indicating a possible drug allergy.

8. The patient's physical examination reveals tracheostomy in place, thick secretions being suctioned, tachycardia, no murmurs, and no rashes or lesions.
9. The patient's labs show normal results for WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, Glucose, and other electrolytes, but there is a slightly elevated potassium level.
10. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, mode of ventilation (MMV/PSV/AutoFlow), set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 8 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 31 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:
1. Respiratory distress due to tracheobronchomalacia and potential exacerbation of COPD.
2. C. difficile infection with associated diarrhea and risk of severe colitis or sepsis.
3. Drug allergies, particularly to ceftriaxone and propofol, which may limit future medication options.
4. Tachycardia, which may be due to anxiety or an underlying cardiac condition.
5. Hyperglycemia or hypoglyc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, and tracheobronchomalacia. She was admitted for respiratory distress, which responded well to anti-anxiety treatment and PEEP. She has a history of multiple intubations and recent removal of Y-stent. The patient's current condition includes tachypnea and labored breathing, but her chest X-ray shows no new pneumonia, and she does not have a fever or leukocytosis. There is a possibility of COPD exacerbation, but the patient may also be experiencing increased intrathoracic pressure causing upper airway collapse. The patient is frequently anxious and requires close monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing tachypnea and labored breathing, which could worsen if not properly managed. There is a possibility of COPD exacerbation or further collapse of the upper airway due to increased intrathoracic pressure.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is showing signs of feeling the need to urinate, indicating a potential UTI. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary based on the culture results.
3. Rash: The patient developed a fine papular rash on her arms and chest after taking Cipro, suggesting an allergic reaction to the medication. Alternative antibiotics may be needed.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has experienced brief episodes of tachycardia,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), tracheobronchomalacia from multiple intubations, and recent removal of Y-stent placement admitted for respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and is currently on maximum PPI therapy, Bactrim for E. coli UTI, and weaning PEEP down to 8 cmH2O.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's tracheobronchomalacia and recent stent removal, there is a risk of further airway collapse or obstruction, leading to worsening respiratory distress and potential need for reintubation.
2. UTI: The patient has an active urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli, which needs to be managed appropriately to prevent the progression of the infection.
3. Anxiety: The patient frequently displays signs of anxiety, which may contribute to tachypnea and increased intrathoracic pressure, potentially leading to upper airway collapse.
4. Diarrhea/C.diff positive: The patient has a history of diarrhea and tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C.diff). Continuing with the prescribed course of Flagyl is essential to treat the infection.
5. COPD exacerbation: The patient's symptoms may be suggestive of a COPD exacerbation, and appropriate management should be continued to improve lung"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and tracheobronchomalacia from multiple intubations. The patient was admitted for respiratory distress and had a recent removal of Y-stent two days ago.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, anxiety, urinary tract infection (UTI), tachycardia, diarrhea with a positive Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and COPD exacerbation. The patient is also diagnosed with hyperlipidemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate ranging from 56 to 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84 to 129 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics for the UTI, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for tracheobronchomalacia, sedatives and anxiolytics for anxiety, and other medications for COPD, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the patient does not tolerate the weaning of PEEP, development of new infections due to immunocompromised state, exacerbation of COPD if not adequately managed, and potential complications related to diabetes and hypertension management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tracheobronchomalacia, and previous metal stent placement. She was admitted for respiratory distress and responded well to anti-anxiety treatment and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient has multiple medical conditions including diabetes, hypertension, tracheobronchomalacia, and recent removal of Y-stent. She is currently experiencing respiratory distress, which is being managed with PEEP titration, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and anxiolytics. The patient is also being treated for Clostridium difficile infection, urinary tract infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and has a history of anxiety, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress due to tracheobronchomalacia. This condition can lead to airway collapse and difficulty in breathing. The management plan includes PEEP titration, speaking on the ventilator with cuff deflation, and using a Passy-Muir valve.
2. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection and is being treated with Flagyl. If left untreated or inadequately treated, this infection can lead to severe diarrhea and dehydration.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is experiencing symptoms suggestive of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, tracheobronchomalacia, and recent stent placement. She was admitted for respiratory distress and responded well to anti-anxiety treatment and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). She remains ventilator-dependent due to acute/chronic respiratory failure with severe tracheobronchomalacia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 102/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She has been treated for a pansensitive E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI) with Bactrim and will continue the treatment for 7 days. A Foley catheter was changed, and she is also being treated for Clostridium difficile infection with Flagyl for 2 weeks. She has been started on a pulmonary nutrition regimen. The patient's code status is full code, and she is being screened for long-term acute care placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe tracheobronchomalacia and acute/chronic respiratory failure may lead to further respiratory failure if adequate ventilation and oxygenation are not maintained.
2. UTI: Although the patient has been treated for the UTI, there is a risk of complications such as sepsis or pyelonephritis if"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and tracheobronchomalacia who was admitted for respiratory distress. She has been diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI), anxiety, and acute respiratory failure not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has undergone multiple intubations and recently had a metal stent placed at OSH, followed by the removal of a Y-stent two days ago. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 8, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate (HR) of 67 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 116/83 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. The patient has a history of COPD, for which she is receiving albuterol and ipratropium every 6 hours. She also has hyperlipidemia and is on a statin. The patient's recent labs show an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 16.0 K/uL, with neutrophils accounting for 77.9%, lymphocytes for 19.3%, and monocytes for 2.5%. Her creatinine (Cr) level is elevated at 1."

She was admitted for respiratory distress and responded well to anti-anxiety treatment and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient's current issues include respiratory distress, urinary tract infection (UTI), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, tachycardia, anxiety, and possible COPD exacerbation. She is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, anti-anxiety drugs, and insulin for diabetes management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 77 to 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 114/72 to 138/126 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 28 to 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is intubated through a tracheostomy tube and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 8 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen due to tracheobronchomalacia, which can lead to airway collapse and inadequate oxygenation.
2. UTI: The patient has a confirmed UTI caused by Acinito bacter, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) from multiple intubations. She was admitted for respiratory distress.
- She responded well to anti-anxiety treatment and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
- The patient remains ventilator-dependent due to acute/chronic respiratory failure with severe TBM.
- Sputum culture grew Acinetobacter, and she is being treated with Bactrim for two weeks.
- She is also on Flagyl for Clostridium difficile infection.
- The plan is to discharge the patient to a rehabilitation facility tomorrow.
- The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's severe TBM and acute/chronic respiratory failure may lead to ongoing respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and ventilator settings is necessary.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of sputum culture and adherence to weaning protocols are important to prevent this complication.
3. Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI): The patient is being treated with Flagyl for CDI. Monitoring for symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever is essential to ensure effective treatment and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tracheobronchomalacia, and recent metal stent placement, is admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with anxiety and is currently experiencing tachypnea and labored breathing. The chest X-ray shows no new pneumonia, and there is no fever or leukocytosis present. The wheezing may be suggestive of a COPD exacerbation or anxiety-induced tachypnea causing upper airway collapse in the already severely narrowed airway.

The patient has a positive culture for Acinetobacter baumannii complex, which is resistant to many antibiotics except for tobramycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The patient has also tested positive for Clostridium difficile in the stool and Escherichia coli in the urine.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and various other medications for anxiety, panic attacks, and COPD exacerbation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 116/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16"

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and tracheobronchomalacia. She was admitted for respiratory distress and has a history of recent metal stent placement at OSH and removal of Y-stent two days ago. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing tachypnea and labored breathing. The chest X-ray shows no new pneumonia, and there is no fever or leukocytosis. However, wheezing may indicate a COPD exacerbation or anxiety-induced upper airway collapse due to increased intrathoracic pressure.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine culture for Escherichia coli, which is resistant to several antibiotics including ciprofloxacin. She has been started on bactrim for treatment.

3. Diarrhea/Clostridium difficile (C. diff) positive: The patient tested positive for C. diff on stool culture. Treatment with flagyl will be continued for 7 days after completing bactrim.

4. Anxiety: The patient is frequently anxious, which may contribute to respiratory distress. Medications such as alprazolam, ativan (PRN), zyprexa (TID), and escitalopram (qd) have been prescribed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tracheobronchomalacia, and recent removal of a Y-stent. She was admitted for respiratory distress, which is attributed to her tracheobronchomalacia. The patient's current medications include PPI, alprazolam, ativan, zyprexa, escitalopram, MSIR, bactrim, flagyl, cipro, glargine, and SSI. She is being treated for an Acinetobacter infection with bactrim and has a positive C. diff stool culture. The patient's recent lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly low Hct, and normal platelet count. Imaging reveals bilateral pleural effusion and areas of opacity in the right lung, indicating possible pneumonia. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube with MMV/PSV/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 8, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and ABG results of ///33/. The patient's physical examination reveals abdominal breathing, expiratory wheezing, coarse breath sounds, and a distended abdomen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), tracheobronchomalacia, and has undergone metal stent placement at OSH with recent removal of Y-stent. The patient was admitted for respiratory distress and responded well to anti-anxiety treatment and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient may experience further episodes of respiratory distress due to tracheobronchomalacia. The plan is to titrate PEEP to open up the upper airway and monitor the patient's response.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has sputum with acinito bacter, indicating a possible UTI. Bactrim DS will be given for 14 days to treat the infection.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: As the patient will be treated with Bactrim, there is a risk of developing C. diff infection. Flagyl will be started three times daily for 3 weeks to prevent and treat this infection.

4. Tachycardia: The patient experienced brief episodes of tachycardia, which could be due to anxiety or another cause. Sinus tachycardia is currently present, and the patient will be monitored on telemetry.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and tracheobronchomalacia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and has since responded well to anti-anxiety treatment and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Her sputum culture grew Acinetobacter, which is sensitive to Bactrim. The patient remains ventilator-dependent due to acute/chronic respiratory failure with severe tracheobronchomalacia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. Her oxygen saturation is at 98%. Her lungs are clear, and there are no new changes on her chest X-ray. The plan is to treat her with Bactrim for two weeks, which will also cover the pan-sensitive Escherichia coli urinary tract infection. She will also be started on Flagyl for Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is expected to be discharged to an outpatient facility tomorrow morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe tracheobronchomalacia and acute/chronic respiratory failure may continue to pose a risk for respiratory failure, especially if she remains ventilator-dependent.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, tracheobronchomalacia, and recent removal of a Y-stent. She was admitted for respiratory distress and has been diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI), anxiety, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS). The patient's respiratory distress is characterized by tachypnea and labored breathing, but there are no signs of pneumonia, fever, or leukocytosis. Wheezing may indicate a COPD exacerbation or anxiety-related symptoms. The patient is frequently anxious, as reported by the IP.

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and management of ventilation parameters.
2. UTI: The patient has a UTI, which needs to be treated with appropriate antibiotics. The current medication being used is Bactrim.
3. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety should be addressed with continued use of alprazolam, ativan PRN, zyprexa TID, and escitalopram qd.
4. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has tracheobronchomalacia, and ongoing management includes increasing PEEP to open up the upper airway, continuing proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and considering stent placement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, tracheobronchomalacia, and recent removal of Y-stent. She was admitted for respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI), anxiety, and acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. She is on mechanical ventilation support and has a tracheostomy tube in place.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation support. There is a concern about tracheobronchomalacia leading to upper airway collapse due to increased intrathoracic pressure. The plan is to increase PEEP to open up the upper airway and continue monitoring.

2. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection, initially treated with ciprofloxacin but developed a rash. She is currently on bactrim and will be treated for Acinetobacter.

3. Diarrhea/C.diff positive: The patient has diarrhea and tested positive for Clostridium difficile. She will continue taking flagyl for 7 days after completing bactrim.

4. Tachycardia: The patient had episodes of tachycardia, ranging from 100 to 180 beats per minute. It is unclear whether it is due to anxiety or a cardiac arrhythmia like AVNRT. Telemetry monitoring will be continued.

5. COPD exacerbation: The patient may have a COPD exacerbation, indicated by wheezing. She is receiving albuterol and ipratropium every 6 hours.

6. Diabetes management: The patient's diabetes medication regimen will be continued as per home regimen.

7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's statin medication for hyperlipidemia will be continued.

Other ICU Care:
The patient is receiving nutrition through Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 40 mL/hour. Prophylactic measures include low molecular weight heparin for DVT prevention and proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is transfer to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), tracheobronchomalacia (TBM), and recent stent placement in the trachea. She was admitted for respiratory distress and responded well to anti-anxiety treatment and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 100s and blood pressure within normal limits. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, set at CPAP/PPS mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's respiratory distress has improved, and her sputum culture revealed Acinito bacter, for which she is being treated with Bactrim DS for two weeks. She is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics due to her risk factors for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient's laboratory results show normal values for white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), glucose, electrolytes, and other parameters. Her recent blood cultures were negative. The patient's anxiety has been managed with anxiolytics such as Zyprexa, Xanax, and lor"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, tracheobronchomalacia, and previous stent placements. She was admitted for respiratory distress and responded well to anti-anxiety treatment and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory distress, possible Clostridium difficile infection, tachycardia, urinary tract infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress due to tracheobronchomalacia. Close monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and respiratory support measures such as PEEP and CPAP/PPS mode on the ventilator will be necessary.
2. Clostridium difficile Infection (C.diff): The patient's recent antibiotic use and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of C.diff infection. Prophylactic treatment with Flagyl should be initiated to prevent or treat the infection.
3. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing episodes of tachycardia, which may be due to anxiety or another underlying cause. Continuous monitoring on telemetry is recommended, and further evaluation may be needed to determine the exact cause.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is being treated for a UTI with Bactrim for 14 days. Regular monitoring of urine output and"
