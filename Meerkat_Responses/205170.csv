","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, embolic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and other comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU due to lethargy likely secondary to an infectious source. 

The patient initially presented with septic shock, which has since resolved. He had leukocytosis, tachypnea, elevated lactate levels, and hypotension. The source of infection was likely pneumonia, as indicated by chest x-ray findings and purulent sputum. Cultures were sent in the emergency department.

The patient also had acute mental status changes (AMS) likely secondary to infection, acute renal failure likely secondary to hypotension/septic shock, and hypertension. These conditions have since resolved.

The patient has a history of CVAs, including bilateral embolic cerebellar and hemorrhagic left thalamic strokes. He is currently on simvastatin, anticoagulated with Plavix, and taking baclofen for contractures.

Other medical issues include type II diabetes mellitus, chronic constipation, dysphagia, depression, hypothyroidism, and a history of DVT. His medications have been adjusted accordingly.

The patient has been intubated and received mechanical ventilation. He has an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and a nasoga"

   This is a 62 yo M with PMH of HTN, type 2 DM, embolic and hemorrhagic
   CVA, and history of DVT who presents with lethargy likely secondary to

   .
   # Septic Shock:  Pt has leukocytosis, tachypnea, elevated lactate,
   hypotension however not tachycardic, but suggestive of septic shock.
   Source likely pneumonia given chest x-ray and purulent sputum.  Other
   possible source could be C diff given foul smelling stool, however no
   recent antibiotic use.  Cultures sent in ED.  If patient's mental
   status worsens or worsens clinically consider LP to rule out
   meningitis, although very unlikely.
   - Follow cultures, reculture if spikes
   - Send C diff toxin
   - Legionella antigen
   - Check for flu, place on precautions until negative
   - Continue antibiotics, however will narrow to Vanc/Zosyn for possible
   HAP and continue Flagyl PO for possible C diff until negative toxin.
   - Goal directed therapy, follow CVP with goal [**7-31**], with fluids and
   pressors as needed goal MAP > 65, UOP 30cc/hr
   - Continue mechanical ventilation for airway protection
   .
   # AMS:  Likely secondary to infection, however given history of CVA's
   could be seizure activity.  Will monitor for signs of seizure activity,
   will get EEG if evidence of seizures.  No sign of acute hemorrhage or
   stroke by head CT today.  As above consider LP if mental status
   worsens.
   - Hold sedating medications including oral morphine, gabapentin,
   mirtazapine, however will continue baclofen and duloxetine given risk
   of withdrawal.
   - Mechanical ventilation for airway protection
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Likely secondary to hypotension/septic shock.
   Likely will improve with perfusion.
   - Urine lytes

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, embolic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presented with lethargy likely secondary to an infectious source. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for septic shock, acute mental status change (AMS), acute renal failure, and other chronic conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with possible progression to septic shock: The patient has signs of infection, including leukocytosis, tachypnea, elevated lactate levels, and hypotension. Pneumonia is suspected as the source of infection, given the chest X-ray findings and purulent sputum. Monitoring for clinical deterioration and following cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial.
2. Acute mental status change (AMS): The patient's mental status is altered, which could be due to infection or seizure activity. Monitoring for signs of seizure activity and obtaining an electroencephalogram (EEG) if evidence of seizures is necessary.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, likely secondary to hypotension and septic shock. Improving perfusion may help improve renal function.
4. History of CVAs: The patient has a history of embolic and hemorrhagic CVAs. Continuing simvastatin and anticoagulation with Plavix is important to"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 62 yo M with PMH of HTN, type 2 DM, embolic and hemorrhagic
   CVA, and history of DVT who presents with lethargy likely secondary to
   infectious source
   .
   # Septic Shock:  Pt has leukocytosis, tachypnea, elevated lactate,
   hypotension however not tachycardic, but suggestive of septic shock.
   Source likely pneumonia given chest x-ray and purulent sputum.  Other
   possible source could be C diff given foul smelling stool, however no
   recent antibiotic use.  Cultures sent in ED.  If patient's mental
   status worsens or worsens clinically consider LP to rule out
   meningitis, although very unlikely.
   - Follow cultures, reculture if spikes
   - Send C diff toxin
   - Legionella antigen
   - Check for flu, place on precautions until negative
   - Continue antibiotics, however will narrow to Vanc/Zosyn for possible
   HAP and continue Flagyl PO for possible C diff until negative toxin.
   - Goal directed therapy, follow CVP with goal [**7-31**], with fluids and
   pressors as needed goal MAP > 65, UOP 30cc/hr
   - Continue mechanical ventilation for airway protection
   .
   # AMS:  Likely secondary to infection, however given history of CVA's
   could be seizure activity.  Will monitor for signs of seizure activity,
   will get EEG if evidence of seizures.  No sign of acute hemorrhage or
   stroke by head CT today.  As above consider LP if mental status
   worsens.
   - Hold sedating medications including oral morphine, gabapentin,
   mirtazapine, however will continue baclofen and duloxetine given risk
   of withdrawal.
   - Mechanical ventilation for airway protection
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Likely secondary to hypotension/septic shock.
   Likely will improve with perfusion.
   - Urine lytes
   - Trend
   .
   # Hypertension:  Hold home regimen of lasix and lisinopril given
   hypotension in the ED.
   .
   # History of CVAs: bilateral embolic cerebellar [**2188**], hemorrhagic left
   thalamic [**2190**].  Continue simvastatin, anticoagulated with plavix.
   Continue baclofen for contractures.
   .
   # Type II Diabetes mellitus:  Monitor blood sugars QID, insulin sliding
   scale.  Hold gabapentin and morphine given possibility of sedation.
   .
   # Chronic Constipation:  Continue aggressive bowel regimen including
   colace, miralax, reglan, lactulose, biscodyl, fleet enemas, and
   golytely PRN.
   .
   # Dysphagia:  PEG in place, tube feeds when stable.
   .
   # Depression:  Continue duloxetine, hold mirtazapine given possible
   sedation.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # h/o DVT:  Will hold coumadin for now, check INR in AM, bridge with
   lovenox if needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, embolic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presented with lethargy likely secondary to an infectious source. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, possibly due to pneumonia given the chest x-ray findings and purulent sputum. Cultures have been sent, and antibiotics have been started.

The patient also has acute mental status changes (AMS) that could be secondary to infection or seizure activity. An EEG has been ordered if there are signs of seizures. The patient's renal function has deteriorated, likely due to hypotension/septic shock, but should improve with perfusion. His blood pressure is currently being managed with fluids and pressors.

The patient's medical history includes chronic constipation, dysphagia with a PEG tube in place, depression, hypothyroidism, and a history of DVT. He is currently on anticoagulation therapy with Plavix and is being bridged with lovenox. His code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to intubation and mechanical ventilation for airway protection, the patient may develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or have difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
2. Infection: The patient is already diagnosed with septic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, embolic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypothyroidism. The patient presents with lethargy likely secondary to an infectious source.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Septic Shock: Resolved, but the patient had leukocytosis, tachypnea, elevated lactate, and hypotension. The source of infection is likely pneumonia given the chest x-ray and purulent sputum. Cultures have been sent in the emergency department.
   - Continue vancomycin for gram-positive coverage.
   - Continue zosyn until speciation and sensitivities are back.
   - Continue PO flagyl until C. difficile toxin is negative.
   - Legionella antigen and flu pending, continue precautions until negative.
   - No longer requiring pressors or fluids for blood pressure control, continue to monitor closely with an arterial line.

2. Acute Mental Status Changes (AMS): Resolved, likely secondary to infection.
   - Can restart home medications including oral morphine, gabapentin, and mirtazapine.
   - Able to extubate today, tolerating spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) fine.

3. Acute Renal Failure: Resolved with volume resuscitation, likely secondary to hypotension/septic shock.
   - Trend down.

4. Hypertension: Hold home regimen of lasix and lisinopril given hypotension in the emergency department. Can restart when/if becomes hypertensive.

5. History of CVAs: Bilateral embolic cerebellar [**2188**], hemorrhagic left thalamic [**2190**]. Continue simvastatin, anticoagulated with plavix. Continue baclofen for contractures.

6. Type II Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor blood sugars QID, insulin sliding scale. Restart gabapentin and morphine.

7. Chronic Constipation: Will discontinue miralax and lactulose for now given loose stools and monitor bowel movements. Continue bowel regimen including colace, reglan, bisacodyl, and fleet enemas.

8. Dysphagia: J-tube in place, tube feeds started last night, will get nutrition recommendations.

9. Depression: Continue duloxetine and mirtazapine.

10. Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.

11. h/o DVT: Continue to hold coumadin for now given antibiotics, check INR in the morning, bridge with lovenox if needed.

12. FEN: No intravenous fluids, replete electrolytes, tube feed.

13. Prophylaxis: Therapeutic on coumadin now, but will hold for now, lovenox as needed, PPI.

14. Access: Right internal jugular (RIJ), left arterial line (AL).

15. Code: Full code confirmed with healthcare provider.

16. Communication: [**Name (NI) 3643**], wife and daughter-in-law present.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's purulent sputum and chest x-ray findings suggest a possible pneumonia. It is important to monitor for any worsening respiratory symptoms and ensure appropriate antibiotic coverage.

2. C. difficile infection: The patient has tested positive for C. difficile. It is crucial to continue PO flagyl until the toxin is negative to prevent further complications associated with this infection.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, and it is important to monitor for any signs of DVT recurrence, especially with prolonged immobility in the ICU.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further episodes of hypotension.

5. Acute kidney injury: The patient had acute renal failure in the past"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of CVA, decubitus ulcer, sepsis without organ dysfunction, diabetes mellitus type II, and altered airway protection. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and is currently extubated. The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuations in blood pressures, requiring boluses of normal saline. He is now on invasive mechanical ventilation due to worsening respiratory status. The patient has positive cultures for coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum, but negative for flu and legionella. He tested positive for Clostridium difficile and is being continued on PO flagyl. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels. His electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. His arterial blood gas analysis indicates a slightly alkalotic pH, normal pCO2, and elevated pO2. The patient's vital signs are stable, but his fluid balance is negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, leading to the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening hypoxemia.
2. Sepsis: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient's positive cultures for coagulase-negative staph"

   - continue home medications including oral morphine, gabapentin,
   mirtazapine
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  resolved with volume resuscitation, lLikely
   secondary to hypotension/septic shock-Stable/Resolved.
   - Trend
   .
   # Hypertension:  Hold home regimen of lasix and lisinopril given
   hypotension in the ED.  Can restart when/if becomes hypertensive.
   .
   # History of CVAs: bilateral embolic cerebellar [**2188**], hemorrhagic left
   thalamic [**2190**].  Continue simvastatin, anticoagulated with plavix.
   Continue baclofen for contractures.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 62 yo M with PMH of HTN, type 2 DM, embolic and hemorrhagic
   CVA, and history of DVT who presents with lethargy likely secondary to
   infectious source
   .
   # Septic Shock:  resolved, Pt had leukocytosis, tachypnea, elevated
   lactate, hypotension. Source likely pneumonia given chest x-ray and
   purulent sputum.  Other possible source could be C diff given foul
   smelling stool, however no recent antibiotic use.  Cultures sent in
   ED.  Flu and Legionella negative.  CXR similar to previous film.
   - GPC
s in pairs, chains and clusters in sputum from ED, continue
   vancomycin for gram positive coverage for MRSA.  D/c Zosyn as no
   supportive Cx data at this point
   - C diff toxin positive, continue PO flagyl
   - Intermittently requiring pressors or fluids for BP control, continue
   to monitor closely with A line, will d/c line in afternoon if stable
   .
   # AMS:  resolved, Likely secondary to infection
   - continue home medications including oral morphine, gabapentin,
   mirtazapine
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  resolved with volume resuscitation, lLikely
   secondary to hypotension/septic shock-Stable/Resolved.
   - Trend
   .
   # Hypertension:  Hold home regimen of lasix and lisinopril given
   hypotension in the ED.  Can restart when/if becomes hypertensive.
   .
   # History of CVAs: bilateral embolic cerebellar [**2188**], hemorrhagic left
   thalamic [**2190**].  Continue simvastatin, anticoagulated with plavix.
   Continue baclofen for contractures.
   .
   # Type II Diabetes mellitus:  Monitor blood sugars QID, insulin sliding
   scale.  Restart gabapentin and morphine
   -Sugars well controlled
   .
   # Chronic Constipation:   Will discontinue miralax and lactulose for
   now given loose stools and monitor bowel movements.  Continue bowel
   regimen including colace, reglan, biscodyl, fleet enemas as needed,
   though with C diff, likely has infectious loose stools
   .
   # Dysphagia:  J tube in place, nutrition following
   .
   # Depression:  Continue duloxetine, mirtazapine
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, embolic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypothyroidism. The patient presents with lethargy likely secondary to an infectious source. 

The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, which has resolved. The source of infection is likely pneumonia given the chest X-ray and purulent sputum. Cultures sent in the emergency department were negative for flu and Legionella. The patient's white blood cell count was elevated, and he had tachypnea, elevated lactate levels, and hypotension. The patient is being treated with vancomycin for gram-positive coverage, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and continuing PO flagyl for Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient also has acute mental status changes (AMS) likely secondary to infection, which have resolved. He is being continued on home medications including oral morphine, gabapentin, and mirtazapine.

The patient experienced acute renal failure, which has resolved with volume resuscitation. It is believed to be secondary to hypotension/septic shock. 

The patient has a history of CVAs, including a bilateral embolic cerebellar CVA and a hemorrhagic left thalamic CVA. He is being continued on simvastatin, anticoagulated with Plavix, and continues to take baclofen for contractures.

The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is well-controlled with insulin sliding scale and restarted gabapentin and morphine.

The patient has chronic constipation and is being monitored closely. He has a J-tube in place for dysphagia.

The patient has a history of depression and is being continued on duloxetine and mirtazapine.

The patient has hypothyroidism and is being continued on levothyroxine.

The patient has a history of DVT and is receiving Coumadin, but it is being held temporarily. He is also on lovenox as needed and a PPI for prophylaxis.

The patient has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and PICC line. He is being monitored closely in the ICU and may be able to go to rehab tomorrow pending pressures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia due to the patient's immunocompromised state and presence of purulent sputum.
2. Clostridium difficile infection, considering the use of antibiotics and the presence of foul-smelling stool.
3. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and presence of DVT history.
4. Stroke or transient ischemic attack due to the patient's history of CVAs and ongoing risk factors.
5. Acute kidney injury or renal failure due to hypotension and septic shock.
6. Pressure ulcers due to immobility and prolonged bed rest.
7. Aspiration pneumonia due to altered mental status and risk for airway protection.
8. Hypotension or shock due to ongoing fluid resuscitation needs.
9. Infection at the J-tube insertion site.
10. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient for any signs or symptoms of these potential complications and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage them."
