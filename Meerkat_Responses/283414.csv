   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: The patient is a 71 yo man with h/o recently
   diagnosed IPF, who presents with a one-week history of worsening
   hypoxia.
   # IPF:  Diagnosed 6 months ago.  He is currently taking Prednisone,
   Acetylcystine, and Azathioprine.  He has had increasing hypoxia over
   the past week, with recent ABG of 7.51/36/60/30.  CXR showed new LUL
   infiltrate.  DDx includes worsening of underlying IPF (i.e. AIPF) v.
   superimposed PNA. PE CT negative.
    - Continue Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin for [**9-7**] day course
    - F/u final Chest CT
    - Supplemental O2 for goal > 88%, Mucomyst, Azathioprine,
   Methylprednisone 2g/day
    - f/u  Legionella Ag
     - Continue Protonix for GERD prevention
    - Continue Bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**] given prednisone use
   # Back pain:  The patient has had increasing back pain for the past
   week.  He has decreased strength in his extremities bilaterally and one
   episode of fecal incontinence yesterday.  This is concerning for spinal
   cord compression.
   -  Consider CT L-spine to evaluate for herniated disc, spinal cord
   compression
   -  MRI to further eval
   - Continue Oxycodone prn for pain
   # Coccyx ulcer:  The patient developed an ulcerated lesion in his
   coccyx last week.  He was started on Cephalexin by his PCP last Tuesday
   for possible cellulitis.  DDx includes Zoster v. sacral ulcer v.
   cellulitis.  The wound is currently dressed.
    - Examine wound when dressing is changed by nursing staff
    - Consider continuing Cephalexin if lesion appears infected

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of recently diagnosed IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) presenting with worsening hypoxia over the past week.
- He has been experiencing increasing back pain, decreased strength in extremities, and one episode of fecal incontinence, which is concerning for spinal cord compression.
- The patient developed an ulcerated lesion in his coccyx last week, and he was started on Cephalexin by his PCP for possible cellulitis.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 112/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89% on 4L.
- The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen for a goal of >88%, Mucomyst, Azathioprine, and Methylprednisolone 2g/day.
- The patient has diffuse crackles over all lung fields, tachycardia, and sinus rhythm with normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops.
- Lab results show an elevated WBC count of 10.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, sodium level of 137 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, and a slightly elevated TCO2 level of 30.
- Imaging studies include a chest X-ray showing new left upper lobe infiltrate, and a PE CT scan that is negative.
- The patient's overall assessment and plan include continuing Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin for a 9-day course, follow-up final chest CT, supplemental O2 for goal >88%, Mucomyst, Azathioprine, Methylprednisolone 2g/day, and further evaluation for spinal cord compression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Spinal cord compression: The patient's increasing back pain, decreased strength in extremities, and episode of fecal incontinence raise concerns for spinal cord compression. This condition requires urgent evaluation and management to prevent further neurological deficits or paralysis.
2. Pneumonia: The new left upper lobe infiltrate seen on the chest X-ray suggests a possible pneumonia. The patient's worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress may be due to this infection. Appropriate antibiotics and supportive care should be provided.
3. Coccyx ulcer infection: The presence of an ulcerated lesion in the coccyx raises concerns for potential infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy, such as Cephalexin, should be considered if the lesion appears infected.
4. Acute exacerbation of IPF: The patient's worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress could be indicative of an acute exacerbation of his underlying IPF. Continued use of Mucomyst, Azathioprine, and"

   diagnosed IPF, who presents with a one-week history of worsening
   hypoxia.
   # IPF:  Diagnosed 6 months ago.  He is currently taking Prednisone,
   Acetylcystine, and Azathioprine.  He has had increasing hypoxia over
   the past week, with recent ABG of 7.51/36/60/30.  CXR showed new LUL
   infiltrate.  DDx includes worsening of underlying IPF (i.e. AIPF) v.
   superimposed PNA. PE CT negative.
    - Continue Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin for [**9-7**] day course
    - F/u final Chest CT
    - Supplemental O2 for goal > 88%, Mucomyst, Azathioprine,
   Methylprednisone 2g/day
    - f/u  Legionella Ag

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of recently diagnosed interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). He presents with worsening hypoxia over the past week, and recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory alkalosis. A chest X-ray showed a new left upper lobe (LUL) infiltrate. The differential diagnosis includes worsening of underlying IPF (acute exacerbation of IPF) versus superimposed pneumonia. A CT pulmonary angiography (PE CT) was negative.

The patient is currently being treated with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for a 9-day course, supplemental oxygen for a goal of maintaining an oxygen saturation >88%, Mucomyst, azathioprine, and methylprednisolone 2g/day. A follow-up final chest CT is planned. Legionella Ag test is also being followed up.

The patient has experienced increasing back pain for the past week, with decreased strength in his extremities bilaterally and one episode of fecal incontinence. This is concerning for spinal cord compression.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Exacerbation of IPF: The patient's worsening hypoxia and new LUL infiltrate on chest X-ray raise concerns for an acute exacerbation of his underlying IPF. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Spinal Cord Compression: The patient's increasing back pain,"

","Summary:
- 71-year-old man with a history of recently diagnosed IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) presenting with worsening hypoxia over the past week.
- Diagnosed with IPF six months ago and currently on treatment with Prednisone, Acetylcystine, and Azathioprine.
- Patient's respiratory status has been stable in the hospital, but he remains in obvious respiratory distress.
- Bronchoscopic evaluation showed no evidence of consolidation.
- Peri-anal rash diagnosed as zoster and started on valacyclovir.
- The patient is also experiencing back pain, which is stable overnight and negative for any significant findings on MRI.
- Coccyx ulcer diagnosed as zoster and being managed with valacyclovir and wound care.
- The patient is on various medications including Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin, Mucomyst, Azathioprine, Prednisone, and Oxycodone for pain management.
- The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen for a goal of >88% saturation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of underlying IPF exacerbation: The patient's increasing hypoxia may indicate a worsening of his underlying IPF, which can lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Infection: Despite negative bronchoscopic evaluation for consolidation, there is a risk of developing a hospital-acquired infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of recently diagnosed IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) who presents with worsening hypoxia over the past week. He has been stable in the hospital, but his condition has not improved. The patient's current medications include Prednisone, Acetylcystine, and Azathioprine. His vital signs show tachycardia and low oxygen saturation. Physical examination reveals diffuse crackles in all lung fields, and he is in obvious respiratory distress. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and increased creatinine levels. The patient's chest X-ray shows increasing infiltrates, which are concerning for worsening of underlying IPF exacerbation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of underlying IPF exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of worsening hypoxia and chest X-ray findings suggest a possible worsening of his IPF. This can lead to further respiratory distress and decreased oxygen saturation.
2. Arachnoiditis: The patient's MRI results show evidence of arachnoiditis at the L3 to L5 levels. Arachnoiditis is an inflammation of the arachnoid membranes surrounding the spinal cord, which can cause severe pain and neurological deficits.
3. Zoster infection: The patient has a diagnosis of zoster (shingles), as indicated by the presence of a peri-anal rash. If left untreated, z"

The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of recently diagnosed IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) who presents with worsening hypoxia over the past week. He has been stable in the hospital. His recent events include an MRI of the L spine and a bronchoscopy which showed no evidence of consolidation. He has a peri-anal rash diagnosed as zoster, for which he has been started on valacyclovir and contact precautions. His respiratory status remained stable during the bronchoscopy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of recently diagnosed IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis).
- He presents with worsening hypoxia over the past week.
- The patient has been stable in the hospital and is currently on various medications including Prednisone, Acetylcystine, and Azathioprine for his IPF.
- Physical examination reveals diffuse crackles over all lung fields, tachycardia, and warm well-perfused extremities.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and decreased hemoglobin levels.
- Chest X-ray indicates increasing infiltrates.
- The patient's condition is being managed with supplemental oxygen, Mucomyst, Azathioprine, Prednisone, and further investigations are planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of underlying IPF exacerbation: The patient's IPF may continue to deteriorate, leading to further respiratory compromise.
2. Infection: The presence of diffuse crackles in the lungs and increasing infiltrates on the chest X-ray raise concerns about a possible pulmonary infection.
3. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization in the ICU.
4. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, particularly given the presence of a coccyx ulcer.
5. Medication-related complications: The patient is on multiple medications, including immunosuppressants, which may increase the risk of adverse drug reactions or interactions.
6. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates raise concerns for the development of ARDS, a life-threatening lung condition.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information or tests may be required for a more accurate assessment."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of recently diagnosed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). He presents with worsening hypoxia over the past week. The assessment and plan indicate that the patient's condition is likely an exacerbation of underlying IPF or possibly an infection. The patient is currently on medications such as Prednisone, Acetylcystine, and Azathioprine for IPF management. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening IPF exacerbation or infection.
2. Infection due to immunosuppressive therapy with medications like Azathioprine.
3. Complications related to the coccyx ulcer, which is diagnosed as zoster and being treated with Valcyte.
4. Potential risks associated with long-term use of corticosteroids like Prednisone.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, administer appropriate antibiotics if necessary, manage pain and discomfort related to the back pain and coccyx ulcer, and assess the efficacy of the current treatment regimen for IPF."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of recently diagnosed IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) who presents with a one-week history of worsening hypoxia. He has been stable in the hospital but has been experiencing increasing hypoxia, which could be due to worsening of underlying IPF exacerbation or infection. The chest CT shows no evidence of central, lobar, or segmental PE (Pulmonary Embolism) or acute aortic syndrome, but there is moderately progressive worsening of pulmonary fibrosis without focal consolidations. The CXR (Chest X-Ray) shows stable appearances with no new consolidation or PTX (Pneumothorax).

The patient's medical history includes a coccyx ulcer diagnosed as Zoster, for which he started on Valcyte on [**7-18**]. He is also being treated for back pain with evidence of arachnoiditis on MRI at L3 to L5, and neuro was consulted to assess for VZV (Varicella Zoster Virus) arachnoiditis. The patient's allergies include a last dose of antibiotics (Ceftriaxone) on [**2101-7-18**] 09:00 AM, Levofloxacin on [**2101-7-19**] 08:32 AM, and Valgancyclovir on [**2101-7-20**] 12:00 AM. He is currently on various medications including Pantoprazole, Lorazepam, Heparin Sodium, and others.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature (Tmax): 35.9°C (96.7°F)
- Heart Rate (HR): 70 bpm (64 - 119 bpm)
- Blood Pressure (BP): 121/73 mmHg (85/59 - 140/88 mmHg)
- Respiratory Rate (RR): 28 inspirations per minute (17 - 36)
- Oxygen Saturation (SpO2): 96%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus Rhythm (SR)

The patient's physical examination reveals general respiratory distress, clear oropharynx with dry mucous membranes, supple neck, no jugular venous distention (JVD), no lower extremity edema, diffuse crackles over all lung fields, tachycardia, normal heart sounds, soft abdomen with diffuse tenderness, present bowel sounds, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly, warm extremities with 3/5 strength in the right arm, no clubbing, cyan"

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxia. The patient has a history of prior lumbar surgery, which prevents the performance of a lumbar puncture. The patient's allergies include ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and valgancyclovir. The patient has been receiving various medications, including pantoprazole, lorazepam, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs show a low temperature at 35.9°C (96.7°F), normal blood pressure, a slightly elevated heart rate within normal limits, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,309 mL and a total output of 905 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 404 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of ///25/. Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient's unresponsive state.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and slightly abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's platelet count is normal, and renal function tests show no significant abnormalities. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include herpes zoster, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and pneumonia. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), specifically idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), presenting with increased dyspnea and fecal incontinence with arachnoiditis of the L-spine. He also has herpes zoster. The patient's respiratory status remains tenuous but shows subtle signs of improvement. No infection has been identified. The plan includes continuing levofloxacin for 10 days, considering tapering steroids slowly, sending rheum serologies, monitoring I/Os, and continuing neurological evaluation. The patient's buttock rash from varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is being exacerbated by irritation from stool due to incontinence and requires aggressive nursing care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AEIPF (Acute Exacerbation of IPF): The patient's increased dyspnea could be due to an acute exacerbation of IPF, which is a potentially life-threatening complication.
2. Disseminated Zoster: The concern for disseminated zoster is significant, as it can lead to severe complications such as encephalitis or multi-organ involvement.
3. Arachnoiditis: The patient's arachnoiditis of the L-spine can cause severe neurological complications, including paralysis or bladder and bowel dysfunction.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, increasing the risk of developing pneumonia, which can worsen"

 HERPES ZOSTER
 INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (ILD INCLUDING IPF, UIP, NSIP, DIP, LIP,
   ETC)
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   71M with IPF, presented with increased dyspnea, likely from AEIPF, and
   fecal incontinence with arachnoiditis of the L-spine, as well as
   zoster. Respiratory status remains tenuous but there are subtle signs
   of improvement today. No infection has been identified. Will continue
   levofloxacin for 10 days, will consider tapering the steroids slowly.
   Will also send some rheum serologies to look for other causes of
   worsening ILD, though likely very low yield. If there is progression of
   lung disease will consider broadening abx, and possibly uring other
   immunosuppression. Furosemide may have had some positive effect, though
   hard to say. Will continue to monitor I/Os.
   Neurological evalution is being continued with the guidance of the
   neurology team. Need to sample CSF to look for VZV in the spinal fluid.
   Buttock rash from VZV is being exacerbated by irritation from stool due
   to incontinence and required aggressive nursing care.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- 71-year-old male patient with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), presenting with increased dyspnea, likely due to acute exacerbation of IPF, and fecal incontinence with arachnoiditis of the left spine.
- Patient also has herpes zoster.
- Respiratory status remains tenuous but shows subtle signs of improvement today.
- No infection has been identified.
- Will continue levofloxacin for 10 days and consider tapering steroids slowly.
- Rheum serologies will be sent to look for other causes of worsening ILD.
- If there is progression of lung disease, broadening antibiotics and possibly investigating other immunosuppression will be considered.
- Furosemide may have had some positive effect on fluid balance.
- Neurological evaluation is ongoing with guidance from the neurology team.
- CSF sample will be taken to look for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the spinal fluid.
- Buttock rash from VZV is being exacerbated by irritation from stool due to incontinence and requires aggressive nursing care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Exacerbation of IPF: The patient's increased dyspnea suggests an acute exacerbation of IPF. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory function and potentially respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

2. Fecal Incontinence: The patient's fec"
