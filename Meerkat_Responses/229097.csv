   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   69 y/o F with remote history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, and
   PUD, s/p ORIF of R wrist yesterday presents with lethargy s/p syncope,
   found to have borderline ST elevations and Trop I of 1.99, ARF, and
   transaminitis, transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for cardiac cath.
   .
   1. Syncope/ACS: Patient denied CP at OSH. Her presentation with
   lethargy and syncope is unusual for ACS, and she has little known
   cardiac history, but these symptoms may have been multifactorial from
   recent sedatives and hypovolemia. Also, her elevated Trop and CK-MB are
   suggestive of NSTEMI. Although the EKG has mild ST elevations in V2 and
   V3, they are likely not enough to categorize this as a STEMI. Patient
   transferred for cardiac cath.
   - ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   - Low dose metoprolol given HR in low 60s
   - Heparin gtt
   - Check cardiac markers here and cycle CKMB until peak.
   - Lipid panel
   - TTE to see if any pump dysfunction resulting from ischemia.
   - As patient is stable and is recovering from ARF, will defer cardiac
   cath overnight and reassess in am.
   .
   2. Respiratory failure: Patient noted to be very lethargic at OSH, and
   ABG suggests hypoventilation more than hypoxia. Her CXR shows
   hyperinflation suggesting COPD, although the acidemia and lack of
   elevated bicarb suggests that she is not a chronic CO2 retainer. She
   most likely was overdosed from sedatives/narcotics perioperatively and
   given her small weight, likely underlying lung disease, and ARF, was
   more prone to these effects. No e/o fluid overload or PNA on CXR, and
   PE unlikely given preserved oxygenation, no tachypnea or tachycardia.
   - On vent with settings Vt 480 RR 14 FiO2 50 PEEP 5. Will increase RR
   to 16 and recheck ABG to assess ventilation.
   - Midazolam/fentanyl sedation to keep pt comfortable but responsive to
   stimuli.
   - Wean vent as tolerated in the am.
   - If no improvement with above, would consider PE eval such as V/Q scan
   given ARF.
   .
   3. Acute Renal Failure - Renal US at OSH showed no e/o obstruction. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have had ATN from a med received perioperatively, but more likely
   prerenal from poor POs, and possibly poor forward flow if the ischemia
   has affected pump function.
   - 500cc bolus of NS, followed by 100cc/hr D5 1/2NS.
   - UA/Cx with sediment, urine lytes.
   - Trend creatinine and renally dose meds.
   .
   4. Transaminitis: Likely toxic/viral/ischemic given profound elevation.
   No reason to suspect acute viral hepatitis, and no known toxin
   ingestion. Patient not known to be hypotensive, as would expect with
   ischemia, but possibly occurred at time of ACS.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - Tylenol level and hepatitis serology.
   .
   5. Anemia: Uncertain baseline, currently with hct of ~30. Macryocytic,
   with normal RDW.
   - Repeat hct in am.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate.
   .
   6. s/p ORIF: RUE casted, perfusion symmetrical, although R hand
   somewhat discolored.
   - Monitor neurovascular status.
   .
   7. PUD: H2 blocker.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and recent surgery on her right wrist (ORIF).
- She presented with lethargy and syncope, which may be related to acute coronary syndrome (ACS), although the EKG showed only mild ST elevations in V2 and V3.
- The patient has been transferred to another hospital for cardiac catheterization.
- She is currently on various medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, low-dose metoprolol, heparin, and midazolam/fentanyl sedation.
- The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she required mechanical ventilation due to hypoventilation and possible overdose of sedatives/narcotics perioperatively.
- The underlying lung disease and acute renal failure (ARF) make her more prone to these effects.
- Her ABG results show a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis.
- The chest X-ray reveals hyperinflation, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- The patient also has acute renal failure, possibly due to pre-renal causes, ATN, or poor forward flow resulting from ischemia.
- She received a 500cc bolus of normal saline followed by 100cc/hr D"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   69 y/o F with remote history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, and
   PUD, s/p ORIF of R wrist yesterday presents with lethargy s/p syncope,
   found to have borderline ST elevations and Trop I of 1.99, ARF, and
   transaminitis, transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for cardiac cath.
   .
   1. Syncope/ACS: Patient denied CP at OSH. Her presentation with
   lethargy and syncope is unusual for ACS, and she has little known
   cardiac history, but these symptoms may have been multifactorial from
   recent sedatives and hypovolemia. Also, her elevated Trop and CK-MB are
   suggestive of NSTEMI. Although the EKG has mild ST elevations in V2 and
   V3, they are likely not enough to categorize this as a STEMI. Patient
   transferred for cardiac cath.
   - ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   - Low dose metoprolol given HR in low 60s
   - Heparin gtt
   - Check cardiac markers here and cycle CKMB until peak.
   - Lipid panel
   - TTE to see if any pump dysfunction resulting from ischemia.
   - As patient is stable and is recovering from ARF, will defer cardiac
   cath overnight and reassess in am.
   .
   2. Respiratory failure: Patient noted to be very lethargic at OSH, and
   ABG suggests hypoventilation more than hypoxia. Her CXR shows
   hyperinflation suggesting COPD, although the acidemia and lack of
   elevated bicarb suggests that she is not a chronic CO2 retainer. She
   most likely was overdosed from sedatives/narcotics perioperatively and
   given her small weight, likely underlying lung disease, and ARF, was
   more prone to these effects. No e/o fluid overload or PNA on CXR, and
   PE unlikely given preserved oxygenation, no tachypnea or tachycardia.
   - On vent with settings Vt 480 RR 14 FiO2 50 PEEP 5. Will increase RR
   to 16 and recheck ABG to assess ventilation.
   - Midazolam/fentanyl sedation to keep pt comfortable but responsive to
   stimuli.
   - Wean vent as tolerated in the am.
   - If no improvement with above, would consider PE eval such as V/Q scan
   given ARF.
   .
   3. Acute Renal Failure - Renal US at OSH showed no e/o obstruction. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have had ATN from a med received perioperatively, but more likely
   prerenal from poor POs, and possibly poor forward flow if the ischemia
   has affected pump function.
   - 500cc bolus of NS, followed by 100cc/hr D5 1/2NS.
   - UA/Cx with sediment, urine lytes.
   - Trend creatinine and renally dose meds.
   .
   4. Transaminitis: Likely toxic/viral/ischemic given profound elevation.
   No reason to suspect acute viral hepatitis, and no known toxin
   ingestion. Patient not known to be hypotensive, as would expect with
   ischemia, but possibly occurred at time of ACS.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - Tylenol level and hepatitis serology.
   .
   5. Anemia: Uncertain baseline, currently with hct of ~30. Macryocytic,
   with normal RDW.
   - Repeat hct in am.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate.
   .
   6. s/p ORIF: RUE casted, perfusion symmetrical, although R hand
   somewhat discolored.
   - Monitor neurovascular status.
   .
   7. PUD: H2 blocker.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and recent surgery for a right wrist fracture. She presented with lethargy and syncope, which could be related to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or medication side effects. The patient also has evidence of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and acute renal failure (ARF).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's presentation with lethargy and syncope suggests possible ACS, and elevated cardiac markers suggest NSTEMI. Close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to assess the extent of cardiac damage and determine appropriate management, such as cardiac catheterization.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was noted to be very lethargic, with an ABG suggesting hypoventilation rather than hypoxia. The CXR showed hyperinflation suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the patient may have been overdosed with sedatives/narcotics perioperatively. Ventilation parameters should be adjusted to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and further evaluation for pulmonary embolism (PE) may be considered if there is no improvement.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has ARF, which could be due to pre-renal causes like poor oral intake or post-renal causes like obstructive"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   69 y/o F with remote history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, and
   PUD, s/p ORIF of R wrist yesterday presents with lethargy s/p syncope,
   found to have ? ST elevations and + cardiac markers, ARF, and
   transaminitis
   .
   1. Syncope/ACS: Stemi (not classic) vs. Nstemi.  ARF; not great
   candidate for elective cath.
   - echo to assess WMA
   - ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   - Low dose metoprolol given HR in low 60s
   - Heparin gtt
   - Check cardiac markers here and cycle CKMB until peak.
   - Lipid panel
   .
   2. Respiratory failure:  COPD +/- hypoventilation
   - continue vent, wean as tolerated
   - Midazolam/fentanyl sedation; wean as tolerated
   - If no improvement with above, would consider PE eval such as V/Q scan
   given ARF.
   .
   3. Acute Renal Failure
 creatine improving with saline bolus
   - UA/Cx with sediment, urine lytes.
   - Trend creatinine and renally dose meds.
   .
   4. Transaminitis: Likely toxic/viral/ischemic given profound elevation.
   No reason to suspect acute viral hepatitis, and no known toxin
   ingestion. Patient not known to be hypotensive, as would expect with
   ischemia, but possibly occurred at time of ACS.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - Tylenol level elevated
   - hepatitis serology pending.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. 

The patient underwent an ultrasound at 10:00 AM, which showed anemia that appears to be of chronic disease. The patient attempted to be weaned off the ventilator but developed respiratory acidosis, so they were put back on assist-control ventilation overnight and will attempt weaning again in the morning. 

The transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reveals that the left atrium size is normal with no atrial septal defect seen. The estimated right atrial pressure is between 10-15mmHg. The left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic function are all normal, with an ejection fraction greater than 55%. There is no ventricular septal defect. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened, but there is no aortic stenosis or regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and there is no pericardial effusion.

The patient has allergies to ampicillin and unknown medications. The last dose of antibiotics was administered on [**2125-2-7**] at 08:00 PM. The patient is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium at 450 units/hour and ranitidine"

   PUD, s/p ORIF of R wrist yesterday presents with lethargy s/p syncope,
   found to have ? ST elevations and + cardiac markers, ARF, and
   transaminitis
   1. NSTEMI: Echo shows preserved pump function. Highest MB here 20,
   trending down. NSTEMI likely secondary to severe dehydration,
   hypotension. Will manage medically.
   - Cont ASA, Metoprolol,
   - stop heparin gtt, clopidogrel
   - can descrease atrovastatin to 10mg on discharge
   - no cath, medically manage
   2. Respiratory failure:  Hypoventilation from meds and COPD. ABG this
   am shows better ventilation, but will await repeat gas on lower vent
   setting, ie, CPAP.  Still acidotic, but mentating.
   - Wean sedation and vent as tolerated, hopeful for extubation today
   3. Acute Renal Failure: creatine improving with IVF, urine lytes c/w
   prerenal.
   - Cont maintenance IVF while NPO.
   - Trend creatinine and renally dose meds.
   4. Transaminitis: Hepatitis serologies and Tylenol level negative.
   Likely ischemic given profound elevation. LFTs improving.
   - Trend LFTs.
   5. Anemia: Hct stable.  Uncertain baseline.
   - Follow daily.
   6. s/p ORIF: RUE casted, perfusion greatly improved.
   - Monitor neurovascular status.
   7. PUD: H2 blocker.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and recent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of the right wrist. The patient presents with lethargy after experiencing syncope and was found to have possible ST elevations and positive cardiac markers, acute renal failure (ARF), and transaminitis.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. NSTEMI: The patient is likely experiencing non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) secondary to severe dehydration and hypotension. The echocardiogram shows preserved pump function, and the highest MB here is 20, trending down. Management will be medical.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoventilation from medications and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). An arterial blood gas (ABG) this morning shows improved ventilation, but a repeat gas on lower ventilator settings (CPAP) is pending. The patient remains acidotic but is alert and oriented.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are improving with intravenous fluids (IVF), and urine electrolytes correspond to prerenal azotemia. IVF will be continued while the patient is NPO, and creatinine levels will be trended along with renally dosing medications.

4. Transaminitis: Hep"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, peptic ulcer disease, and previous open reduction and internal fixation of the right wrist. She presented with lethargy following a syncopal episode, and further evaluation revealed suspected non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, transaminitis, anemia, and recent open reduction and internal fixation of the right wrist.

The patient has been managed medically for the NSTEMI, with medications including aspirin, metoprolol, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin. Respiratory support has been provided due to hypoventilation from medications and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute renal failure is being treated with intravenous fluids, and transaminitis is likely secondary to ischemic injury. Anemia is being monitored, and the patient's recent open reduction and internal fixation of the right wrist is showing improved perfusion.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 124/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's general appearance is described as alert and responsive, with no evidence of jaundice or other significant findings on physical examination.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, peptic ulcer disease, and recent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right wrist. The patient presents with lethargy after experiencing syncope, and was found to have possible ST elevations and positive cardiac markers, acute renal failure, and transaminitis.

The patient has been diagnosed with the following conditions:
1. NSTEMI (Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction): The patient's cardiac catheterization has been deferred due to acute renal failure, but an echocardiogram shows preserved pump function. The patient is currently on aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and heparin.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoventilation from medications and COPD. An arterial blood gas (ABG) shows improvement, but the patient will be monitored and ventilator settings will be adjusted as needed.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are improving with intravenous fluids, and urine electrolytes are consistent with pre-renal causes. The patient will continue maintenance IVF while NPO and renal function will be closely monitored.
4. Transaminitis: Hepatitis serologies and Tylenol level are negative, suggesting that the cause of transaminitis is likely ischemic. Liver"

   PUD, s/p ORIF of R wrist yesterday presents with lethargy s/p syncope,
   found to have ? ST elevations and + cardiac markers, ARF, and
   transaminitis
   .
   1. Syncope/ACS: Stemi (not classic) vs. Nstemi.  ARF; not great
   candidate for elective cath.
   - echo to assess WMA
   - ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin
   - Low dose metoprolol given HR in low 60s
   - Heparin gtt
   - Check cardiac markers here and cycle CKMB until peak.
   - Lipid panel
   .
   2. Respiratory failure:  COPD +/- hypoventilation
   - continue vent, wean as tolerated
   - Midazolam/fentanyl sedation; wean as tolerated
   - If no improvement with above, would consider PE eval such as V/Q scan
   given ARF.
   .
   3. Acute Renal Failure
 creatine improving with saline bolus
   - UA/Cx with sediment, urine lytes.
   - Trend creatinine and renally dose meds.
   .
   4. Transaminitis: Likely toxic/viral/ischemic given profound elevation.
   No reason to suspect acute viral hepatitis, and no known toxin
   ingestion. Patient not known to be hypotensive, as would expect with
   ischemia, but possibly occurred at time of ACS.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - Tylenol level elevated
   - hepatitis serology pending.
   .
   5. Anemia: Hct stable.  Uncertain baseline, currently with hct of ~30.
   Macryocytic, with normal RDW.
   - Iron studies, B12, folate.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and recent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of the right wrist. She presents with lethargy following syncope, suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and acute respiratory failure.
- The patient has anemia, likely due to chronic disease, and acute renal failure. Her liver enzymes are significantly elevated, indicating transaminitis.
- She has mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and impaired left ventricular inflow pattern on echocardiogram.
- The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with current settings including tidal volume (Vt) of 480 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 95.
- She has been receiving heparin sodium infusion, ranitidine (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate (HR) between 63-73 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 124/58 to 149/83 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and recent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of the right wrist. The patient presented with lethargy after experiencing syncope and was found to have possible ST elevations and positive cardiac markers, acute renal failure, transaminitis, and hypoxia.

The patient was initially intubated and placed on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated. She is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with a nasal cannula. The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, and metoprolol was uptitrated to 25 mg three times a day. There is concern for benzodiazepine withdrawal as the patient is not receiving sedation.

The patient complains of left arm pain near where the arterial line was placed and has self-removed the arterial line. She also experiences some shortness of breath (SOB) and cough with occasional whitish sputum.

Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 160/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on NIPPV.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the new complaint of arm pain and SOB.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and previous open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right wrist. She presented with lethargy and syncope, which was followed by suspected cardiac ischemia indicated by ST elevations and positive cardiac markers. The patient also had acute renal failure, anemia, anxiety, hypertension, and post-operative status after ORIF.

The patient's current condition shows improvement in renal failure but continues to experience respiratory failure with some shortness of breath (SOB), poor air movement, and wheezing. The chest X-ray does not show clear infiltrates. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 160/87 mmHg and heart rate of 89 beats per minute. The arterial line was inserted on 02/08/2025 at 03:00 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient initially presented with suspected cardiac ischemia, indicated by ST elevations and positive cardiac markers. Although the echo showed preserved pump function, it is important to monitor the patient's cardiac status for any signs of ongoing ischemia or other cardiac complications.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing ongoing respiratory failure characterized by SOB, poor air movement, and wheezing. The absence of clear infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggests"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and recent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right wrist. She presented with lethargy after experiencing syncope and was found to have suspected NSTEMI, acute renal failure (ARF), transaminitis, anemia, and an improvement in perfusion of the right upper extremity (RUE).

The patient underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated. Her oxygen saturation levels are high in the 90s-100%. ABG results show PaCO2 levels in the 40s and PaO2 levels in the 50s. Co-oximetry readings are within normal limits.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 89 bpm with normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 160/87 mmHg to 102/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 98%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight imbalance in fluid intake and output.

The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set tidal volume (Vt) of 480 mL, spontaneous Vt ranging from 328-485 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O"

   69 y/o F with remote history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, and
   PUD, s/p ORIF of R wrist yesterday presents with lethargy s/p syncope,
   found to have ? ST elevations and + cardiac markers, ARF, and
   transaminitis
   1. NSTEMI: Echo shows preserved pump function. Highest MB here 20,
   trending down. NSTEMI likely secondary to severe dehydration,
   hypotension. Will manage medically.
   - Cont ASA, Metoprolol,
   - stop heparin gtt, clopidogrel
   - can descrease atrovastatin to 10mg on discharge
   - no cath, medically manage
   2. Respiratory failure:  Hypoventilation from meds and COPD. ABG this
   am shows better ventilation, but will await repeat gas on lower vent
   setting, ie, CPAP.  Still acidotic, but mentating.
   - Wean sedation and vent as tolerated, hopeful for extubation today
   3. Acute Renal Failure: creatine improving with IVF, urine lytes c/w
   prerenal.
   - Cont maintenance IVF while NPO.
   - Trend creatinine and renally dose meds.
   4. Transaminitis: Hepatitis serologies and Tylenol level negative.
   Likely ischemic given profound elevation. LFTs improving.
   - Trend LFTs.
   5. Anemia: Hct stable.  Uncertain baseline.
   - Follow daily.
   6. s/p ORIF: RUE casted, perfusion greatly improved.
   - Monitor neurovascular status.
   7. PUD: H2 blocker.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and recent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right wrist. The patient presented with lethargy following syncope and was found to have suspected NSTEMI, acute renal failure (ARF), transaminitis, anemia, and a casted right upper extremity (RUE) with improved perfusion.

The patient's current condition includes ongoing management of NSTEMI, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, transaminitis, anemia, and post-operative care of the RUE. The patient has been extubated and is receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula. The arterial line was started on 02/08/2125 at 03:00 PM.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 160/87 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The temperature is within normal range. The patient has distant breath sounds bilaterally with faint rales at the right base. There is no evidence of neck stiffness, jugular venous distention, or hepatomegaly. The patient has well-perfused extremities with intact pulses and capillary refill less than 2 seconds in both upper and lower extremities."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and previous open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right wrist. She presented with lethargy and syncope, and was found to have possible ST elevations, positive cardiac markers, acute renal failure (ARF), and transaminitis. 

She is currently extubated but experiencing some shortness of breath (SOB), poor air movement, and wheezing. A chest X-ray does not show a clear infiltrate. The patient has preserved pump function on an echocardiogram, indicating that the cardiac ischemia is less likely and her symptoms may be due to hypoperfusion from syncope.

The patient's vital signs include a blood pressure of 178/82 mmHg, heart rate of 60 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has a history of anxiety, hypertension, and possible mild benzodiazepine withdrawal.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise include cardiac ischemia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anemia, anxiety, hypertension, and complications related to the recent surgical procedure (ORIF)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and a recent operation for a fractured right wrist. She presents with lethargy following a syncopal episode, suspected cardiac ischemia, acute renal failure, respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation, anemia, anxiety, and a casted right upper extremity. Her vital signs show persistently elevated blood pressure, which has been managed with captopril and amlodipine. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, liver enzymes, cardiac markers, and electrolyte imbalances. She is currently on various medications and treatments for her conditions, including cardiac support, COPD management, renal monitoring, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's disposition is to call out to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's symptoms of lethargy and syncope, along with the positive cardiac markers, suggest potential cardiac ischemia. Continued monitoring and management of cardiac function are necessary.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's respiratory symptoms and history of COPD indicate a likely exacerbation of her condition. Close monitoring and treatment with bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics are important to prevent respiratory failure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of mitral prolapse and regurgitation, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and recent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right wrist. The patient presented with lethargy following a syncopal episode and was found to have suspected acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), acute renal failure (ARF), and transaminitis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 60 bpm (with sinus bradycardia), blood pressure ranging from 178/82 mmHg to 195/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's height is 64 inches, and her total fluid intake and output balance is -2,390 mL (-320 mL urine output).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin (Hct), elevated platelet count, increased creatinine, low TCO2, high glucose, and abnormal liver function tests.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypertension: Likely present in the outpatient setting as well, possibly exacerbated by mild benzodiazepine withdrawal. The patient is currently on captopril titrated to achieve better blood pressure control and amlodipine.
