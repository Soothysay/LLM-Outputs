   68F ventilator-dependent secondary to [**Last Name (un) 9456**]-[**Location (un) **] vs CIPD,
   insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, recurrent urinary tract infections
   with chronic indwelling Foley catheter, recent C difficile infection on
   vancomycin PO admitted from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab for fever x1 week, diarrhea,
   and lethargy x1 days.
   .
   #. Pneumonia:  Consolidation in LLL, in addition to bilateral fluffy
   infiltrates. Has been covered with Vancomycin, Zosyn initially which
   are appropriate for VAP and more recently Vancomycin, Imipenem with
   worsening fevers and leukocytosis. Of note, Staph aureus fevers can
   cause recurrent fevers even when appropriately treated, although would
   not expect worsening leukocytosis, and would expect focal
   consolidation. Given bilateral ground glass opacities, concern for
   atypical bacterial or viral infection as well. Legionella possible
   given multilobar infiltrates, recent GI symptoms, lethargy. No prior
   sputum cultures in our system.
   -Possible bronch/mini BAL pending culture results
   - Monitor sputum cultures - narrow antibiotics as soon as source known
   particularly given history of C. difficile infection
   - Monitor blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin, meropenem,
   -Add cipro for double pseudomonas coverage
   - Follow blood cultures drawn at [**Hospital 328**] Rehab
   - Viral swab
 collected today by respiratory therapy; some difficulty
   with collection and may not be adequate sample.
   .
   # Fever
 Most likely due to persistent pneumonia as above. Also
   consider midline infection.
   -f/u BCx
 may have to replace midline pending culture results.
   .
   #. Chronic respiratory failure:  Secondary to [**Last Name (un) 9456**]-[**Location (un) **]. Pt doing
   well on increased FiO2 50% compared to home settings on FiO2 35%.
   -wean vent to home settings
   -follow O2 sats
   -Do ABG with VBG. If results correlate well, can evaluate respiration
   with VBGs.
   -NIFs
   .
   #. Abdominal pain:  Mild RUQ tenderness. LFTs normal. Pt with history
   of C. diff colitis. No evidence of colitis or other intrabdominal
   pathology to explain abdominal pain. Given nontender abdominal exam and
   concurrent infection, concern for mesenteric ischemia given likely
   vascular disease and potential episodes of low blood pressure. Lactate
   1.8 is reassuring.
   - continue IV flagyl pending results.
   - Hold on vancomycin PO given that first need to confirm PEG tube
   placement
   - Consider RUQ ultrasound
   .
   #. Abnormal UA:  Recurrent urinary tract infections per report.
   Abnormal UA expected given chronic indwelling Foley catheter. Small
   leukocyte esterase, negative nitrite. UTI unlikely, although she is
   covered regardless with above listed antibiotics. In the ED, received
   linezolid for VRE coverage.
   - Follow urine culture
   .
   .
   #. Anemia:  MCV 96. Baseline unknown (no records in our system). No
   evidence of active bleeding at this time. Reportedly guaiaic negative,
   per rehab transfer note. Given low albumin, may be secondary to poor
   nutrition status. On folic acid at home.
   - Type and screen
   - Guaiac stools
   - F/u B12, folate
   .
   #. Lethargy:  Multiple potential sources, as listed above. Infection
   high on list given fever, leukocytosis so will cover with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics at this time. Also with rash at groin,
   although does not appear like cellulitis. ?concern for contribution
   from [**Last Name (un) 9456**] [**Location (un) **]. Had recent exacerbation which required IVIG.
   Anemic, although at baseline - and would not expect patient to be
   symptomatic at this hematocrit.
   - Infectious workup and treatment, as above
   - Closely monitor hematocrit
   -Touch base with pt
s neurologist re: status of her GBS and if this is
   actually CIPD given time course of disease.
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus, type II:  Tight blood glucose control
   particularly important in setting of infection.
   - Lantus, SSI per home regimen - half dose as cannot give tubefeeds
   until PEG tube placement confirmed
   .
   #. Heart failure:  Does not appear to be in overt heart failure at this
   time. Most recent TTE at [**Hospital1 403**] ([**6-5**]) was without indication of systolic
   dysfunction.
   .
   #. Anxiety:  Hold Klonipin given need to confirm PEG tube placement.
   Ativan IV as needed, low-dose.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: PEG tube may not be in place per most recent CT scan -final
   read pending; Will hold off on Fibersource HN Full strength 60cc/hour

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old ventilator-dependent female with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, chronic respiratory failure, pneumonia, and recurrent urinary tract infections. She was admitted from a rehabilitation facility with fever, diarrhea, and lethargy. She has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, and her current condition includes fever, bilateral fluffy infiltrates on chest X-ray, and worsening leukocytosis. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin for suspected multi-drug resistant organism. She also has a mild right upper quadrant tenderness, elevated lactate, and anemia with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 96. The patient's neurological status is limited, and she has impaired physical mobility and skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray suggests a possible infection. Appropriate antibiotics are being administered, and monitoring sputum cultures is recommended.
2. Atypical bacterial or viral infection: The bilateral ground-glass opacities seen on chest X-ray raise the possibility of an atypical infection. Legionella pneumonia should also be considered given the multilobar infiltrates and recent gastrointestinal symptoms.
3. Midline infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis"

   - Vancomycin, meropenem, azithromycin for atypicals (IV given need to
   first confirm PEG tube placement)
   - Chest CT for further characterization
   - Follow blood cultures drawn at [**Hospital 328**] Rehab
   - Viral swab
 collected today by respiratory therapy; some difficulty
   with collection and may not be adequate sample.

   #. Abdominal pain:  Mild RUQ tenderness. LFTs normal. Pt with history
   of C. diff colitis. No evidence of colitis or other intrabdominal
   pathology to explain abdominal pain. Given nontender abdominal exam and
   concurrent infection, concern for mesenteric ischemia given likely
   vascular disease and potential episodes of low blood pressure. Lactate
   1.8 is reassuring.
   - continue IV flagyl pending results.
   - Hold on vancomycin PO given that first need to confirm PEG tube
   placement
   - Consider RUQ ultrasound

   #. Patchy infiltrate on CXR:  Infection vs. fluid. No evidence of overt
   heart failure. Treatment of pulmonary infection as above.
   .
   #. Abnormal UA:  Recurrent urinary tract infections per report.
   Abnormal UA expected given chronic indwelling Foley catheter. Small
   leukocyte esterase, negative nitrite. UTI unlikely, although she is
   covered regardless with above listed antibiotics. In the ED, received
   linezolid for VRE coverage.
   - Follow urine culture

   #. Lethargy:  Multiple potential sources, as listed above. Infection
   high on list given fever, leukocytosis so will cover with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics at this time. Also with rash at groin,
   although does not appear like cellulitis. ?concern for contribution
   from [**Last Name (un) 9456**] [**Location (un) **]. Had recent exacerbation which required IVIG.
   Anemic, although at baseline - and would not expect patient to be
   symptomatic at this hematocrit.
   - Infectious workup and treatment, as above
   - Closely monitor hematocrit

   #. Diabetes mellitus, type II:  Tight blood glucose control
   particularly important in setting of infection.
   - Lantus, SSI per home regimen - half dose as cannot give tubefeeds
   until PEG tube placement confirmed

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, chronic respiratory failure, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and recent C. difficile infection. She was admitted to the ICU for invasive ventilation, PICC line placement, and further management of her conditions. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and IV fluids. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her vital signs are stable, but she shows signs of anxiety and impaired physical mobility. There are several potential medical complications to consider, including pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, and impaired physical mobility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure and recurrent urinary tract infections. She presents with consolidation in the left lower lobe and bilateral fluffy infiltrates, suggesting a possible bacterial or viral infection. Given her recent gastrointestinal symptoms and lethargy, there is a concern for atypical bacterial or viral infection as well. Monitoring sputum cultures, narrow antibiotics, and chest CT for further characterization are recommended.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has mild erythema surrounding the PEG insertion site and an erythematous patch on both thighs near the groin. These findings raise concerns about potential skin infections or complications related to the PEG tube placement. Close monitoring and appropriate wound care are necessary.

3. Impaired Physical Mobility: The patient's upper extrem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure and GBS/CIDP. She presents with fever, lethargy, and diarrhea. She has been admitted to the ICU and started on various antibiotics for multifocal pneumonia (PNA). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs show a fever, increased heart rate, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. She has a history of VAP and has been on multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem, azithromycin, and linezolid. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, high glucose levels, and decreased platelet count. Chest X-ray reveals multifocal infiltrates, and sputum culture indicates growth of gram-negative rods. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's history of chronic respiratory failure and recent intubation increase the risk of developing VAP. The presence of fever and multifocal infiltrates on chest X-ray could suggest a possible infection.
2. Drug-resistant infection: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, which may lead to the development of drug-resistant organisms. The sputum culture growing gram-negative rods indicates a possible bacterial infection.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's symptoms of fever, lethargy, and diarrhea could be indicative of an infectious or inflammatory process in the gastrointestinal tract. Clostridium difficile infection should be"

   68F ventilator-dependent secondary to [**Last Name (un) 9456**]-[**Location (un) **] vs CIPD,
   insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, recurrent urinary tract infections
   with chronic indwelling Foley catheter, recent C difficile infection on
   vancomycin PO admitted from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab for fever x1 week, diarrhea,
   and lethargy x1 days.
   .
   #. Pneumonia:  Consolidation in LLL, in addition to bilateral fluffy
   infiltrates. Has been covered with Vancomycin, Zosyn initially which
   are appropriate for VAP and more recently Vancomycin, Imipenem with
   worsening fevers and leukocytosis. Of note, Staph aureus fevers can
   cause recurrent fevers even when appropriately treated, although would
   not expect worsening leukocytosis, and would expect focal
   consolidation. Given bilateral ground glass opacities, concern for
   atypical bacterial or viral infection as well. Legionella possible
   given multilobar infiltrates, recent GI symptoms, lethargy. No prior
   sputum cultures in our system.
   -Possible bronch/mini BAL pending culture results
   - Monitor sputum cultures - narrow antibiotics as soon as source known
   particularly given history of C. difficile infection
   - Monitor blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin, meropenem,
   -Add cipro for double pseudomonas coverage
   - Follow blood cultures drawn at [**Hospital 328**] Rehab
   - Viral swab
 collected today by respiratory therapy; some difficulty
   with collection and may not be adequate sample.
   .
   # Fever
 Most likely due to persistent pneumonia as above. Also
   consider midline infection.
   -f/u BCx
 may have to replace midline pending culture results.

   #. Chronic respiratory failure:  Secondary to [**Last Name (un) 9456**]-[**Location (un) **]. Pt doing
   well on increased FiO2 50% compared to home settings on FiO2 35%.
   -wean vent to home settings
   -follow O2 sats
   -Do ABG with [**Location (un) 9481**]. If results correlate well, can evaluate respiration
   with VBGs.
   -NIFs
   .
   #. Abdominal pain:  Mild RUQ tenderness. LFTs normal. Pt with history
   of C. diff colitis. No evidence of colitis or other intrabdominal
   pathology to explain abdominal pain. Given nontender abdominal exam and
   concurrent infection, concern for mesenteric ischemia given likely
   vascular disease and potential episodes of low blood pressure. Lactate
   1.8 is reassuring.
   - continue IV flagyl pending results.
   - Hold on vancomycin PO given that first need to confirm PEG tube
   placement
   - Consider RUQ ultrasound
   .
   #. Abnormal UA:  Recurrent urinary tract infections per report.
   Abnormal UA expected given chronic indwelling Foley catheter. Small
   leukocyte esterase, negative nitrite. UTI unlikely, although she is
   covered regardless with above listed antibiotics. In the ED, received
   linezolid for VRE coverage.
   - Follow urine culture
   .
   #. Anemia:  MCV 96. Baseline unknown (no records in our system). No
   evidence of active bleeding at this time. Reportedly guaiaic negative,
   per rehab transfer note. Given low albumin, may be secondary to poor
   nutrition status. On folic acid at home.
   - Type and screen
   - Guaiac stools
   - F/u B12, folate
   .
   #. Lethargy:  Multiple potential sources, as listed above. Infection
   high on list given fever, leukocytosis so will cover with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics at this time. Also with rash at groin,
   although does not appear like cellulitis. ?concern for contribution
   from [**Last Name (un) 9456**] [**Location (un) **]. Had recent exacerbation which required IVIG.
   Anemic, although at baseline - and would not expect patient to be
   symptomatic at this hematocrit.
   - Infectious workup and treatment, as above
   - Closely monitor hematocrit
   -Touch base with pt
s neurologist re: status of her GBS and if this is
   actually CIPD given time course of disease.
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus, type II:  Tight blood glucose control
   particularly important in setting of infection.
   - Lantus, SSI per home regimen - half dose as cannot give tubefeeds
   until PEG tube placement confirmed
   .
   #. Heart failure:  Does not appear to be in overt heart failure at this
   time. Most recent TTE at [**Hospital1 403**] ([**6-5**]) was without indication of systolic

There is concern for atypical bacterial or viral infection, and Legionella is a possible consideration given multilobar infiltrates and recent gastrointestinal symptoms. Blood cultures are pending, and a viral swab was collected. The patient also has chronic respiratory failure, mild RUQ tenderness, abnormal UA, anemia, and lethargy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral fluffy infiltrates, worsening fevers, and leukocytosis. Given the history of COPD and recent antibiotic use, there is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Monitoring sputum cultures, narrow antibiotics as soon as the source is known, and follow-up blood cultures are important. The patient may require bronchoscopy with mini-BAL culture results.

2. Fever: The most likely cause of the fever is persistent pneumonia, but midline infection should also be"

   Assessment and Plan
   68F ventilator-dependent secondary to [**Last Name (un) 9456**]-[**Location (un) **] vs CIPD,
   insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, recurrent urinary tract infections
   with chronic indwelling Foley catheter, recent C difficile infection on
   vancomycin PO admitted from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab for fever x1 week, diarrhea,
   and lethargy x1 days.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Suspect she is pre-renal and hypovolemic as urine
   output is low, and she is increasingly somnolent/lethargic.  Plan to
   bolus with up to 4 liters of IVF and see if she responds.  If not,
   likely secondary to sepsis with source most likely PNA.
   - will need central line, mixed venous sat, CVP measurements if no
   response to fluid boluses
   - may require pressors to maintain MAP>60
   .
   #. Lethargy:  Multiple potential sources, as listed above. Infection
   high on list given fever, leukocytosis so will continue broad-spectrum
   antibiotics at this time. Also with rash at groin, although does not
   appear like cellulitis. ?concern for contribution from [**Last Name (un) 9456**] [**Location (un) **].
   Had recent exacerbation which required IVIG. Anemic, although at
   baseline - and would not expect patient to be symptomatic at this
   hematocrit.
   - f/u cultures and continue abx, as below
   - IVFs as above
   - Closely monitor hematocrit
   -Touch base with pt
s neurologist re: status of her GBS and if this is
   actually CIPD given time course of disease.
   .
   #. Pneumonia:  Continues to have bilateral patchy infiltrates which
   appear to be multifocal pneumonias with sputum culture growing 3
   different GNRs awaiting speciation.  Covering broadly with IV vanc for
   possible MRSA, [**Last Name (un) **] and levaquin for possible pseudomonas as she has
   ventilatory dependence and has been living in a rehab facility.
   Legionella urinary antigen negative.  No prior sputum cultures in our
   system.  Also concern for possible ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**] with bilateral infiltrates,
   P/F ratio just a little over 200.  Will institute low tidal volume
   ventilation of 4-6cc/kg.
   -Possible bronch/mini BAL pending culture results
   - Monitor sputum cultures - narrow antibiotics as soon as source known
   particularly given history of C. difficile infection
   - Monitor blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin, meropenem, levaquin
   - Follow blood cultures drawn at [**Hospital 328**] Rehab
   - f/u viral swab
   .
   #. Chronic respiratory failure:  Secondary to [**Last Name (un) 9456**]-[**Location (un) **]. Pt doing
   well on increased FiO2 40% compared to home settings on FiO2 35%.
   -wean vent to home settings
   -follow O2 sats
   -ABG correlates well with VBGs.
   -NIFs- most recent -35 yesterday
   .
   # Fever
 Most likely due to persistent pneumonia as above. Also
   consider midline infection.
   -f/u BCx
 may have to replace midline pending culture results.
   .
   #. Abdominal pain:  Pt with history of C. diff colitis on po vanc
   treatment on transfer from outside hospital.  Mild RUQ tenderness on
   admission with normal LFTs.  No evidence of colitis or other
   intrabdominal pathology to explain abdominal pain. Given nontender
   abdominal exam and concurrent infection, concern for mesenteric
   ischemia given likely vascular disease and potential episodes of low
   blood pressure. Lactate 1.8 is reassuring.
   - continue PO vanc empirically despite c diff toxin neg x 1
   - resend c diff
   - RUQ ultrasound to evaluate for source of pain/hypotension
   .
   #. Abnormal UA:  Recurrent urinary tract infections per report.
   Abnormal UA expected given chronic indwelling Foley catheter. Small
   leukocyte esterase, negative nitrite. UTI unlikely, although she is
   covered regardless with above listed antibiotics. In the ED, received
   linezolid for VRE coverage.   Urine cx showing yeast.  Will repeat U/A
   - repeat U/A
   .
   #. Anemia:  MCV 96. Baseline unknown (no records in our system). No
   evidence of active bleeding at this time. Reportedly guaiaic negative,
   per rehab transfer note. Given low albumin, may be secondary to poor
   nutrition status. On folic acid at home.
   - Type and screen
   - Guaiac stools
   - B12, folate nml
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus, type II:  Tight blood glucose control
   particularly important in setting of infection.
   - Lantus, SSI per home regimen
   - can resume home dose (was on half dose pending PEG tube placement
   confirmation)
   .
   #. Heart failure:  Most recent TTE at [**Hospital1 403**] ([**6-5**]) was without indication
   of systolic dysfunction.
   - f/u on previous echo, heart history; need more information
   .
   #. Anxiety:  Continue home klonopin and trazodone.

   Disposition:ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female who is ventilator-dependent due to COPD, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, recurrent urinary tract infections with chronic indwelling Foley catheter, and recent C. difficile infection. She was admitted from a rehabilitation facility for fever, diarrhea, and lethargy. 

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications and conditions, including hypotension, lethargy, pneumonia, chronic respiratory failure, fever, abdominal pain, abnormal urinalysis, anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and anxiety. 

The plan of care includes addressing these conditions by providing fluid resuscitation to manage hypotension, broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential infections, weaning off ventilatory support, monitoring oxygen saturation levels, conducting cultures and laboratory tests, and adjusting antibiotics based on culture results. The patient's diabetes management and glycemic control will also be monitored. Additionally, the team is considering the possibility of mesenteric ischemia and plans to perform an RUQ ultrasound to evaluate for any sources of pain or hypotension. 

The patient's family history and communication preferences have been noted, with the patient requesting that her nephew not be contacted. The patient's code status is set to full code. The patient will remain in the ICU for further management and observation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of CIDP (Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy) and chronic respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU for multifocal pneumonia (PNA). Her current condition includes hypotension, lethargy, decreased urine output, and increasing FiO2 requirements. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and signs of infection suggest a possible septic state.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The worsening patchy opacities on imaging and increasing FiO2 requirements are concerning for the development of ARDS.
3. Organism-Related Infections: Multifocal PNA is present, and the sputum culture shows growth of gram-negative rods (GNRs). It is important to identify the specific GNR causing the infection.
4. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen due to the current PNA and potential development of ARDS.
5. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) Infection: RUQ tenderness and negative urinary legionella test raise suspicion for C. diff infection, especially in the context of recent antibiotic use.
6. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's high bicarbonate level and low partial pressure of carbon dioxide ("

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o female w/ a history of GBS/CIDP and chronic respiratory failure
   since [**Month (only) 807**], a/w multifocal pna.
   Hypotension
 concerning for sepsis in the setting of elev WBCC and
   multifocal opacities.   Increasingly somnolent.  Now received 2L NS w/o
   improvement.   Check lactate.   Will need central access and CVP
   monitoring.
   Multifocal PNA
 GNRs sputum.   Given improvement in WBCC and sputum,
   GNRs seem the likely source and limited utility to lower resp tract
   sampling at this time.  Cont vanc/meropenem. Changed to levofloxacin
   for better atypical coverage, as well as empiric pseudomonas
   coverage.   Urinary legionella is neg.   If  sputum does not provide
   likely etiology, will need lower airway sampling.
   Chronic Respiratory Failure
NIF yesterday 30.  Worsening patchy
   opacities and increasing FiO2 concerning for developing ARDS. P/F is
   215 c/w [**Doctor Last Name 11**].  Will move to low tidal volume strategy.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and chronic respiratory failure, presenting with multifocal pneumonia (PNA). She has been experiencing hypotension and decreased urine output. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. She has a tracheostomy tube in place.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure in the 80s, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her weight is currently 145 kg.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.8 K/uL and a decreased hematocrit (Hct) level of 23.4%. Her platelet count (Plt) is within normal range at 489 K/uL. Other lab values such as creatinine (Cr), blood glucose, and liver function tests (LFTs) are also provided.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's hypotension is concerning for sepsis, especially with elevated WBC and multifocal opacities seen on imaging. She is increasingly somnolent and has received 2 liters of normal saline without improvement. Lactate levels should be checked, and the patient will need central access and central venous pressure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a history of fever, unknown origin. She has type I diabetes mellitus, anxiety, impaired skin integrity, and impaired physical mobility. The patient's current condition includes septic shock, chronic respiratory failure, lethargy, abnormal urine analysis, anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotensive state overnight and decreased urine output suggest septic shock. The multifocal pneumonia seen on the chest X-ray indicates a possible source of infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure secondary to an unspecified respiratory condition. The respiratory acidosis and increased respiratory rate indicate inadequate ventilation.
3. Lethargy: The patient's lethargy could be due to multiple factors such as infection, diabetes, or anemia. The fever and leukocytosis suggest that infection is a potential cause.
4. Urinary Tract Infection: The abnormal urine analysis showing yeast may indicate a urinary tract infection. However, the small leukocyte esterase and negative nitrite make a urinary tract infection less likely.
5. Anemia: The patient requires transfusion and has an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV). The anemia could be secondary to poor nutrition or blood loss.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type I diabetes mellitus. Tight blood glucose control is essential,"

   Disposition:ICU for now
","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type I, anxiety, and impaired physical mobility. She was admitted to the ICU from a rehabilitation facility due to fever, diarrhea, and lethargy. The patient has been ventilator-dependent secondary to COPD exacerbation versus CIPD, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, recurrent urinary tract infections with chronic indwelling Foley catheter, and recent C. difficile infection.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, lethargy, fever, pneumonia, chronic respiratory failure, abdominal pain, anemia, and abnormal urine analysis. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and receiving IV fluids. She is also being weaned off ventilator support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis with possible sources such as pneumonia, central line infection, or urinary tract infection. There is also a concern for mesenteric ischemia given her vascular disease and potential episodes of low blood pressure. Additionally, the patient may require further evaluation for her anemia and abnormal urine analysis results.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, blood cultures, and response to treatment. Frequent assessments of her oxygen saturation levels and ABG results should be done to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Regular follow-up with the neurologist regarding her GBS status and CIPD is necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yof h/o GBS/CIDP and chronic respiratory failure since [**Month (only) 807**], now
   with diffuse lung infiltrates and respiratory failure.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis in the setting of elevated WBC and
   multifocal lung opacities. No evidence for bleeding, cardiac event,
   pulmonary embolism.  Refusing central line placement, so no CVP
   monitoring.  Maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.   Consider check adrenal axis if
   continues to experience hypotension.
   SEPSIS -- septic shock.  LIkely source include lungs (either
   pneumonia-multifocal; or septic emboli-no evidence for bacteremia),
   although allso concern urinary source or C. diff --> po vanco.
   Continue current level of support.
   DIFFUSE PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Multifocal PNA with component of ARDS
 GNRs in  sputum, concern for Pseudomonas.  Continue vancomycin,
   meropenem, levofloxacin.   No evidence for Legionella.  Current CXR
   raises concern for cavitating process (concern for Pseudomonas,
   Staph).   If  sputum does not provide likely etiology, will need lower
   airway sampling.
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE -- Acute pneumonia on background of chronic
   respriatory failure (neurological disease).  NIF= 30 yesterday.
   Worsening patchy opacities and increasing FiO2 concerning for
   developing ARDS. P/F is 215 c/w [**Doctor Last Name 11**].  Will move to low tidal volume
   strategy.
   RUQ tenderness -- CT abdomen unrevealing.  Possible  C.diff -->
   empirical PO vanco.   C.diff toxin pending.    Continued on IV
   flagyl.   No evid of ischemic bowel.  RUQ u/s.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS -- Sepsis and possible volume depletion.  Follow up
   on ABG.
   THIGH RASH -- likely fungal -->
   ANEMIA -- Guiac neg.  No evidence of active blood loss.  B12/folate
   nl.  Cont to follow.
   NIDDM -- ISS.
   ANXIETY --  IV ativan.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome/CIDP and chronic respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU due to diffuse lung infiltrates and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/60 mmHg to 144/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese, no signs of pallor or jaundice, and warm skin without rashes. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal muscle tone. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb), and normal platelet count (Plt). The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and other lab values are within normal range.

The assessment and plan include several conditions: hypotension attributed to sepsis with elevated WBC and multifocal lung opacities, septic shock likely originating from the lungs or urinary tract, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates with concern for pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure due to acute pneumonia on a background of chronic respiratory failure, and metabolic acidosis likely secondary to sepsis and possible"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yof h/o GBS/CIDP and chronic respiratory failure since [**Month (only) 807**], now
   with diffuse lung infiltrates and respiratory failure.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis in the setting of elevated WBC and
   multifocal lung opacities. No evidence for bleeding, cardiac event,
   pulmonary embolism.  Refusing central line placement, so no CVP
   monitoring.  Maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.   Consider check adrenal axis if
   continues to experience hypotension.
   SEPSIS -- septic shock.  LIkely source include lungs (either
   pneumonia-multifocal; or septic emboli-no evidence for bacteremia),
   although allso concern urinary source or C. diff --> po vanco.
   Continue current level of support.
   DIFFUSE PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Multifocal PNA with component of ARDS
 GNRs in  sputum, concern for Pseudomonas.  Continue vancomycin,
   meropenem, levofloxacin.   No evidence for Legionella.  Current CXR
   raises concern for cavitating process (concern for Pseudomonas,
   Staph).   If  sputum does not provide likely etiology, will need lower
   airway sampling.
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE -- Acute pneumonia on background of chronic
   respriatory failure (neurological disease).  NIF= 30 yesterday.
   Worsening patchy opacities and increasing FiO2 concerning for
   developing ARDS. P/F is 215 c/w [**Doctor Last Name 11**].  Will move to low tidal volume
   strategy.
   RUQ tenderness -- CT abdomen unrevealing.  Possible  C.diff -->
   empirical PO vanco.   C.diff toxin pending.    Continued on IV
   flagyl.   No evid of ischemic bowel.  RUQ u/s.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS -- Sepsis and possible volume depletion.  Follow up
   on ABG.
   THIGH RASH -- likely fungal -->
   ANEMIA -- Guiac neg.  No evidence of active blood loss.  B12/folate
   nl.  Cont to follow.
   NIDDM -- ISS.
   ANXIETY --  IV ativan.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)/chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and chronic respiratory failure. He presents with diffuse lung infiltrates, respiratory failure, hypotension, sepsis, and possible metabolic acidosis. The patient has been mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which was attributed to sepsis. It is important to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. The cause of hypotension should be further investigated, including checking the adrenal axis if persistent.

2. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with septic shock likely originating from the lungs, with multifocal lung opacities indicating pneumonia. Other potential sources of infection include the urinary tract or Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and lower airway sampling may be required if sputum does not provide the likely etiology.

3. Diffuse Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient has multifocal pneumonia with a concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Gram-negative rods (GNRs) are present in the sputum, raising concern for Pseudomonas infection. Current antibiotic coverage should be continued"

   Assessment and Plan
   68F ventilator-dependent secondary to [**Last Name (un) 9456**]-[**Location (un) **] vs CIPD,
   insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, recurrent urinary tract infections
   with chronic indwelling Foley catheter, recent C difficile infection on
   vancomycin PO admitted from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab for fever x1 week, diarrhea,
   and lethargy x1 days.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Hypotension and UOP improved yesterday without
   pressors or fluid boluses.  Pt refused central line but PICC was placed
   yesterday.  Possible sources include her multifocal pneumonia which is
   concerning for necrotizing PNA given cavitation seen on CXR. Also, C.
   diff as pt c/o abdominal pain and was being treated for it at [**Hospital 328**]
   rehab. C. diff was negative x2 here. RUQ ultrasound does not
   demonstrate cholelithiasis.
   -          maintain MAP>60, UOP with goal 30-40cc/hour
   -          Changing abx to cefepime given possible drug rash to
   meropenem
   -          D/C IV vanc as MRSA screen negative and only pseudomonas
   seen on sputum cx
   -          Continuing po vanc until she is off other abx for 1 week
   given h/o c diff
           -    Plan for chest CT today to eval cavitatary lesions
          -     F/u blood cultures
          -    Blood cultures drawn at [**Hospital 328**] Rehab continue to be
   negative (checked today)
          -    resp viral screen negative
   .
   # Chronic respiratory failure:  Secondary to [**Last Name (un) 9456**]-[**Location (un) **]. Pt with
   respiratory acidosis and RR increased yesterday but tidal volume
   remains low.  Now has A line for ABG draws.  Do not suspect ARDS (given
   her P/F>200) and in light of continued respiratory acidosis despite
   increased RR, will plan to transition back towards her home vent
   settings (AC
   -Increase RR today to 24 to facilitate expiration of CO2 and check ABG
   -Insert A-line for better BP monitoring and ease of ABG draws
    -follow O2 sats
   - follow NIFs
   .
   #. Lethargy:  Multiple potential sources, as listed above. Infection
   high on list given fever, leukocytosis so will continue broad-spectrum
   antibiotics at this time. Also with rash at groin, although does not
   appear like cellulitis. ?concern for contribution from [**Last Name (un) 9456**] [**Location (un) **].
   Had recent exacerbation which required IVIG. Anemic, although at
   baseline - and would not expect patient to be symptomatic at this
   hematocrit.
   - f/u cultures and continue abx, as below
   - IVFs as above
   - Closely monitor hematocrit
   -Touch base with pt
s neurologist re: status of her GBS and if this is
   actually CIPD given time course of disease.
   .
   #. Abnormal UA:  Recurrent urinary tract infections per report.
   Abnormal UA expected given chronic indwelling Foley catheter. Small
   leukocyte esterase, negative nitrite. UTI unlikely, although she is
   covered regardless with above listed antibiotics. In the ED, received
   linezolid for VRE coverage.   Urine cx showing yeast.
   - repeat U/A
   .
   #. Anemia:  MCV 96. Required transfusion yesterday. Baseline unknown
   (no records in our system). No evidence of active bleeding at this
   time. Reportedly guaiaic negative, per rehab transfer note. Given low
   albumin, may be secondary to poor nutrition status. On folic acid at
   home. Also, possibility of blood in lung.
   - Type and screen
   - Guaiac stools
   - B12, folate nml
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus, type II:  Tight blood glucose control
   particularly important in setting of infection.
   - Lantus, SSI per home regimen
   - resumed home dose
   .
   #. Heart failure:  Most recent TTE at [**Hospital1 403**] ([**6-5**]) was without indication
   of systolic dysfunction.
   -          f/u on previous echo, heart history; need more information
   -       Records requested from [**Hospital1 403**] [**2177-7-14**] at 1600.

   Disposition:ICU for now
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of ventilator-dependent secondary to COPD, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, recurrent urinary tract infections with chronic indwelling Foley catheter, and recent C. difficile infection admitted from rehab for fever, diarrhea, and lethargy. She is currently in the ICU due to septic shock, chronic respiratory failure, lethargy, abnormal urinalysis, anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and heart failure.

The patient's recent events include an increase in PCO2 on ABG, resulting in an increase in respiratory rate. She was placed on AC 400x 24 with FiO2 40% and PEEP 5, which improved her oxygenation with a current SpO2 of 94%. A chest X-ray showed cavities concerning for necrotizing pneumonia. The patient also has a large rash over her chest and arms, which is non-painful, non-tender, and non-itchy. It was initially attributed to a drug rash and the IV Vancomycin was held. However, the MRSA screen was negative, and only pseudomonas was seen on sputum culture. Therefore, the antibiotics were changed to cefepime.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.6C (101.5F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/48 to 122/62 mmHg, respiratory rate"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yof h/o GBS/CIDP and chronic respiratory failure since [**2177-4-28**],
   now with diffuse lung infiltrates and respiratory failure.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis in the setting of elevated WBC and
   multifocal lung opacities. No evidence for bleeding, cardiac event,
   pulmonary embolism.  Refusing central line placement, so no CVP
   monitoring.  Maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.   Consider check adrenal axis if
   continues to experience hypotension.
   SEPSIS -- septic shock.  Likely source include lungs (either
   pneumonia-multifocal; or septic emboli-no evidence for bacteremia),
   although also concern urinary source or C. diff --> po vanco.  Continue
   current level of support.
   DIFFUSE PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Multifocal PNA with component of ARDS
 GNRs in  sputum, Pseudomonas isolated on sputum specimen.  Continue
   vancomycin, meropenem, levofloxacin.   No evidence for Legionella.
   Current CXR raises concern for cavitating process (concern for
   Pseudomonas, Staph) --> consider CT scan to further define.   If
   sputum does not provide likely etiology, will need lower airway
   sampling.
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE -- Acute pneumonia on background of chronic
   respriatory failure (neurological disease).  NIF= 30 yesterday.
   Worsening patchy opacities and increasing FiO2 concerning for
   developing ARDS. P/F is 215 c/w [**Doctor Last Name 11**].  Will move to low tidal volume
   strategy.
   SKIN RASH -- likely drug-related.  Suspect antibiotic most likely.
   Will D/C meropenem --> tobramycin & aztreonam.
   RUQ tenderness -- CT abdomen unrevealing.  Possible  C.diff -->
   empirical PO vanco.   C.diff toxin pending.    Continued on IV
   flagyl.   No evid of ischemic bowel.  RUQ u/s.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS -- Sepsis and possible volume depletion.  Follow up
   on ABG.
   THIGH RASH -- likely fungal --> local care.
   ANEMIA -- Guiac neg.  No evidence of active blood loss.  B12/folate
   nl.  Cont to follow.
   NIDDM -- monitor glucose, maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 continue TF via PEG.
   ANXIETY --  IV ativan prn.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Guillain-Barre syndrome and chronic respiratory failure, now presenting with diffuse lung infiltrates and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 38.6°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 95/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension, sepsis, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, respiratory failure, skin rash, and metabolic acidosis. The hypotension is attributed to sepsis, likely originating from the lungs or possibly the urinary tract. The diffuse pulmonary infiltrates are consistent with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with Pseudomonas aeruginosa identified in sputum specimens. The patient's respiratory failure is due to acute pneumonia on the background of chronic respiratory failure caused by neurological disease.

The skin rash is suspected to be drug-related, possibly due to the antibiotic meropenem. The ruq tenderness is likely related to Clostridium difficile infection, and empirical treatment with oral vancomycin has been initiated. The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to sepsis and possible volume depletion.

Other findings include anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and anxiety. The patient's nutritional support includes total parenteral nutrition (TF) via percutaneous end"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Guillain-Barre Syndrome/Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (GBS/CIDP) and chronic respiratory failure, now presenting with diffuse lung infiltrates and respiratory failure. The patient has been mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy since [**2177-4-28**].

Assessment and Plan:
1. HYPOTENSION: The patient is experiencing hypotension attributed to sepsis. There is no evidence of bleeding, cardiac events, or pulmonary embolism. Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring is not being performed due to the patient's refusal of central line placement. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. If the hypotension continues, consider checking the adrenal axis.
2. SEPSIS: The patient is in septic shock with likely sources including the lungs (pneumonia or septic emboli), although there is also concern for a urinary source or Clostridium difficile infection. Continue current antibiotic support with vancomycin, meropenem, and levofloxacin. Consider a CT scan to further define the cavitating process on the chest X-ray, which raises concern for Pseudomonas or Staphylococcus infection. Lower airway sampling may be needed if sputum does not provide the likely etiology.

   showed multifocal pneumonia, no effusions, no abscesses, no
   cavitations.   Sputum grew pseudomonas.  Also, C. diff as pt c/o
   abdominal pain and was being treated for it at [**Hospital 328**] rehab. C. diff
   was negative x2 here. RUQ ultrasound does not demonstrate
   cholelithiasis.
   - maintain MAP>60, UOP with goal 30-40cc/hour

   potential sources, as listed above. Infection high on list but also
   concern for contribution from [**Last Name (un) 9456**] [**Location (un) **]. Had recent exacerbation
   which required IVIG. Anemic, although at baseline - and would not
   expect patient to be symptomatic at this hematocrit.

   #. Anemia:  Normocytic. Baseline unknown (no records in our system). No
   evidence of active bleeding at this time. Reportedly guaiaic negative,
   per rehab transfer note. Given low albumin, may be secondary to poor

","The patient is a 68-year-old female admitted from a rehabilitation center with a chief complaint of fever, diarrhea, and lethargy. She has a history of chronic respiratory failure, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, recurrent urinary tract infections with chronic indwelling Foley catheter, recent Clostridium difficile infection on vancomycin PO, and septic shock. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. She also has impaired skin integrity, impaired physical mobility, and anxiety.

The patient's recent events include switching back to her home ventilation settings, changing antibiotics to cefepime due to a possible drug rash to meropenem, and continuing PO vancomycin until she is off other antibiotics for 1 week given her history of C. difficile. Blood cultures from the rehabilitation center are negative. The patient's O2 sats are being monitored, and she is being kept on FiO2 of 0.4 to help with the pneumonia.

Other assessments and plans include lethargy, which is improving and now more alert and interactive, possibly due to infection or contribution from [Last Name (un) 9456]-[Location (un)]. Diabetes mellitus type I is being managed with tight blood glucose control, especially important in the setting of infection. Anxiety is being managed with home klonopin and trazodone.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, type II diabetes mellitus, and obesity admitted to the ICU for fever, lethargy, and diarrhea. She has been ventilator-dependent secondary to pneumonia, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, recurrent urinary tract infections with chronic indwelling Foley catheter, and a recent C. difficile infection. The patient's current conditions include septic shock, chronic respiratory failure, lethargy, impaired skin integrity, impaired physical mobility, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and improved urine output indicate septic shock. Possible sources include multifocal pneumonia, which is concerning for necrotizing pneumonia given cavitation seen on chest X-ray. Also, C. difficile as the patient complains of abdominal pain and was being treated for it at the previous hospital.

2. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and increased respiratory rate suggest chronic respiratory failure secondary to [Last Name (un) 9456]-[Location (un)]. The patient's tidal volume remains low, and she has an arterial line for ABG draws. The patient does not have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) given her PaO2/FiO2 ratio >200.

3. Lethargy: The patient's lethargy could be due to multiple potential sources, including infection or exacerbation of [Last Name (un) 9456]-[Location (un)]. Recent exacerbation required IVIG. Anemia, although at baseline, would not expect the patient to be symptomatic at this hematocrit.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is normocytic, and the baseline is unknown. There is no evidence of active bleeding, but the patient may have poor nutrition status indicated by low albumin. The possibility of blood in the lung should also be considered.

5. Diabetes mellitus, type II: Tight blood glucose control is particularly important in the setting of infection.

6. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety will require continuation of home klonopin and trazodone.

Potential Medical Complications to Monitor:
- Maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 and urine output with a goal of 30-40cc/hour.
- Change antibiotics to cefepime due to possible drug rash to meropenem.
- Discontinue IV vancomycin as MRSA screen is negative, and only pseudomonas seen on sputum culture.
- Continue po vanc until the patient is off other antibiotics for 1 week due to history of C. difficile.
- Plan for chest CT today to evaluate cavitary lesions.
- Follow up blood cultures.
- Transition back towards home vent settings (AC 500x12 FiO2 0.35, PEEP 5).
- Follow O2 sats.
- Discontinue NIFs as the patient is vent-dependent at baseline.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of GBS/CIDP and chronic respiratory failure, now presenting with multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He is mechanically ventilated due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on a background of chronic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 95/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is overweight and appears comfortable without any signs of pain or distress. 

Physical examination reveals normal cardiovascular and respiratory findings, with trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination shows normal tone, purposeful movement, and orientation. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal limits or show no significant abnormalities.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure - Acute pneumonia and ARDS on a background of chronic respiratory failure. The patient has shown clinical improvement, and mechanical ventilation should continue.
2. Diffuse pulmonary infiltrates - Multifocal pneumonia with a component of ARDS. Gram-negative rods (GNRs) in sputum, and Pseudomonas isolated on sputum specimen. Antibiotics vancomycin, meropenem, and levofloxacin should be continued.
3. Hypotension - Attributed to sepsis, now resolved. Monitor blood pressure and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg.
4. Sepsis - Resolved.
5. Skin rash - Likely drug-related. Suspect antibiotic most likely, but unclear. Tobramycin and aztreonam have been started instead of meropenem.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yof h/o GBS/CIDP and chronic respiratory failure since [**2177-4-28**],
   now with multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure.
   RESPRIATORY FAILURE -- Acute pneumonia and ARDS on background of
   chronic respriatory failure (neurological disease).  No complications
   by chest CT.  Clinical improvement.  Continue mechanical ventilation.
   DIFFUSE PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- Multifocal PNA with component of ARDS
 GNRs in  sputum, Pseudomonas isolated on sputum specimen.  Continue
   vancomycin, meropenem, levofloxacin.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, now resolved.   Monitor BP,
   maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- resolved.
   SKIN RASH -- likely drug-related.  Suspect antibiotic most likely, but
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 133**] D/C meropenem --> tobramycin & aztreonam
  Now on
   Cefopime.
   RUQ tenderness
 Resolved. CT abdomen unrevealing.  Possible  C.diff
   --> empirical PO vanco.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS -- Sepsis and possible volume depletion.  Follow up
   on ABG.
   THIGH RASH -- likely fungal --> local care.
   ANEMIA -- Guiac neg.  No evidence of active blood loss.  B12/folate
   nl.  Cont to follow.
   NIDDM -- monitor glucose, maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome/Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (GBS/CIDP) and chronic respiratory failure since 04/28/2177. The patient is currently experiencing multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure.

The patient has been mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy tube, with ventilator settings near baseline. The patient shows signs of clinical improvement, but still remains critically ill.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying chronic respiratory failure may worsen due to the acute pneumonia and ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). Close monitoring and management of respiratory function will be necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia with GNRs (Gram-negative rods) in the sputum, and Pseudomonas isolated on sputum specimen. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued to treat the infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient had an episode of hypotension attributed to sepsis, but it has since resolved. Monitoring blood pressure and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg will be important to prevent recurrent hypotension.
4. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has resolved, ongoing monitoring and prompt identification of any new signs of infection are crucial.
5. Skin rash: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU for septic shock secondary to multifocal pneumonia. She also has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, recurrent urinary tract infections with chronic indwelling Foley catheter, and recent C. difficile infection. The patient was transferred from Hospital 328 Rehab for fever, diarrhea, and lethargy. Her vital signs are stable, but she requires ventilator support. She has a diffuse erythematous macular rash across her chest and arms, which is improving. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood cultures have been negative. The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to an acute insult from multifocal pneumonia. She is being treated with cefepime and vancomycin, and her FiO2 has been increased to help with the pneumonia. Her lethargy is improving, but multiple potential sources, including infection and [Last Name (un) 9456]-[Location (un)], need to be considered. The patient also has normocytic anemia, likely due to poor nutrition status, and type II diabetes mellitus. She is anxious and will continue with home medications for anxiety and depression. The patient is receiving nutrition support and prophylactic treatments for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

   - Follow-up cultures and continue abx, as above
   - Closely monitor hematocrit

4. Anemia: Normocytic. Baseline unknown (no records in our system). No evidence of active bleeding at this time. Reportedly guaiac negative, per rehab transfer note. Given low albumin, may be secondary to poor nutrition status. On folic acid at home.

   - Guaiac stools
   - B12, folate nml
   - Normal iron level but decreased TIBC, elevated ferritin

5. Diabetes mellitus, type II: Tight blood glucose control particularly important in setting of infection.
   - Lantus, SSI per home regimen
   - Resumed home dose

6. Anxiety: Continue home klonopin and trazodone.

7. Depression: Questionable report of abuse at nursing home.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of ventilator dependence due to [Last Name (un)]-[Location (un)], insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, recurrent urinary tract infections with chronic indwelling Foley catheter, recent C. difficile infection on vancomycin PO admitted from [Hospital 328] Rehab for fever x1 week, diarrhea, and lethargy x1 day. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, chronic respiratory failure, lethargy, anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient had stable blood pressure and no requirement for IV fluid boluses. CT scan showed multifocal pneumonia without effusions, abscesses, or cavitations. Sputum grew pseudomonas. C. difficile infection was negative twice in the ICU. RUQ ultrasound did not demonstrate cholelithiasis.
   - Maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg.
   - Continue cefepime due to possible drug rash from meropenem.
   - Continue PO vanc until off other antibiotics for 1 week given history of C. difficile.
   - Follow-up blood cultures are negative.

2. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to [Last Name (un)]-[Location (un)]. Acute insult due to multifocal pneumonia. Transitioned back to home vent settings (AC "
