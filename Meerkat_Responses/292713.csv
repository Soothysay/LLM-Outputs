   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment:
   69 year old man with septic shock from Group A Strep cellulitis and
   compartment syndrome now with persistent renal failure and respiratory
   failure. Markedly hypertensive and hyperglycemic.  Now w/ leukocytosis
   and significant left shift.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: concerning for VAP; [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, has developed thick
   secretions; does not appear to have baseline CO2 retention from obesity
   (as would be expected from an obesity/hypoventillation syndrome)
   -  CXR was suggestive of ETT displacement.  Was bronched at bedside and
   tube replaced.
   - sputum Gram stain/culture
   - D/c PCN G and clinda, add piperacillin/tazobactam to cover VAP
   pathogens,  vancomycin for MRSA coverage, and flagyl for c.diff
   - BP control with labetalol drip (hypertension has precluded the team's
   ability to wean sedation)
   .
   ## Acute renal failure due to ischemic ATN +/- very mild rhabdomyolysis
   in the setting of septic shock; CVVH stopped this morning and
   nephrology planning on initiating hemodialysis in AM for volume
   overload
   - minimize IV fluids
   - HD today per renal for management of volume overload/hypertension
   - Per pharmacy, if pt gets HD, will need to add 500 mg vanc s/p
   dialysis.  Also, change zosyn to q8h
   - normal acid-base balance currently; potassium normal
   .
   ## Septic shock; initial septic shock seems to have resolved, but new
   leukocytosis concerning for new infection; most likely is VAP given
   inability to wean from ventilator and thick secretions being suctioned;
   line infection also possible
   - add on WBC differential
   - Blood and sputum cultures pending
   - Will empirically add flagyl to cover for c. diff (pt has not stooled
   and can not test but pt has been on clinda.  Will d/c clinda)
   - change penicillin to piperacillin/tazobactam as above; add vancomycin
   for MRSA coverage to cover VAP pathogens
   - ID input appreciated
   .
   ## Type 2 diabetes mellitus; markedly hyperglycemic requiring very
   large insulin doses on insulin drip
   - hourly fingersticks
   - cont insulin drip and titrate to goal FSBG <150
   .
   ## Hypertension: marked hypertension poorly-controlled on current
   regimen
   - On labetalol drip.  Also, restarted amlodipine (one home BP med that
   was not nephrotoxic
   - HD tomorrow per renal likely to improve volume status somewhat
   .
   ## Compartment syndrome s/p fasciotomy
   - wound care per surgical team
   .
   ## Hyperlipidemia: cont statin
   .
   ## Bilirubinemia: could represent underlying fatty liver disease; has
   been stable
   - Total was 3.1, direct 2.6
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation; had brief post-op atrial fibrillation at
   [**Hospital 3296**] Hospital, though it has not been an issue here
   - cont to monitor; if recurs, consider anticoagulation
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds with free water flushes
   ## ICU Care: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; ppi for stress ulcer
   prophylaxis
   ## Communication: wife [**Name (NI) 1828**] (home [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4973**]; cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4974**]);

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old man with septic shock from Group A Strep cellulitis and compartment syndrome.
- He has persistent renal failure and respiratory failure.
- The patient is markedly hypertensive and hyperglycemic.
- He has leukocytosis with a significant left shift.
- The patient has respiratory failure and is suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- His acute renal failure is due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and possibly very mild rhabdomyolysis.
- The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and markedly elevated blood glucose levels.
- He also has uncontrolled hypertension.
- The patient has compartment syndrome and requires wound care.
- Other medical conditions include hyperlipidemia, bilirubinemia, atrial fibrillation, and obesity.
- The patient's family has been informed and is available for communication.
- The patient's code status is full code, and he is being kept in the ICU for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory failure and inability to wean from the ventilator suggest the possibility of VAP. This is supported by the presence of thick secretions and a recent change in sputum color or consistency.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient in the ICU has had several events over the past 24 hours, including replacing an arterial line and an increasing white blood cell count with a left shift. The patient also has multiple allergies, specifically to quinolones, and unknown allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was given, and the patient is currently receiving various infusions and other ICU medications. There are no changes to the medical and family history. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for some noted below.

The vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring show that the patient is stable with no significant changes in fluid balance. The respiratory support includes ABG results indicating normal oxygenation levels. Physical examination findings are not assessed in various areas such as peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and more.

Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and a slightly decreased hematocrit (Hct). Platelet count (Plt) is within normal range, but creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated. Blood glucose levels are also high. Other lab results, including coagulation profiles, cardiac markers, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and renal function tests, are within normal limits or show only slight abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Infection: The increasing WBC count with a left shift suggests a possible infection. The elevated Cr levels may indicate kidney dysfunction related to sepsis or another underlying"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital with septic shock caused by Group A Strep cellulitis and compartment syndrome after lower extremity fasciotomy. He currently has persistent renal and respiratory failure, as well as hyperglycemia controlled with an insulin drip. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated with a left shift, indicating an infection. He is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics but may require further identification and treatment. The patient's respiratory failure is concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and he is being treated accordingly. His acute renal failure is due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and very mild rhabdomyolysis, and he is on hemodialysis (HD) with minimal urine output. His blood glucose levels are under control with an insulin drip. The patient's hypertension has been controlled through aggressive HD. He also has compartment syndrome post-fasciotomy, hyperlipidemia, and stable bilirubinemia, which could be related to underlying fatty liver disease. The patient is receiving tube feeds with free water flushes, SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis, and a PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis. His code status is full code, and he is to be dispositioned to the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory failure raises concern for VAP"

   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: concerning for VAP; [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, has developed thick
   secretions; does not appear to have baseline CO2 retention from obesity
   (as would be expected from an obesity/hypoventillation syndrome)
   -  CXR was suggestive of ETT displacement.  Was bronched at bedside and
   tube replaced.
   - sputum Gram stain/culture
   - D/c PCN G and clinda, add piperacillin/tazobactam to cover VAP
   pathogens,  vancomycin for MRSA coverage, and flagyl for c.diff
   - BP control with labetalol drip (hypertension has precluded the team's
   ability to wean sedation)
   .
   ## Acute renal failure due to ischemic ATN +/- very mild rhabdomyolysis
   in the setting of septic shock; CVVH stopped this morning and
   nephrology planning on initiating hemodialysis in AM for volume
   overload
   - minimize IV fluids
   - HD today per renal for management of volume overload/hypertension
   - Per pharmacy, if pt gets HD, will need to add 500 mg vanc s/p
   dialysis.  Also, change zosyn to q8h
   - normal acid-base balance currently; potassium normal
   .
   ## Septic shock; initial septic shock seems to have resolved, but new
   leukocytosis concerning for new infection; most likely is VAP given
   inability to wean from ventilator and thick secretions being suctioned;
   line infection also possible
   - add on WBC differential
   - Blood and sputum cultures pending
   - Will empirically add flagyl to cover for c. diff (pt has not stooled
   and can not test but pt has been on clinda.  Will d/c clinda)
   - change penicillin to piperacillin/tazobactam as above; add vancomycin
   for MRSA coverage to cover VAP pathogens
   - ID input appreciated
   .
   ## Type 2 diabetes mellitus; markedly hyperglycemic requiring very
   large insulin doses on insulin drip
   - hourly fingersticks
   - cont insulin drip and titrate to goal FSBG <150
   .
   ## Hypertension: marked hypertension poorly-controlled on current
   regimen
   - On labetalol drip.  Also, restarted amlodipine (one home BP med that
   was not nephrotoxic
   - HD tomorrow per renal likely to improve volume status somewhat
   .
   ## Compartment syndrome s/p fasciotomy
   - wound care per surgical team

   ## Hyperlipidemia: cont statin
   .
   ## Bilirubinemia: could represent underlying fatty liver disease; has
   been stable
   - Total was 3.1, direct 2.6

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with septic shock from Group A Strep cellulitis and compartment syndrome. He now has persistent renal failure and respiratory failure. The patient is also hypertensive, hyperglycemic, leukocytosis with a significant left shift, and has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's inability to wean from the ventilator and the presence of thick secretions suggest a possible VAP. Appropriate antibiotics have been added to cover this infection.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has persistent renal failure due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and very mild rhabdomyolysis in the setting of septic shock. Hemodialysis has been initiated for volume overload and hypertension.
3. Septic shock: Although initial septic shock seems to have resolved, the new leukocytosis is concerning for a new infection, most likely VAP or a line infection. Blood and sputum cultures are pending, and empirical antibiotic coverage has been started.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient is markedly hyperglycemic, requiring very large insulin doses on an insulin drip. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels will be necessary to maintain glycemic control.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is poorly"

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital with septic shock caused by Group A Strep cellulitis and compartment syndrome after undergoing left lower extremity fasciotomy. Currently, the patient is experiencing leukocytosis and a left shift in his blood work. The differential diagnosis includes ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), untreated wound collection, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl, with plans to discontinue Flagyl if C. diff negative. 

The patient also has respiratory failure and is suspected of having VAP. He is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and clindamycin, and sputum Gram stain and culture have been ordered. The patient's pain control is being optimized to potentially allow for awakening, as tolerated by pain. 

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and possibly very mild rhabdomyolysis in the setting of septic shock. He is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and will continue with Q3 HD afterwards. Medications are being concentrated and vancomycin dosing is being adjusted accordingly.

The patient's hypertension is being managed with amlodipine and beta blockers as needed. The patient's compartment syndrome post fasciotomy will be followed up with wound care and plastic surgery recommendations."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital with septic shock secondary to Group A Strep cellulitis and compartment syndrome requiring left lower extremity fasciotomy. He currently has persistent renal and respiratory failure, hyperglycemia controlled with insulin drip, and resolved hypertension. The patient is now experiencing leukocytosis with a left shift, which is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory failure and prolonged intubation increase the risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures such as sputum Gram stain/culture, treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and clindamycin, and attempting to wean sedatives are being implemented.

2. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI): As the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is a risk of developing CDI. Prophylactic measures for CDI should continue.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN), possibly exacerbated by septic shock. Conservative management with hemodialysis (HD) is ongoing, focusing on fluid balance and medication concentration.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic measures including subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis are in place due to the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   69 year old man with DM who presented from OSH with septic shock from
   Group A Strep cellulitis and compartment syndrome s/p LLE fasciotomy *
   2 now with persistent renal and respiratory failure along with
   hyperglycemia controlled with insulin drip and resolved hypertension.
   Now w/ leukocytosis and left shift.
   .
   Plan:
   ##. Leukocytosis with bandemia, uncertain etiology
 currently covering
   broadly with vanc, cefepime, flagyl, and clindamycin
   -continue emperic coverage for VAP and C.diff; continue coverage for
   GAS
   -culture subclavian and HD lines
   -ID following, appreciate recs (d/c clinda today)
   ## Respiratory failure: concerning for VAP; does not appear to have
   baseline CO2 retention from obesity (as would be expected from an
   obesity/hypoventillation syndrome)
   - sputum Gram stain/culture
   - cont treatment for VAP with vanc, cefepime, clinda
   - attempt to wean midazolam and fentanyl, encourage patient to be more
   awake
   .
   ## Acute renal failure due to ischemic ATN +/- very mild rhabdomyolysis
   in the setting of septic shock; CVVH stopped, now on HD making very
   minimal urine
   - minimize IV fluids, concentrating all meds
   - HD today per renal for management of volume overload/hypertension
   with goal as negative as BP allows (hold BP med)
   - vanc dosing per HD protocol
   .
   ## Type 2 diabetes mellitus: glucose under control requiring with
   insulin drip
   - hourly fingersticks
   - cont insulin drip and titrate to goal FSBG <150
   .
   ## Hypertension: marked hypertension prior to initiation of aggressive
   HD, now controlled
   - restarted amlodipine (one home BP med that was not nephrotoxic) but
   holding today as per renal request
   - HD today with hope of negative balance
   .
   ## Compartment syndrome s/p fasciotomy
   -wound care consult
   -plastics consult
   .
   ## Hyperlipidemia: cont statin
   .
   ## Bilirubinemia: could represent underlying fatty liver disease; has
   been stable
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds with free water flushes
   ## ICU Care: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; ppi for stress ulcer
   prophylaxis

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old man with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital with septic shock due to group A streptococcal cellulitis and compartment syndrome. He underwent left lower extremity fasciotomy and is currently in the ICU for persistent renal and respiratory failure, as well as hyperglycemia controlled with an insulin drip. The patient's recent changes include leukocytosis and a left shift.

The plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics for leukocytosis with bandemia, covering for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and Clostridium difficile infection. Cultures of the subclavian and hemodialysis lines are also being obtained. The patient's respiratory failure is concerning for VAP, and he is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and clindamycin. Sputum Gram stain and culture are being performed, and an attempt is being made to wean the patient off midazolam and fentanyl.

The patient has acute renal failure due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and possibly very mild rhabdomyolysis. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) has been stopped, and the patient is now on intermittent hemodialysis (HD) with minimal urine output. IV fluids are being minimized, and all medications are being concentrated.

The patient's type 2 diabetes mellitus is well-controlled with an insulin drip, and hourly"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure and renal failure. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and dialysis catheter. The patient is on invasive ventilation support and has been receiving insulin infusions, which have been converted to subcutaneous administration. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), blood pressure ranging from 168/59 mmHg to 129/45 mmHg, heart rate between 87 and 93 bpm, respiratory rate of 25-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has a first-degree AV block and central venous pressure within normal range.

The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 3,112 mL and output of 5,017 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,905 mL. The patient's urine output is very low at 17 mL, and there is no mention of other output such as NG or stool.

The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, set at a tidal volume of 431 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 228, and respiratory rate (RR) of 27 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of being overweight or obese, clear breath sounds in the anterior exam, warm skin, and unresponsive neurological status with no spontaneous movement.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), as well as elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), lactate, and lactic acid levels. The patient's glucose levels are within normal range. Imaging shows an endotracheal tube (ETT) positioned at 6 cm and left base opacity, which may indicate a possible infection or fluid accumulation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), and acute kidney injury (AKI) due to renal failure. The patient's critically ill condition, low urine output, and abnormal laboratory values suggest the need for close monitoring and management of these potential complications."

   Challenging management in terms of sedation.  We will try to titrate
   down the benzodiazepine.  He will still require pain control and so we
   will continue (and likely need to escalate) the fentanyl.  He may be a
   reasonable patient to try propofol if we need additional sedation
   (though will still require).  We will try to wean PEEP again today.
   [**Month (only) 60**] be reasonable to consider tracheostomy early next week if not
   progressing.
   We will continue present ABX for now.  We will plan to treat for VAP
   for an 8 day total course if no other diagnosis becomes apparent.  He
   will need ongoing rx for his GAS and cellulitis.
   We will ask his wife to come in when feasible.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe left lower extremity infection, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypertension, obesity, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient underwent a fasciotomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis. The patient's condition is critical, and the medical team is facing challenges with sedation management. They plan to titrate down the benzodiazepine and may consider using propofol for additional sedation. The team also aims to wean the PEEP and consider tracheostomy if there is no progress. Antibiotics will be continued for the Group A streptococcus bacteremia and cellulitis. The patient's wife will be informed when possible.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. The medical team suspects VAP and plans to treat for an 8-day course if no other diagnosis becomes apparent.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures such as boots and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin have been initiated.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged immobilization. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been prescribed.

- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate (HR) between 87-102 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 130/53 to 196/73 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) between 24-32 breaths per minute, and a CVP of 5 mmHg.
- The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 700 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 61, indicating potential overventilation.
- Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 532 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hb) level of 10.2 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 268 mg/dL,"

   loculated effusion
   - CT neck to legs today with IV contrast
   - continue current abx, f/u ID recs
   - plan for 8 day course for VAP (per ID, can revert to PCN on [**9-24**])
   - GAS bacteremia course usually 14-21 days although may need to adjust
   in this patient as he remains and may remain acutely ill
   -  d/c subclavian once PICC is placed
   ## Respiratory failure: felt to have VAP; did well from resp standpoint
   but concern for airway protection risk due to AMS which may be [**2-13**]
   sedating meds vs new baseline mental status; no growth to date for
   cultures
   - continue to follow cultures
   - cont treatment for VAP with vanc, cefepime

   ## Acute renal failure due to ischemic ATN +/- very mild rhabdomyolysis
   in the setting of septic shock; now on HD making very minimal urine;
   all meds are concentrated aside from fentanyl (attempting to wean) and
   vanco; not improving
 plan for q3 HD
   - will need HD after IV contrast for CT
   - vanc, cefepime dosing per HD protocol
   - renal feels HD cath is too proximal and therefore not effective,
   renal plans to change line for proper positioning prior to CT scan so
   patient can be dialyzed after CT
   .
   ## Type 2 diabetes mellitus
 Hyperglycemic for past 24 hours.
   Currently on 80/60 NPH plus sliding scale
   - Titrate up NPH for improved glycemic control
   .
   ## Hypertension: Multiple home BP meds have been held [**2-13**] poor
   tolerance in setting of renal failure; unable to wean fentanyl because
   patient becomes very hypertensive (low 200s) with any movement or
   agitation; currently receiving amlodipine 10mg daily, metoprolol 25mg
   [**Hospital1 **]
   - HD today as above
   - increase metoprolol to 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue amlodipine

- The patient is a 69-year-old man with diabetes mellitus who presented with septic shock due to Group A Strep cellulitis and compartment syndrome following a lower extremity fasciotomy.
- He has acute renal failure, possibly due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN), as well as leukocytosis with a left shift.
- The patient is currently being treated for various conditions, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute respiratory failure, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
- His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), blood pressure ranging from 170/60 to 196/73 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, lactate, and lipase levels, as well as low albumin and potassium levels.
- The patient's physical examination reveals pinpoint pupils, tachycardia, clear lung sounds, soft and nondistended abdomen, and clean fasciotomy site with exposed muscle and tendon.
- Imaging studies include a CT scan of the neck to legs with IV contrast, which will help evaluate for possible abscess or parapnemonic loculated effusion.
- The plan includes continuing current antibiotics, monitoring for VAP, weaning sedatives, and performing a CT scan to assess for"

   Assessment and Plan
   69 year old man with DM who presented from OSH with septic shock from
   Group A Strep cellulitis and compartment syndrome s/p LLE fasciotomy.
   Now w/ leukocytosis and left shift.  Differential includes VAP,
   untreated wound collection, c. diff.
   Plan:
   ##. Leukocytosis with bandemia, uncertain etiology
 currently covering
   broadly with vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   - D/C flagyl today if C. diff negative
   - Will do 8 day course for VAP.  Discuss GAS course with ID.
   - culture subclavian and HD lines
   - ID following
   ## Respiratory failure: concerning for VAP; does not appear to have
   baseline CO2 retention from obesity (as would be expected from an
   obesity/hypoventillation syndrome)
   - sputum Gram stain/culture
   - cont treatment for VAP with vanc, cefepime
   - increasing fentanyl, weaning midazolam to improve pain control while
   allowing for potential awakening
   - attempt to awake as tolerated by pain
   .
   ## Acute renal failure due to ischemic ATN +/- very mild rhabdomyolysis
   in the setting of septic shock; now on HD making very minimal urine
   - minimize IV fluids, concentrating all meds
   - HD today again.  Goal of [**4-17**] L off.  Will likely get Q3 hemodialysis
   afterwards.
   - vanc dosing per HD protocol
   .
   ## Type 2 diabetes mellitus
   - Off insulin drip
   - 80/60 NPH + sliding scale
   .
   ## Hypertension: marked hypertension prior to initiation of aggressive
   HD, now controlled
   - restarted amlodipine
   - HD today as above
   - beta blockers as needed
   .
   ## Compartment syndrome s/p fasciotomy
   - follow wound care and plastics recs
   .
   ## Hyperlipidemia: cont statin
   .
   ## Bilirubinemia: could represent underlying fatty liver disease; has
   been stable
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds with free water flushes
   ## ICU Care: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; ppi for stress ulcer
   prophylaxis
   ## Lines: right subclavian, left HD triple-lumen
   ## Communication: wife [**Name (NI) 1828**] (home [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4973**]; cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4974**]);
   son [**Name (NI) **] (cell [**0-0-**])
   Discussed with wife today.  She will come here tomorrow between 2 and 4

          He did well with his SBT this morning, but is too sedated
   for extubation, particularly given difficult airway.  Will let BZD
   continue to wash out.
          Will discuss with his wife when she is able to come in.
          If not improved, may warrant tracheostomy early next week.
   Leucocytosis and left shift
   His leucocytosis and left shift have not improved to the degree we
   would have hoped.  Although there is some risk of transport and of IV
   contrast , there is a substantial risk of undrained focus of infection
   that we need to try to identify.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of the ventilator.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on hemodialysis due to acute renal failure. This indicates impaired kidney function, and further complications may occur if the renal failure progresses.

3. Infection: The patient has severe lower extremity infection and bacteremia caused by Group A strep. There is a risk of sepsis or septic shock if the infection spreads or worsens.

4. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, which can lead to complications such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage if not properly managed.

5. Obesity: The patient is described as overweight/obese, which increases the risk of various health problems, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and joint issues.

6. Difficult Airway: The patient has a difficult airway, which may complicate extubation or the placement of a tracheostomy if needed.

7. Leucocytosis with Left Shift: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. If this persists or worsens, it could indicate a worsening infection or other"

   Assessment and Plan
   69 year old man with DM who presented from OSH with septic shock from
   Group A Strep cellulitis, compartment syndrome s/p LLE fasciotomy, ARF
   thought [**2-13**] ATN on HD, VAP, and leukocytosis w left shift that had
   transiently resolved but is now persistent.
   Plan:
   ##. Leukocytosis with left shift and fever, uncertain etiology
   currently covering broadly with vanc, cefepime, flagyl.  CT largely
   unrevealing but may still have abscess that was not adequately
   visualized. Other etiologies include drug fever, malignancy, MDS.
   - continue current abx, f/u ID recs
   - cycling lines
   - replace ART line today
   ## Respiratory failure: Treating for VAP, did poorly o/n from resp
   standpoint with need for increasing support
   - continue to follow cultures
   - cont treatment for VAP with vanc, cefepime
   - wean sedatives, vent as able
   .
   ## Acute renal failure due to ischemic ATN +/- very mild rhabdomyolysis
   in the setting of septic shock; now on HD making very minimal urine;
   all meds are concentrated aside from fentanyl (attempting to wean) and
   vanco; not improving
 plan for q3 HD. Dialyzed [**9-17**].
   -          vanc, cefepime dosing per HD protocol
   .
   ## Type 2 diabetes mellitus
 Hyperglycemic . Currently on 90/70 NPH
   plus sliding scale
   - restart insulin gtt

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old man with diabetes mellitus who presented with septic shock from Group A Strep cellulitis, compartment syndrome following lower extremity fasciotomy, acute renal failure thought to be ischemic ATN on HD, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and leukocytosis with a left shift. He had transient resolution but now has persistent leukocytosis. The patient has been treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl. A CT scan was largely unrevealing but may still have an abscess that was not adequately visualized. Other potential etiologies include drug fever, malignancy, or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). 

The patient's respiratory failure has not improved, and he is currently being treated for VAP with vancomycin and cefepime. Sedatives are being weaned, and attempts are being made to wean off the ventilator as able. 

The patient's acute renal failure is due to ischemic ATN +/- very mild rhabdomyolysis in the setting of septic shock. He is now on hemodialysis (HD) making very minimal urine. All medications are concentrated aside from fentanyl (attempting to wean) and vancomycin; he is not improving. The plan is to continue HD every three days. 

The patient also has type 2 diabetes mellitus, currently managed with NPH insulin and a sliding scale"

   Group A Strep cellulitis, compartment syndrome s/p LLE fasciotomy, ARF
   thought [**2-13**] ATN on HD, VAP, and leukocytosis w left shift that had
   transiently resolved but is now persistent.
   Plan:
   ##. Leukocytosis with bandemia, uncertain etiology
 currently covering
   broadly with vanc, cefepime, flagyl.  Possibly abscess or parapnemonic
   loculated effusion
   - CT neck to legs today with IV contrast
   - continue current abx, f/u ID recs
   - plan for 8 day course for VAP (per ID, can revert to PCN on [**9-24**])
   - GAS bacteremia course usually 14-21 days although may need to adjust
   in this patient as he remains and may remain acutely ill
   -  d/c subclavian once PICC is placed
   ## Respiratory failure: felt to have VAP; did well from resp standpoint
   but concern for airway protection risk due to AMS which may be [**2-13**]
   sedating meds vs new baseline mental status; no growth to date for
   cultures
   - continue to follow cultures

   all meds are concentrated aside from fentanyl (attempting to wean) and
   vanco; not improving
 plan for q3 HD
   - will need HD after IV contrast for CT
   - vanc, cefepime dosing per HD protocol
   - renal feels HD cath is too proximal and therefore not effective,
   renal plans to change line for proper positioning prior to CT scan so
   patient can be dialyzed after CT
   .
   ## Type 2 diabetes mellitus
 Hyperglycemic for past 24 hours.
   Currently on 80/60 NPH plus sliding scale
   - Titrate up NPH for improved glycemic control
   .
   ## Hypertension: Multiple home BP meds have been held [**2-13**] poor
   tolerance in setting of renal failure; unable to wean fentanyl because
   patient becomes very hypertensive (low 200s) with any movement or
   agitation; currently receiving amlodipine 10mg daily, metoprolol 25mg
   [**Hospital1 **]
   - HD today as above
   - increase metoprolol to 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue amlodipine

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis, acute respiratory failure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, including renal failure requiring dialysis and an unknown allergy to quinolones. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

During the 24-hour period, the patient underwent resiting of dialysis catheters and a multi-lumen catheter. The patient's torso CT showed no new findings. The patient's temperature was 101 degrees Fahrenheit at 4 am, and a consult with the surgical team was requested. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 112/51 mmHg to 179/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. The patient's central venous pressure is 13 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 1,364 mL and output of 6,010 mL with a negative balance of -4,881 mL. 

The patient is receiving several medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, insulin, dextrose, and other ICU medications. 

Physical examination findings include a first-degree AV block on EKG and an absence of peripheral pulses and skin assessment due to sed"

   Respiratory Failure
          He did well with his SBT this morning, but is too sedated
   for extubation, particularly given difficult airway.  Will let BZD
   continue to wash out.
          Will discuss with his wife when she is able to come in.
          If not improved, may warrant tracheostomy early next week.
   Leucocytosis and left shift
   His leucocytosis and left shift have not improved to the degree we
   would have hoped.  Although there is some risk of transport and of IV
   contrast , there is a substantial risk of undrained focus of infection
   that we need to try to identify.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 69-year-old man with several significant medical issues including severe lower extremity infection post fasciotomy, group A strep bacteremia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure on hemodialysis, hypertension, obesity, probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), leukocytosis with a marked left shift, and difficult airway. 

The patient's condition remains critical, as indicated by the need for continuous monitoring in the ICU. He has been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, and there are concerns about his ability to be extubated due to sedation and the difficult airway. The plan is to allow benzodiazepine to wash out before reconsidering extubation. If the patient does not improve, a tracheostomy may be necessary early next week.

The patient's leukocytosis and left shift have not improved adequately, which raises the concern of an undrained focus of infection. To investigate further, a CT scan of the head, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and thigh is planned. The current antibiotics for suspected VAP will be continued for an additional 8 days. C. difficile cultures will be awaited, and if the CT scans do not reveal any underlying issues, all lines will be resited and cultured. Infectious disease consultation is recommended, including consideration of empiric antifungal coverage.

The patient's wound care will be managed per surgery recommendations. Nutritional support will be provided through a renal formula diet"

          He did well with his SBT this morning, but is too sedated
   for extubation, particularly given difficult airway.  Will let BZD
   continue to wash out.
          Will discuss with his wife when she is able to come in.
          If not improved, may warrant tracheostomy early next week.
   Leucocytosis and left shift
   His leucocytosis and left shift have not improved to the degree we
   would have hoped.  Although there is some risk of transport and of IV
   contrast , there is a substantial risk of undrained focus of infection
   that we need to try to identify.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe lower extremity infection, bacteremia caused by group A streptococcus, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypertension, obesity, and probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He underwent fasciotomy and is currently on hemodialysis. The patient's leucocytosis with a marked left shift has not improved as expected. He is sedated and unable to provide history. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's severe lower extremity infection and bacteremia indicate a high risk of sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and presence of ARDS can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's risk factors, such as being intubated and having a difficult airway, increase the likelihood of developing VAP.
4. Renal Failure: The patient already has acute renal failure, and complications such as worsening renal function or need for ongoing dialysis may arise.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and obesity are risk factors for developing DVT.
6. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: Critically ill patients are at an increased risk of stress ulcer bleeding.
7. Difficult Airway: The patient's difficult airway poses challenges for extubation and weaning off mechanical ventilation.

   repeat LFTs and get ABd US.
   Could do mini Bal for sputum Cx but CXR and CT really not support this
   as a source.
   ARF: For HD today
 does have significant hyperK of unclear etiology.
   Did get dye load yesterday but was give HD after so does not make
   sense. We are checking CKs [**Last Name (un) 5165**] to make sure now evidence of muscle
   injury as a oitentila source.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical complications including severe lower extremity infection, group A strep bacteremia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure on hemodialysis, hypertension, obesity, and probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with a recent increase in white blood cell count and left shift, indicating a worsening infection. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a fever and elevated PaCO2 levels. Imaging studies reveal a concerning mass in the right kidney, suggesting renal cell carcinoma (RCC), as well as small fluid collections in the left leg that may require drainage. The patient's blood cultures are negative for C. difficile, but other potential sources of infection, such as the NG tube and catheter tips, are being evaluated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's deteriorating condition and elevated white blood cell count suggest a systemic infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, requiring hemodialysis to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation to support his breathing due to respiratory failure.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
5. Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC): The imaging studies indicate"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is fever, and they have a history of allergies to quinolones. The patient has been receiving multiple infusions of medications including midazolam, insulin, and fentanyl.

The patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate (HR) of 104 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 80/45 mmHg to 152/60 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 97% and their heart rhythm is a first-degree AV block.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,722 mL, with 807 mL being given through intravenous fluids (IVF). The total output includes 6,910 mL of blood products and 10 mL of urine. The patient's respiratory support includes ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 52 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 298, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 119 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -24 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 23.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 29.6%, platelet count (Plt) of 638 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 6.4 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 27 mmHg, glucose level of 171 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 1.5 mmol/L. Other lab results show elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4).

The patient's physical examination findings include an undetermined peripheral vascular assessment, normal skin condition, and incomplete neurologic assessment due to the patient not responding or moving. The patient's arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen lines are in place for ICU care.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis or infection due to the fever and elevated WBC count, acute kidney injury indicated by the elevated creatinine level, respiratory distress syndrome or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given the patient's respiratory support and ABG results, and potential thromboembolic events considering the patient's immobilized state in the ICU.

It is important for the patient's healthcare team to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to ensure the patient's well-being and progress in the ICU."

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital with septic shock due to group A strep cellulitis, compartment syndrome following a lower extremity fasciotomy, acute renal failure thought to be ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) on hemodialysis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and leukocytosis with a left shift. The patient had transiently resolved but now persistent leukocytosis with fever, uncertain etiology. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl.

The patient's respiratory status has worsened, and they are now on increased respiratory support. The plan is to continue following cultures, treat for VAP with vancomycin, discontinue cefepime, and add meropenem.

The patient also has acute renal failure due to ischemic ATN +/- very mild rhabdomyolysis in the setting of septic shock. The patient is on hemodialysis but not improving. The plan is to dose vancomycin per HD protocol, adjust medications according to renal function, and follow up with renal recommendations.

The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia, currently being managed with an insulin drip at 12 units per hour. The goal is to set fasting blood sugar around 120 and titrate the insulin drip accordingly.

The patient also has a history of compartment syndrome following a fasciotomy and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital with septic shock caused by Group A Strep cellulitis. He has undergone a lower extremity fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome and is currently in the ICU. The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and mild rhabdomyolysis. He is on hemodialysis (HD) but is not improving. The patient also has respiratory failure, for which he is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His white blood cell count is elevated with a left shift, indicating an ongoing infection. Other potential causes of his fever include drug fever, malignancy, or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The patient has multiple comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, renal mass consistent with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and compartment syndrome post-fasciotomy. His family history includes a wife with Strep throat.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Uncertain etiology of leukocytosis with left shift and fever.
2. Respiratory failure due to VAP, which is not improving despite treatment.
3. Acute renal failure due to ischemic ATN +/- mild rhabdomyolysis, not improving on HD.
4. Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with severe lower extremity infection, respiratory failure, acute renal failure on hemodialysis, hypertension, obesity, and probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has a history of difficult airway, leucocytosis with marked left shift, and persistent fevers of unclear etiology. The patient's condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a severe lower extremity infection and bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis. His persistent fevers and hypotension indicate ongoing infection and possible progression to septic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, as evidenced by his worsening condition in the setting of fevers and hypotension. He is now on assisted ventilation and may require tracheostomy for long-term airway management.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, necessitating hemodialysis. Hyperkalemia has already been resolved with repeat hemodialysis.
4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may require medication management and close monitoring.
5. Obesity: The patient's obesity can complicate his medical management, especially in terms of mobility and pressure ulcer prevention.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has signs of VAP, including worsening respiratory status in the setting of mechanical ventilation. Appropriate antibiotic coverage and ventilator management"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with multiple medical conditions, including severe lower extremity infection, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypertension, obesity, and a difficult airway. He was admitted to the ICU with sepsis and has been critically ill. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis. He is also receiving various medications to manage his blood sugar levels, prevent blood clots, and reduce stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Difficult airway management: The patient's obesity and previous surgery for fasciotomy make airway management challenging, which can increase the risk of complications during intubation or extubation.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires ongoing hemodialysis to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, and there is still a concern for ongoing infection as indicated by persistent fevers.
5. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction and poor tissue perfusion.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are elevated, requiring high-dose insulin drips to maintain glycemic control.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at"

   Await final read on thigh CT but appears they may be too small to drain
 would still like Gne [**Doctor First Name **] to return to eval wounds themselves as a
   potential foci.
   At this pint we have pan cultured changed all lines (except Aline which

   Given clinical deterioration would add a 2nd GNR covering ABX

   Send blood cx for fungal isolators. Discuss with ID role of empiric

   Only other ICU source would be acacl choly and GB looks big by CT-
   repeat LFTs and get ABd US.
   Could do mini Bal for sputum Cx but CXR and CT really not support this
   as a source.
   ARF: For HD today
 does have significant hyperK of unclear etiology.
   Did get dye load yesterday but was give HD after so does not make
   sense. We are checking CKs [**Last Name (un) 5165**] to make sure now evidence of muscle

   Assessment and Plan
   69 year old man with DM who presented from OSH with septic shock from
   Group A Strep cellulitis, compartment syndrome s/p LLE fasciotomy, ARF
   thought [**2-13**] ATN on HD, VAP, and leukocytosis w left shift that had
   transiently resolved but is now persistent.
   Plan:
   ##. Leukocytosis with left shift and fever, uncertain etiology
   currently covering broadly with vanc, cefepime, flagyl.  CT largely
   unrevealing but may still have abscess that was not adequately
   visualized. Other etiologies include drug fever, malignancy, MDS.
   Cycled lines.
   - f/u ID recs
   - d/c
d tobramycin after one dose
   -added meropenem
   -would cultures to be sent today
   -discuss possibility of pelvic stranding as representative of evolving
   abscess with surgery and/or radiology
   ## Respiratory failure: Treating for VAP, did poorly o/n from resp
   standpoint with need for increasing support
   - continue to follow cultures
   - cont treatment for VAP with vanc, d/c cefepime (treatment for VAP
   will be complete [**9-20**] although will need further empiric coverage if no
   source is found), add meropenem
   - wean sedatives, vent as able
   .
   ## Acute renal failure due to ischemic ATN +/- very mild rhabdomyolysis
   in the setting of septic shock; now on HD making very minimal urine;
   all meds are concentrated aside from fentanyl (attempting to wean) and
   vanco; not improving
 plan for q3 HD. Dialyzed [**9-17**]. Not improving.
   -          Vanc dosing per HD protocol, meds renally dosed
   -          Renal recs
 is this still thought to be reversible?
   .
   ## Type 2 diabetes mellitus
 Hyperglycemic . Insulin gtt at 12u/hr
   with FSBS in the 160s
   - set FSBS around 120, titrate gtt.
   ## Compartment syndrome s/p fasciotomy
 dressings as per instructed by
   wound care; plastics have evaluated and feel there is no current role
   for their intervention
   - follow wound care recs
 change to [**Hospital1 **] dressings
   - call gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] to eval leg PRN
 will ask them to follow daily
   .
   ## Hyperlipidemia:  Statin has been d/c
   ##. Renal Mass c/w RCC: Discussed with family. Will need outpatient
   follow up.
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds with free water flushes
   ## ICU Care: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis (increased to 7500 TID for

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital with septic shock from Group A Strep cellulitis. He underwent lower extremity fasciotomy for compartment syndrome and is currently experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN), as well as persistent leukocytosis with a left shift and fever. The patient is also being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and renal cell carcinoma. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis with left shift and fever, uncertain etiology: The patient's persistent leukocytosis with a left shift and fever indicates an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of worsening infection and adjust the antibiotic regimen accordingly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has been poor, and he is being treated for VAP. Close monitoring of his respiratory parameters and continued treatment for VAP is necessary.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure due to ischemic ATN. This condition requires close monitoring of renal function, and appropriate dialysis therapy should be continued.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, as indicated by his elevated blood sugar levels. Insulin therapy should be continued and adjusted based on glucose levels."

   Assessment and Plan
   69 year old man with DM who presented from OSH with septic shock from
   Group A Strep cellulitis, compartment syndrome s/p LLE fasciotomy, ARF
   thought [**2-13**] ATN on HD, VAP, and leukocytosis w left shift that had
   transiently resolved but is now persistent.
   Plan:
   ##. Leukocytosis with left shift and fever, uncertain etiology
   currently covering broadly with vanc, cefepime, flagyl.  CT largely
   unrevealing but may still have abscess that was not adequately
   visualized. Other etiologies include drug fever, malignancy, MDS.
   Cycled lines.
   - f/u ID recs
   - d/c
d tobramycin after one dose
   -added meropenem
   -would cultures to be sent today
   -discuss possibility of pelvic stranding as representative of evolving
   abscess with surgery and/or radiology
   ## Respiratory failure: Treating for VAP, did poorly o/n from resp
   standpoint with need for increasing support
   - continue to follow cultures
   - cont treatment for VAP with vanc, d/c cefepime (treatment for VAP
   will be complete [**9-20**] although will need further empiric coverage if no
   source is found), add meropenem
   - wean sedatives, vent as able
   .
   ## Acute renal failure due to ischemic ATN +/- very mild rhabdomyolysis
   in the setting of septic shock; now on HD making very minimal urine;
   all meds are concentrated aside from fentanyl (attempting to wean) and
   vanco; not improving
 plan for q3 HD. Dialyzed [**9-17**]. Not improving.
   -          Vanc dosing per HD protocol, meds renally dosed
   -          Renal recs
 is this still thought to be reversible?
   .
   ## Type 2 diabetes mellitus
 Hyperglycemic . Insulin gtt at 12u/hr
   with FSBS in the 160s
   - set FSBS around 120, titrate gtt.
   ## Compartment syndrome s/p fasciotomy
 dressings as per instructed by
   wound care; plastics have evaluated and feel there is no current role
   for their intervention
   - follow wound care recs
 change to [**Hospital1 **] dressings
   - call gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] to eval leg PRN
 will ask them to follow daily
   .
   ## Hyperlipidemia:  Statin has been d/c
   ##. Renal Mass c/w RCC: Discussed with family. Will need outpatient
   follow up.
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds with free water flushes
   ## ICU Care: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis (increased to 7500 TID for
   patient habitus); ranitidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis
   ## Lines: subclavin ([**9-17**]), HD line ([**9-17**]), ART ([**9-18**])

","The patient is a 69-year-old man with diabetes mellitus who presented with septic shock from Group A Strep cellulitis, compartment syndrome after lower extremity fasciotomy, acute renal failure thought to be ischemic ATN on hemodialysis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and leukocytosis with left shift. He has been transiently resolved but now persistent.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Leukocytosis with left shift and fever, uncertain etiology: The patient is currently being covered broadly with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection or abscess formation.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is being treated for VAP and did poorly overnight, requiring increasing respiratory support. Cultures will be followed, and treatment for VAP will continue with vancomycin, and cefepime will be discontinued. Meropenem will be added for further empiric coverage if no source is found.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is due to ischemic ATN +/- very mild rhabdomyolysis in the setting of septic shock. He is currently on hemodialysis but not improving. Medications will be dosed accordingly based on his renal function.

4. Compartment syndrome s/p fasciotomy: The patient's compartment syndrome has been addressed with fasciotomy, and dressings will be"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are currently admitted to the ICU and receiving mechanical ventilation support. The patient has a history of allergies to quinolones and unknown allergies. They have been receiving various antibiotics including vancomycin, tobramycin, cefepime, and meropenem. The patient's vital signs are stable with controlled blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. However, there is a noted fluctuation in blood pressure levels. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure within normal limits. The patient's fluid balance shows an overall positive balance of 1,995 mL with net intake of 2,605 mL and output of 610 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes assist-control ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a mixed acid-base disorder with respiratory compensation. Physical examination findings are not assessed in multiple areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges or slightly elevated. The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   69 year old man with DM who presented from OSH with septic shock from
   Group A Strep cellulitis, compartment syndrome s/p LLE fasciotomy, ARF
   thought [**2-13**] ATN on HD, VAP, and leukocytosis w left shift that had
   transiently resolved but is now persistent.
   Plan:
   ##. Leukocytosis with left shift and fever, uncertain etiology
   currently covering broadly with vanc, cefepime, flagyl.  CT largely
   unrevealing but may still have abscess that was not adequately
   visualized. Other etiologies include drug fever, malignancy, MDS.
   Cycled lines.
   - f/u ID recs
   - d/c
d tobramycin after one dose
   -added meropenem
   -would cultures to be sent today
   -discuss possibility of pelvic stranding as representative of evolving
   abscess with surgery and/or radiology
   ## Respiratory failure: Treating for VAP, did poorly o/n from resp
   standpoint with need for increasing support
   - continue to follow cultures
   - cont treatment for VAP with vanc, d/c cefepime (treatment for VAP
   will be complete [**9-20**] although will need further empiric coverage if no
   source is found), add meropenem
   - wean sedatives, vent as able
   .
   ## Acute renal failure due to ischemic ATN +/- very mild rhabdomyolysis
   in the setting of septic shock; now on HD making very minimal urine;
   all meds are concentrated aside from fentanyl (attempting to wean) and
   vanco; not improving
 plan for q3 HD. Dialyzed [**9-17**]. Not improving.
   -          Vanc dosing per HD protocol, meds renally dosed
   -          Renal recs
 is this still thought to be reversible?
   .
   ## Type 2 diabetes mellitus
 Hyperglycemic . Insulin gtt at 12u/hr
   with FSBS in the 160s
   - set FSBS around 120, titrate gtt.
   ## Compartment syndrome s/p fasciotomy
 dressings as per instructed by
   wound care; plastics have evaluated and feel there is no current role
   for their intervention
   - follow wound care recs
 change to [**Hospital1 **] dressings
   - call gen [**Doctor First Name 458**] to eval leg PRN
 will ask them to follow daily
   .
   ## Hyperlipidemia:  Statin has been d/c
   ##. Renal Mass c/w RCC: Discussed with family. Will need outpatient
   follow up.
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds with free water flushes
   ## ICU Care: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis (increased to 7500 TID for
   patient habitus); ranitidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital with septic shock caused by Group A Strep cellulitis, compartment syndrome following lower extremity fasciotomy, acute renal failure thought to be ischemic ATN on HD, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and leukocytosis with a left shift. The patient has been treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl. Despite transient resolution of the leukocytosis, it has now persisted. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory failure requiring increasing ventilatory support, persistent acute renal failure on HD, and hyperglycemia requiring insulin gtt. The patient also has a history of hyperlipidemia, renal mass c/w RCC, and compartment syndrome status post fasciotomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis with left shift and fever, uncertain etiology - The patient's leukocytosis with a left shift and fever may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the source of infection has not yet been identified. Other possible etiologies include drug fever, malignancy, or myelodysplastic syndrome.
2. Respiratory failure - The patient is experiencing worsening respiratory failure, which requires aggressive management including increasing ventilatory support. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the treatment plan includes de-escalation of antibiotics,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with severe lower extremity infection, group A streptococcus bacteremia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure on hemodialysis, hypertension, obesity, probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), leukocytosis with a marked left shift, and difficult airway. He has been sedated and unable to provide history. The patient has been treated for skin/soft tissue infection and presumptive VAP, with antibiotics to be discontinued unless a new site is identified. Respiratory failure is ongoing, and after hemodialysis today, extubation will be attempted. The patient will start a Duragesic patch and have the fentanyl infusion reduced. If extubation is not tolerated, tracheostomy will be considered. Acute renal failure requires hemodialysis today. The patient has diabetes, which is being managed with an insulin infusion. ICU care includes nutrition through tube feeds and glycemic control through an insulin infusion. The patient has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen line. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently admitted to the ICU."

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), recent septic shock caused by group A streptococcus, compartment syndrome that required fasciotomy, acute renal failure (ARF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and leukocytosis. 

The patient is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and is on mechanical ventilation. The note mentions that the patient had two episodes of fighting the vent and auto-peep, which led to adjustments in the ventilator settings and administration of ativan. There is also a suspicion of obstructive lung disease.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate (HR) between 76-106 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 124/46-173/71 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) set at 20 breaths per minute with spontaneous RR of 3, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 6 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 2,605 mL and output of 610 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,995 mL. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated creatinine (Cr)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who was admitted to the ICU due to recent septic shock caused by group A streptococcus. He underwent a fasciotomy for compartment syndrome, acute renal failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and leukocytosis. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, dialysis, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VAP: The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, which is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and consider weaning off the ventilator to prevent further complications.
2. ARF: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), which can be caused by septic shock, nephrotoxic medications, or hypotension. Close monitoring of renal function and ongoing management with dialysis are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which needs to be managed with antihypertensive medication, such as metoprolol.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes mellitus and requires insulin therapy to maintain glycemic control.
5. Compartment syndrome: Although the patient has already undergone a fasciotomy, wound care recommendations should be followed to prevent infection or other complications related to the surgical site.
6. Hyperlipidemia: Long-term management of hyperlipidemia with statin therapy is necessary to reduce cardiovascular risk"

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) bacteremia. He underwent a fasciotomy for compartment syndrome and is now experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute kidney injury (ARF), and other complications. The patient's current medications include insulin, metoprolol, ranitidine, heparin, and meropenem. His vital signs show hypertension and a first-degree atrioventricular block. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and hyperphosphatemia. The patient's recent events include hemodialysis, switching to pressure support, and attempting spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) without success. The patient's family has been informed of his condition and has agreed to full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, likely caused by an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Gram-negative rod. He is currently being treated with meropenem. It is important to continue the appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of improvement or worsening of symptoms.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS may complicate his recovery, especially if he fails to wean off the ventil"

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o man with
          Severe LE infection s/p fasciotomy
          Group A strep bacteremia
          Respiratory failure
          Acute renal failure now on hemodialysis
          Hypertension
          Obesity
          Probable VAP
          Leucocytosis with marked (though somewhat improving) left
   shift
          Difficult airway
   We are finally making progress with his leucocytosis and marked left
   shift.  The overall pattern is consistent with an ESBL-producing
   organism that we did not grow, since his leucocytosis only started to
   improve after changing from Zosyn to meropenem.  We will complete a
   15-day course for presumptive highly resistant gram-negative-rod VAP.
   Respiratory failure
   Main issue remains balancing pain control and respiratory/mental status
   depression.  We will stop his fentanyl infusion today and re-assess.
   If he does not tolerate SBT today, we will discuss with his wife
   regarding tracheostomy.
   Acute renal failure
   Hemodialysis per renal
   Diabetes
   On insulin infusion for control
   Communication
   We have discussed his status with his wife by phone.  She has not been
   able to come to the hospital, although we have encouraged her to do
   so.  Social work consult.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with severe lower extremity infection, bacteremia caused by Group A strep, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypertension, obesity, probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), leukocytosis with marked left shift, and difficult airway. He is currently on hemodialysis and receiving insulin for diabetes management. The main issues include balancing pain control and respiratory/mental status depression. The patient's wife has been informed about his status, and a social work consult has been requested.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is suspected to have developed VAP, which is a common complication in patients who are on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
2. Difficult airway: The patient has a difficult airway, which may increase the risk of complications during intubation or extubation.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, requiring hemodialysis. This condition can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which needs to be managed to prevent complications such as stroke or cardiac events.
5. Obesity: The patient's obesity puts him at an increased risk of respiratory complications, such as sleep apnea or difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation.
6. Severe lower extremity infection: The patient's severe lower extremity infection increases the risk of sepsis and potentially further"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, recent septic shock caused by group A streptococcus, compartment syndrome post-fasciotomy, acute renal failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and leukocytosis. The patient's condition has improved with the addition of meropenem. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is expected to undergo extubation assessment today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VAP: The patient has a history of VAP, which is a type of pneumonia that develops in patients who are on mechanical ventilation. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status and ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation.
2. ARF: The patient has acute renal failure and is anuric (not producing any urine). Close monitoring of renal function is necessary, and hemodialysis is planned for today.
3. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has high levels of phosphate, and aluminum hydroxide has been given for 3 days. Further management will involve adjusting phosphate binders once the phosphate level falls below 6 mg/dL.
4. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, and metoprolol has been started. Blood pressure monitoring and adjustment of medication dosages may be required.
5. Diabetes: The patient has diabetes, and insulin infusion is being continued.
6. Compartment syndrome: The patient had compartment syndrome, and wound"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock caused by group A streptococcus infection. The patient also had compartment syndrome and acute renal failure.
- The patient underwent a fasciotomy, and now his leukocytosis is improving. However, he likely has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing gram-negative bacterium, along with a bacteremia from group A streptococcus. The addition of meropenem has improved his condition.
- The patient is currently on continuous vancomycin and meropenem, with vancomycin levels monitored during hemodialysis. Cultures are being followed, and a 15-day treatment course for ESBL-producing bacteria will begin on the first day of meropenem.
- The patient's respiratory distress and intubation failed a spontaneous breathing test, which may be due to sedation or primary central nervous system disease. However, his VAP has improved with the addition of meropenem.
- The patient's hypertension is being managed with metoprolol, and pain control is being provided through fentanyl boluses only. Agitation is being treated with haloperidol.
- The patient's acute renal failure is not improving, and he is an"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 M with DM, recent septic shock (group A strep), compartment syndrome
   s/p fasciotomy, ARF, VAP, leukocytosis.
   1.  Respiratory distress/intubation: Difficulty weaning from vent.
   Possibly due to increased sedation vs primary central disease.
   - Have weaned down to 7 of PS and 0 of PEEP with an FiO2 40%.  Goal has
   been to perform SBT today with hope of extubation.  Unclear is pt will
   be able to be extubated.  If not, will contact gen [**Name2 (NI) 458**] re trach
   today.  Will make decision regarding extubation today.  Will need to
   talk to family about trach.
   - Continue treating VAP with meropenem
   - Alb/Ipt nebs
   - Has been off the fentanyl drip and only receiving boluses only for
   pain
 also gave haldol for agitation.  Still requiring high doses of
   fentanyl.  Do not want to start other pain meds for concern of
   increasing sedation.
   2.  ID: Pneumonia, most likely VAP [**2-13**] ESBL GNR as well as GAS
   bateremia.
   - Pt
s improvement with meropenem leads to belief that GNR was ESBL.
   Will need 8 days of meropenem (day 1 [**9-18**])
   - Can d/c vanc today ([**9-22**]), no evidence to suggest continuing gram
   positive infection
   3.  Hypertension
   - Restart beta-blockade, metoprolol 25 mg TID with only minimal
   results.  Pt had one episode of hypotension so have been cautious
   regarding beta blockers.  However, her SBPs remain very high and he may
   benefit from increased anti-hypertensives.  Has required one time doses
   of prn metoprolol for pressure control.
   - Htn may be related to pain; controlling pain may help bring pressures
   down
   - HD removal of fluid also helps htn
   4.  ARF: Slightly improved; making urine.  Still hyperphosphatemic and
   BUN remains very elevated despite HD.  HD may not be adequately
   removing urea/solutes.  Following today
s HD, will re-eval BUN, lytes
   and will consider CVVH.
   - On Aluminum for 3 days for hyperphos as well as phoslo
   - will d/c aluminum when phos < 6 and will then increase phoslo to 2
   TID and add sevelamer 800 TID
   5.  Diabetes
   - Continue Insulin gtt.  Will consider switching to subq when pt is
   more stable and is not frequently NPO for possible extubation.
   6.  LLE wound: s/p compartment syndrome and fasciotomy
   - Wound care restarted wound vac yesterday ([**9-21**]).  Wound care will
   alert team when enough granulation tissue is present for grafting by
   plastics.
   - Pain: can consider consulting pain service for further
   recommendations.  Will given standing Tylenol.  If restarting fentanyl
   gtt, need to d/c fentanyl patch.
   7.  Hyperlipidemia - statin d/c
d in setting of acute illness with
   elevated CK
   - reassess when more stable
   8.  RCC - Based on CT findings
   - outpt f/u
   9.  FEN: Recently has been NPO for possible extubation.
   - tube feeds, free water flushes

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who has been admitted to the ICU for recent septic shock, compartment syndrome, acute renal failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and leukocytosis.
- The patient is still intubated and experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The healthcare team plans to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today with the goal of extubation, but it is unclear if the patient will be able to tolerate extubation.
- The patient has shown improvement with meropenem treatment, suggesting that the VAP may be caused by an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gram-negative rod in addition to group A streptococcus bacteremia.
- The patient's blood pressure remains very high despite the use of metoprolol, and there is concern about the potential need for increased anti-hypertensive medications or consideration of a tracheostomy.
- The patient's acute renal failure has slightly improved, but they are still hyperphosphatemic and have an elevated BUN despite hemodialysis (HD). The healthcare team will re-evaluate the BUN, electrolytes, and consider continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) after today's HD.
- The patient's diabetes will continue to be managed with insulin gtt, and consideration will be given to switching to subcutaneous insulin when the patient is more stable.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 70-year-old man with severe lower extremity infection who underwent a fasciotomy.
- He appears to be controlled by the fasciotomy and antibiotics, but will eventually need skin grafting.
- The patient has completed his antibiotic course for Group A strep bacteremia and is currently alert but not following commands.
- There is a challenging decision regarding tracheostomy vs. a trial of extubation due to reported difficult intubation at the outside hospital.
- The patient is experiencing acute renal failure and is currently on hemodialysis.
- His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is still high, and this will be discussed with the renal team.
- The patient has hypertension, which will be assessed after hemodialysis, and metoprolol may be increased if still significantly hypertensive.
- The patient is obese and has a probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient has a difficult airway and requires pain control, for which an acute pain service consultation has been made.
- The patient's diabetes is uncontrolled, and insulin infusion will continue.
- The patient is receiving ICU care, including tube feeds for nutrition and an insulin infusion for glycemic control.
- The patient has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen line.
- Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous unfractionated heparin for deep"

   Mental status did not improve over the course of hemodialysis, and he
   had an episode of desaturation.  Given his difficult airway and the
   difficulty balancing adequate pain control with sedation, we will
   recommend tracheostomy to his wife.  If he does not show continued (if
   slow) mental status improvement, will investigate further; at this
   point, seems consistent with sedation and uremia, though other things
   are in the DDx.  Discussed with [**Name6 (MD) 4534**] and RN.

","The patient is a 70-year-old man with severe lower extremity infection post fasciotomy. He appears controlled by fasciotomy and antibiotics, but will eventually need skin grafting. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure, acute renal failure on hemodialysis, hypertension, obesity, probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), difficult airway, pain control, and uncontrolled diabetes.

His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103-137 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 35 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 30%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 400 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 94%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.9 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 27.5%, platelet count (Plt) of 664 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 101 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 9.4 mg/dL, glucose of 172 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 1.5 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges or not significantly abnormal.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise, including worsening respiratory failure, persistent acute renal failure, uncontrolled hypertension, VAP, difficult airway management, pain control, and complications related to his diabetes."

   - Yesterday ([**9-22**]) morning, pt was weaned to 7 of PS and 0 of PEEP with
   an FiO2 40%.  In mid morning, he had a spontaneous desat event without
   no identifiable precipitating factor. At that time, he was also noted
   to be hypertensive with SBPs in the 200s.  Increased his PEEP and FiO2
   but improved O2 sats but continued hypertension.  Restarted the
   fentanyl and versed drips as well as changed over to AC.  Pt's
   pressures decreased and he seemed less agitated.  Did well for the rest
   of the day.
   - Made plans to move ahead with trach.  His original [**Doctor First Name 458**] team referred
   us to the Red Team (Dr.[**Name (NI) 3954**] team).  Due to body habitus, ?
   history of NSTEMI, and INR of 1.5, surgery for trach as well as PEG may
   be difficult.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 M with DM, recent septic shock (group A strep), compartment syndrome
   s/p fasciotomy, ARF, VAP, leukocytosis.
   1.  Respiratory distress/intubation: Difficulty weaning from vent.
   Possibly due to large amounts of sedation (BDZ and narcotics) vs
   primary central disease.
   - Yesterday ([**9-22**]) morning, pt was weaned to 7 of PS and 0 of PEEP with
   an FiO2 40%.  In mid morning, he had a spontaneous desat event without
   no identifiable precipitating factor. At that time, he was also noted
   to be hypertensive with SBPs in the 200s.  Increased his PEEP and FiO2
   but improved O2 sats but continued hypertension.  Restarted the
   fentanyl and versed drips as well as changed over to AC.  Pt's
   pressures decreased and he seemed less agitated.  Did well for the rest
   of the day.
   - Made plans to move ahead with trach.  His original [**Doctor First Name 458**] team referred
   us to the Red Team (Dr.[**Name (NI) 3954**] team).  Due to body habitus, ?
   history of NSTEMI, and INR of 1.5, surgery for trach as well as PEG may
   be difficult.
   - Continue treating VAP with meropenem
   - Alb/Ipt nebs
   2.  ID: Pneumonia, most likely VAP [**2-13**] ESBL GNR as well as GAS
   bateremia.
   - Pt
s improvement with meropenem leads to belief that GNR was ESBL.
   Will need 8 days of meropenem (day 1 [**9-18**])
   - Stopped vanc yesterday, [**9-22**] because no evidence to suggest
   continuing gram positive infection
   3.  Hypertension
   - Restart beta-blockade, metoprolol 25 mg TID with only minimal
   results.  Pt had one episode of hypotension so have been cautious
   regarding beta blockers.  However, her SBPs remain very high and he may
   benefit from increased anti-hypertensives.  Has required one time doses
   of prn metoprolol for pressure control.
   - Htn may be related to pain; controlling pain may help bring pressures
   down.  Restarting fentanyl and versed gtt did the most to adequately
   control his pressures.
   - HD removal of fluid also helps htn
   4.  ARF: Slightly improved; making urine.
   - [**9-22**] HD was more successful at decreasing BUN and phos.  If HD
   appears to be ineffective at removal of urea, phos, can consider
   changing over to CVVH.
   - On Aluminum for 3 days for hyperphos as well as phoslo
   - will d/c aluminum when phos < 6 and will then increase phoslo to 2
   TID and add sevelamer 800 TID
   5.  Diabetes
   - Continue Insulin gtt.  Will consider switching to subq when pt is
   more stable and is not frequently NPO for possible extubation.
   6.  LLE wound: s/p compartment syndrome and fasciotomy
   - Wound care restarted wound vac on [**9-21**].  Wound care will alert team
   when enough granulation tissue is present for grafting by plastics.
   - Pain service will see pt tomorrow to help guide pain control.  Will
   give standing Tylenol.  Restarted fentanyl gtt.
   7.  Hyperlipidemia - statin d/c
d in setting of acute illness with
   elevated CK
   - reassess when more stable
   8.  RCC - Based on CT findings
   - outpt f/u
   9.  FEN: Recently has been NPO for possible extubation.
   - tube feeds, free water flushes
   10. Communication: Only with wife and son
   - Met with wife and son yesterday, [**9-22**].

- The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, recent septic shock (group A strep), compartment syndrome post fasciotomy, acute respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and leukocytosis.
- The patient had a spontaneous desaturation event and hypertension, which improved with increased PEEP and FiO2, and restarting fentanyl and versed drips.
- Plans were made for a tracheostomy due to the patient's body habitus, history of NSTEMI, and INR of 1.5.
- The patient's BUN and Cr transiently improved following hemodialysis (HD); still better than pre-HD labs.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 168/60 mmHg to 227/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. He has a history of obesity, recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and an elevated international normalized ratio (INR). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 168/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, obesity, skin breakdown in intertriginous regions, and positive bowel sounds. The patient has multiple lines and tubes including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen catheter.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 M with DM, recent septic shock (group A strep), compartment syndrome
   s/p fasciotomy, ARF, VAP, leukocytosis.
   1.  Respiratory distress/intubation: Difficulty weaning from vent.
   Possibly due to large amounts of sedation (BDZ and narcotics) vs
   primary central disease.
   - Yesterday ([**9-22**]) morning, pt was weaned to 7 of PS and 0 of PEEP with
   an FiO2 40%.  In mid morning, he had a spontaneous desat event without
   no identifiable precipitating factor. At that time, he was also noted
   to be hypertensive with SBPs in the 200s.  Increased his PEEP and FiO2
   but improved O2 sats but continued hypertension.  Restarted the
   fentanyl and versed drips as well as changed over to AC.  Pt's
   pressures decreased and he seemed less agitated.  Did well for the rest
   of the day.
   - Made plans to move ahead with trach.  His original [**Doctor First Name 458**] team referred
   us to the Red Team (Dr.[**Name (NI) 3954**] team).  Due to body habitus, ?
   history of NSTEMI, and INR of 1.5, surgery for trach as well as PEG may
   be difficult.
   - Continue treating VAP with meropenem
   - Alb/Ipt nebs
   2.  ID: Pneumonia, most likely VAP [**2-13**] ESBL GNR as well as GAS
   bateremia.
   - Pt
s improvement with meropenem leads to belief that GNR was ESBL.
   Will need 8 days of meropenem (day 1 [**9-18**])
   - Stopped vanc yesterday, [**9-22**] because no evidence to suggest
   continuing gram positive infection
   3.  Hypertension
   - Restart beta-blockade, metoprolol 25 mg TID with only minimal
   results.  Pt had one episode of hypotension so have been cautious
   regarding beta blockers.  However, her SBPs remain very high and he may
   benefit from increased anti-hypertensives.  Has required one time doses
   of prn metoprolol for pressure control.
   - Htn may be related to pain; controlling pain may help bring pressures
   down.  Restarting fentanyl and versed gtt did the most to adequately
   control his pressures.
   - HD removal of fluid also helps htn
   4.  ARF: Slightly improved; making urine.
   - [**9-22**] HD was more successful at decreasing BUN and phos.  If HD
   appears to be ineffective at removal of urea, phos, can consider
   changing over to CVVH.
   - On Aluminum for 3 days for hyperphos as well as phoslo
   - will d/c aluminum when phos < 6 and will then increase phoslo to 2
   TID and add sevelamer 800 TID
   5.  Diabetes
   - Continue Insulin gtt.  Will consider switching to subq when pt is
   more stable and is not frequently NPO for possible extubation.
   6.  LLE wound: s/p compartment syndrome and fasciotomy
   - Wound care restarted wound vac on [**9-21**].  Wound care will alert team
   when enough granulation tissue is present for grafting by plastics.
   - Pain service will see pt tomorrow to help guide pain control.  Will
   give standing Tylenol.  Restarted fentanyl gtt.
   7.  Hyperlipidemia - statin d/c
d in setting of acute illness with
   elevated CK
   - reassess when more stable
   8.  RCC - Based on CT findings
   - outpt f/u
   9.  FEN: Recently has been NPO for possible extubation.
   - tube feeds, free water flushes
   10. Communication: Only with wife and son
   - Met with wife and son yesterday, [**9-22**].

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, recent septic shock (group A strep), compartment syndrome post fasciotomy, acute respiratory failure (ARF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), leukocytosis, and previous non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

24-hour events:
- The patient was weaned to 7 of pressure support (PS) and 0 of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) with an FiO2 of 40% yesterday morning. However, he experienced a spontaneous desaturation event without any identifiable precipitating factor. He was also noted to be hypertensive with systolic blood pressures in the 200s. His PEEP and FiO2 were increased, and he showed improvement in oxygen saturation but continued to have hypertension. The fentanyl and versed drips were restarted, and he was switched to assisted control mode ventilation. The patient's pressures decreased, and he seemed less agitated for the rest of the day.
- Plans were made to proceed with a tracheostomy. His original team referred us to the Red Team (Dr. [Name] team).
- The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels transiently improved following hemodialysis (HD).
- Vancomycin was stopped, and the Infectious Disease"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 M with DM, recent septic shock (group A strep), compartment syndrome
   s/p fasciotomy, ARF, VAP, leukocytosis.
   1.  Respiratory distress/intubation: Difficulty weaning from vent.
   Possibly due to large amounts of sedation (BDZ and narcotics) or other
   metabolic insults contributing to overall encephalopathy vs primary
   central disease.
   - moving towards trach: surgery red team states that due to body
   habitus, ? history of NSTEMI, and INR of 1.5, surgery for trach as well
   as PEG may be difficult, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] or [**Doctor Last Name **] to see in AM as per
   thoracics
   - Continue treating VAP with meropenem (today is day [**6-20**])
   - Alb/Ipt nebs
   2.  Leukocytosis/ID: Pneumonia, most likely VAP [**2-13**] ESBL GNR as well as
   GAS bateremia.
   - Pt
s improvement with meropenem leads to belief that GNR was ESBL.
   Will need 8 days of meropenem (day 1 [**9-18**])
   - Stopped vanc yesterday, [**9-22**] because no evidence to suggest

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, recent septic shock (caused by group A streptococcus), compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy, acute renal failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), leukocytosis, hypertension, and other comorbidities. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been treated with meropenem for VAP, insulin for glycemic control, and restarted on fentanyl and versed drips for pain management. He is also receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Difficulty weaning from the ventilator: The patient is having trouble being taken off the ventilator, possibly due to large amounts of sedation or other metabolic insults contributing to overall encephalopathy.
2. Tracheostomy and Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG): Due to the patient's body habitus and history of NSTEMI, as well as an elevated INR, surgery for tracheostomy and PEG may be difficult.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains very high despite treatment with metoprolol, indicating the need for further anti-hypertensive medications. Pain may be contributing to the hypertension.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is improving, but he still has elevated BUN and creatinine levels. Hem"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-inch old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. Allergies include quinolones, with unknown specific allergies. The patient was last given meropenem on 09/21/2179 at 02:30 PM. The patient is currently receiving midazolam (versed) at a rate of 1 mg/hour, fentanyl at 70 mcg/hour, and insulin at 6 units/hour. In the ICU, the patient is also receiving midazolam (versed), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other medications including asa, h2b, sqh, meropenem, lopressor, CHG, tylenol, and phoslo.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99), heart rate of 87 bpm (70-92), blood pressure ranging from 176/71 to 227/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (14-27), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a first-degree AV block and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg. The patient has received a total of 1,679 mL of fluids since midnight, with 747 mL of transfused fluids and 332 mL of intravenous fluids. The patient has lost a total of 3,445 mL of blood products and 445 mL of urine. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 30 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O, and a respiratory system compliance of 85.7 cmH2O/mL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 41 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 142 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is overweight/obese, has pupils that are equal and reactive to light (PERRL), normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, normal heart sounds with a regular rate and rhythm, clear breath sounds anteriorly, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination. Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 13.4 to 14.8 thousand/mm3, hematocrit (Hct) ranging from 26.0 to 27.4%, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 671 to 768 thousand/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 92 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 9"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 M with DM, recent septic shock (group A strep), compartment syndrome
   s/p fasciotomy, ARF, VAP, leukocytosis.
   1.  Respiratory distress/intubation: Difficulty weaning from vent.
   Possibly due to large amounts of sedation (BDZ and narcotics) or other
   metabolic insults contributing to overall encephalopathy vs primary
   central disease.
   - moving towards trach: surgery red team states that due to body
   habitus, ? history of NSTEMI, and INR of 1.5, surgery for trach as well
   as PEG may be difficult, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] or [**Doctor Last Name **] to see in AM as per
   thoracics
   - Continue treating VAP with meropenem (today is day [**6-20**])
   - Alb/Ipt nebs
   2.  Leukocytosis/ID: Pneumonia, most likely VAP [**2-13**] ESBL GNR as well as
   GAS bateremia.
   - Pt
s improvement with meropenem leads to belief that GNR was ESBL.
   Will need 8 days of meropenem (day 1 [**9-18**])
   - Stopped vanc yesterday, [**9-22**] because no evidence to suggest
   continuing gram positive infection
   3.  Hypertension: Metoprolol 25 mg TID with only minimal results.  Pt
   had one episode of hypotension so have been cautious regarding beta
   blockers.  However, her SBPs remain very high and he may benefit from
   increased anti-hypertensives.  Has required one time doses of prn
   metoprolol for pressure control.  Htn may be related to pain;
   -control pain by restarting fentanyl and versed gtt for now, pain
   consult pending
   - HD removal of fluid
   4.  ARF: Slightly improved; making urine.  Improvement in
   BUN/creatinine.  [**9-22**] HD was more successful at decreasing BUN and
   phos.
   - On Aluminum for 3-4 days with today day #4 for hyperphos as well as
   phoslo
   - will d/c aluminum when phos < 6 and will then increase phoslo to 3
   TID and add sevelamer 800 TID
   5.  Diabetes
   - Continue Insulin gtt.  Will consider switching to subq when pt is
   more stable and is not frequently NPO for possible extubation.
   6.  LLE wound: s/p compartment syndrome and fasciotomy
   - Wound care restarted wound vac on [**9-21**].  Wound care will alert team
   when enough granulation tissue is present for grafting by plastics.
   - Pain service will see pt tomorrow to help guide pain control.  Will
   give standing Tylenol.  Restarted fentanyl gtt.
   7.  Hyperlipidemia - statin d/c
d in setting of acute illness with
   elevated CK
   - reassess when more stable
   8.  RCC - Based on CT findings
   - outpt f/u
   9.  FEN: Recently has been NPO for possible extubation.
   - tube feeds, free water flushes
   10. Communication: Only with wife and son
   - Met with wife and son yesterday, [**9-22**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, recent septic shock caused by group A strep, compartment syndrome post-fasciotomy, acute renal failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and leukocytosis.
- The patient has been difficult to wean from the ventilator, possibly due to sedation or metabolic insults.
- Tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) are planned for today.
- The patient's blood pressure remains high despite metoprolol therapy, and there is concern about pain contributing to hypertension.
- Renal function has slightly improved, with the patient making urine and a decrease in BUN and creatinine levels.
- The patient has hyperphosphatemia, and treatment with aluminum and sevelamer is being considered.
- Insulin therapy will continue for diabetes management.
- Wound care for the patient's lower extremity wound is ongoing, including the use of a wound vacuum.
- Pain management is being addressed by the pain service.
- The patient has hyperlipidemia, but statin therapy has been delayed until the patient is more stable.
- An outpatient follow-up is recommended for the renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
- The patient has been NPO (nothing by mouth) for possible extubation, and nutrition will be provided through tube feeds.
- Communication with the patient is limited to his wife and son."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 M with DM, recent septic shock (group A strep), compartment syndrome
   s/p fasciotomy, ARF, VAP, leukocytosis.
   1.  Respiratory distress/intubation: Difficulty weaning from vent due
   to concern for airway protection.  Possibly due to large amounts of
   sedation (BDZ and narcotics) or other metabolic insults contributing to
   overall encephalopathy vs primary central disease. Much more awake and
   alert today, suggesting effective HD helped to allieve uremic
   encephalopathy.
   - Trach and PEG today with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (add on)
   - Continue treating VAP with meropenem (today is day [**7-20**])
   - Alb/Ipt nebs
   2.  Leukocytosis/ID: Pneumonia, most likely VAP [**2-13**] ESBL GNR as well as
   GAS bateremia.
   - Pt
s improvement with meropenem leads to belief that GNR was ESBL.
   Will need 8 days of meropenem (day 1 [**9-18**])
   - Stopped vanc  [**9-22**] because no evidence to suggest continuing gram
   positive infection
   3.  Hypertension: Metoprolol 25 mg TID with only minimal results.  Pt
   had one episode of hypotension so have been cautious regarding beta
   blockers.  However, SBPs remain very high and he may benefit from
   increased anti-hypertensives.  Htn may be related to pain. Pain consult
   recommended ketamine.  Will hold off for now.
   -control pain by restarting fentanyl and versed gtt for now
   - HD removal of fluid
   - prn metoprolol for SBP > 180
   4.  ARF: Slightly improved; making urine.  Improvement in
   BUN/creatinine.  [**9-22**] HD was more successful at decreasing BUN and
   phos.
   - d/c aluminum
   - phoslo and sevelamer as per renal
   - HD line to be changed today in IR as most recent HD was not completed
   due to difficulties with the current line
   5.  Diabetes
   - Continue Insulin gtt.  Will consider switching to subq when pt is
   more stable and is not frequently NPO for possible extubation.
   6.  LLE wound: s/p compartment syndrome and fasciotomy
   - Wound care restarted wound vac on [**9-21**].  Wound care will alert team
   when enough granulation tissue is present for grafting by plastics.
   - Pain service will see pt tomorrow to help guide pain control.  Will
   give standing Tylenol.  Restarted fentanyl gtt.
   7.  Hyperlipidemia - statin d/c
d in setting of acute illness with
   elevated CK
   - reassess when more stable
   8.  RCC - Based on CT findings
   - outpt f/u
   9.  FEN: Recently has been NPO for possible extubation.
   - tube feeds, free water flushes
   10. Communication: Only with wife and son

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, who has been admitted to the ICU for recent septic shock caused by group A strep, compartment syndrome post fasciotomy, acute renal failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia, leukocytosis, and possible resistant gram-negative bacterial infection. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, but responding to commands. He has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia, and a possible renal cell carcinoma. The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, meropenem, insulin, ranitidine, and statins.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress/intubation: The patient is having difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to concerns about airway protection. This could be due to large amounts of sedation or other metabolic insults contributing to overall encephalopathy.
2. Leukocytosis/infectious disease: The patient has leukocytosis, which suggests an infection. The most likely diagnosis is ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by an ESBL-producing gram-negative bacterium as well as group A streptococcus bacteremia. The patient has been treated with meropenem, and there is improvement.
3. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure that is minimally responsive to metoprolol. It may be related to"

   Total time spent:
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has undergone a bronchoscopy and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The vital signs show a slightly elevated blood pressure, normal temperature, heart rate within the normal range, and a respiratory rate that is set at 20 breaths per minute with spontaneous respiration being zero. The oxygen saturation is at 98%.

The patient has a first-degree AV block, indicating a delay in the conduction of electrical signals between the atria and ventricles of the heart. The central venous pressure is within normal limits.

The fluid balance shows an intake of 2,412 mL with total output of 1,712 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 700 mL. The blood products transfused were 700 mL of packed red blood cells and 505 mL of fresh frozen plasma.

The respiratory support includes being connected to a ventilator with a set tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) of 40%, plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O, and compliance of 54.5 cmH2O/mL. The ABG (arterial blood gas) results indicate normal oxygenation and ventilation.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y/o man with
          Respiratory failure
   o         I have recommended tracheostomy to his wife and son.  [**Name (NI) **] my
   prior notes regarding decisionmaking.  Although his mental status has
   improved today, he is still at substantial risk for extubation
   failure.  Given his prior difficult intubation (and likely more
   difficult now given relatively long intubation), I feel that the best
   balance of risks and benefits is to proceed with tracheostomy at this
   point.
   o         Anticipate T/G in OR by thoracics today
          Acute renal failure now on hemodialysis
   o         HD per renal.
   o         Continued issues with relatively low flows on line.  To IR
   for fluoroscopic-guided reposition today
   o         Phos binder
          Severe LE infection s/p fasciotomy
   o         Appears controlled by fasciotomy and antibiotics.  Will
   eventually need skin grafting.
   o         Vac in place
   o         Completed ABX in course laid out by ID
          Group A strep bacteremia
   o         Completed ABX course laid out by ID
          Altered mental status
   o         Improving
          Hypertension
   o         Better controlled
          Obesity
          Probable VAP
   o         We have finally made progress with his leucocytosis and
   marked left shift.  The overall pattern is consistent with an
   ESBL-producing organism that we did not grow, since his leucocytosis
   only started to improve after changing from Zosyn to meropenem.
   o         Day 7 of 8 today on meropenem
          Difficult airway
          Renal abnormality on CT, likely RCC
   o         Will need outpatient follow-up.  Our team has discussed with
   his family.
          Pain control
   o         Improved control now
          Diabetes, uncontrolled
   o         Continue insulin infusion given changing caloric intake
          Access
   o         To IR today for HD line placement
   o         PICC today, then d/c CVL
   o         Check matched ABG / VBG and consider d/c arterial line

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with respiratory failure. The patient's mental status has improved but he is still at substantial risk for extubation failure. The attending physician recommends proceeding with a tracheostomy due to the patient's prior difficult intubation and the relatively long duration of intubation.

The patient has several other medical conditions and complications, including acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, severe lower extremity infection with fasciotomy, obesity, probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), difficult airway, renal abnormality on CT scan likely renal cell carcinoma (RCC), pain control, uncontrolled diabetes, and access issues with lines.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with the following settings: Vt (set) 600 mL, RR (set) 20, PEEP 10 cmH2O, FiO2 40%, PIP 38 cmH2O, Plateau 21 cmH2O, Compliance 54.5 cmH2O/mL. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 390, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's laboratory values indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a high neutrophil count, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) levels, normal platelet count (Plt), elevated creat"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 M with DM, recent septic shock (group A strep), compartment syndrome
   s/p fasciotomy, ARF, VAP, leukocytosis.
   1.  Respiratory distress/intubation: Difficulty weaning from vent due
   to concern for airway protection.  Possibly due to large amounts of
   sedation (BDZ and narcotics) or other metabolic insults contributing to
   overall encephalopathy vs primary central disease. Much more awake and
   alert today, suggesting effective HD helped to allieve uremic
   encephalopathy.
   - Trach and PEG today with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (add on)
   - Continue treating VAP with meropenem (today is day [**7-20**])
   - Alb/Ipt nebs
   2.  Leukocytosis/ID: Pneumonia, most likely VAP [**2-13**] ESBL GNR as well as
   GAS bateremia.
   - Pt
s improvement with meropenem leads to belief that GNR was ESBL.
   Will need 8 days of meropenem (day 1 [**9-18**])
   - Stopped vanc  [**9-22**] because no evidence to suggest continuing gram
   positive infection
   3.  Hypertension: Metoprolol 25 mg TID with only minimal results.  Pt
   had one episode of hypotension so have been cautious regarding beta
   blockers.  However, SBPs remain very high and he may benefit from
   increased anti-hypertensives.  Htn may be related to pain. Pain consult
   recommended ketamine.  Will hold off for now.
   -control pain by restarting fentanyl and versed gtt for now
   - HD removal of fluid
   - prn metoprolol for SBP > 180
   4.  ARF: Slightly improved; making urine.  Improvement in
   BUN/creatinine.  [**9-22**] HD was more successful at decreasing BUN and
   phos.
   - d/c aluminum
   - phoslo and sevelamer as per renal
   - HD line to be changed today in IR as most recent HD was not completed
   due to difficulties with the current line
   5.  Diabetes
   - Continue Insulin gtt.  Will consider switching to subq when pt is
   more stable and is not frequently NPO for possible extubation.
   6.  LLE wound: s/p compartment syndrome and fasciotomy
   - Wound care restarted wound vac on [**9-21**].  Wound care will alert team
   when enough granulation tissue is present for grafting by plastics.
   - Pain service will see pt tomorrow to help guide pain control.  Will
   give standing Tylenol.  Restarted fentanyl gtt.
   7.  Hyperlipidemia - statin d/c
d in setting of acute illness with
   elevated CK
   - reassess when more stable
   8.  RCC - Based on CT findings
   - outpt f/u
   9.  FEN: Recently has been NPO for possible extubation.
   - tube feeds, free water flushes
   10. Communication: Only with wife and son

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of diabetes, recent septic shock due to group A strep, compartment syndrome that required fasciotomy, acute renal failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and leukocytosis. The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. He underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) without complications. The patient's blood pressure remains high despite being on metoprolol, and he is still receiving insulin for his diabetes. His renal function has slightly improved, but he still requires hemodialysis (HD). The patient's left lower extremity (LLE) wound is being managed with wound care and pain control. He has hyperlipidemia and right renal cell carcinoma (RCC) that will require outpatient follow-up. The patient has not been eating orally (NPO) for possible extubation and is receiving tube feeds. He is currently sedated but more alert today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress/intubation: The patient may continue to have difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to concerns about airway protection, large amounts of sedation, or metabolic insults contributing to overall encephalopathy.
2. Leukocytosis/ID: The patient has leukocytosis and a possible VAP caused by an ESBL-producing Gram-negative rod, as well as"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 M with DM, recent septic shock (group A strep), compartment syndrome
   s/p fasciotomy, ARF, VAP, leukocytosis.
   1.  Respiratory distress/intubation: Difficulty weaning from vent due
   to concern for airway protection.  Possibly due to large amounts of
   sedation (BDZ and narcotics) or other metabolic insults contributing to
   overall encephalopathy vs primary central disease. Much more awake and
   alert today, suggesting effective HD helped to allieve uremic
   encephalopathy. Trach and PEG in place.
   - allow trach maturation, attempt to wean from vent
   - Continue treating VAP with meropenem until [**9-26**] (today is day [**8-20**])
   - Alb/Ipt nebs
   - chest PT
   2.  Leukocytosis/ID: Pneumonia, most likely VAP [**2-13**] ESBL GNR as well as
   GAS bateremia. Patient completed treatment for both etiologies.
   - Pt
s improvement with meropenem leads to belief that GNR was ESBL.
   3.  Hypertension: Metoprolol 25 mg TID with only minimal results.  Pt
   had one episode of hypotension so have been cautious regarding beta
   blockers.  However, SBPs remain very high and he may benefit from
   increased anti-hypertensives.  Htn may be related to pain. Pain consult
   recommended ketamine.  Will hold off for now.
   -control pain by restarting fentanyl and versed gtt for now
   - HD removal of fluid
   - metoprolol 10mg IV q4 until ok to use PEG for meds --- then,
   metoprolol 25mg TID as prior to PEG placement
   4.  ARF: Slightly improved; making urine.  Improvement in
   BUN/creatinine.  [**9-22**] HD was more successful at decreasing BUN and
   phos.  HD tunneled line placed. Renal has put in HD orders for [**9-25**] but
   remark that if the patient continues with increased urine output and
   decreasing creatinine, would hold off on HD and monitor.
   - phoslo and sevelamer (once phos <6) as per renal
   - f/u renal recs if HD today or not
   5.  Diabetes
   - Continue Insulin gtt.  Will consider switching to subq when pt is
   more stable and after approp glycemic control on regular tube feeds.
   6.  LLE wound: s/p compartment syndrome and fasciotomy
   - Wound care restarted wound vac on [**9-21**].  Wound care will alert team
   when enough granulation tissue is present for grafting by plastics.
   - Pain service will see pt tomorrow to help guide pain control.  Will
   give standing Tylenol.  Restarted fentanyl gtt.
   - VAC dressing to be changed [**9-27**]
   7.  Hyperlipidemia - statin d/c
d in setting of acute illness with
   elevated CK
   - reassess when more stable
   8.  RCC - Based on CT findings
   - outpt f/u, has been discussed with family
   9.  FEN:
   - tube feeds, free water flushes to restart tonight (24 hours post-OR)
   10. Communication: Only with wife and son
   - Met with wife and son, [**9-22**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes, recent septic shock (group A strep), compartment syndrome, acute renal failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), leukocytosis, hypertension, and right lower extremity (RLE) wound. He underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) without complications. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, ranitidine, heparin, insulin, fentanyl, and midazolam. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and right renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 157/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air, and a first-degree atrioventricular block.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress/intubation: The patient may experience difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to concern for airway protection. This could be caused by large amounts of sedation or other metabolic insults contributing to overall encephalopathy, rather than primary central disease.
2. Leukocytosis/infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which could indicate an ongoing infection, specifically ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Treatment with meropenem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-inch tall male with unknown allergies to quinolones. He has tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) in place. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, insulin, and heparin. The patient's blood pressure has been consistently high, so he is being treated with amlodipine and metoprolol. His renal function has improved, as indicated by decreasing serum creatinine levels. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, while his hemoglobin and platelet levels are within normal range. His electrolyte levels, liver function tests, and amylase/lipase levels are also within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypertension: The patient's consistently high blood pressure indicates uncontrolled hypertension, which can lead to complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems.

2. Infection: Elevated white blood cell count suggests the possibility of an ongoing infection. Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to mechanical ventilation and other ICU interventions, he may be at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

3. Renal dysfunction: Although the patient's renal function has improved, the recent history of needing dialysis suggests potential renal impairment. This can lead to electrolyte"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 M with DM, recent septic shock (group A strep), compartment syndrome
   s/p fasciotomy, ARF, VAP, leukocytosis.
   1.  Respiratory distress/intubation: Difficulty weaning from vent due
   to concern for airway protection.  Possibly due to large amounts of
   sedation (BDZ and narcotics) or other metabolic insults contributing to
   overall encephalopathy vs primary central disease. Much more awake and
   alert today, suggesting effective HD helped to allieve uremic
   encephalopathy. Trach and PEG in place.
   - allow trach maturation, attempt to wean from vent
   - Continue treating VAP with meropenem until [**9-26**] (today is day [**8-20**])
   - Alb/Ipt nebs
   - chest PT
   2.  Leukocytosis/ID: Pneumonia, most likely VAP [**2-13**] ESBL GNR as well as
   GAS bateremia. Patient completed treatment for both etiologies.
   - Pt
s improvement with meropenem leads to belief that GNR was ESBL.
   3.  Hypertension: Metoprolol 25 mg TID with only minimal results.  Pt
   had one episode of hypotension so have been cautious regarding beta
   blockers.  However, SBPs remain very high and he may benefit from
   increased anti-hypertensives.  Htn may be related to pain. Pain consult
   recommended ketamine.  Will hold off for now.
   -control pain by restarting fentanyl and versed gtt for now
   - HD removal of fluid
   - metoprolol 10mg IV q4 until ok to use PEG for meds --- then,
   metoprolol 25mg TID as prior to PEG placement
   4.  ARF: Slightly improved; making urine.  Improvement in
   BUN/creatinine.  [**9-22**] HD was more successful at decreasing BUN and
   phos.  HD tunneled line placed. Renal has put in HD orders for [**9-25**] but
   remark that if the patient continues with increased urine output and
   decreasing creatinine, would hold off on HD and monitor.
   - phoslo and sevelamer (once phos <6) as per renal
   - f/u renal recs if HD today or not
   5.  Diabetes
   - Continue Insulin gtt.  Will consider switching to subq when pt is
   more stable and after approp glycemic control on regular tube feeds.
   6.  LLE wound: s/p compartment syndrome and fasciotomy
   - Wound care restarted wound vac on [**9-21**].  Wound care will alert team
   when enough granulation tissue is present for grafting by plastics.
   - Pain service will see pt tomorrow to help guide pain control.  Will
   give standing Tylenol.  Restarted fentanyl gtt.
   - VAC dressing to be changed [**9-27**]
   7.  Hyperlipidemia - statin d/c
d in setting of acute illness with
   elevated CK
   - reassess when more stable
   8.  RCC - Based on CT findings
   - outpt f/u, has been discussed with family
   9.  FEN:
   - tube feeds, free water flushes to restart tonight (24 hours post-OR)
   10. Communication: Only with wife and son
   - Met with wife and son, [**9-22**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 70-year-old male with diabetes, has been experiencing recent septic shock (group A strep), compartment syndrome, acute renal failure (ARF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and leukocytosis.
- The patient's respiratory distress and intubation are ongoing, with concerns about airway protection due to large amounts of sedation or metabolic insults. The patient is more awake and alert today, suggesting that hemodialysis helped alleviate uremic encephalopathy.
- Tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) are in place for airway protection and feeding.
- The patient has completed treatment for pneumonia and bacteremia, likely caused by ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria.
- Hypertension persists despite metoprolol therapy, so additional anti-hypertensive medications may be necessary. Pain management is also a concern.
- ARF has shown slight improvement with increased urine output and decreasing creatinine levels. Renal consultation recommends holding off on hemodialysis if the patient continues to improve.
- Diabetes management involves ongoing insulin therapy, possibly transitioning to subcutaneous insulin once the patient is more stable.
- The lower extremity (LE) wound, resulting from compartment syndrome and fasciotomy, requires wound care and monitoring for grafting by plastics.
- Hyperlipidemia treatment will be reassessed when the patient is more stable.
- Renal cell carcinoma"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, recent septic shock (group A strep), compartment syndrome, acute renal failure (ARF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and leukocytosis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. He has tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes in place. The patient's blood pressure remains very high despite being on metoprolol, and he has a history of pain. The patient's renal function has slightly improved with increased urine output and decreasing creatinine levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to concern for airway protection.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and the possibility of a multidrug-resistant organism.
3. Uncontrolled hypertension.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF) with ongoing fluid overload.
5. Potential need for dialysis.
6. Wound care and management of lower extremity wound due to compartment syndrome.
7. Pain management.
8. Hyperlipidemia and potential need for statin therapy.
9. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) based on CT findings.
10. Feeding tube placement and nutrition support."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock requiring fasciotomy and mechanical ventilation. The patient had an initial ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) that has since resolved. He underwent tracheostomy placement due to a risky airway and decreased respiratory drive secondary to narcotics. The patient is currently weaning off the ventilator and tracheostomy mask.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Respiratory distress - s/p trach placement for risky airway and decreased respiratory drive.
2. Acute kidney injury (ARF) - resolving with increasing urine output.
3. Hypernatremia - 4L free water deficit.
4. Leukocytosis - resolving, with a WBC count of 11 today.
5. Hypertension - wide range but overall high. The patient is on home medications including atenolol, dyazide, and benzapril. Diuretics and ACE inhibitors are being held until kidney function recovers.
6. Hyperlipidemia - statin stopped in setting of creatine kinase (CK) elevation. Restart crestor and check CK.
7. Pain control - limited by respiratory function but currently less of an issue. Fentanyl patch at 75 mcg, wean IV fentanyl drip as tolerated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock requiring fasciotomy and mechanical ventilation. He has since been weaned off the ventilator and is in the process of recovering from acute respiratory failure (ARF). The patient's medical history includes hypertension, resolved ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and elevated blood glucose levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on multiple antihypertensive medications. His blood pressure remains elevated despite these medications, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. If left untreated, hypertension can lead to further complications such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level of 154 mg/dL, indicating hypernatremia. This condition can result from dehydration or excessive sodium intake. If not managed properly, hypernatremia can lead to neurological complications such as seizures and coma.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's initial labs showed elevated creatinine levels, indicating impaired kidney function. ARF can occur due to various factors like sepsis, dehydration, or medication use. If not treated promptly, ARF can progress to chronic kidney disease or require long-term dialysis.

4. Diabetic Complications: As a diabetic patient, the patient is at risk for diabetic complications such as uncontrolled blood glucose levels, which can"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM), recovering from gastrointestinal (GAS) septic shock, left lower extremity (LLE) compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy, acute renal failure (ARF) on hemodialysis (HD) thought to be caused by acute tubular necrosis (ATN), resolved extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gram-negative bacillus ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and tracheostomy (trach) placement for risky airway and decreased respiratory drive. The patient has completed an 8-day course of meropenem and is tolerating tracheostomy mask well. The patient's ARF is improving, with 3 liters of urine output in the past 24 hours, and may not need further HD if urine output continues. The patient also has hypernatremia, which has been treated with free water boluses via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and D5W intravenous (IV). The patient denies pain, but will continue on fentanyl patch for pain control. The patient's diabetes is well-controlled, and he is currently on insulin gtt. The patient's blood pressure is high, and diuretics and ACE inhibitors will be held while kidney function recovers. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, and has undergone a radical cystectomy (RCC) with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient's wife and son are the only communicators, and they were met with on [**9-22**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress - The patient had respiratory distress due to risky airway and decreased respiratory drive, which required tracheostomy placement. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status and provide appropriate respiratory support as needed.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF) - The patient initially had ARF on HD thought to be caused by ATN. Although the ARF is improving, close monitoring of renal function is necessary, and further HD may be required if urine output does not meet the desired level.
3. Hypernatremia - The patient has hypernatremia, which has been treated with free water boluses via PEG and D5W IV. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's sodium levels and adjust fluid management accordingly to prevent further complications.
4. Left Lower Extremity Compartment Syndrome - The patient had LLE compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy. Although the compartment syndrome has resolved, the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of reoccurrence or complications related to the fasciotomy.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) - The patient had resolved ESBL GNR VAP. Close monitoring for any signs of recurrent infection or worsening respiratory status is necessary.
6. Hypertension - The patient has uncontrolled hypertension"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) who was admitted to the ICU for resolving gas septic shock, left lower extremity (LLE) compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy, acute renal failure (ARF) on hemodialysis (HD) thought to be secondary to toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), resolved extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gram-negative bacillus ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and tracheostomy (trach). The patient is currently weaning from mechanical ventilation and resolving ARF.

The patient has a history of DM, which is well controlled with insulin. He also has hypertension (HTN) that is not well controlled despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications. The patient's hyperlipidemia is being managed with statins.

The patient's current medications include meropenem, insulin, heparin sodium, and fentanyl patch for pain control. He is also receiving Combivent nebs and chest physiotherapy for respiratory support.

The patient's recent lab results show normal white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet (Plt) levels. However, his creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. His glucose levels are well controlled within normal range. Other lab results show slightly elevated levels of lactate, lactic acid, and lipase.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock requiring fasciotomy, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute respiratory failure (ARF). The patient underwent tracheostomy placement due to a risky airway and decreased respiratory drive secondary to narcosis. He completed an 8-day course of meropenem and is currently being weaned from the ventilator and tracheostomy mask. The patient's leukocytosis is resolving, with a current white blood cell count of 11.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory distress - The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a respiratory support device. He is expected to be weaned off the vest and tracheostomy mask soon. ABG in the morning, and pulse oximetry will be monitored overnight.
2. Leukocytosis - The patient's white blood cell count is resolving, but he still has slightly elevated levels.
3. Hypertension - The patient's blood pressure readings show a wide range, but overall, it remains high. His home medications include atenolol 50, diazide, and benzapril. Diuretics and ACE inhibitors are being held while kidney function recovers. Amlodipine has been restarted, and the beta-blocker dose has been increased to 37.5 TID.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who has been admitted to the ICU. He has a history of resolving gas septic shock, left lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy, acute respiratory failure on hemodialysis thought to be due to acute tubular necrosis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative rod ventilator-associated pneumonia, and tracheostomy placement. The patient is currently weaning from the ventilator with resolving acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress - The patient may experience respiratory distress due to the recent tracheostomy placement and decreased respiratory drive.
2. Delirium - The patient is likely to have delirium caused by ICU stay, multiple organ dysfunction, and uremia.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF) - Although the patient's ARF is improving with adequate urine output and decreasing creatinine, there is a possibility of further deterioration.
4. Hypernatremia - The patient has hypernatremia, which is improving but needs close monitoring and replacement of free water deficit.
5. Left lower extremity (LLE) fasciotomy - The patient underwent fasciotomy for compartment syndrome in the LLE. The wound needs regular monitoring and dressing changes, and a plan for potential skin grafting should be discussed with the plastics team before discharge.
6. Pain control - Although the patient denies pain, ongoing pain control measures should be implemented"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who was admitted to the ICU for resolving GAS septic shock, lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy, acute renal failure on hemodialysis thought to be secondary to ATN, resolved extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Gram-negative rod ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and tracheostomy placement. The patient's current condition shows improvement in respiratory distress, weaning from the ventilator, and resolving acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient may experience difficulty breathing or increased respiratory distress due to the tracheostomy placement and weaning from the ventilator.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, indicating a potential electrolyte imbalance. This can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or muscle cramps.

3. Lower extremity complications: The patient has a history of lower extremity compartment syndrome, which required fasciotomy. There is a risk of developing further complications such as infections or non-healing wounds.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Although the patient's acute renal failure is improving, there is still a risk of developing AKI due to factors such as medication use, infection, or hypotension.

5. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure, and it needs to be managed carefully to prevent complications"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who was admitted with resolving gas exchange (GAS) septic shock, lower left extremity (LLE) compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy, acute renal failure (ARF) on hemodialysis (HD) thought to be caused by acute tubular necrosis (ATN), extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gram-negative bacillus ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and tracheostomy placement. The patient is currently weaning from the ventilator and has resolving ARF. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory distress - The patient had respiratory distress after tracheostomy placement due to risky airway and decreased respiratory drive. The patient is currently tolerating tracheostomy mask well and is being weaned from the ventilator.

2. Delirium - The patient is likely experiencing delirium due to ICU stay, multiple organ dysfunction, and uremia. Haloperidol or quetiapine may be used as needed to manage delirium.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF) - The patient has improving ARF with adequate urine output and decreasing creatinine. Further hemodialysis may not be necessary.

4. Hypernatremia - The patient has improving hypernatremia with several liters free water deficit. The patient is currently replacing free water and tolerating fluid by mouth (TF) at 300 mL every 4 hours. D5W infusion may be stopped today since the insulin drip has been discontinued.

5. LLE Fasciotomy - The patient had fasciotomy for compartment syndrome in the lower left extremity. The vacuum-assisted closure (Vac) dressing was changed yesterday, and the patient received a bolus dose of fentanyl for the dressing change. The patient will have Monday and Thursday dressing changes, and wound care recommendations will be provided. The plan for continued need for skin grafting will be discussed with the plastics team before discharge.

6. Pain Control - The patient denies pain, but continues to receive fentanyl patch for pain control. The patch dose will be decreased by 25 mcg with each patch change.

7. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) - The patient's blood glucose levels are trending up since discontinuation of insulin drip. The patient will continue without insulin drip and increase NPH to 50 units.

8. Hypertension - The patient has a blood pressure in the 140s-150s range. Home medications include atenolol 50, dyazide, and benzapril. Diuretics and ACE inhibitors will be held while kidney function recovers. Amlodipine has been restarted, and metoprolol has been increased to 75 mg three times a day on September 27th.

9. Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) - The patient has RCC on CT scan. Outpatient follow"
