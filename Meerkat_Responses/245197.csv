","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient presents with hypotension and is currently receiving fluids and vasopressor support. He has several comorbidities including plasma cell dyscrasia, right below-knee amputation, chronic respiratory failure, and sacral decubitus ulcers. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but he is experiencing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to hypovolemia from over ultrafiltration or sepsis. Close monitoring and aggressive fluid resuscitation are necessary. Vasopressor support may be required.
2. Sepsis: The patient's immune system is compromised due to ESRD, making him susceptible to infections. Wound infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia should be considered and treated promptly.
3. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient's tracheostomy has not improved his respiratory function, and he requires ventilatory support. Prolonged mechanical ventilation can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia and lung injury.
4. ESRD: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he requires hemodialysis. Fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances should be closely monitored.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with unknown primary complaints. The patient has undergone multiple procedures and interventions since admission, including the placement of a multi-lumen, midline, and dialysis catheter. The patient has allergies to penicillins and sulfa drugs, and received doses of ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and acyclovir overnight. The patient is currently receiving norepinephrine infusion and other ICU medications. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/48 to 130/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheal mask ventilation. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 599 mL, with no output recorded. Blood products have not been administered. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen. 

Physical examination findings are limited due to non-assessment of peripheral pulses, skin, neurologic status, and other systems. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and troponin-T levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges or not significantly abnormal. 

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and various lines and"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 y.o male, chronic trach, s/p mult admissions, ESRD, CAD, afib, DM2,
   plasma cell dyscrasia who presents with hypotension.
   .
   #Hypotension: Pt found to be hypotensive in HD today. Apparently, was
   mentating. However, SBP found to be 50/30's in ED. Etiologies include
   hypovolemia secondary HD session or blood loss. Other possibilities
   include infection/sepsis (white count/lactate). Pt has has many
   hospitalizations, colonizations and antibiotic course for various
   PNA's, UTIs as well as many sources including trach, HD lines.. Other
   possibilies include pnx, PE (unlikely given supratherapeutic INR),
   tamponade, medication effect, or other cardiac event. However, most
   likely scenerio is infection/sepsis. Given, pt's multiple infections in
   the past with MRSA, actinobacter, serratia, multiple resistance
   patterns and infections to PCN/sulfa will have to cover with broad
   spectum antibiotics.
   -Vanco, meropenem, cipro/flagyl
   -acyclovir for ?zoster.
   -bcx, ucx, sputum cx
   -trend fever curve/wbc count
   -IVF for CVP 8-12
   -levophed for map >65
   .
   # Sepsis: Meets SIRS criteria with WBC to 13.2, HR>100 and BP 50/33.
   Lactate of 4 now decreased to 2.8 with IVF and pressors. Likely source
   is PNA although urine, wound and lines are potential sources.
   - Femoral Central Venous Line placed in E.D. Unable to transduce
   however will need to fluid resuscitate on clinical exam.
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65. Pt on
   HD so cannot assess [**Last Name (LF) 949**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] need to follow neuro exams and serial
   lactates.
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   -wound cx
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   -ID consult in am.
   .
   #Chronic Respiratory Failure: Known hx of hypercarbic/hypoxic
   respiratory failure now s/p trachostomy from early [**2149**]. Prior BAL
   without endobronchial lesions or tracheobronchomalacia. Pt has had
   MRSA, pseudomonal, actinobacter, serratia PNA.
   -broad spectrum abx.
   -trach [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] ventilate if needed
   -ABGs.
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-17**] to diabetic nephropathy.
   - Continued renagel.
   -will notify renal to plan for HD.
   .
   #acid/base: Pt with ""normal bicarb"" but a gap of 17. Explanations
   include lactic acidosis, renal failure. However, one would not expect
   normal bicarb. Possible that pt, has a metabolic alkalosis or chronic
   resp acidosis with compensatory met alkalosis.
   -IVF
   -abg's.
   -HD session
   -abx.
   -repeat CMP in am.
   .
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%). Dilated Left Ventricular Cavity. Pt
   with trop 0.53 which is higher than prior. Likely is enzyme leak in the
   setting of demand due to hypotension during HD. Also in the setting of
   renal failure. INR supratherapeutic.
   -continue statin, BB when BP tolerates.
   -ROMI
   -repeat EKG in am.
   -consider echo.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt with INR of 3.3.
   - Continue metoprolol for rate control when BP can tolerate.
   - Cont coumadin to maintain INR [**1-18**], will hold PM dose.
   .
   # Type II DM: Pt with BS of 205 on admission.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple hospitalizations, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, and plasma cell dyscrasia. He presents with hypotension and is suspected to have sepsis, possibly due to a pneumonia or other sources of infection such as the tracheostomy or dialysis catheter. He has a high white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient also has chronic respiratory failure, requiring a tracheostomy, and has had previous infections including MRSA, pseudomonal, actinobacter, and serratia. He is on hemodialysis for ESRD.

The patient has multiple medical complications including acid-base imbalance, CAD with left ventricular dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus, right below-knee amputation, and plasma cell dyscrasia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, respiratory failure, further deterioration of cardiac function, uncontrolled diabetes, and complications related to ESRD and plasma cell dyscrasia."

   Infectious Disease:
   1.Agree with Meropenem to cover broad gram negative and ESBL coverage.
   2.Can continue Ciprofloxacin while weaning off pressors and cultures

   discontinue double gram negative coverage.
   3. D/C Linezolid and start Daptomycin at 6 mg/kg q 48 hours (after HD
   if possible). Daptomycin with better soft tissue and
   bone penetration and would prefer given possibility of sacral decubitus
   ulcer/osteo as source.
   3.Would obtain stool cultures and start empiric PO vanc for c. diff.
   4.Would send sputum for gram stain and culture
   5.Follow up urine, blood and wound culture. Draw blood cultures off HD
   line
   6.D/C midline. Would favor change HD line if repeat positive blood
   cultures as per [**Hospital1 630**] has not been changed for ""months""

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presents with hypotension and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is on various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can be attributed to several factors such as hypovolemia due to overultrfiltration or sepsis (line, wounds, urine, PNA, stool). Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, serial lactate levels, and neurologic exams is necessary. The patient may require fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.

2. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of tracheostomy and is currently on tracheal ventilation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered to cover potential respiratory pathogens. If the patient's condition worsens, mechanical ventilation may be required.

3. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis due to diabetic nephropathy. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is crucial. The patient may require ongoing dialysis management.

4. CAD: The patient has stable troponins, suggesting possible demand ischemia in the setting of acute renal failure. Continuing statin and beta-blocker therapy"

   discontinue double gram negative coverage.
   3. D/C Linezolid and start Daptomycin at 6 mg/kg q 48 hours (after HD
   if possible). Daptomycin with better soft tissue and
   bone penetration and would prefer given possibility of sacral decubitus
   ulcer/osteo as source.
   3.Would obtain stool cultures and start empiric PO vanc for c. diff.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic tracheostomy, history of multiple admissions, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient presents with hypotension and is being managed for hypovolemia versus sepsis. The plan includes careful intravenous fluid resuscitation, weaning off vasopressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. 

The patient also has chronic respiratory failure secondary to tracheostomy, ESRD on hemodialysis due to diabetic nephropathy, and a history of coronary artery disease. 

There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple risk factors for sepsis, including chronic wounds, tracheostomy, and recent hospital admissions. The presence of hypotension and elevated lactate levels suggests a possible infection.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline renal function is compromised due to ESRD. However, the elevated lactate levels and presence of metabolic acidosis indicate the possibility of AKI on top of the pre-existing renal disease.

3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and atrial fibrillation. His current condition, including hypotension and elevated troponin levels, raises concerns for cardiac ischemia or other cardiac events.

4. Respiratory failure: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (afib), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). He presents with hypotension and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can be attributed to hypovolemia due to overultrfiltration or sepsis from various sources such as central venous line, wounds, urine, pneumonia, or stool. The patient requires careful intravenous fluid (IVF) resuscitation, weaning off norepinephrine, and consideration of transitioning to vasopressin. Serial lactate levels and neurological examinations should be monitored.

2. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to tracheostomy, which is now on 40% oxygen. It is unclear if underlying pneumonia is present. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered, and the patient may require ventilation if needed. Regular ABGs and culture follow-up should be done.

3. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) due to diabetic nephropathy. There is a metabolic acidosis gap despite elevated lactate levels. Renal gel should be continued, and the renal team should be notified.

4. CAD: The patient has a troponin level of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including chronic tracheostomy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presents with hypotension and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions.

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to hypovolemia due to overultrfiltration or sepsis from possible sources such as line infections, wounds, urine, pneumonia, or stool. The patient is receiving vasopressor support with Levophed and Vasopressin, and attempts are being made to wean off these medications. Serial lactate levels and neurologic examinations are being monitored.

2. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure secondary to tracheostomy, for which he is on long-term ventilation support. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and tracheostomy management is being performed.

3. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) due to diabetic nephropathy. The frequency of HD is pending further evaluation.

4. CAD: The patient's stable troponin levels suggest demand ischemia in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI). Statin therapy, beta-blockers, revascularization options (ROMI), and an ech"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presents with hypotension and has been admitted to the ICU.

24-hour events include sputum culture with GNR (others NGTD), discontinuation of acyclovir, transfusion of 2 units, and initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient underwent debridement, wet-to-dry dressings, and optimized nutrition. The patient is on an air mattress and receiving vasopressors.

Allergies include penicillins and sulfa (sulfonamides). The patient has received multiple antibiotics over the past day, including acyclovir, metronidazole, daptomycin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and vancomycin.

Infusions include norepinephrine at 0.06 mcg/kg/min and vasopressin at 2.4 units/hour. Other ICU medications include famotidine (Pepcid) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for left-sided hip pain, which the patient nods in response when asked if it is under control.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, type I diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and anemia. The patient's hemodynamics have improved, and there is an effort to reduce the dose of levophed and remove it today. Vasopressin will be maintained for an additional 24 hours. Oxygen saturation has decreased slightly, and there may be increased lung water based on the chest X-ray. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable, and they are not currently at the threshold for a blood transfusion. ICU care includes tube feeds, glycemic control with regular insulin, and various lines such as a dialysis catheter, arterial line, and multi-lumen line. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, type II diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and plasma cell dyscrasia. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension due to hypovolemia and sepsis. He is receiving vasopressor support with Levo and Vasopressin. His CVP is stable between 7-12. The medical team is attempting to wean off these medications while monitoring lactate levels and neurological examination to assess perfusion.

The patient has chronic respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and is currently on tracheal ventilation at 50%. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the team plans to obtain ABGs and follow up with cultures.

In terms of ESRD, there are no changes in the patient's mental status, uremia, or hypokalemia. Normal lactate levels are observed, and the team is considering continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Renal replacement therapy is planned for today or tomorrow.

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), which is stable with normal troponin levels. Statin and beta-blocker therapy will be continued once blood pressure stabilizes, and an echocardi"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for resistant infections, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presents with hypotension and has been admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and rising lactate levels.
2. Severe Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The etiology is likely due to infections in various sites such as lines, wounds, urine, and pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and cultures are being followed.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension despite being on vasopressors. Efforts are being made to wean off the pressors, but so far, unsuccessful.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia and sacral/leg ulcers. Wound care and vascular recommendations are being followed.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and has recently required intubation and mechanical ventilation. ABGs are being monitored, and cultures"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple chronic conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and plasma cell dyscrasia. 

The patient's current medical issues and plans are as follows:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to hypovolemia caused by overdiuresis or sepsis. The patient is receiving vasopressors (Levo) and vasopressin to maintain blood pressure. The CVP is ranging from 7-12 depending on the patient's position.

2. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been on chronic respiratory support since tracheostomy placement. He is currently on 50% FiO2 and broad-spectrum antibiotics. ABGs and tracheal cultures will be followed up.

3. ESRD: The patient's renal function remains stable with no changes in mental status, no uremia, and normal lactate levels. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) is being considered.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's troponin levels are stable. Statin and beta-blocker therapy will be continued, and an echo will be done following sepsis resolution.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and plasma cell dyscrasia. 

The patient's current medical conditions include renal failure, severe sepsis, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and plasma cell dyscrasia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening renal failure, progression of sepsis leading to septic shock, development of pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and complications related to diabetes mellitus type II. 

The patient's treatment plan involves continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics based on the estimated creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min, monitoring blood, urine, stool, and wound cultures, trending white blood cell count, switching nebulizers to metered-dose inhalers, maintaining the patient on mechanical ventilation, and monitoring labs on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH). 

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple comorbidities and associated complications in the intensive care unit (ICU)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for resistant infections, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presents with hypotension and is currently on two vasopressors (Levo and Vasopressin). The patient has impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), type I diabetes mellitus, and chronic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple sources of infection, including line-related, wounds, urine, and pneumonia. This could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Hypotension: The patient is already hypotensive and on two vasopressors. There is a risk of continued hypoperfusion and organ damage.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised due to ESRD. There is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
5. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
6. Diabetic Complications: The patient has type I diabetes, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (afib), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and plasma cell dyscrasia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypotension, which is likely due to sepsis. The patient is on vasopressin and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). His respiratory status has improved, and he is transitioning to pressure support (PS) mode on the ventilator. His ESRD is being managed with CVVH, and his other comorbidities, including CAD, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, and plasma cell dyscrasia, are also being addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is most likely due to sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure requires careful monitoring and management to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. ESRD: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing renal replacement therapy, such as CVVH, to manage fluid and electrolyte balance.
4. CAD: The patient's coronary artery disease increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for various resistant infections, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (afib), type II diabetes mellitus (DM2), and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presents with hypotension and is suspected to have sepsis due to possible infections in the lines, wounds, urine, pneumonia, and stool. The patient has received fluid boluses and is now off pressors. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued, and cultures have been obtained. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is being trended.

The patient also has chronic respiratory failure following tracheostomy, for which ventilator support is being provided. Nebulizers have been switched to metered-dose inhalers (MDIs). Cultures have been taken.

In terms of ESRD, the patient has decreased mental status (MS) and rising lactate levels, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been initiated. Antibiotics have been dosed for a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30.

Regarding CAD, the patient's troponins remain stable. Statin and beta-blocker therapy are being continued, and an echocardiogram will be considered after sepsis resolution.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old obese male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension (not in shock), impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), type I diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia.

Overnight, the patient's invasive ventilation was successfully weaned off, and they were transitioned to high flow nasal cannula. The patient's blood pressure improved with the initiation of stress dose steroids, and they were taken off vasopressors. The patient continues to be on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient has a tracheostomy in place and will attempt speech therapy today. Their cardiovascular system shows no chest pain, and their gastrointestinal system shows no abdominal pain. The patient has crackles at the lung bases, but their respiratory rate is within normal limits. Their extremities reveal absent right distal pulses and diminished left distal pulses with cyanosis. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to time and place, and has purposeful movement with decreased muscle tone.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. Other lab values, such as electrolytes and liver enzymes"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and plasma cell dyscrasia. He presents with hypotension, which is likely due to sepsis from various sources such as line infections, wounds, urine, and stool. The patient is already on sepsis doses of vasopressin and continues to be on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) with a fluid balance of +7 mL.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Renal Failure, End Stage: The patient's renal function is stable on CVVH.
2. Sepsis, Severe: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and cultures have been obtained. Efforts are being made to wean off vasopressin.
3. Hypotension: The etiology is most likely sepsis. Vasopressin is being continued, and attempts are being made to taper while maintaining mentation.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for resistant infections, ESRD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, DM2, and plasma cell dyscrasia.
5. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient was successfully weaned from invasive ventilation yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old overweight/obese male with a chief complaint of sepsis. He has a history of end-stage renal disease, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), type I diabetes mellitus, and critical limb ischemia due to peripheral vascular disease. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH), vasopressin, heparin sodium, and calcium gluconate (CRRT). His vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/39 to 81/25 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for limited tracheostomy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition indicates severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which can lead to septic shock and multiple organ failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and is on invasive ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration in lung function.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). There is a risk of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The source of infection could be from various locations, including lines, wounds, urine, and pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and cultures are pending.

2. Renal Failure (ESRD): The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH). Close monitoring of electrolytes and repletion while on CVVH is important.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is most likely secondary to sepsis. Vasopressin has been started and is being tapered off, while maintaining mentation at the present level. If the patient is unable to be weaned from pressors, the dialysis line may need to be replaced.

4. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient successfully weaned from invasive ventilation yesterday. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should continue, and cultures should be followed up.

5. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 109 and 208 mg/dL. Insulin sliding scale and Lantus continue to be administered.

6. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) with Critical Limb Ischemia: The patient's right distal pulse is absent, and the left distal pulse is diminished with cyanosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for various resistant infections, severe decubitus ulcers, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and plasma cell dyscrasia. He presented with hypotension and sepsis syndrome and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) with anemia following coxal debridement. The patient has multiple comorbidities including respiratory failure, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to his history of resistant infections and chronic tracheostomy.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may continue to be a concern, especially in the setting of sepsis and ongoing fluid losses.
3. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if not adequately managed, leading to further deterioration in lung function.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's severe decubitus ulcers may worsen without appropriate wound care and nutritional support.
5. ESRD: The patient's end-stage renal disease may require ongoing dialysis support, and there is a risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Cardiovascular Disease: The patient's history of CAD and atr"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for resistant infections, severe pressure ulcers, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (afib), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presented with hypotension and sepsis syndrome, which led to his current admission. He has been on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) since admission and underwent coxxygeal debridement.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics for suspected sepsis, anticoagulation therapy with heparin, and treatment for various other conditions such as diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and plasma cell dyscrasia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient already has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on CVVH. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with suspected infection sources including lines, wounds, urine, and pneumonia. Continued monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent septic shock.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be attributed to sepsis and/or heparin-induced hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate management are required.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for various resistant infections, severe coxxygeal decubiti, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (afib), diabetes mellitus type II (DM2), and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presented with hypotension and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with anemia following coxxygeal debridement.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:
1. Renal Failure, End Stage (ESRD): The patient has a history of ESRD and is currently on CVVH with anemia. Close monitoring of electrolytes and repletion while on CVVH is necessary.
2. Sepsis, Severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient's hypotension is most likely due to sepsis, which could be caused by infections in the line, wounds, urine, pneumonia, or stool. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and cultures are being monitored.
3. Hypotension: In addition to sepsis, the patient's low hematocrit on heparin with coxxygeal decubitus, which continues to leak serosanguinous fluid, may contribute to hypotension. The etiology of hypot"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple chronic conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and plasma cell dyscrasia. He presented with hypotension and was found to have sepsis syndrome. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and has a history of multiple admissions for various resistant infections. He underwent coxxygeal debridement and is now experiencing nausea, which is being managed with famotidine. The patient's hypotension has improved, and he is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics while awaiting culture results. The etiology of the hypotension is likely sepsis, possibly related to line, wounds, urine, or stool infections. The patient's chronic respiratory failure is slowly being weaned from ventilator support. His renal failure is being managed with CVVH, and he is also being treated for atrial fibrillation with heparin. The patient's type II diabetes is being managed with insulin. He also has a history of plasma cell dyscrasia and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. It is important to continue monitoring for signs of worsening infection and adjust treatment accordingly."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They were admitted with septic shock and have since improved, remaining off vasopressors for approximately 48 hours. The introduction of steroids for adrenal insufficiency component of shock seemed to improve their condition temporarily. However, there is worsening reddness at the site of an HD catheter, which may require removal. The patient also has acute on chronic respiratory failure, and a trach shield will be applied today. The patient is suspected to be relatively adrenal insufficient, and the taper of steroids will be initiated rapidly since blood pressure has improved. Abdominal pain and distention are present, and a KUB (kidney, ureter, bladder) examination will be conducted. The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and will attempt to remove fluid today now that their blood pressure is improved. ICU care plans include continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, nutrition support, glycemic control, and various lines and catheters for ongoing treatment. Prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP will also be implemented."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is septic shock. The patient has been receiving treatment for septic shock and has shown improvement in blood pressures, remaining off vasopressors for approximately 48 hours. This improvement was temporarily related to the introduction of steroids for an adrenal insufficiency component of shock.

The patient's current conditions include renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension (not in shock), impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), type 1 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia.

The plan of care includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, addressing acute on chronic respiratory failure by applying a trach shield, beginning the rapid taper of steroids for relative adrenal insufficiency, and evaluating abdominal pain/distention through a KUB (Kidney, Ureter, Bladder) exam.

Additionally, the patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and ongoing monitoring of lines such as a dialysis catheter, arterial line, and multi-lumen line. Prophylaxis measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are also mentioned.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old obese male with multiple medical conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), type I diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments including CVVH, dialysis, tube feeds, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's severe sepsis indicates a high risk of infection. Continuous monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment is necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant negative balance, indicating potential dehydration. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is required to maintain fluid equilibrium and prevent complications related to fluid overload or underload.
3. Wound healing: The patient's impaired skin integrity puts him at risk for delayed wound healing. Proper wound care and regular assessment are essential to prevent infection and promote healing.
4. Respiratory issues: The patient's acute respiratory failure requires close monitoring of respiratory status. Adjustments to ventilator settings and oxygen delivery may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension needs to be closely monitored, and appropriate hemodynamic support should be provided to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.
6. Diabetic complications: The patient's type I diabetes mell"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, chronic tracheostomy, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient has been admitted multiple times for pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Acinetobacter infections, as well as bacteremia caused by Serratia and coag-negative Staphylococcus. He presented with hypotension and likely sepsis.

The patient's current medications include meropenem, daptomycin, midodrine, hydrocortisone, vancomycin (PO), fentanyl, and renal gel. He is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to fluid overload and ESRD. The patient is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected Acinetobacter infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved with the current regimen of hydrocortisone, midodrine, and antibiotics. Monitoring and continuing the current treatment plan is advised.

2. Pain Control: The patient is currently receiving fentanyl, but it is not providing adequate pain relief. Titration of fentanyl dosage and starting a patch at 25 mcg/hr with additional prn doses are"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old individual with multiple medical problems. The patient was admitted with sepsis and found to have adrenal insufficiency. The patient has a history of chronic tracheostomy, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Septic shock: The patient was initially admitted with sepsis, and their blood pressures are stable on hydrocortisone and midodrine. The plan is to continue with meropenem and daptomycin for two weeks. However, there is a consideration to discontinue daptomycin sooner and continue with another antibiotic.

2. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient is tolerating the tracheostomy collar.

3. Relative adrenal insufficiency: The patient has been diagnosed with relative adrenal insufficiency, and the plan is to wean down on hydrocortisone.

4. Atrial fibrillation (Afib): The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, and it is recommended to continue heparin intravenously.

5. Access: There is erythema around the hemodialysis line, and observation is recommended for now. If necessary, the line may need to be re-sited, and input from interventional radiology (IR) will be sought"

   - CVVH with planned fluid removal- able to get~2.8 L down with good BP
   although clotted twice and therefore off since 1am - Renal aware and
   will assess for poss move toward HD
   - continues to complain of reflux; switched from famotidine to PPI
   yesterday - problem largely when his tube feeds are running at 30, does
   not complain when feeds are at 10
   - Lost A line overnight.
   - Pt stooling around flexi-seal and contaminating his sacral decub
   - Plastics debrided sacral decub this am, reported belief that wound
   would extend to bone if it could be properly debrided but currently
   holding back because of heparin gtt --- would be happy to be more
   aggressive with debridement at bedside if we call when heparin is off

   # Hypotension: Improved on hydrocort, midodrine, and current abx
   regimen although still w sporadic episodes of hypotension.
   - monitor
   - continue meropenem and daptomycin for 2 weeks with reassessment at
   that time, cont PO vanc
 will check CK with tomorrows labs
   - increase midodrine to 5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - maintain current hydrocort dosing (25mg IV q12)

   Patient hypotensive to low 70s during rounds. Responded well to 250cc

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and plasma cell dyscrasia.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas, Acinetobacter infections, and bacteremia caused by Serratia and coag-negative Staphylococcus. He also has severe pressure ulcers (decubitus) on his sacrum and legs, which have not improved despite treatment.

The patient is currently receiving CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) due to fluid overload and ESRD. His blood pressure is unstable, and he continues to experience episodes of hypotension. He is being treated with hydrocortisone, midodrine, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's pain is not adequately controlled with fentanyl, so the dosing will be increased, and a fentanyl patch will be started.

There is concern about the patient's chronic respiratory failure, as weaning from ventilator support is difficult due to hypercarbia. The patient has a history of Acinetobacter infection in his sputum, but it may be chronic colonization rather than the cause of his"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple chronic conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presented with hypotension and sacral decubitus ulcer.

Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure (ESRD): The patient has a history of chronic renal failure requiring dialysis.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been admitted multiple times for pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Acinetobacter infections, and bacteremia (Serretia, Coag neg Staph).
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing sporadic episodes of hypotension despite receiving hydrocortisone, midodrine, and antibiotics.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has severe coxzygeal decubitus ulcers and sacral decubitus ulcer that may extend to the bone.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation support.
6. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient has uncontrolled blood sugar levels.
7. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has critical limb ischemia due to peripheral vascular disease.
8. Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: The patient has a stable plasma cell dyscrasia.

The patient presented with hypotension and sacral decubitus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD, indicating chronic kidney failure. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) was initiated but limited due to hypotension. It is planned to ultrafiltrate and progress towards euvolemia. There is a possibility of converting to hemodialysis (HD) in the near future.

2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. He is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem and daptomycin. Cultures are being followed, and the patient will continue on this regimen for 2 weeks with reassessment.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved with hydrocortisone, midodrine, and the current antibiotic regimen. Monitoring and continuing these treatments are advised.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has severe coxigeal decubiti and sacral decubitus. The sacrum underwent debridement by plastics"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, type I diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient underwent continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with planned fluid removal, but it was unsuccessful due to clots twice and is currently off since 1 AM. The medical team is aware of this issue and plans to assess for a potential move towards hemodialysis (HD).

The patient complains of reflux and was switched from famotidine to a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) yesterday. The problem largely occurs when tube feeds are running at 30, but the patient does not complain when feeds are at 10.

The patient also lost an arterial line overnight and has been stooling around the flexi-seal, contaminating his sacral decub. The plastics were debrided from the sacral decub this morning, and the belief is that the wound may extend to the bone if properly debrided. However, the current heparin gtt is holding back aggressive debridement. It is mentioned that the medical team would be happy to be more aggressive with debridement at the bedside if they call when the heparin is off.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus (DM), type I peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia. The patient was admitted with sepsis, possibly originating from a sacral decubitus or hemodialysis line. He is currently hemodynamically stable and tolerating continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is now more stable with the use of hydrocortisone and midodrine. It is recommended to continue with meropenem and daptomycin for two weeks. Considering the possibility of early discontinuation of daptomycin, it would be advisable to discuss this with the Infectious Disease team.

2. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient tolerates a tracheostomy collar and requires chronic respiratory support. Further evaluation and management of respiratory failure should be considered.

3. Relative Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient may have relative adrenal insufficiency, and weaning down hydrocortisone should be done cautiously.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and it is important to continue with heparin IV to prevent thromboembolic events.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old individual with multiple medical conditions, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient was admitted with sepsis of unclear origin but possibly due to sacral decubitus or a hemodialysis line. Currently, the patient's hemodynamics are more stable, and they are tolerating continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's blood pressures are stable on hydrocortisone and midodrine, indicating improvement. However, septic shock can still be a potential complication if there is a recurrence of infection or inadequate treatment.

2. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient tolerates a tracheostomy collar, which suggests improvement in respiratory status. However, chronic respiratory failure can persist if the underlying cause is not fully addressed.

3. Relative Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient exhibits symptoms of relative adrenal insufficiency, and the hydrocortisone dose should be weaned down carefully to avoid adrenal crisis.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and heparin IV should be continued to prevent thromboembolic events.

5. Access Issues: There is erythema around the hemodialysis line, which requires observation. If necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient has been admitted multiple times for pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas, and acinetobacter infections, as well as bacteremia caused by serratia and coagulase-negative staphylococcus. He presented with hypotension and a sacral decubitus ulcer. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension that has improved with hydrocortisone, midodrine, and antibiotics, but still experiences sporadic episodes. He is receiving meropenem and daptomycin for 2 weeks, along with vancomycin orally. His pain management requires an increase in fentanyl dosing and the addition of a patch. The patient is also experiencing fluid overload and ESRD, necessitating aggressive ultrafiltration via CVVH. Renal failure management includes continuing with CVVH and renal gel. Chronic respiratory failure is being managed with tracheostomy collar and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's right below-knee amputation and sacral/leg ulcers have not shown significant improvement, and surgical debridement is planned. Cardiovascular disease is being managed with statins"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for pneumonia, severe coxalgia decubiti, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), and plasma cell dyscrasia. He presented with hypotension and a sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient has been treated with hydrocortisone, midodrine, and antibiotics for sepsis. He required vasopressin during debridement due to hypotension. The patient also has chronic respiratory failure, right below-knee amputation (R BKA) with leg ulcers, atrial fibrillation, type II DM, and plasma cell dyscrasia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH). Aggressive ultrafiltration is needed to manage fluid overload.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of multiple admissions for pneumonia and severe coxalgia decubiti. He is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still unstable despite treatment with hydrocortisone, midodrine, and antibiotics. Vasopressin has been initiated to manage hypotension during debridement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including renal failure, severe sepsis, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and plasma cell dyscrasia. He presented with hypotension and sacral decubitus. The patient's current medications include meropenem, daptomycin, midodrine, hydrocortisone, fentanyl, calcium gluconate, and heparin. He is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient also has chronic respiratory failure and is on a tracheostomy collar. He has right below-knee amputation with sacral and leg ulcers that have not shown appreciable improvement. The patient's recent labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine, and low albumin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing CVVH to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances. There is a risk of further deterioration of renal function if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction and potentially progress to septic shock. Close monitoring and aggressive antibiotic therapy are essential to control the infection.
3. Hypotension: Despite improvement"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with chronic renal failure, hypotension, and multiple medical complications. They are currently admitted to the ICU and require life support measures. The patient's vital signs are stable, but their hemodynamic status remains tenuous. They have been started back on vasopressors to manage their blood pressure, and levophed has been initiated. The patient's respiratory status is good, and they are well-oxygenated on the tracheal mask. However, there are concerns regarding impaired skin integrity and potential peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, which can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic symptoms.
2. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. This can result in systemic inflammation, organ failure, and a compromised immune response.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires continuous monitoring and intervention with vasopressors. If left uncontrolled, it may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ hypoxia.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient exhibits signs of impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and poor wound healing.
5. Respiratory Failure: Acute respiratory failure has been identified in the patient, but it is not ARDS. Close monitoring of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for aggressive debridement of wounds by plastics.

The patient was hypotensive in the morning when receiving large fentanyl boluses for the debridement, so Levophed was started. It was later decided to transition to Vasopressin to limit peripheral vasoconstriction. The patient's renal team recommended discontinuing CVVH and starting hemodialysis (HD) on Monday.

Other interventions include the possibility of a diverting colostomy to eliminate contamination and allow healing, as well as starting lactulose to allow stool to flow into flexiseal and limit leakage.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and sulfa (sulfonamides). The last doses of antibiotics administered were daptomycin and meropenem.

The patient denies chest pain or shortness of breath but reports back pain from the debridement. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/50-138/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on tracheal mask ventilation.

Physical examination reveals generalized resting comfort, clear lungs, no murmurs, obesity, bilateral lower extremity venous stasis changes, and diminished pulses. The patient has undergone toe and below-knee amputations.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated creatinine, and slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Coagulation studies indicate prolonged PT and PTT with normal INR.

Assessment and plan include renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's severe sepsis indicates a high risk for ongoing infections, which can lead to septic shock and multiple organ failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite vasopressor therapy can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ dysfunction.
3. Renal failure: The patient's pre-existing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may worsen due to the ongoing sepsis and hypotension, leading to further renal dysfunction.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure could progress to respiratory distress syndrome or ventilator-associated pneumonia if adequate respiratory support is not maintained.
5. Diabetic complications: The patient's type 1 diabetes mellitus"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including end-stage renal disease, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, type I diabetes mellitus, and critical limb ischemia due to peripheral vascular disease. The patient has undergone aggressive debridement by plastics and will likely require a diverting colostomy. He is currently on vasopressin and heparin infusions. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/50 to 138/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on tracheal mask ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease and is currently undergoing hemodialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. There is a risk of ongoing infection and potential progression to septic shock.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently unstable and requires vasopressor support. There is a risk of persistent hypotension and inadequate organ perfusion.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of infection and potential development of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple chronic conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, type II diabetes mellitus (DM2), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presented with hypotension likely due to sepsis and sacral decubitus ulcer. He has been admitted multiple times for pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas, acinetobacter infections, as well as bacteremia caused by serreta and coag-negative staphylococcus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has sporadic episodes of hypotension even off of CVVH, which have been exacerbated by attempts at pain control.
2. Sepsis: The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has decubitus ulcers on the sacrum and left leg, which are not improving despite aggressive debridement and dressings.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is tolerating a tracheostomy collar with supplemental oxygen.
5. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is planned for initiation of hemodialysis (HD) today.
6. Diabetes Mellitus (DM2): The patient's blood sugar was elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), type 1 diabetes mellitus, and critical limb ischemia due to peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's pre-existing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may worsen due to the current severe sepsis and hypotension. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration of dialysis may be necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis with organ dysfunction requires immediate attention. Prompt identification and treatment of the underlying infection is crucial to prevent further complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension needs to be addressed promptly. Adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support may be required to maintain blood pressure within normal ranges.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections. Regular turning and proper skin care should be implemented to prevent further complications.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure requires careful monitoring and support. Assisted ventilation and oxygen therapy may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's type 1 diabetes mellitus requires careful management"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple chronic health conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, type II diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presented with hypotension likely secondary to sepsis and sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient has been admitted multiple times for pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas, acinetobacter infections, as well as bacteremia caused by serratia and coag-negative staphylococcus. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which indicates chronic kidney failure. This can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic symptoms.
2. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection that can lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly.
3. Hypotension: The patient has episodes of hypotension, which can be exacerbated by pain control attempts. Hypotension can compromise blood flow to vital organs and may result in shock.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has decubitus ulcers on the sacrum and leg, which are pressure sores caused by prolonged"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, type II diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of plasma cell dyscrasia. He presented with hypotension and a sacral decubitus ulcer. He has been admitted multiple times for pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas, acinetobacter infections, as well as bacteremia caused by serreta and coag-negative staphylococcus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and requires hemodialysis. There is a goal of fluid management to avoid fluid overload.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. He is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and cultures are being followed.
3. Hypotension: The patient has sporadic episodes of hypotension even off of CVVH. Vasopressin was stopped yesterday, and midodrine is being given at 7.5 mg.
4. Pain Control: The patient is not receiving adequate pain relief despite uptitrating fentanyl dosing. A patch has been switched, and consideration is being given to increasing the patch to 37.5.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for pneumonia and bacteremia, severe decubitus ulcers, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (afib), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and plasma cell dyscrasia. He presented with hypotension likely due to sepsis and a sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient is currently receiving hemodialysis (HD) and being treated for multiple medical complications including renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type 1, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection (Cdiff).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is currently undergoing hemodialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of multiple admissions for pneumonia and bacteremia, suggesting a predisposition to infections. The current presentation of hypotension and organ dysfunction indicates a possible ongoing septic process.
3. Hypotension: The patient experiences sporadic episodes of hypotension even after discontinuing vasopressin. This may be exacerbated by pain control attempts.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is hypotension. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), type I diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/35-86/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 2 mmHg, indicating low blood volume. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,200 mL and output of 1,150 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,050 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels such as low potassium, high sodium, and low magnesium. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a tracheostomy mask with supplemental oxygen, and their ABG results indicate a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral vascular pulses, impaired skin integrity,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an obese individual with multiple medical conditions, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypertension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia.

The patient's recent events include coming off vasopressors overnight with no new complaints. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/35 mmHg to 114/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation but not in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), and glucose. The patient also has elevated levels of lactate, but normal levels of potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), BUN, and calcium (Ca++). The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.31.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient is off mechanical ventilation but still on a tracheal shield.
2. Sepsis: Improved and off vasopressors.
3. ESRD: Hemodialysis (HD) is planned for today.
4. Decubitus Ulceration: Continue to follow wound care and plastic recommendations.
5. History of Clostridium difficile (C. Diff): Continue flagyl/vanc for now.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: Will transition over to coumadin.
7. Line removal and picc placement.
8. Disposition: Plan to move toward return to nursing home/rehab.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the provided information, some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress if proper ventilation support is not maintained.
2. Sepsis: Despite the improvement, there is still a risk of recurrent or worsening sepsis due to underlying medical conditions and possible infection sources.
3. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requires ongoing management, including hemodialysis, to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's decubitus ulceration needs careful monitoring and management to prevent infection and worsening of the ulcer.
5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's type 1 diabetes mellitus requires strict glycemic control to avoid complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
6. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient's critical limb ischemia poses a risk of tissue necrosis or amputation if not properly managed.
7. Infections: The patient's history"

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for pneumonia and bacteremia, severe decubitus ulcers, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (afib), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and plasma cell dyscrasia. He presented with hypotension likely due to sepsis and sacral decubitus.

The patient has several medical complications including hypotension, sepsis, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, ESRD, CAD, afib, and plasma cell dyscrasia.

The plan includes continuing meropenem and daptomycin until 11/27/2150 with reassessment at that time, continuing PO vanc until other antibiotics are stopped, starting midodrine at 7.5mg, and prescribing prednisone 15mg daily.

The patient's pain control is inadequate despite uptitrating fentanyl dosing, and increasing the patch to 37.5 may be considered.

Fluid overload and ESRD management includes being around 9 liters positive yesterday, now off CVVH with planned initiation of HD today. The goal is to maintain fluid balance as tolerated, replete electrolytes as needed, and follow up with the renal team.

Chronic respiratory failure is being managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics, tracheostomy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for pneumonia and bacteremia, severe pressure ulcers, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (afib), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presented with hypotension likely due to sepsis and sacral decubitus. He has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience sporadic episodes of hypotension, which can exacerbate pain control attempts. Vasopressin has been stopped, and midodrine is being used to manage the hypotension.
2. Fluid Overload/ESRD: The patient had fluid overload but is now off continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) with planned initiation of hemodialysis (HD) today. Fluid management will be closely monitored.
3. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, and there is a possibility of Acinetobacter colonization in his sputum. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and tracheostomy mask usage will be maintained.
4. R BKA with Sacral and Leg ulcers: There has been no appreciable improvement in the patient's lower leg amputation and pressure ulcers. Aggressive debridement of the sac"

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for pneumonia and bacteremia, severe sacral decubitus ulcers, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presented with hypotension and a sacral decubitus ulcer, and is now on hemodialysis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient is doing well and is off pressors. It is recommended to continue meropenem and daptomycin until 11/27/2150 with reassessment at that time. Midodrine at 7.5 mg and prednisone 15 mg QD should be continued.
2. Pain Control: The patient is currently receiving fentanyl without adequate pain relief despite uptitrating the fentanyl dosing. Increasing the patch to 50 mcg may be considered.
3. Fluid Overload/ESRD: Hemodialysis was performed today. Repletion of electrolytes as needed and follow-up with the renal team should be done.
4. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient is tolerating the tracheostomy collar with supplemental O2. This morning's shortness of breath is likely due to fluid overload since no hemodialysis was performed yesterday. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and a follow-up chest X-ray should be obtained"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, type I diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: As the patient has ESRD, there is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function, leading to worsening renal failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis with organ dysfunction indicates an ongoing infection that could potentially lead to septic shock and multiple organ failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may indicate poor perfusion and could lead to organ hypoxia and ischemia.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and poor wound healing.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure could progress to chronic respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's type I diabetes mellitus requires careful management to prevent hyperglycemia and its associated complications.
7. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient's critical limb ischemia due to peripheral vascular disease poses a risk of limb loss and complications related to poor circulation.
8. Dialysis Catheter Complications: The use of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Renal failure, end stage (ESRD): The patient is diagnosed with end-stage renal disease, indicating a severe and permanent loss of kidney function.

2. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient is suffering from a severe systemic infection that has led to organ dysfunction.

3. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. However, it is mentioned as not being in shock.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has developed pressure ulcers or bedsores, indicating compromised skin integrity due to prolonged immobility or pressure.

5. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name]): The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may be attributed to underlying conditions other than acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

6. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type I: The patient has type 1 diabetes, which is a chronic condition characterized by insufficient insulin production by the pancreas.

7. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia: The patient has peripheral vascular disease affecting critical blood flow to the limbs.

The patient's current treatment plan includes managing sepsis, undergoing dialysis three times a week for ESRD, addressing decubitus ulceration, managing atrial fibrillation, providing nutrition through tube feeds, and ICU care."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. The chief complaint is back pain. The patient has a history of renal failure (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (not ARDS), type I diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 94 bpm (87-105), blood pressure of 99/58 mmHg (67/39-119/73), respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute (17-29), and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheal mask ventilation. The patient is on heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,198 mL and total output of 1,130 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,068 mL. The patient has received 960 mL of total fluid through the gastrointestinal tract and 831 mL through intravenous fluids. Blood product transfusion was given as well.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 250 K/uL, creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 112 to 250 mg/dL, sodium level of 105 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride level of 28.4%, bicarbonate level of 10.7 K/uL, and pH of 7.25. Other lab values are also provided, including results for kidney function tests, liver function tests, and cardiac markers.

The patient's assessment and plan include renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), type I diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia. The plan involves managing sepsis, dialysis for ESRD, treatment for decubitus ulceration, management of atrial fibrillation, nutrition through tube feeds, and ICU care."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including renal failure (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type 1, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia. The patient is currently on antibiotics, dialysis, and receiving tube feeds. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Complications may arise if the infection spreads further or if there is a resistant strain of bacteria.
2. Renal Failure (ESRD): As the patient already has end-stage renal disease, complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for ongoing dialysis should be monitored.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function should be closely monitored for any deterioration, which could lead to further respiratory failure or the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure needs to be managed to ensure adequate organ perfusion. Complications may arise if the blood pressure drops further, leading to shock.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The presence of a decubitus ulcer increases the risk of infection and potential complications such as cellulitis or osteomyelitis.
6. Diabetes Mellitus Type 1: The patient's blood glucose levels should be closely monitored to prevent hyperglycemia or hypogly"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple health issues including renal failure (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, type I diabetes mellitus, and critical limb ischemia due to peripheral vascular disease.

The patient has been undergoing dialysis with a total of 4.5L removed. The goal for antibiotic therapy is to continue dapto/[**Last Name (un)**] until [**11-26**] and vancomycin for 2 weeks following discontinuation. Fentanyl patch has been increased to 50mcg, and the patient's last documented episode of atrial fibrillation was on [**11-15**]. Speech and swallow consultation has been requested, and case management screening for placement is ongoing.

Allergies include penicillins and unknown sulfa (sulfonamides). The last dose of antibiotics was daptomycin on [**2150-11-17**] at 11:30 AM, vancomycin on [**2150-11-19**] at 12:00 AM, and meropenem on [**2150-11-19**] at 03:44 AM.

The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion at a rate of 2,000 units/hour. Other ICU medications include fentanyl initiated on [**2150-11-19"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including chronic tracheostomy, severe coxogygeal decubiti, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presented with hypotension likely secondary to sepsis and a sacral decubitus. He has a history of multiple admissions for pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas, and Acinetobacter infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive but is now stable off pressors. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's blood pressure and reassessing the need for pressors.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of severe infections including pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas, and Acinetobacter. It is crucial to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and follow up with cultures.
3. Fluid Overload/ESRD: The patient has ESRD and may require dialysis. Monitoring fluid balance and electrolytes is essential.
4. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient tolerates tracheostomy collar with supplemental oxygen. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory status is necessary.
5. Pain Control: The patient's pain is not adequately controlled despite titration of fentanyl. Increasing the patch dosage may be considered.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for pneumonia, bacteremia, severe bedsores, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presented with hypotension likely due to sepsis and sacral decubitus ulcer. He is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD, which indicates chronic kidney disease. This condition may lead to further deterioration of renal function and require ongoing dialysis.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been experiencing multiple infections, including pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas, Acinetobacter, serreta, and coag-negative Staphylococcus. This increases the risk of sepsis, especially with the presence of hypotension. Proper infection control measures and antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent further complications.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires close monitoring and management. Pressors may be needed initially, but it is important to assess and adjust treatment accordingly.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has developed pressure ulcers or bedsores, which can lead to serious infections and complications if not properly managed.

5. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and relies on"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), type I diabetes mellitus, and critical limb ischemia due to peripheral vascular disease (PVD).

The patient's medical history includes an unknown allergy to penicillins and sulfonamides, and he has received various antibiotics in the past, including daptomycin, vancomycin, and meropenem. He is currently on heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications such as fentanyl. The patient's current vital signs are within normal ranges, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/42 mmHg to 111/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on high flow neb and tracheostomy mask.

The patient has received hemodialysis for his ESRD and continues to require it. He also has a PICC line inserted for medication administration. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including chronic tracheostomy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presented with hypotension and signs of sepsis, and was admitted to the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced repeated episodes of hypotension, which required the administration of vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. This could indicate a potential complication related to septic shock.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has developed pressure ulcers, specifically sacral and leg ulcers, indicating impaired skin integrity. This can be a result of prolonged immobility and increased risk of tissue breakdown.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, as indicated by the need for long-term tracheostomy and supplemental oxygen. This may lead to further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD, requiring regular hemodialysis. This places him at risk for further renal complications, including fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of multiple infections, including pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas, acinetobacter, serreta, and coagulase-negative"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for pneumonia and bacteremia, severe coxal decubiti, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presented with hypotension and likely sepsis, as well as a sacral decubitus ulcer. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension has been addressed with norepinephrine infusion, but it is important to continue monitoring and adjusting the treatment as needed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's history of multiple admissions for pneumonia and bacteremia suggests a high risk for sepsis. It is crucial to monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and response to antibiotics.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has severe coxal decubiti and a sacral decubitus ulcer. Regular wound assessment and appropriate wound care are essential to prevent further complications.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and requires long-term tracheostomy and supplemental oxygen. Monitoring his oxygen saturation levels and performing frequent chest X-rays are important.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Close monitoring of renal function and"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypertension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), type I diabetes mellitus, and critical limb ischemia due to peripheral vascular disease. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for pain control and management of multiple comorbidities.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including Norepinephrine infusion for hypotension, Heparin sodium infusion, Fentanyl for pain control, and multiple antibiotics such as Daptomycin, Vancomycin, and Meropenem. The patient is also receiving nutritional support through Nutren 2.0 at a rate of 40 mL/hour.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/45 mmHg to 62/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient's current weight is 107.3 kg.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased potassium levels, elevated creatinine, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are within normal range or slightly elevated.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,371 mL including 478 mL of intravenous fluids, and a total output of 200 mL of urine and 820 mL of drain output. The patient's respiratory support includes high flow nasal cannula with SpO2 of 99%.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, further deterioration in respiratory status, development of pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, and potential hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to the patient's diabetes and ongoing glucose monitoring. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status is crucial to manage these potential complications effectively."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old overweight/obese individual with multiple medical conditions, including acute respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, renal failure, impaired skin integrity, diabetes mellitus type 1, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia. The patient presented with worsening hypotension requiring fluids and norepinephrine. They have been on multiple antibiotics since admission, including daptomycin, vancomycin, and meropenem. The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.4 C (97.5 F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/51 mmHg to 71/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 100% on high flow nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and elevated glucose levels. The patient's renal function is impaired, and there are signs of infection with positive cultures for blood and sputum. The patient's skin integrity is compromised, with an ulceration on the left foot. The patient's diabetes and peripheral vascular disease are significant comorbidities. The patient's respiratory support includes high flow nasal cannula, and they are receiving nutrition through a feeding tube.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing worsening hypotension that requires fluids and norepinephrine. This could indicate a potential septic shock or cardiovascular dysfunction.

2. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infection leading to sepsis. The patient's organ dysfunction may be a result of this infection.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has developed pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, indicating compromised skin integrity due to prolonged immobility or pressure on certain areas.

4. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support, indicating respiratory distress or failure. However, it is specified that this is not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

5. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient has chronic kidney disease, as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels and decreased hemoglobin and platelet counts.

6. Diabetes mellitus type 1: The patient has a history of diabetes, which may contribute to other complications such as infections or poor wound healing.

7. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia: The patient has compromised blood flow to the extremities, leading to potential tissue damage or gangrene.

It is important to address these complications promptly and manage them appropriately to improve the patient's condition and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for pneumonia and bacteremia, severe decubitus ulcers, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presented with hypotension likely due to sepsis and sacral decubitus. He was admitted to the ICU and received hemodialysis on day 17, restarting pressors overnight for hypotension.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient had a low blood pressure of 71 systolic and mean of 45. Norepinephrine was initiated at a low dose and continued. Midodrine was also started at 7.5 mg.
2. Pain Control: The patient is not receiving adequate pain relief despite uptitration of fentanyl dosing. Consider increasing the patch to 50 mcg.
3. Fluid Overload/ESRD: Hemodialysis (HD) is planned, but there are concerns about the patient becoming more hypotensive if fluid is removed. Discussion with the team is needed.
4. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient tolerates the tracheostomy collar with supplemental oxygen. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and follow-up chest X-ray is recommended.
5. R BKA with Sacral and Leg ulcers: Follow-up wound"

The patient's assessment and plan include pain control, renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension (not in shock), impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), diabetes mellitus type 1, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and atrial fibrillation/bradycardia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal failure, persistent or recurrent infections, development of further pressure ulcers, exacerbation of diabetes mellitus, complications related to atrial fibrillation, and potential cardiovascular events. 

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of worsening hypotension, infection, or changes in renal function. Additionally, the patient's pain management and wound care should be closely monitored and adjusted as necessary."

The patient presented with hypotension likely due to sepsis and a sacral decubitus ulcer. He has been on mechanical ventilation and received hemodialysis on day 17.

The patient's current conditions include hypotension, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic pain, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and chronic respiratory failure. The patient's pain is not adequately controlled despite uptitration of fentanyl dosing. He is also at risk for fluid overload and ESRD, as well as recurrent bacterial infections and chronic wounds.

The patient's ongoing treatment plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, following up with wound care recommendations, stopping the use of Dakins solution, and continuing with flexiseal/lactulose. The patient's atrial fibrillation/bradycardia is being managed with heparin drip and bridging to Coumadin. His type 2 diabetes is being managed with insulin sliding scale and Lantus.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple chronic conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and plasma cell dyscrasia. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various infections, including pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas, Acinetobacter, serretia, and coag-negative staphylococcus. The patient presented with hypotension and likely sepsis, along with severe sacral decubitus.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD, which means his kidneys are not functioning properly. This puts him at risk for further deterioration of renal function.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of multiple infections and is currently suspected to have sepsis. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be life-threatening.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is sensitive to fentanyl. This may result in ongoing hypotension, especially during hemodialysis (HD) sessions.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has chronic wounds and ulcers, which can be a source of infection and further complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is dependent on a tracheostomy"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of Pseudomonas pneumonia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and atrial fibrillation (afib). He was admitted with sepsis and decubitus ulcers, likely as the source of infection. The patient has been pressor-dependent but recently weaned off. He has multiple comorbidities including pain, renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, type 1 diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and relative adrenal insufficiency.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition indicates severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. If left untreated or poorly managed, it can lead to septic shock, multiple organ failure, and potentially death.

2. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD, and there is a risk of further deterioration of renal function. This could lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The presence of decubitus ulcers indicates impaired skin integrity. If not properly managed, these ulcers can worsen, leading to increased risk of infection, including cellulitis or osteomyelitis.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure. If not adequately"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and hypotension. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia. The patient's vital signs are stable but show low blood pressure. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments including antibiotics, pain management strategies, dialysis, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's history of severe sepsis indicates an increased risk for further infection and sepsis-related complications.
2. Renal Failure: As the patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD), there is a risk of worsening renal function and potential complications related to renal replacement therapy.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may lead to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and poor wound healing.
5. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may indicate ongoing hypoperfusion and potential organ damage.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's type 1 diabetes mellitus requires careful glycemic control to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for recurrent Pseudomonas pneumonia and infected decubitus ulcers. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, Clostridium difficile infection, sepsis, diabetes mellitus type I, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia. The patient's current condition includes severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction due to an infected decubitus ulcer. Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as meropenem, vancomycin, and daptomycin, is crucial until November 26th. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's perineal area showed further breakdown, which may require additional debridement. This could lead to an enlarging wound that may eventually necessitate a diverting colostomy to facilitate healing. Regular wound care and follow-up with plastics surgery are recommended.

3. Pain Control: The patient is experiencing pain and would benefit from a pain consult. Currently, he is on tylenol, lidocaine, and oxycodone for pain management. Adequate pain control is essential to improve the patient's comfort and overall"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old man with multiple comorbidities including chronic tracheostomy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and plasma cell dyscrasia. He presented with hypotension and likely sepsis, along with a sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient has been receiving aggressive care including pressors for hypotension, broad-spectrum antibiotics, renal replacement therapy, pain control, and wound management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypotension and multiple positive blood cultures suggests ongoing sepsis. It is crucial to continue monitoring for signs of infection and maintaining appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient tolerates a tracheostomy collar with supplemental oxygen, indicating chronic respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and ongoing ventilatory support may be required.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has multiple pressure ulcers, including a sacral decubitus ulcer that may require a colostomy for healing. Regular wound care and prevention strategies are essential to prevent further skin breakdown.
4. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and requires ongoing dialysis management. Monitoring electrolyte imbalances and fluid status is important to maintain adequate renal function.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient has type 2"

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including chronic tracheostomy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and plasma cell dyscrasia. He presented with hypotension likely secondary to sepsis and sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, severe pressure ulcers, multiple admissions for pneumonia and bacteremia, and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current medications include daptomycin, vancomycin, and meropenem for sepsis, prednisone for stress dosing, fentanyl for pain control, ibuprofen, oxycodone, and lactulose for colostomy care.

Assessment and plan:
1. Pain control: The patient has achieved moderate control of pain using various medications.
2. Renal failure, end stage: The patient has ESRD and requires ongoing management, including ultrafiltration sessions.
3. Sepsis, severe: The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, including daptomycin, vancomycin, and meropenem. Blood cultures are still negative.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved but remains in the low 80s at times. The renal team will monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has severe pressure ulcers that require ongoing wound care"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus type I, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He is currently admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, hypotension, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is receiving dialysis and has been on antibiotics. His blood pressure remains in the 80's to low 90's. He has a tracheostomy in place and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's chest exam reveals increased rhonchi, indicating possible worsening of his respiratory status. His hemoglobin (Hct) level is stable, with no evidence of bleeding. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated creatinine (Cr), and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of his pain, renal failure, sepsis, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's chest exam shows increased rhonchi, suggesting a possible worsening of his respiratory status. This could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially requiring intubation or other advanced respiratory support measures.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, indicating a systemic infection. If the infection spreads"

   # Hypotension:  much improved with lows in mid-90's off pressors,
   though runs in the 80's after HD.  Per Renal team, pt should not be
   bolused and as long as pt is mentating we can feel comfortable with low
   BPs.

   - judicial use of fentanyl given pressure sensitivity
   # Infection: Still no actually positive blood cultures.
   Currently on  meropenem/vancomycin/daptomycin until [**2150-11-26**] with

   -Added Tylenol per pain service
   # Fluid Overload/ESRD: Plan for ultrafiltration again today per renal.
   Vanco to be drawn and dosed at that time +/- Epo/
   -Discuss post-discharge HD plans with renal prior to discharge.
   # Chronic Respiratory Failure: Tolerating trach collar with
   supplemental O2 with adequate saturations. Previous culture with
   GPcocci in pairs, Gram negative rods, sparse ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII.
   -following QD CXR's while in house
   - continue to follow cultures
   - continue with trach mask
   #Decub Ulcers: Concern that without diverting colostomy, site will
   continue to become contaminated by feces, leading to cyclic infection,
   inability to heal, ultimately repeat sepsis. Per general surgery, pt IS
   technically a candidate for the surgery, and while the anesthesia is
   not without risk, he very well may persevere through the procedure.

   # GI Bleed: Likely gastric source given black, coffee-ground like
   texture. Per report, subsequent NG suction drained minimal further

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic tracheostomy, multiple admissions for pneumonia and bacteremia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The patient presented with severe sacral decubitus ulcers, hypotension, and evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been receiving aggressive hemodialysis and treatment for severe sepsis with multiple antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient demonstrated evidence of brief upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which was likely due to stress gastritis/ulcer. It is important to monitor for any further episodes of bleeding and continue with conservative management.
2. Hypotension: The patient has shown improvement in hypotension but still runs in the 80's after hemodialysis. Close monitoring and adjustment of fluid balance and medication dosages are necessary to maintain stable blood pressure levels.
3. Infection: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics for severe sepsis, and no positive blood cultures have been identified yet. Continued monitoring and reassessment of the patient's infection status are essential.
4. Pain Control: The patient has achieved moderate control of pain through the use of various analgesics, including fentanyl patches, IV fentanyl, ibuprofen, and oxycodone. Regular assessment of pain levels and adjustment of medication dosages may be needed.
5. Fluid Overload/ESRD: The patient requires ultrafiltration again today due to fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid balance and adjustment of hemodialysis parameters are necessary to manage ESRD effectively.
6. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient tolerates the tracheostomy collar with supplemental oxygen, maintaining adequate saturations. Continued monitoring of respiratory function and culture results is necessary to prevent any further complications.
7. Decub Ulcers: The patient has severe sacral decubitus ulcers, which may lead to cyclic infection and repeat sepsis if not managed appropriately. A diverting colostomy may be considered to prevent fecal contamination of the wound site.
8. Clostridium difficile (C. diff): The patient has a history of C. diff infection, and appropriate treatment with vancomycin is ongoing until off other antibiotics.
9. Atrial Fibrillation/Bradycardia: The patient has atrial fibrillation and bradycardia, and anticoagulation therapy should be continued with heparin and coumadin.
10. Type II Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus, and management includes monitoring blood glucose levels and adjusting insulin therapy as necessary.

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable, but close monitoring and management of these potential complications are crucial to prevent further deterioration."

","The patient is a 63-year-old overweight/obese male with multiple comorbidities, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type I, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. He presents to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, acute pain, and hypotension. The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 80/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on tracheal mask ventilation. He is also on fentanyl PCA and Tylenol for pain management.

The patient has a history of ESRD requiring dialysis, diabetes mellitus type I, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. He is currently on multiple medications including pantoprazole, fentanyl, and meropenem.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating an inflammatory response. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and electrolyte levels are abnormal, suggesting impaired renal function. His liver function tests are within normal limits. His blood glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is well-nourished, anxious, and obese. His cardiovascular examination is unremarkable"

   75 y.o man with chronic trach, s/p mult admissions for PNAs
   (Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Acinetobacter),  and bacteremia
   (Serretia, Coag neg Staph) presented with severe coxxygeal decubiti,
   ESRD, CAD, afib, DM2, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The  patient
   originally demonstrated hypotension likely [**1-17**] sepsis [**1-17**] sacral decub.
   Now appears at baseline systolic blood pressure in the context of
   aggressive HD (systolic 80
s) without further evidence of septic
   physiology.  However, overnight, demonstrated evidence of brief upper
   GI bleeding with black coffee ground emesis; no further episodes this
   AM.
   # GI Bleed: Likely gastric source given black, coffee-ground like
   texture. Per report, subsequent NG suction drained minimal further
   fluid, therefore was clamped this AM. Patient Hemodynamically stable.
   Etiology likely stress gastritis/ulcer in context of extended
   hospitalization.

   -Discuss post-discharge HD plans with renal prior to discharge.
   # Chronic Respiratory Failure: Tolerating trach collar with
   supplemental O2 with adequate saturations. Previous culture with
   GPcocci in pairs, Gram negative rods, sparse ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII.
   -following QD CXR's while in house
   - continue to follow cultures
   - continue with trach mask
   #Decub Ulcers: Concern that without diverting colostomy, site will
   continue to become contaminated by feces, leading to cyclic infection,
   inability to heal, ultimately repeat sepsis. Per general surgery, pt IS
   technically a candidate for the surgery, and while the anesthesia is
   not without risk, he very well may persevere through the
   procedure. Surgery prepared to do procedure next week.
   -Request [**Doctor First Name 458**] to discuss specifics of procedure with patient. Currently

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old man with multiple chronic conditions including tracheostomy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and plasma cell dyscrasia. He presented with severe sacral decubitus ulcers, hypotension, and evidence of sepsis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, and Acinetobacter bacteremia. He is currently receiving aggressive hemodialysis (HD) and has shown improvement in his blood pressure but remains hypotensive at times. The patient recently experienced a brief upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and has been placed on nothing by mouth (NPO) status. He is on multiple antibiotics for suspected Acinetobacter infection, including meropenem, vancomycin, and daptomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient had a brief upper GI bleed likely due to stress gastritis or ulcer, which can be a complication of prolonged hospitalization and use of corticosteroids. It is important to monitor for any signs of re-bleeding or continued blood loss.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to sepsis, ESRD, or the use of nephrotoxic medications. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished, obese male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, and end-stage renal disease. He is currently on dialysis and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing hypotension at baseline, with blood pressure readings ranging from 71/33 mmHg to 77/49 mmHg. He also has a history of type I diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia.

The patient presented with evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleed during the night, resulting in a minimal hematocrit drop. No significant changes in blood pressure were observed. It is likely due to gastritis, and anticoagulation has been held. The GI service will evaluate the situation.

The patient is also experiencing ongoing acidosis from renal failure. Surgery will speak with the patient and family about the possibility of a colostomy. 

ICU care includes glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, dialysis catheter placement, PICC line placement, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and he remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's consistently low blood pressure may indicate poor organ perfusion and potential organ dysfunction. Immediate interventions such as fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy may be required"

   75 y.o man with chronic trach, s/p mult admissions for PNAs
   (Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Acinetobacter),  and bacteremia
   (Serretia, Coag neg Staph) presented with severe coxxygeal decubiti,
   ESRD, CAD, afib, DM2, and plasma cell dyscrasia. The  patient
   originally demonstrated hypotension likely [**1-17**] sepsis [**1-17**] sacral decub.
   Now appears at baseline systolic blood pressure in the context of
   aggressive HD (systolic 80
s) without further evidence of septic
   physiology.  No further episodes of coffee ground emesis.
   # GI Bleed: Only episode was on [**11-24**].08. Likely gastric source given
   black, coffee-ground like texture. Patient Hemodynamically stable.
   Etiology likely stress gastritis/ulcer in context of extended
   hospitalization.
   -f/u GI recs
   -Hold Ibuprofen
   -Will plan to hold Coumadin, restart ASA on Friday
   -Adequate access via PICC, peripherals
   -maintain type and cross
   -[**Hospital1 **] HCT
   # Hypotension:  much improved with lows in mid-90's off pressors,
   though runs in the 80's after HD.  Per Renal team, pt should not be
   bolused and as long as pt is mentating we can feel comfortable with low
   BPs.
   -Wean steroids to 5mg down from 10.
   - D/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 430**]/dapto/vanco for aceanetabaceter today.
   # Pain Control: Achieving satisfactory control on new regimen:
   -Appreciate pain recs-- Increased Fent Patch from 75mcg/hr to 100 TP
   q72 hours
   -Fent 50-100mg IV q 8 hours
   -Ibuprofen Suspension 400mg PO q6 hours
HOLD given bleed
   -Oxycodone 5-10mg PO q4 hours PRN
   -Added Tylenol per pain service
   # Fluid Overload/ESRD: Plan for ultrafiltration again today per renal.
   Vanco to be drawn and dosed at that time +/- Epo/
   -Discuss post-discharge HD plans with renal prior to discharge.
   # Chronic Respiratory Failure: Tolerating trach collar with
   supplemental O2 with adequate saturations. Previous culture with
   GPcocci in pairs, Gram negative rods, sparse ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII.
   -following QOD CXR's while in house
   - continue to follow cultures
   - continue with trach mask
   #Decub Ulcers: Concern that without diverting colostomy, site will
   continue to become contaminated by feces, leading to cyclic infection,
   inability to heal, ultimately repeat sepsis. Per general surgery, pt IS
   technically a candidate for the surgery, and while the anesthesia is
   not without risk, he very well may persevere through the
   procedure. Surgery prepared to do procedure next week.
   -Patient waiting to discuss surgery with family.
    -In the meantime, wet to dry dressing change for sacral decub ulcer
   [**Hospital1 **] with xeroform
   -has f/u for outpt scheduled with plastics;
   for left foot heel ulcer, con't silividine [**Hospital1 **] (then to stop silvidene

   - f/u Wound recs
   - continue flexiseal/lactulose.
    # Cdiff:  history of c diff. Inactive issue.  On PO vanco until off
   other antibiotics.
    # Atrial Fibrillation/bradycardia:
   -  Continue Heparin SQ. Hold Coumadin. Restart ASA once GI bleed
   absolutely stable.
   -Will communicate with [**Doctor First Name 458**] re: time to hold if [**Doctor First Name 458**] proceeds.
    # Type II DM:

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus type I, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and chronic pain. The patient was admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, acute pain, impaired skin integrity, and hypotension. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 94/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheal mask ventilation. The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, fentanyl, and vancomycin. The patient has been receiving dialysis since November 4th and has multiple lines including a dialysis catheter and PICC line. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, potassium, and lactate levels. The patient's pain management, renal function, sepsis, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease will need to be closely monitored and managed.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to diabetes and end-stage renal disease makes him more susceptible to infections. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in vital signs, is essential.
