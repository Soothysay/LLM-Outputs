   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and is in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and is
   currently on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after lengthy discussion
   and has refused VT ablation in past, but seems agreeable in the past.
   - Start lidocaine IV at 1 mg/min
   - Continue PO amiodarone for now
   - Keep ICD on until family discussion
   - Discuss with pt ablation (which he is agreeing right now) and code
   status would need to be reveresed for procedure
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic
   systolic heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home
   medications: statin, ASA, and metoprolol.  ACEi and Lasix will be held
   given hypotension.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than
   his VT and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.
   ACEI held as above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac
   injury after shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol and oxycodone.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Continued on Ativan home-dose.
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked.

   Code status: Full code for ablation procedure, DNR / DNI following
   procedure
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia despite being on oral amiodarone.

The patient presented to the hospital due to an ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) firing and chest pain. He was given a bolus of intravenous amiodarone and is currently on a continuous infusion. The patient has expressed agreement for ventricular tachycardia ablation and wishes to be DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate) after the procedure. The plan is to start lidocaine intravenously at a rate of 1 mg/min, continue oral amiodarone, keep the ICD on until family discussion, and discuss the possibility of reversing code status for the procedure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 52 beats per minute, blood pressure of 105/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula, and a heart rhythm of ventricular-paced. His physical examination is generally unremarkable except for a jugular venous pulse"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and is in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and is
   currently on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a
   successful VT ablation yesterday for which his code status was changed
   to full code.
   - Stop lidocaine IV this AM as it is causing nausea.
   - Continue PO amiodarone for now
   - Keep ICD on
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -Consider restarting home ACEi and Lasix now that he is in sinus
   rhythm.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol and oxycodone.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Continued on Ativan home-dose.
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He also has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recently discharged from the cardiac care unit with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator firing. The patient presented with recurrent ventricular tachycardia on oral amiodarone and underwent successful ventricular tachycardia ablation yesterday. His code status was temporarily changed to full code, but it has since been changed back to DNR/DNI.

The patient is currently feeling well and in a paced sinus rhythm since the ablation procedure. His post-catheterization check was unremarkable. The patient has allergies to morphine, mirtazapine, and ambien, causing nausea and nightmares. He is receiving infusions of heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/57 mmHg to 122/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. 

His review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the recent events mentioned above. The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction, presented to the ICU with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) despite being on oral amiodarone. He had undergone a successful VT ablation procedure, after which his code status was changed to full code. However, his code status was reversed to DNR/DNI. The patient experienced multiple episodes of VT, for which he received several shocks and was eventually repaced into sinus rhythm. He became agitated and lost IV access, leading to the discontinuation of lidocaine gtt. The patient is currently on PO amiodarone and will continue with this medication. His ICD will be kept on.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has experienced recurrent episodes of VT, which can be life-threatening if not promptly managed. Continuous monitoring and appropriate intervention are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Cardiac Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. There are no signs of CHF at present, but close monitoring of the patient's fluid balance and cardiac function is essential to prevent exacerbation of heart failure.
3. Infection: Given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU, there is an increased risk of developing healthcare-associated infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and is in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and is
   currently on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a
   successful VT ablation for which his code status was changed to full
   code.  Code status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he
   developed VT overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and
   transferred back to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115
   from 140.  Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus
   rhythm since 2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt started but patient
   became agitated and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in
   the past for patient.
   -Currently on PO amiodarone- will continue PO and not the drip.
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time
   - Keep ICD on
   - receiving repeated ICD shocks, and transitioning to comfort care
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol and oxycodone.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Continued on Ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He also has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recently underwent a ventricular tachycardia ablation procedure. The patient presented to the ICU with recurrent ventricular tachycardia and was treated with IV amiodarone and lidocaine. He is currently on oral amiodarone and has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is in sinus rhythm. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia and continues to experience episodes, despite being on oral amiodarone. This increases the risk of further complications related to ventricular arrhythmias, such as hemodynamic instability or sudden cardiac arrest.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. While his current condition is stable, there is a risk of worsening heart failure, which can lead to pulmonary edema, fluid overload, and hypotension.
3. Infection: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures increase the risk of developing healthcare-associated infections, such as ventil"

He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recently underwent a ventricular tachycardia ablation procedure. 

The patient presented to the hospital with ICD firing and chest pain, but had stable vital signs. He was given IV amiodarone and is currently on a continuous infusion. However, the patient developed ventricular tachycardia overnight and received multiple shocks. He was paced back into sinus rhythm and transferred back to the critical care unit, where he again experienced ventricular tachycardia. The ventricular tachycardia detect setting was adjusted from 140 to 115, and the patient has been in sinus rhythm since 2 AM.

The patient has been receiving repeated ICD shocks and is transitioning to comfort care. His medications include a statin, aspirin, metoprolol, and amiodarone orally. Lidocaine is not being restarted due to past ineffectiveness. The ICD will be kept on.

The patient's pump function shows no signs of congestive heart failure at this time. He has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. His home medications of a statin, aspirin, and metoprolol will be continued."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and is in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and is
   currently on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a
   successful VT ablation for which his code status was changed to full
   code.  Code status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he
   developed VT overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and
   transferred back to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115
   from 140.  Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus
   rhythm since 2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt started but patient
   became agitated and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in
   the past for patient.
   -Currently on PO amiodarone- will continue PO and not the drip.
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time
   - Keep ICD on
   - receiving repeated ICD shocks, and transitioning to comfort care
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol and oxycodone.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Continued on Ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked.  Daughter
   will visit today- will discuss goals of care again.
   .
   #. Prophy
 DVT: heparin SQ; No need for PPI; Colace/Senna.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, and recently discharged from the CCU with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) that fired. 

The patient presented with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) on oral amiodarone, which led to his return to the ICU. He underwent a successful ventricular tachycardia ablation procedure. His initial code status was full code, but it was reversed after the procedure. 

The patient's current medical conditions include chronic systolic heart failure, known VTach, and chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing. He is currently on comfort care with a DNR/DNI status and will not be externally shocked. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, and his lab results indicate mild cardiac injury due to the ICD shock. He is receiving repeated ICD shocks and transitioning to comfort care. 

His current medications include a statin, aspirin (ASA), metoprolol, and he is also receiving pain management with Tylenol and oxycodone. 

His other medical issues include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He also has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recently underwent ventricular tachycardia ablation. The patient presented with ventricular tachycardia and chest pain, and was given intravenous amiodarone. His code status was changed to full code after the VT ablation, but it has since been changed back to DNR/DNI. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Physical Mobility: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may contribute to impaired physical mobility.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's chronic heart failure and immobility can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or impaired skin integrity.
3. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Chronic: The patient has a known history of chronic systolic heart failure, which can lead to fluid accumulation and symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and edema.
4. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has experienced recurrent episodes of VT, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
5. Code Status: The patient's code status has been changed multiple times, indicating a complex decision-making process regarding end-of-life care.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia. The patient was recently discharged from the CCU with an ICD firing and returned with recurrent VT on oral amiodarone. He underwent a successful VT ablation procedure yesterday, after which his code status was changed to DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a history of recurrent VT, which can be life-threatening and may require further interventions such as antiarrhythmic medications or additional ablation procedures.
2. Heart failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with a low ejection fraction. This condition can lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema, necessitating careful monitoring and management of fluid balance and medications.
3. Cardiac catheterization and potential complications: The patient has undergone VT ablation and may require future cardiac catheterization procedures. These procedures carry risks such as bleeding, infection, or damage to the heart or surrounding structures.
4. Infection: As an immobile patient in the ICU, the patient is at increased risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt started but patient became agitated
   and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past for
   patient.
   -Currently on PO amiodarone- will continue PO and not the drip.
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time. Might
   also be contributing to his altered mental status.
   - Keep ICD on
   - receiving repeated ICD shocks, and transitioning to comfort care.
   Receiving morphine PRN for pain
   - extensive conversation with daughter (HCP) took place, where decision
   was made to keep ICD on, and instruction was provided that the three
   modalities of therapy for this irregular rhythm are
   medication/ICD/ablation (all of which he has had and extensively
   pursued).
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol and oxycodone.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Continued on Ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Ativan was discontinued
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg  with good response
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked. Leave ICD
   on. Daughter will visit today- will discuss goals of care again.
   .
   #. Prophy
 DVT: heparin SQ; No need for PPI; Colace/Senna.

","The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recent discharge from the critical care unit with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing. The patient presented with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) on oral amiodarone and underwent successful ventricular tachycardia ablation. The patient's code status was changed to do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI) after the procedure. The patient has been experiencing shocks from the ICD and has been in sinus rhythm since 2 AM. Lidocaine and amiodarone infusions were started, but the patient became agitated and lost IV access. Lidocaine has not worked well in the past for the patient. The patient is currently on oral amiodarone and will continue with that medication. The decision was made to keep the ICD on, considering the patient's known irregular rhythm and previous extensive pursuit of therapy options. The patient is receiving morphine as needed for pain.

   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and is in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and is
   currently on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a
   successful VT ablation for which his code status was changed to full
   code.  Code status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he
   developed VT overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and
   transferred back to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115
   from 140.  Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus
   rhythm since 2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt started but patient
   became agitated and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in
   the past for patient.
   -Currently on PO amiodarone- will continue PO and not the drip.
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time
   - Keep ICD on
   - receiving repeated ICD shocks, and transitioning to comfort care
   - extensive conversation with daughter (HCP) took place, where decision
   was made to keep ICD on, and instruction was provided that the three
   modalities of therapy for this irregular rhythm are
   medication/ICD/ablation (all of which he has had and extensively
   pursued).
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol and oxycodone.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Continued on Ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recent discharge from the critical care unit with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing. He returns with recurrent ventricular tachycardia on oral amiodarone, which is now being managed with intravenous amiodarone. The patient is currently in comfort care mode and has decided to keep the ICD on despite repeated shocks.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of acute mountain sickness (AMS) and moderate distress. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 100/60 to 130/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. He is paced rhythm with regular rate and normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. His lungs are clear without wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi, and his abdomen is soft without tenderness or masses. His extremities have good pulses, and his skin is intact without any lesions.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 12.5 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, slightly decreased potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L, and elevated blood glucose level of 123 mg/dL. Other labs, including PT/PTT/INR, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are within normal limits.

The patient's current medications include statin, aspirin, metoprolol, IV amiodarone, and oral amiodarone. His code status is do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI), and he is not to be externally shocked. The patient's daughter will visit today, and the goals of care will be discussed again.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventricular tachycardia recurrence despite being on oral and IV amiodarone.
2. Heart failure exacerbation due to his chronic systolic heart failure.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization.
4. Stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to endotracheal intubation.
6. Hypotension and acute kidney injury due to hypoperfusion.

These are just potential complications, and further evaluation and monitoring are required to assess the patient's condition and determine the appropriate interventions."

 VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, SUSTAINED
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt started but patient became agitated
   and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past for
   patient.
   - will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] re: utility of repeat ablation
   -Currently on PO amiodarone- will continue PO and not the drip.
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time. Might
   also be contributing to his altered mental status.
   - Keep ICD on
   - receiving repeated ICD shocks, and transitioning to comfort care.
   Receiving morphine PRN for pain
   - extensive conversation with daughter (HCP) took place, where decision
   was made to keep ICD on, and instruction was provided that the three
   modalities of therapy for this irregular rhythm are
   medication/ICD/ablation (all of which he has had and extensively
   pursued).
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  Will d/c opiates today
   secondary to altered mental status.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg  with good response.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked. Leave ICD
   on. Daughter will visit today- will discuss goals of care again.
   .
   #. Prophy
 DVT: heparin SQ; No need for PPI; Colace/Senna.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and was recently discharged from the critical care unit after experiencing an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shock. The patient presented with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) despite being on oral amiodarone. He underwent successful ventricular tachycardia ablation, and his code status was changed to do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI). The patient has been in sinus rhythm since 2 AM but continues to receive multiple ICD shocks. His current medications include statin, aspirin, metoprolol, and he is also on comfort care measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of VT and has experienced recurrent episodes even after VT ablation and being on oral amiodarone.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with a low ejection fraction of 20%. This increases the risk of worsening heart failure symptoms and fluid overload.
3. Arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and I"

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
 VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, SUSTAINED
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt started but patient became agitated
   and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past for
   patient.
   - will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] re: utility of repeat ablation
   -Currently on PO amiodarone- will continue PO and not the drip.
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time. Might
   also be contributing to his altered mental status.
   - Keep ICD on
   - receiving repeated ICD shocks, and transitioning to comfort care.
   Receiving morphine PRN for pain
   - extensive conversation with daughter (HCP) took place, where decision
   was made to keep ICD on, and instruction was provided that the three
   modalities of therapy for this irregular rhythm are
   medication/ICD/ablation (all of which he has had and extensively
   pursued).
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  Will d/c opiates today
   secondary to altered mental status.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg  with good response.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked. Leave ICD
   on. Daughter will visit today- will discuss goals of care again.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recently underwent ventricular tachycardia ablation. The patient presented with recurrent ventricular tachycardia, for which he received multiple shocks and was transferred back to the cardiac care unit (CCU). He is currently on comfort care measures, including morphine for pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired physical mobility due to chronic systolic heart failure and advanced age.
2. Delirium/confusion, possibly caused by medication side effects or altered mental status.
3. Impaired skin integrity due to immobility and potential pressure ulcers.
4. Ventricular tachycardia recurrences, despite previous ablation and antiarrhythmic medication.
5. Heart failure exacerbation, considering the patient's known chronic systolic dysfunction.
6. Infection risks due to prolonged hospitalization and use of invasive lines.
7. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, due to decreased respiratory reserve.
8. Poor glycemic control, which can be exacerbated by stress and certain medications.
9. Possible medication interactions and side effects, particularly with multiple drugs being administered.
10. Psychological distress for both the patient and his family, given the advanced nature of his"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Underwent VT ablation yesterday.  EP fellow consented patient
   daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] was full code for the procedure only.  Elective
   intubation at 16:20.
   -Pt potassium at 2000hrs was 2.5, 3.2 when repeated. Repleted with
   40meq IV potassium and 2gm IV Mag.
   -Pt's ICD battery needs replacement after multiple shocks
   -Pt returned s/p ablation at 2100hrs was in sinus, but then reconverted
   to Vtach in the 120s-130s for several minutes upon returning to the
   CCU. He was shocked several times via ICD at 2100hrs and reverted to
   normal sinus paced rhythm.  V tach thought to be secondary to the
   dopamine used during procedure which he has yet to be weaned off at
   this point.  He is RV pacing only, pacer leads were checked and LV lead
   is not capturing.  Femoral sheath removed at 23:30, post-cath check
   this morning.  Left one femoral venous access intact since patient is
   getting propofol through peripheral and dopamine through femoral.  Will
   need to remove femoral access once dopamine is completely weaned off
   this AM, unable to wean dopamine overnight likely secondary to BP
   effect of propofol which is needed to keep the patient sedated on the
   vent as he is still intubated.  Will need to wean patient to extubate
   this AM. Patient's DNR/DNI status confirmed with daughter
   post-procedure.

   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt started but patient became agitated
   and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past for
   patient.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] repeated ablation on [**2147-9-25**]. Currently pt is paced and
   in sinus However, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] may want to take pt for LV lead
   replacement since the lead is not capturing. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] expressed
   pts VT might be originating from that site.
   - Currently on PO amiodarone- will continue PO and not the drip.
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time. Might
   also be contributing to his altered mental status.
   - Keep ICD on
   - receiving repeated ICD shocks, and transitioning to comfort care.
   Due to  his multiple shocks ICD may need battery replacement.  Discuss
   with family how they would like to proceed.
   - extensive conversation with daughter (HCP) took place, where decision
   was made to keep ICD on, and instruction was provided that the three
   modalities of therapy for this irregular rhythm are
   medication/ICD/ablation (all of which he has had and extensively
   pursued).
   Post-cath check at 0650hrs
   -Femoral sheath removed at 23:30, Left one femoral venous access intact
   since patient is getting propofol through peripheral and dopamine
   through femoral.  Will need to remove femoral access once dopamine is
   completely weaned off this AM
   -Rt lower extremity to bruits, indurations, or active bleeding over
   site. No mottling of the skin or toes. DP/PT 2+
   Respiratory --  Pt was intubated for the ablation.
   -Unable to extubate as originally planned at 0400hrs since pt was
   unable to be weened off the dopamine.  Most likely secondary to the
   hypotensive effect of propofol.
   -Respiratory chanced his ventilator setting to Pressure support with
   plans to extubate later this morning.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  Will d/c opiates today
   secondary to altered mental status.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg with good response two nights ago
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.  Currently
   on propofol while intubated.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   FEN:
   -Pt was hypokalemic yesterday to 2.2 was repleated with 40mEq IV and
   2gm of Mg.  This morning
s potassium was 3.7 repleated 20mEq this AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt started but patient became agitated
   and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past for
   patient.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] repeated ablation on [**2147-9-25**]. Currently pt is paced and
   in sinus, however, it is felt that the RV lead may be triggering the
   Vtach and his pacer will be shut off today and his rhythm will be
   monitored.
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time. Might
   also be contributing to his altered mental status.
   - Keep ICD on
   - receiving repeated ICD shocks, and transitioning to comfort care.
   Due to  his multiple shocks ICD may need battery replacement.  Discuss
   with family how they would like to proceed.
   - extensive conversation with daughter (HCP) took place, where decision
   was made to keep ICD on, and instruction was provided that the three
   modalities of therapy for this irregular rhythm are
   medication/ICD/ablation (all of which he has had and extensively
   pursued).
   - D/C amiodarone and start verapamil today.
   - Add diltiazem IV if goes into Vtach
   - No plans to change battery at this time because it is still working
   and it would be an unnecessary stress at this time.
   Post-cath check at 0650hrs
   -Femoral sheath removed at 23:30, Left one femoral venous access intact
   since patient is getting propofol through peripheral and dopamine
   through femoral.  Will need to remove femoral access once dopamine is
   completely weaned off this AM
   -Rt lower extremity to bruits, indurations, or active bleeding over
   site. No mottling of the skin or toes. DP/PT 2+
   Respiratory --  Pt was intubated for the ablation.
   -Unable to extubate as originally planned at 0400hrs since pt was
   unable to be weaned off the dopamine.  Most likely secondary to the
   hypotensive effect of propofol.
   -Respiratory changed his ventilator setting to Pressure support with
   plans to extubate later this morning.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  Will d/c opiates today
   secondary to altered mental status.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg with good response two nights ago
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.  Currently
   on propofol while intubated.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   FEN:
   -Pt was hypokalemic yesterday to 2.2 was repleated with 40mEq IV and
   2gm of Mg.  This morning
s potassium was 3.7 repleated 20mEq this AM.
   -Follow lytes
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked. Leave ICD
   on. Daughter will visit today- will discuss goals of care again.

   #. Prophy
 DVT: heparin SQ; No need for PPI; Colace/Senna.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia. The patient was admitted to the ICU after experiencing recurrent VT on oral amiodarone and underwent a successful ventricular tachycardia ablation procedure. He was initially full code but changed to DNR/DNI after the procedure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/53 mmHg to 84/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support. The patient is currently intubated and sedated on propofol.

The patient's rhythm has been unstable, with episodes of ventricular tachycardia requiring multiple ICD shocks. He was paced into sinus rhythm but experienced another episode of VT overnight and received additional shocks. The patient's pacer leads were checked, and the left ventricular lead is not capturing. The femoral sheath was removed at 23:30, and the patient is receiving dopamine through a femoral line"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Underwent VT ablation yesterday.  EP fellow consented patient
   daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] was full code for the procedure only.  Elective
   intubation at 16:20.
   -Pt potassium at 2000hrs was 2.5, 3.2 when repeated. Repleted with
   40meq IV potassium and 2gm IV Mag.
   -Pt's ICD battery needs replacement after multiple shocks
   -Pt returned s/p ablation at 2100hrs was in sinus, but then reconverted
   to Vtach in the 120s-130s for several minutes upon returning to the
   CCU. He was shocked several times via ICD at 2100hrs and reverted to
   normal sinus paced rhythm.  V tach thought to be secondary to the
   dopamine used during procedure which he has yet to be weaned off at
   this point.  He is RV pacing only, pacer leads were checked and LV lead
   is not capturing.  Femoral sheath removed at 23:30, post-cath check
   this morning.  Left one femoral venous access intact since patient is
   getting propofol through peripheral and dopamine through femoral.  Will
   need to remove femoral access once dopamine is completely weaned off
   this AM, unable to wean dopamine overnight likely secondary to BP
   effect of propofol which is needed to keep the patient sedated on the
   vent as he is still intubated.  Will need to wean patient to extubate
   this AM. Patient's DNR/DNI status confirmed with daughter
   post-procedure.

   since patient is getting propofol through peripheral and dopamine
   through femoral.  Will need to remove femoral access once dopamine is
   completely weaned off this AM
   -Rt lower extremity to bruits, indurations, or active bleeding over
   site. No mottling of the skin or toes. DP/PT 2+
   Respiratory --  Pt was intubated for the ablation.
   -Unable to extubate as originally planned at 0400hrs since pt was
   unable to be weaned off the dopamine.  Most likely secondary to the
   hypotensive effect of propofol.
   -Respiratory changed his ventilator setting to Pressure support with
   plans to extubate later this morning.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  Will d/c opiates today
   secondary to altered mental status.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg with good response two nights ago
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.  Currently
   on propofol while intubated.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   FEN:
   -Pt was hypokalemic yesterday to 2.2 was repleated with 40mEq IV and

   Code status: DNR/DNI- no external shocks
   Disposition:
","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia. The patient presented to the hospital with ICD firing and chest pain, and was initially in ventricular tachycardia at a rate of 120-130s. He received IV amiodarone bolus and was on a continuous infusion. After undergoing a successful VT ablation procedure, his code status was changed to full code, but was later reversed to DNR/DNI.

The patient experienced multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia and received several shocks. He was paced into sinus rhythm and transferred back to the CCU. Lidocaine and amiodarone infusions were started, but the patient became agitated and lost IV access. The decision was made to keep the ICD on, despite the repeated shocks, and discussions were held with the family regarding the patient's care plan. Verapamil will be started today, and diltiazem IV will be added if the patient goes into ventricular tachycardia. No plans for ICD battery replacement were made at this time.

The patient's potassium levels were low yesterday and were repleted with IV potassium and magnesium. His current potassium level is normal."

   24 Hour Events:
   Underwent VT ablation yesterday.  EP fellow consented patient
   daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] was full code for the procedure only.  Elective
   intubation at 16:20.
   -Pt potassium at 2000hrs was 2.5, 3.2 when repeated. Repleted with
   40meq IV potassium and 2gm IV Mag.
   -Pt's ICD battery needs replacement after multiple shocks
   -Pt returned s/p ablation at 2100hrs was in sinus, but then reconverted
   to Vtach in the 120s-130s for several minutes upon returning to the
   CCU. He was shocked several times via ICD at 2100hrs and reverted to
   normal sinus paced rhythm.  V tach thought to be secondary to the
   dopamine used during procedure which he has yet to be weaned off at
   this point.  He is RV pacing only, pacer leads were checked and LV lead
   is not capturing.  Femoral sheath removed at 23:30, post-cath check
   this morning.  Left one femoral venous access intact since patient is
   getting propofol through peripheral and dopamine through femoral.  Will
   need to remove femoral access once dopamine is completely weaned off
   this AM, unable to wean dopamine overnight likely secondary to BP
   effect of propofol which is needed to keep the patient sedated on the
   vent as he is still intubated.  Will need to wean patient to extubate
   this AM. Patient's DNR/DNI status confirmed with daughter
   post-procedure.

   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt started but patient became agitated
   and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past for
   patient.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] repeated ablation on [**2147-9-25**]. Currently pt is paced and
   in sinus However, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] may want to take pt for LV lead
   replacement since the lead is not capturing. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] expressed
   pts VT might be originating from that site.
   -Currently on PO amiodarone- will continue PO and not the drip.
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time. Might
   also be contributing to his altered mental status.
   - Keep ICD on
   - receiving repeated ICD shocks, and transitioning to comfort care.
   Due to  his multiple shocks ICD may need battery replacement.  Discuss
   with family how they would like to proceed.
   - extensive conversation with daughter (HCP) took place, where decision
   was made to keep ICD on, and instruction was provided that the three
   modalities of therapy for this irregular rhythm are
   medication/ICD/ablation (all of which he has had and extensively
   pursued).
   Post-cath check at 0650hrs
   -Femoral sheath removed at 23:30, Left one femoral venous access intact
   since patient is getting propofol through peripheral and dopamine
   through femoral.  Will need to remove femoral access once dopamine is
   completely weaned off this AM
   -Rt lower extremity to bruits, indurations, or active bleeding over
   site. No mottling of the skin or toes. DP/PT 2+
   Respiratory --  Pt was intubated for the ablation.
   -Unable to extubate as originally planned at 0400hrs since pt was
   unable to be weened off the dopamine.  Most likely secondary to the
   hypotensive effect of propofol.
   -Respiratory chanced his ventilator setting to Pressure support with
   plans to extubate later this morning.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  Will d/c opiates today
   secondary to altered mental status.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg  with good response.
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.  Currently
   on propofol while intubated.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   FEN:
   -Pt was hypokalemic yesterday to 2.2 was repleated with 40mEq IV and
   2gm of Mg.  This morning
s potassium was 3.7 repleated 20mEq this AM.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient underwent a VT ablation procedure and was consented by the EP fellow.
- The patient's potassium levels were low at 2.5 and 3.2, so they were repleted with 40meq IV potassium and 2gm IV Mag.
- The patient's ICD battery needs replacement due to multiple shocks.
- After the ablation procedure, the patient returned to the CCU and initially converted back to Vtach for several minutes. The patient was shocked several times via ICD and reverted to normal sinus paced rhythm. The VT was thought to be secondary to the dopamine used during the procedure.
- The patient is currently RV pacing only, and the pacer leads were checked. The LV lead is not capturing.
- The femoral sheath was removed at 23:30, and the left femoral venous access is intact since the patient is receiving propofol through a peripheral line and dopamine through femoral access.
- The patient's DNR/DNI status was confirmed with the daughter post-procedure.
- The patient has a history of CAD s/p MI and CABG, chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF 20%, and recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing.

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
 VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, SUSTAINED
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt started but patient became agitated
   and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past for
   patient.
   - will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] re: utility of repeat ablation
   -Currently on PO amiodarone- will continue PO and not the drip.
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time. Might
   also be contributing to his altered mental status.
   - Keep ICD on
   - receiving repeated ICD shocks, and transitioning to comfort care.
   Receiving morphine PRN for pain
   - extensive conversation with daughter (HCP) took place, where decision
   was made to keep ICD on, and instruction was provided that the three
   modalities of therapy for this irregular rhythm are
   medication/ICD/ablation (all of which he has had and extensively
   pursued).
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  Will d/c opiates today
   secondary to altered mental status.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg  with good response.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked. Leave ICD
   on. Daughter will visit today- will discuss goals of care again.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and has recently been discharged from the CCU with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing. The patient presented with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) on oral amiodarone and underwent a successful ventricular tachycardia ablation procedure. His code status was changed to full code after the procedure, but it was later reversed to DNR/DNI.

The patient has been experiencing episodes of VT, which have been managed with multiple shocks and medication. He is currently on oral amiodarone and has a functioning ICD. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 90/53 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. He is intubated and sedated on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO"

   Underwent VT ablation yesterday.  EP fellow consented patient
   daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] was full code for the procedure only.  Elective
   intubation at 4:20pm.
   -Pt potassium at 2000hrs was 2.5, 3.2 when repeated. Repleted with
   40meq IV potassium and 2gm IV Mag.
   -Pt's ICD battery needs replacement after multiple shocks
   -Pt returned s/p ablation at 2100hrs was in sinus, but then reconverted
   to Vtach in the 120s-130s for several minutes upon returning to the
   CCU. He was shocked several times via ICD at 2100hrs and reverted to
   normal sinus paced rhythm.  V tach thought to be secondary to the
   dopamine used during procedure which he has yet to be weaned off at
   this point.  He is RV pacing only, pacer leads were checked and LV lead
   is not capturing.  Femoral sheath removed at 23:30, post-cath check
   this morning.  Left one femoral venous access intact since patient is
   getting propofol through peripheral and dopamine through femoral.  Will
   need to remove femoral access once dopamine is completely weaned off
   this AM, unable to wean dopamine overnight likely secondary to BP
   effect of propofol which is needed to keep the patient sedated on the
   vent as he is still intubated.  Will need to wean patient to extubate
   this AM. Patient's DNR/DNI status confirmed with daughter
   post-procedure.

   and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past for
   patient.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] repeated ablation on [**2147-9-25**]. Currently pt is paced and
   in sinus However, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] may want to take pt for LV lead
   replacement since the lead is not capturing. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] expressed
   pts VT might be originating from that site.
   -Currently on PO amiodarone- will continue PO and not the drip.
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time. Might
   also be contributing to his altered mental status.
   - Keep ICD on
   - receiving repeated ICD shocks, and transitioning to comfort care.
   Due to  his multiple shocks ICD may need battery replacement.  Discuss
   with family how they would like to proceed.
   - extensive conversation with daughter (HCP) took place, where decision
   was made to keep ICD on, and instruction was provided that the three
   modalities of therapy for this irregular rhythm are
   medication/ICD/ablation (all of which he has had and extensively

   Respiratory --  Pt was intubated for the ablation.
   -Unable to extubate as originally planned at 0400hrs since pt was
   unable to be weened off the dopamine.  Most likely secondary to the
   hypotensive effect of propofol.
   -Respiratory chanced his ventilator setting to Pressure support with
   plans to extubate later this morning.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as

He also has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT).
- The patient presented to the hospital with ICD firing and chest pain, and was found to be in VT at a rate of 120-130 beats per minute. He received IV amiodarone and was started on a continuous infusion, but developed agitation and lost IV access.
- The patient underwent a repeat VT ablation procedure, which was successful. However, he continues to experience episodes of VT and is receiving repeated ICD shocks.
- The patient's ICD battery needs replacement due to multiple shocks.
- The patient is currently intubated and receiving propofol through a peripheral line and dopamine through a femoral line. He is also receiving multiple medications including midazolam, famotidine, heparin, and others.
- The patient's potassium levels were initially low but have been repleted. His magnesium level was also low and has been corrected.
- The patient is DNR/DNI and not to be externally shocked. His code status was changed to full code after the VT ablation procedure, but it was reversed back to DNR/DNI.

   Underwent VT ablation yesterday.  EP fellow consented patient
   daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] was full code for the procedure only.  Elective
   intubation at 4:20pm.
   -Pt potassium at 2000hrs was 2.5, 3.2 when repeated. Repleted with
   40meq IV potassium and 2gm IV Mag.
   -Pt's ICD battery needs replacement after multiple shocks
   -Pt returned s/p ablation at 2100hrs was in sinus, but then reconverted
   to Vtach in the 120s-130s for several minutes upon returning to the
   CCU. He was shocked several times via ICD at 2100hrs and reverted to
   normal sinus paced rhythm.  V tach thought to be secondary to the
   dopamine used during procedure which he has yet to be weaned off at
   this point.  He is RV pacing only, pacer leads were checked and LV lead
   is not capturing.  Femoral sheath removed at 23:30, post-cath check
   this morning.  Left one femoral venous access intact since patient is
   getting propofol through peripheral and dopamine through femoral.  Will
   need to remove femoral access once dopamine is completely weaned off
   this AM, unable to wean dopamine overnight likely secondary to BP
   effect of propofol which is needed to keep the patient sedated on the
   vent as he is still intubated.  Will need to wean patient to extubate
   this AM. Patient's DNR/DNI status confirmed with daughter
   post-procedure.

   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt started but patient became agitated
   and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past for
   patient.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] repeated ablation on [**2147-9-25**]. Currently pt is paced and
   in sinus However, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] may want to take pt for LV lead
   replacement since the lead is not capturing. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] expressed
   pts VT might be originating from that site.
   -Currently on PO amiodarone- will continue PO and not the drip.
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time. Might
   also be contributing to his altered mental status.
   - Keep ICD on
   - receiving repeated ICD shocks, and transitioning to comfort care.
   Due to  his multiple shocks ICD may need battery replacement.  Discuss
   with family how they would like to proceed.
   - extensive conversation with daughter (HCP) took place, where decision
   was made to keep ICD on, and instruction was provided that the three
   modalities of therapy for this irregular rhythm are
   medication/ICD/ablation (all of which he has had and extensively
   pursued).
   Post-cath check at 0650hrs
   -Femoral sheath removed at 23:30, Left one femoral venous access intact
   since patient is getting propofol through peripheral and dopamine
   through femoral.  Will need to remove femoral access once dopamine is
   completely weaned off this AM
   -Rt lower extremity to bruits, indurations, or active bleeding over
   site. No mottling of the skin or toes. DP/PT 2+
   Respiratory --  Pt was intubated for the ablation.
   -Unable to extubate as originally planned at 0400hrs since pt was
   unable to be weened off the dopamine.  Most likely secondary to the
   hypotensive effect of propofol.
   -Respiratory chanced his ventilator setting to Pressure support with
   plans to extubate later this morning.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  Will d/c opiates today
   secondary to altered mental status.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg  with good response.
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.  Currently
   on propofol while intubated.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   FEN:
   -Pt was hypokalemic yesterday to 2.2 was repleated with 40mEq IV and
   2gm of Mg.  This morning
s potassium was 3.7 repleated 20mEq this AM.
   -Follow lytes
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked. Leave ICD
   on. Daughter will visit today- will discuss goals of care again.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recently discharged from the critical care unit with ICD firing. The patient presented with recurrent ventricular tachycardia despite being on oral amiodarone and underwent a successful ventricular tachycardia ablation procedure. He is currently paced and in sinus rhythm, but the left ventricular lead is not capturing, and there is a possibility of lead replacement. The patient has altered mental status, impaired physical mobility, and impaired skin integrity. He has a history of multiple ICD shocks and is transitioning to comfort care. The patient's potassium levels were low yesterday and were repleted with IV potassium and magnesium. His current potassium level is 3.7, and it will be followed closely. The patient's ICD battery needs replacement, and the decision to keep the ICD on has been made after discussion with the family. The patient is DNR/DNI, and not to be externally shocked. The next of kin is his daughter, who will visit today to discuss goals of care again.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia recurrence
2. Impaired physical mobility due to intubation and sedation
3. Altered mental status"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt started but patient became agitated
   and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past for
   patient.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] repeated ablation on [**2147-9-25**]. Currently pt is paced and
   in sinus However, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] may want to take pt for LV lead
   replacement since the lead is not capturing. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] expressed
   pts VT might be originating from that site.
   - Currently on PO amiodarone- will continue PO and not the drip.
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time. Might
   also be contributing to his altered mental status.
   - Keep ICD on
   - receiving repeated ICD shocks, and transitioning to comfort care.
   Due to  his multiple shocks ICD may need battery replacement.  Discuss
   with family how they would like to proceed.
   - extensive conversation with daughter (HCP) took place, where decision
   was made to keep ICD on, and instruction was provided that the three
   modalities of therapy for this irregular rhythm are
   medication/ICD/ablation (all of which he has had and extensively
   pursued).
   Post-cath check at 0650hrs
   -Femoral sheath removed at 23:30, Left one femoral venous access intact
   since patient is getting propofol through peripheral and dopamine
   through femoral.  Will need to remove femoral access once dopamine is
   completely weaned off this AM
   -Rt lower extremity to bruits, indurations, or active bleeding over
   site. No mottling of the skin or toes. DP/PT 2+
   Respiratory --  Pt was intubated for the ablation.
   -Unable to extubate as originally planned at 0400hrs since pt was
   unable to be weened off the dopamine.  Most likely secondary to the
   hypotensive effect of propofol.
   -Respiratory chanced his ventilator setting to Pressure support with
   plans to extubate later this morning.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  Will d/c opiates today
   secondary to altered mental status.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg with good response two nights ago
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.  Currently
   on propofol while intubated.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   FEN:
   -Pt was hypokalemic yesterday to 2.2 was repleated with 40mEq IV and
   2gm of Mg.  This morning
s potassium was 3.7 repleated 20mEq this AM.
   -Follow lytes
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked. Leave ICD
   on. Daughter will visit today- will discuss goals of care again.
   .
   #. Prophy
 DVT: heparin SQ; No need for PPI; Colace/Senna.

The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia. The patient presented with ICD firing and chest pain, and was initially treated with IV amiodarone. After a successful VT ablation, the patient's code status was changed to full code. However, the patient experienced recurrent VT and required multiple shocks. He is currently paced and in sinus rhythm.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels were low at 2.5 and 3.2. He was repleted with 40meq IV potassium and 2gm IV Mag.
2. ICD battery replacement: Due to repeated ICD shocks, the patient may need battery replacement.
3. LV lead replacement: The patient's left ventricular lead is not capturing, and Dr. [Last Name (STitle)] expressed that VT might be originating from that site. There is a possibility of replacing the LV lead.
4. Altered mental status: The patient is agitated and has altered mental status, possibly due to medications such as lidocaine.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt started but patient became agitated
   and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past for
   patient.
   - LV pacing at 60 currently.
   - RV pacing off.
   - now s/p ablation x 2 (most recently [**2147-9-25**])
   - Currently pt is paced and in sinus; intrinsic conduction.
   - Keep ICD on
   - family wants generator changed at some point
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time. Might
   also be contributing to his altered mental status.
   - Due to  his multiple shocks ICD will need battery replacement.
   Discuss with family how they would like to proceed.
   - extensive conversation with daughter (HCP) took place, where decision
   was made to keep ICD on, and instruction was provided that the three
   modalities of therapy for this irregular rhythm are
   medication/ICD/ablation (all of which he has had and extensively
   pursued).
   - D/C amiodarone and started verapamil yesterday.
   - Add diltiazem IV if goes into Vtach
   .
   # Respiratory
 extubated, off sedation, off pressors.
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  Will d/c opiates today
   secondary to altered mental status.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg with good response two nights ago
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.  Currently
   on propofol while intubated.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   FEN:
   -Pt was hypokalemic yesterday to 2.2 was repleated with 40mEq IV and
   2gm of Mg.  This morning
s potassium was 3.2, being repleted.
   -Follow lytes
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked. Leave ICD
   on
   .
   #. Prophy
 DVT: heparin SQ; No need for PPI; Colace/Senna.

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recently discharged from the cardiac care unit with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing. The patient presented with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) on oral amiodarone and underwent two VT ablation procedures. He is currently do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI), with the decision reversed to full code after the last ablation procedure. The patient's ICD settings were adjusted to reduce false alarms, and he is being paced at 60 beats per minute. His current medications include metoprolol, a statin, and aspirin. The patient's respiratory support has been discontinued, and he is extubated. He is off sedation and pressors. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 96/50 mmHg, heart rate of 60 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on room air, and temperature within normal range. The patient's physical examination reveals mild tenderness in the abdomen, no signs of heart failure, and no femoral bruits. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt were started but patient became
   agitated and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past
   for patient.
   - LV pacing at 60 currently
   - RV pacing off.
   - now s/p ablation x 2 (most recently [**2147-9-25**])
   - Currently pt is paced and in sinus; intrinsic conduction.
   - Keep ICD on
   - family wants generator changed at some point
   - D/C amiodarone and started verapamil yesterday.
   - Add diltiazem IV if goes into Vtach
   .
   # Respiratory
 extubated, off sedation, off pressors.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   .
   # Leukocytosis- WBC up to 14.2 this AM (~9 yesterday).  Increased stool
   overnight and abdominal tenderness to exam this morning.  Possible
   C.diff
   - Stool sent for C.diff toxin
   - Patient started on Flagyl 500mg PO TID
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  No opiates given altered
   mental status history with opioid administration
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg with good response four nights
   ago
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.  Currently
   on propofol while intubated.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   FEN:
   - Hypokalemic to 3.2 this AM.
   - Will replete with 80mEq IV K+.
   - Follow lytes
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked. Leave ICD
   on
   .
   #. Prophy
 DVT: heparin SQ; No need for PPI; Colace/Senna.

   Disposition: CCU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia. He was previously discharged from the cardiac care unit (CCU) and returned with recurrent ventricular tachycardia on oral amiodarone. The patient underwent a successful ventricular tachycardia ablation procedure but experienced multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia and received several shocks. He is currently on do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status and has his code status reversed to full code after the VT ablation procedure. The patient has been extubated and is off sedation and pressors.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/50 mmHg to 126/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. He has mild abdominal tenderness and increased stool frequency overnight. The white blood cell count is elevated at 14.2 K/uL. His electrolytes show hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L, which will be repleted with 80mEq IV K+. The patient's renal function is impaired with an elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL.

The patient is currently paced and in sinus rhythm, with intrinsic conduction. He has an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) which will be kept on, and the family wants the generator changed at some point. The patient's cardiac enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after the shock but are not indicative of an acute coronary syndrome. He is being continued on his home medications, including a statin, aspirin, metoprolol, and an ACE inhibitor, which is currently held due to hypotension. The patient's pain is well-controlled with Tylenol, and his anxiety is improving with olanzapine sublingually.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a history of recurrent ventricular tachycardia, which can be life-threatening if not appropriately managed.
2. Heart failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and there is a risk of decompensation.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient has leukocytosis and increased stool frequency, suggesting a possible C. difficile infection.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium level needs to be monitored and managed to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates impaired renal function, which requires close monitoring.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further assessment and examination may be required to fully evaluate the patient's condition."

   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt started but patient became agitated
   and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past for
   patient.
   - LV pacing at 60 currently.
   - RV pacing off.
   - now s/p ablation x 2 (most recently [**2147-9-25**])
   - Currently pt is paced and in sinus; intrinsic conduction.
   - Keep ICD on
   - family wants generator changed at some point
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time. Might
   also be contributing to his altered mental status.
   - Due to  his multiple shocks ICD will need battery replacement.
   Discuss with family how they would like to proceed.
   - extensive conversation with daughter (HCP) took place, where decision
   was made to keep ICD on, and instruction was provided that the three
   modalities of therapy for this irregular rhythm are
   medication/ICD/ablation (all of which he has had and extensively
   pursued).
   - D/C amiodarone and started verapamil yesterday.
   - Add diltiazem IV if goes into Vtach
   .
   # Respiratory
 extubated, off sedation, off pressors.
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  Will d/c opiates today
   secondary to altered mental status.
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg with good response two nights ago
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.  Currently
   on propofol while intubated.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   FEN:
   -Pt was hypokalemic yesterday to 2.2 was repleated with 40mEq IV and
   2gm of Mg.  This morning

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia. The patient underwent two ventricular tachycardia ablation procedures. He was admitted to the intensive care unit due to an ICD firing and chest pain, and then again for recurrent ventricular tachycardia. The patient's code status has been changed from DNR/DNI to full code after the successful VT ablation, but was reversed back to DNR/DNI.

The patient is currently extubated, off sedation, and off pressors. He is being paced at 60 beats per minute and has had multiple shocks. His vital signs are stable, and he is in sinus rhythm since 2 AM. The patient's family wants the generator changed at some point, and they have discussed the option of battery replacement. Lidocaine, which previously did not work well for the patient, will not be restarted due to his altered mental status. The patient's current medications include statin, ASA, metoprolol, and IV diltiazem.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt started but patient became agitated
   and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past for
   patient.
   - LV pacing at 60 currently.
   - now s/p ablation x 2
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] repeated ablation on [**2147-9-25**]. Currently pt is paced and
   in sinus.
   - Lidocaine not working in past- will not restart at this time. Might
   also be contributing to his altered mental status.
   - Keep ICD on
   - family wants generator changed at some point
   - Due to  his multiple shocks ICD may need battery replacement.
   Discuss with family how they would like to proceed.
   - extensive conversation with daughter (HCP) took place, where decision
   was made to keep ICD on, and instruction was provided that the three
   modalities of therapy for this irregular rhythm are
   medication/ICD/ablation (all of which he has had and extensively
   pursued).
   - D/C amiodarone and started verapamil yesterday.
   - Add diltiazem IV if goes into Vtach
   - No plans to change battery at this time because it is still working
   and it would be an unnecessary stress at this time.
   Respiratory
 extubated, off sedation, off pressors.
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.

The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and cardiac catheterization with stenting. He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia. The patient underwent two ventricular tachycardia ablation procedures. He presented to the hospital with ICD firing and chest pain. He was given IV amiodarone and transferred to the CCU. After developing recurrent ventricular tachycardia, the patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since 2 AM. He is currently paced at 60 beats per minute and is in sinus rhythm.

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, currently admitted to the ICU for acute decompensated heart failure. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/50 to 126/69 mmHg, respiratory rate between 13-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on aerosol-cool delivery device with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is intubated and sedated, with no signs of pallor or cyanosis in the oral mucosa. The neck is supple and there are no jugular venous distention or carotid bruits. The cardiac examination shows a paced rhythm with regular rate and normal S1, S2 sounds, no murmurs, thrills, or lifts, and no evidence of congestive heart failure. The lungs are clear without any adventitious sounds or decreased breath sounds. The abdomen is soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly or bruits. The extremities are warm and well-perfused without any edema or cyanosis. The pulses are strong and bilaterally equal.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dL, leukocyte count of 11.5 K/uL, platelet count of 17"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of colon cancer treated with surgery and chemotherapy. The patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, coughing up blood, and right-sided weakness. She was found to have an acute ischemic stroke and was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

On review of systems, the patient reports difficulty with swallowing and occasional nausea/vomiting. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate ranging from 60 to 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/50 mmHg to 126/69 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 13 to 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on aerosol-cool with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals an altered mental status, with the ability to respond but not fully assessable. She is also unable to move or have normal muscle tone. The peripheral vascular pulses are not assessed, and her skin is not assessed either. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 14.2 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 123 to 159 mg/dL, and slightly elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt were started but patient became
   agitated and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past
   for patient.
   - LV pacing at 60 currently
   - RV pacing off.
   - now s/p ablation x 2 (most recently [**2147-9-25**])
   - Currently pt is paced and in sinus; intrinsic conduction.
   - Keep ICD on
   - family wants generator changed at some point
   - D/C amiodarone and started verapamil yesterday.
   - Add diltiazem IV if goes into Vtach
   .
   # Respiratory
 extubated, off sedation, off pressors.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   .
   # Leukocytosis- WBC up to 14.2 this AM (~9 yesterday).  Increased stool
   overnight and abdominal tenderness to exam this morning.  Possible
   C.diff
   - Stool sent for C.diff toxin
   - Patient started on Flagyl 500mg PO TID
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  No opiates given altered
   mental status history with opioid administration
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg with good response four nights
   ago
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.  Currently
   on propofol while intubated.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   FEN:
   - Hypokalemic to 3.2 this AM.
   - Will replete with 80mEq IV K+.
   - Follow lytes

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He also has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia. The patient presented to the hospital with ICD firing and chest pain. He was initially given IV amiodarone and later underwent successful ventricular tachycardia ablation. The patient's code status was changed to DNR/DNI after the procedure. He experienced multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia and received several shocks. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm and has been on LV pacing at 60 bpm. He is extubated and off sedation and pressors.

Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has a history of recurrent VT, which led to ICD firing and chest pain. He was given IV amiodarone and underwent VT ablation. However, he experienced another episode of VT overnight, requiring multiple shocks to restore sinus rhythm.

2. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. There are no signs of CHF at the moment, but the patient's cardiac function should be closely monitored.

3. C. difficile infection: The patient has leukocytosis with"

The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia. The patient presented with ICD firing and chest pain, and was given IV amiodarone in the emergency room. He underwent a successful ventricular tachycardia ablation procedure, after which his code status was changed to do not resuscitate (DNR). The patient experienced another episode of ventricular tachycardia and was repaced into sinus rhythm. He is currently on a heart rate of 60 beats per minute with left ventricular pacing, and the right ventricular pacing is turned off. The patient's current medications include statin, aspirin, metoprolol, and he will continue his home medications. He is also on prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's family wants the generator changed at some point. The patient is extubated, off sedation, and off pressors. He is being monitored closely for any signs of congestive heart failure, cardiac ischemia, pain, anxiety, and electrolyte imbalances.

   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2 and
   with new onset leukocytosis and abdominal pain.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach, presented due to ICD firing and chest
   pain, s/p VT ablation [**2147-9-25**], patient with improved rhythm, but still
   has occasional runs of NSVT at 120-130s. O/n, occasional episodes of
   Vtach which converted, without shocks or other intervention.
   - Off amio, off lido, continue CCB for triggered ecotopy.
   - LV pacing at 60 currently
   - RV pacing off.
   - Keep ICD on
   - Family wants generator changed at some point
   - Add diltiazem IV if goes into Vtach
   .
   #Leukocytosis with left shift/SIRS, differential diagnosis includes C.
   Diff (possible despite negative c. diff toxin assay x 1, given
   abdominal pain, diarrhea and rapidly rising WBC and test has a
   sensitivity of 60-90%. ), UTI (possible given cloudy urine, 9 WBCs and
   a few bacterial cells seen on UA with micro, diverticulitis, given age
   of patient and location of pain, possible but less likely, ischemic
   bowel disease, unlikely given normal lactate, pneumonia, possible as
   s/p intubation
   -F/u c. diff stool assay x 2 to rule out C. Diff
   -Start empiric flagyl 500 mg IV q8 and PO Vancomycin to cover for C.
   difficile.  Add IV cipro to cover for potential diverticulitis.
   -Foley pulled, condom catheter in place, repeat UA, F/u urine culture
   to rule out UTI, begin empiric cipro
   - F/u blood cultures
   -F/u CXR to rule out aspiration, pneumonia
   - start mIVF NS at 100 cc/hr
   - hold lasix and ACEi
   - trend lactates
   - CT abdomen/pelvis given guarding on physical exam
   - may need to increase rate of pacemaker to correlate with SIRS
   physiology
   - repeat urine cx
   .
   # Abdominal pain
 pt with diffuse abdominal pain/tenderness, but
   abdomen soft and without signs of rebound/guarding.  AXR ordered and no
   signs of obstruction or perforation; redundant bowel loops noted in RUQ
   with size 4 cm (unclear if small bowel or colon, as per wet read with
   radiology). Differential diagnosis includes C. Diff, ischemic disease,
   unlikely given negative lactate, diverticulitis, possible given
   patient
s age and location of pain, pancreatitis, unlikely given normal
   lipase, hepato-biliary disease, unlikely given normal LFTs, and
   decreasing bili, pyelonephritis, unlikely given afebrile and negative
   nitrites on UA, UTI causing suprapubic pain, possible given hazy urine
   and 9 WBCs on micro.
   - NPO
   - CT abdomen/pelvis since pt has guarding on exam
   - Will start flagyl 500 mg IV q8h to empiricially treat for C. Diff
   along with PO vanco for now
   - trend lactate
   - Start IV cipro as well to cover for possible diverticulitis
   .
   #Hyponatremia- Na this AM 126, yesterday was 135. Likely false result
   given patient did not demonstrate thirst yesterday, and did not have an
   excessive free water intake. The patient has been putting out an
   appropriate amount of urine, making SIADH or other cerebral salt
   wasting unlikely.
   -F/u repeat Na, f/u urine lytes

   # Respiratory
 extubated, off sedation, off pressors and maintaining
   adequate O2 sat and pressure

   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggested  mild cardiac injury on
   presentation, resolved, likely did not have ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  No opiates given altered
   mental status history with opioid administration
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He also has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recently discharged from the critical care unit with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) that fired due to ventricular tachycardia. The patient presented with recurrent ventricular tachycardia, which was managed with ablation. He is now experiencing diffuse abdominal pain and tenderness, with no signs of rebound or guarding. Imaging studies show no evidence of obstruction or perforation, but there are redundant bowel loops in the right upper quadrant. The patient has leukocytosis with a left shift, suggesting a possible Clostridium difficile infection. Other potential causes of his abdominal pain include diverticulitis, ischemic bowel disease, pancreatitis, hepato-biliary disease, pyelonephritis, and urinary tract infection. The patient's other medical conditions include anxiety and a history of opioid use. He is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and being treated empirically for C. difficile infection, diverticulitis, and urinary tract infection. His sodium level is low, and further evaluation is needed. The patient is extubated and maintaining adequate oxygen saturation. His heart failure and coronary artery disease are stable at present. He is on"

   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt were started but patient became
   agitated and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past
   for patient.
   - LV pacing at 60 currently
   - RV pacing off.
   - now s/p ablation x 2 (most recently [**2147-9-25**])
   - Currently pt is paced and in sinus; intrinsic conduction.
   - Keep ICD on
   - family wants generator changed at some point
   - D/C amiodarone and started verapamil yesterday.
   - Add diltiazem IV if goes into Vtach
   .
   # Abdominal pain
 pt with diffuse abdominal pain/tenderness, but
   abdomen soft and without signs of rebound/guarding.  AXR ordered and no
   signs of obstruction or perforation; redundant bowel loops noted in RUQ

   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.

   # Leukocytosis- WBC up to 14.2 this AM (~9 yesterday).  Increased stool
   overnight and abdominal tenderness to exam this morning.  Possible
   C.diff
   - Stool sent for C.diff toxin (neg x 1)
   - sending C diff toxin again with next BM
   - Currently off empiric Abx
   - urinalysis with 9 wbc and cloudy urine; unclear if UTI.  Have pulled
   foley and awaiting urine cx prior to Abx initiation.

   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.

   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  No opiates given altered
   mental status history with opioid administration
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg with good response four nights

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of diffuse abdominal pain. He has not had a bowel movement in 5 days and experienced diarrhea yesterday. He also reports that he tried to have a bowel movement twice today without any movement. On examination, the patient's pain is sharp, constant, and diffuse. There is no rebound tenderness, but the abdomen is mildly tender to palpation. Redundant bowel loops were seen on abdominal X-ray. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and lactate levels are pending. He has several allergies, including morphine, nausea/vomiting, mirtazapine, and unknown allergies to Ambien. The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin for prophylaxis. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted abdominal pain. 

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 100 degrees Celsius, current temperature of 99.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 60 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 58-105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is on AV pacing, weighs 78.7 kg, and is 70 inches tall. Fluid balance shows an input of 2630 mL, output of 1320 mL, and a balance of 1310 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has a SpO2 of 90%. Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities in the general, HEENT, neck, cardiac, lung, extremities, skin, or pulses.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient's assessment includes abdominal pain, delirium/confusion, impaired physical mobility, impaired skin integrity, chronic heart failure, and sustained ventricular tachycardia. The plan includes ICU care with nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and is dispositioned appropriately."

   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2 and
   with new onset leukocytosis and abdominal pain.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach, presented due to ICD firing and chest
   pain, s/p VT ablation [**2147-9-25**], patient with improved rhythm, but still
   has occasional runs of NSVT at 120-130s. O/n, occasional episodes of
   Vtach which converted, without shocks or other intervention.
   - Off amio, off lido, continue CCB for triggered ecotopy.
   - LV pacing at 60 currently
   - RV pacing off.
   - Keep ICD on
   - Family wants generator changed at some point
   - Add diltiazem IV if goes into Vtach

   pain, diarrhea and rapidly rising WBC and test has a sensitivity of
   60-90%. ), UTI (possible given cloudy urine, 9 WBCs and a few bacterial
   cells seen on UA with micro, diverticulitis, given age of patient and
   location of pain, possible but less likely, ischemic bowel disease,
   unlikely given normal lactate, pneumonia, possible as s/p intubation
   -F/u c. diff stool assay x 2 to rule out C. Diff
   -Consider addition of empiric flagyl 500 mg IV q8
   -Foley pulled, condom catheter in place, repeat UA, F/u urine culture
   to rule out UTI, begin empiric cipro

   # Abdominal pain
 pt with diffuse abdominal pain/tenderness, but
   abdomen soft and without signs of rebound/guarding.  AXR ordered and no
   signs of obstruction or perforation; redundant bowel loops noted in RUQ
   with size 4 cm (unclear if small bowel or colon, as per wet read with
   radiology). Differential diagnosis includes C. Diff, ischemic disease,
   unlikely given negative lactate, diverticulitis, possible given
   patient
s age and location of pain, pancreatitis, unlikely given normal
   lipase, hepato-biliary disease, unlikely given normal LFTs, and
   decreasing bili, pyelonephritis, unlikely given afebrile and negative
   nitrites on UA, UTI causing suprapubic pain, possible given hazy urine
   and 9 WBCs on micro.
   - NPO
   - consider CT abdomen/pelvis if clinical exam worsens
   -Consider starting flagyl 500 mg IV q8h to empiricially treat for C.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He also has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recent discharge from the critical care unit with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing. The patient presented with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) on oral amiodarone, and he underwent ventricular tachycardia ablation.

The patient's current complaints include diffuse abdominal pain, lack of bowel movement for five days, and attempts to have bowel movements without success. He has also reported nightmares. The patient's allergies include morphine, nausea/vomiting, mirtazapine, and unknown allergies to Ambien.

On physical examination, the patient's general appearance is normal, and his HEENT examination shows no abnormalities. His neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy or jugular venous distention. The cardiac examination reveals a paced rhythm with a regular rate and normal S1 and S2 sounds. There are no murmurs, lifts, or thrills, and the point of maximal impulse is located in the fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. The lung examination is unremarkable, and the abdomen is extremely tender but soft without rebound or guarding. The extremities show no clubbing or edema,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing and chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient recently underwent ventricular tachycardia ablation and presented with recurrent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. He is currently on cardiopulmonary bypass support and has been extubated.

The patient complains of diffuse abdominal pain and has not had a bowel movement in five days. On examination, he is tender in the abdomen but without rebound or guarding. An abdominal X-ray shows no signs of obstruction or perforation, but there are redundant bowel loops in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a left shift, normal lactate levels, and no evidence of infection on urinalysis.

The patient also has hyponatremia with a sodium level of 126 mEq/L. This may be a false result due to inadequate water intake. The patient's respiratory status is stable, and he is maintaining adequate oxygen saturation.

The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure and is on home medications including a statin, aspirin, and metoprolol. His chest pain is controlled with Tylenol. He has a history of anxiety, but it appears to be improving.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Diffuse abdominal pain and guarding this AM. WBC count up to 24.7
   this AM. Blood cultures and urine culture sent.  Pt restarted
   empirically on Flagyl, Cipro, and PO Vanc. Given his sodium level all
   diuretics were held and he was started on 100ml/hr of NS continuous.
   He has been bolused with 250cc x3 this afternoon and his lungs remain
   clear to auscultation.  His blood pressure remained in the 80s systolic
   throughout the day despite the fluid and extra boluses and his
   pacemaker being reset to a HR=70.
   -CT abdomen with contrast shows segmental inflammation of the sigmoid
   suggestive of colitis.  UA prelim is growing 10,000-100,000 gram
   negative rods.  Empiric abx coverage appropriate for now pending
   sensitivities.
   -His WBC count decreased from 24.7 to 20.7 this afternoon and his
   sodium remained stable at 127.
   -Increased confusion throughout the day.  Yelling in Russian all night,
   ripping off his leads, undressing.  Given Zyprexa ODT 5mg x2. Russian

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt were started but patient became
   agitated and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past
   for patient.
   - LV pacing at 70 currently
   - RV pacing off.
   - now s/p ablation x 2 (most recently [**2147-9-25**])
   - Currently pt is paced and in sinus; intrinsic conduction.
   - Keep ICD on
   - family wants generator changed at some point
   - D/C amiodarone and started verapamil yesterday.
   - Add diltiazem IV if goes into Vtach
   .
   # Respiratory
 extubated, off sedation, off pressors.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   -Gentle hydration with NS at 50ml/hr today given low BP.  Will monitor
   for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # Leukocytosis- WBC up to 14.2 this AM (~9 yesterday).  Increased stool
   overnight and abdominal tenderness to exam this morning.  Possible
   C.diff
   - Stool sent for C.diff toxin
   - Patient started on Flagyl 500mg PO TID
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  No opiates given altered
   mental status history with opioid administration
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg with good response four nights
   ago
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.  Currently
   on propofol while intubated.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   FEN:
   - Hypokalemic to 3.2 this AM.
   - Will replete with 80mEq IV K+.
   - Follow lytes
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked. Leave ICD
   on
   .
   #. Prophy
 DVT: heparin SQ; No need for PPI; Colace/Senna.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He also has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing and chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%.
- The patient was recently discharged from the cardiac care unit (CCU) with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing, and he now returns with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) on oral amiodarone.
- He underwent a successful ventricular tachycardia ablation procedure twice and his code status was changed to do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) after the procedure. However, the patient's code status was reversed to full code before the second ablation.
- The patient has been experiencing episodes of VT, requiring multiple shocks. He has been in sinus rhythm since 2 AM. Lidocaine and amiodarone infusions were started but the patient became agitated and lost IV access.
- The patient's current medications include statin, aspirin, metoprolol, and verapamil. He is being kept on the ICD, and the family wants the generator changed at some point.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt were started but patient became
   agitated and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past
   for patient.
   - LV pacing at 70 currently
   - RV pacing off.
   - now s/p ablation x 2 (most recently [**2147-9-25**])
   - Currently pt is paced and in sinus; intrinsic conduction.
   - Keep ICD on
   - family wants generator changed at some point
   - On verapamil.
   - Add diltiazem IV if goes into Vtach
   .
   # Respiratory
 extubated, off sedation, off pressors.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   -Gentle hydration with NS at 50ml/hr today given low BP.  Will monitor
   for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # Leukocytosis- WBC down today (20.7 from 24).  No stool since
   yesterday AM.  Abdominal tenderness improved.  CT abd showed sigmoid
   colitis.  Unclear etiology.  Have not ruled out C.diff but it is
   unlikely given improving symptoms and decreasing white count.
   -Continue IV cipro
   - Will stop Flagyl and vanc this AM.
   - Urine sensitivities pending- will tailor abx therapy accordingly
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  No opiates given altered
   mental status history with opioid administration
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg with good response four nights
   ago
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.  Currently
   on propofol while intubated.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   FEN:
   -Replete lytes as needed

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He also has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia. The patient presented to the hospital with recurrent ventricular tachycardia and was treated with intravenous amiodarone. He underwent a successful ventricular tachycardia ablation procedure and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has a history of recurrent VT, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed. The ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) has been activated multiple times, indicating the need for ongoing monitoring and management.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. Fluid management should be carefully monitored to prevent exacerbation of heart failure symptoms.
3. Colitis: The CT abdomen shows segmental inflammation of the sigmoid colon suggestive of colitis. This could be due to an infectious or non-infectious cause. Antibiotic therapy has been initiated, but the etiology is still unclear.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient initially presented with leukocytosis (white blood cell count of 24.7), which has decreased to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt were started but patient became
   agitated and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past
   for patient.
   - LV pacing at 70 currently
   - RV pacing off.
   - now s/p ablation x 2 (most recently [**2147-9-25**])
   - Currently pt is paced and in sinus; intrinsic conduction.
   - Keep ICD on
   - family wants generator changed at some point
   - On verapamil.
   - Add diltiazem IV if goes into Vtach
   .
   # Respiratory
 extubated, off sedation, off pressors.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   -Gentle hydration with D5-NS at 50ml/hr today given low BP.  Will
   monitor for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # Leukocytosis- WBC down today (20.7 from 24).  No stool since
   yesterday AM.  Abdominal tenderness improved.  CT abd showed sigmoid
   colitis.  Unclear etiology.  Have not ruled out C.diff but it is
   unlikely given improving symptoms and decreasing white count.
   -Continue IV cipro
   - Will stop Flagyl and vanc this AM.
   - Urine sensitivities pending- will tailor abx therapy accordingly
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  No opiates given altered
   mental status history with opioid administration
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg with good response four nights
   ago
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.  Currently
   on propofol while intubated.
   -If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   FEN:   Hyponatremic recently.  Lytes this AM show Na+ of 139 (after
   hydration yesterday).
   -continue to monitor lytes
   -Replete lytes as needed
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked. Leave ICD
   on
   .
   #. Prophy
 DVT: heparin SQ; No need for PPI; Colace/Senna.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Sigmoid colitis: The CT abdomen with contrast shows segmental inflammation of the sigmoid colon, suggestive of colitis. This condition may lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever.

2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count) and is currently being treated with antibiotics. The preliminary urine culture is growing gram-negative rods, indicating a possible urinary tract infection. If left untreated, this infection can spread to other parts of the body and cause severe complications.

3. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient has a history of VT and has experienced recurrent episodes while in the ICU. VT is a life-threatening heart rhythm disorder that can lead to cardiac arrest if not promptly managed.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been consistently in the 80s systolic throughout the day, indicating hypotension. Low blood pressure can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of kidney injury and other systemic complications.

5. Confusion and agitation: The patient has shown signs of confusion and agitation, which may be due to the underlying medical conditions or the use of certain medications. Agitation can increase the risk of self-harm or injury, and confusion can affect the patient's ability to follow medical instructions.

6. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid during his ablation"

   diuretics were held and he was started on 100ml/hr of NS continuous.
   He has been bolused with 250cc x3 this afternoon and his lungs remain
   clear to auscultation.  His blood pressure remained in the 80s systolic
   throughout the day despite the fluid and extra boluses and his
   pacemaker being reset to a HR=70.
   -CT abdomen with contrast shows segmental inflammation of the sigmoid
   suggestive of colitis.  UA prelim is growing 10,000-100,000 gram
   negative rods.  Empiric abx coverage appropriate for now pending
   sensitivities.
   -His WBC count decreased from 24.7 to 20.7 this afternoon and his
   sodium remained stable at 127.
   -Increased confusion throughout the day.  Yelling in Russian all night,

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt were started but patient became
   agitated and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past
   for patient.
   - LV pacing at 70 currently
   - RV pacing off.
   - now s/p ablation x 2 (most recently [**2147-9-25**])
   - Currently pt is paced and in sinus; intrinsic conduction.
   - Keep ICD on
   - family wants generator changed at some point
   - On verapamil.
   - Add diltiazem IV if goes into Vtach
   .
   # Respiratory
 extubated, off sedation, off pressors.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   -Gentle hydration with NS at 50ml/hr today given low BP.  Will monitor
   for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # Leukocytosis- WBC down today (20.7 from 24).  No stool since
   yesterday AM.  Abdominal tenderness improved.  CT abd showed sigmoid
   colitis.  Unclear etiology.  Have not ruled out C.diff but it is
   unlikely given improving symptoms and decreasing white count.
   -Continue IV cipro
   - Will stop Flagyl and vanc this AM.
   - Urine sensitivities pending- will tailor abx therapy accordingly
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  No opiates given altered
   mental status history with opioid administration
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg with good response four nights
   ago
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.  Currently
   on propofol while intubated.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   FEN:
   - Hypokalemic to 3.2 this AM.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia. The patient presented with recurrent ventricular tachycardia and underwent two ventricular tachycardia ablation procedures. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing diffuse abdominal pain and guarding. His white blood cell count is elevated, and he has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected colitis. The patient also has altered mental status and agitation, for which he has been given antipsychotic medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of recurrent ventricular tachycardia, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
2. Sigmoid Colitis: The patient's abdominal pain and guarding, along with the CT scan findings, suggest the possibility of sigmoid colitis. This condition can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's confusion and agitation could be due to various factors such as medication side effects, electrolyte imbalances, or infection. It is important to monitor his mental status closely.
4. Fluid Overload: Given the patient's history of chronic systolic heart failure and"

   AM. Blood cultures and urine culture sent.  Pt restarted empirically on
   Flagyl, Cipro, and PO Vanc. Given his sodium level all diuretics were
   held and he was started on 100ml/hr of NS continuous.  He has been
   bolused with 250cc x3 this afternoon and his lungs remain clear to
   auscultation.  His blood pressure remained in the 80s systolic
   throughout the day despite the fluid and extra boluses and his
   pacemaker being reset to a HR=70.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and cardiac ablation procedure. He has chronic atrial fibrillation and is on ventricular pacing. He also has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient presented to the ICU with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) and chest pain. He was given intravenous amiodarone and transferred back to the CCU. The patient underwent successful VT ablation and his code status was changed to DNR/DNI. He has been in sinus rhythm since 2 AM, but experienced episodes of VT overnight. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated at 24.7, and he has abdominal pain, guarding, and tenderness. His sodium level is low at 127, and he is confused. The patient is on multiple medications including statins, ASA, metoprolol, and amiodarone. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent VT: The patient's history of VT and recent ablation procedure suggest a high risk for recurrent VT episodes.
2. Sepsis: The elevated leukocyte count, abdominal pain, guarding, and tenderness may indicate an infection, possibly leading to sepsis.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's low potassium level needs to be addressed promptly to prevent cardiac complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 20**] [**Known lastname **] is a 86 yo Russian speaking man with h/o CAD s/p MI and
   CABG in [**2136**], chronic AFib with V-pacing, chronic systolic CHF with EF
   20%, recently discharged from CCU with ICD firing, now returns with
   recurrent VT on PO amiodarone, now s/p VT ablation procedure x 2.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt with known VTach and s/p ICD firing, presented due to
   ICD firing and chest pain. Patient has stable VS and was in VT at
   120-130s. He was bolused with 450 mg of IV amiodarone in the ER and was
   on a gtt. He is currently DNR/DNI after undergoing a successful VT
   ablation for which his code status was changed to full code.  Code
   status reversed after procedure.  Was stable until he developed VT
   overnight on [**9-23**].  Was repaced into sinus rhythm and transferred back
   to CCU.  Again went into VT.  VT detect re-set to 115 from 140.
   Patient received multiple shocks and has been in sinus rhythm since
   2AM.  Lidocaine and amiodarone gtt were started but patient became
   agitated and lost IV access.  Lidocaine had not worked well in the past
   for patient.
   - LV pacing at 60 currently
   - RV pacing off.
   - now s/p ablation x 2 (most recently [**2147-9-25**])
   - Currently pt is paced and in sinus; intrinsic conduction.
   - Keep ICD on
   - family wants generator changed at some point
   - D/C amiodarone and started verapamil yesterday.
   - Add diltiazem IV if goes into Vtach
   .
   # Respiratory
 extubated, off sedation, off pressors.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF at this time. Pt with known chronic systolic
   heart failure with EF of 20%. We will continue his home medications:
   statin, ASA, and metoprolol.
   -No signs of decompensation at the moment.  Monitor UOP since pt
   received a lot of fluids during his ablation.
   .
   # Leukocytosis- WBC up to 14.2 this AM (~9 yesterday).  Increased stool
   overnight and abdominal tenderness to exam this morning.  Possible
   C.diff
   - Stool sent for C.diff toxin
   - Patient started on Flagyl 500mg PO TID
   .
   #. CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG. Chest pain free, other than his VT
   and shocks.  ASA, statin, BB were continued as above.  ACEI held as
   above, due to hypotension. Enzymes suggest mild cardiac injury after
   shock, but most likely he is not having ACS.
   .
   #. OA - pain was well controlled on Tylenol.  No opiates given altered
   mental status history with opioid administration
   .
   #. Anxiety - Discontinued ativan home-dose. Consider low dose mood
   stabilizer at night, if agitation continues.
   -Received Olanzapine sublingual 2.5mg with good response four nights
   ago
   -Pt altered mental status and anxiety seem to be improving.  Currently
   on propofol while intubated.
   - If agitated, consider zydis again vs. haldol 1 mg
   FEN:
   - Hypokalemic to 3.2 this AM.
   - Will replete with 80mEq IV K+.
   - Follow lytes
   .
   #. Code - patient is DNR/DNI.  Not to be externally shocked. Leave ICD
   on
   .
   #. Prophy
 DVT: heparin SQ; No need for PPI; Colace/Senna.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He has chronic atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and recently experienced an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing.

The patient presented to the hospital with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) on oral amiodarone, and subsequently underwent a successful ventricular tachycardia ablation procedure. However, he remains at high risk for recurrent arrhythmias and requires ongoing management.

The patient's current vital signs include a blood pressure in the 80s systolic, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His physical examination reveals mild tenderness in the abdomen and no other significant findings.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.7, which has decreased to 20.7 after starting empiric antibiotic therapy. Other laboratory values are within normal limits.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing his home medications for chronic conditions such as a statin, aspirin, and metoprolol. He is being monitored for any signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) and will receive"
