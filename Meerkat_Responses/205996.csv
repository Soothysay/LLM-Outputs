   Assessment and Plan
   52 year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer who
   presents with hypotension, tacchycardia, acute renal failure and
   worsening anemia and liver function tests.
   #. Anemia: Source unclear. Hemolysis labs abnormal, coags normal
   (although given vitamin K yesterday). No schistocytes seen on smear.
   Does not appear to be DIC given normal coags
 but with low fibrinogen,
   elevated FDP. Sequestration possible but no spleen enlargement
   appreciated on physical exam. [**Month (only) 60**] be drug-induced (ceftriaxone); this
   was discontinued prior to transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]. [**Doctor First Name 2674**] also possible ([**2-10**]
   malignancy?) though no schistocytes seen on peripheral smear.
   - Repeat peripheral smear
   - Coombs test
   - Consult hematology
   - CT scan of abdomen to assess for RP bleed
   - Q6 hour CBCs, coags
   - Transfuse to hct> 25, platelets>20; transfuse 1U platelets, 2U pRBCs
   - Recheck fibrinogen
   # Hypotension/tachycardia: Likely due to hypovolemia from blood loss
   and poor po intake. Improved overnight.
   Other possibility is infection with urine as most likely source given
   frequent manipulation. Other possibilities include cardiac although no
   ekg changes. Patient has no resp complaints but he does have h/o PE and
   is not on systemic anticoagulation due to bleeding.
   - Will give pRBCs, platelets as above
   - Closely monitor MAP, CVP
 will give IVF bolus as needed (goal
   MAP>65)
   - Urine, blood cultures with no growth at this point
   - Treat empirically with vanc and zosyn for possible urine source
   no indication of active infection at this time, will consider
   discontinuing antibiotics
   -CVL and A line for closer monitoring
   # AMS: Improved. Was likely due to hypotension, possibly infection,
   worsening liver function and kidney function on a number of sedating
   medications, possible hepatic encephalopathy.
   - if mental status worsens, will consider lactulose PR
 currently NPO,
   and unable to place NGT.
   - Empiric tx with abx for possible infectious source as above
   - Consider head CT to evaluate for bleeding if mental status worsens
   - Hold sedating meds
   # Metastatic prostate cancer: defer to primary onc team
   .
   # ARF: Now resolved. Was likely pre-renal due to hypotension and
   tacchycardia.
   # Elevated liver function tests: Likely due to mets, hypotension.
   Improving.
   - Continue to trend
   - Consider lactulose PR if mental status worsens, as above
   # Radiation cystitis: Frank hematuria x2 weeks
   - If clots or not flushing, need to call urology
 already involved
   - Continue cbi
   - cont oxybutinin (may need to hold for mental status changes)
   - cont urojet
   # OSA: cpap at night
   # Chronic pain: Hold sedating pain medications at this time. Will need
   to monitor for withdrawl and maybe with improvement in blood pressure
   can restart renally dosed methadone. Will cont gabapentin.
   # H/O DVT/PE: not anticoagulation candidate, has IVC filter which was
   placed [**2168**].
   # Depression: cont citalopram
   # FEN:  IVF bolus to keep MAP> 65, replete lytes prn, npo for now given
   mental status
   # Access : PICC- d/c once get central access, central access
   # PPx: protonix, pneumoboots
   # Code:  full, confirmed with his oncologist
   # Dispo:  ICU level of care for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer. He presents with hypotension, tachycardia, acute renal failure, worsening anemia, and liver function tests. The patient's anemia is unclear in source, with abnormal hemolysis labs but normal coagulation studies. No schistocytes were seen on the smear, indicating no disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Sequestration is possible but no spleen enlargement was appreciated on physical examination. The patient has also been experiencing mild asterixis, indicating hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's hypotension and tachycardia are likely due to hypovolemia from blood loss and poor oral intake. There is a possibility of infection, particularly urinary tract infection given frequent manipulation. Other potential causes include cardiac issues, although no EKG changes were noted. The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is not on systemic anticoagulation due to bleeding.

The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, likely pre-renal due to hypotension and tachycardia. The elevated liver function tests are likely due to metastases, hypotension, and possible hepatic encephalopathy. Radiation cystitis has been present for two weeks, and the patient is already involved with urology. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 96% with CPAP at night. Chronic"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 52 year-old male with a history of metastatic
   prostate cancer who presents with hypotension, tacchycardia, acute
   renal failure and worsening anemia and liver function tests.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension/tacchycardia: likely due to hypovolemia from blood loss
   and poor po intake. Other possibility is infection with urine as most
   likely source given frequent manipulation. Other possibilities include
   cardiac although no ekg changes. Patient has no resp complaints but he
   does have h/o PE and is not on systemic anticoagulation due to
   bleeding.
   -give 2 u prbs, 1 u plts, 2 u ffp, 10 u IV vitamin K
   -repeat crit q6
   -obtain urine cx
   -obtain bld cx
   -obtain cxr
   -treat empirically with vanc and zosyn for possible urine source
   -IVF bolus to keep MAP > 65
   -CVL and A line for closer monitoring
   -consider CTA
   -complete romi
   .
   # AMS: likely due to hypotension, possibly infection, worsening liver
   function and kidney function on a number of sedating medications,
   possible hepatic encephalopathy. Also given low plts and elevated INR,
   could have bleed intracranially.
   -lactulose
   -empiric tx with abx for possible infectious source
   -treat hypovolemia with blood, IVF
   -obtain head ct
   -hold sedating meds
   .
   # Metastatic prostate cancer: defer to primary onc team
   .
   # Anemia/thromboyctopenia: Likely secondary to metastatic prostate
   cancer. Given all counts are lower, this could be dilutional. Another
   possibility is DIC in setting of sepsis. No recent procedures.
   -check smear
   -check fibrinogen
   -transfuse to hct goal > 25
   -transfuse plts goal > 20 since pt bleeding
   -consider giving vitamin k although liver function is worsening
   -check hemolysis labs
   -monitor crits q6
   .
   # ARF: Likely pre-renal due to hypotension and tacchycardia.
   -recheck lytes in afternoon after hydration
   -monitor urine output
   -send urine lytes and eos
   -if no improvement in creatinine, obtain renal u/s
   -f/u urology reccs--> considering perc nephrostomy tubes
   .
   # Elevated liver function tests: likely due to liver mets and
   hypotension. Mostly direct.
   -obtain repeat RUQ us
   -check albumin
   -trend lfts
   -cont lactulose
   .
   # Radiation cystitis: Patient with frank hematuria on cbi x 2 weeks.
   -f/u urology reccs, if clots or not flushing, need to call them
   -cont cbi
   -cont oxybutinin (may need to hold for mental status changes)
   -cont urojet
   .
   # Stomach distension: seen on cxr yesterday, recommended decompression
   with ng tube which may be useful in giving meds as well. Will place.
   .
   # OSA: cpap at night
   .
   # Chronic pain: Given his somnolence and lethargy, will hold sedating
   pain medications at this time. Will need to monitor for withdrawl and
   maybe with improvement in blood pressure can restart renally dosed
   methadone. Will cont gabapentin.
   .
   # H/O DVT/PE: not anticoagulation candidate, has IVC filter which was
   placed [**2168**].

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer. He presented with hypotension, tachycardia, acute renal failure, worsening anemia, and liver function tests. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions including radiation cystitis, stomach distension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic pain, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), depression, and fluid electrolyte imbalance (FEN).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia could be due to hypovolemia from blood loss and poor oral intake. Infection is also a possibility, especially considering the frequent manipulation of the urinary catheter. Cardiac issues are less likely since there are no EKG changes. Possible interventions include transfusion of blood products, IV fluids, and empirical treatment for a possible urinary source infection.

2. Acute Mental Status Changes (AMS): The patient's altered mental status could be caused by hypotension, infection, worsening liver function, kidney function, sedating medications, or hepatic encephalopathy. It is important to treat hypovolemia, administer lactulose, provide empirical antibiotic therapy, obtain a head CT scan, and hold sedating medications.

3. Metastatic Prostate Cancer: This is a chronic condition that requires management by the"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer who
   presents with hypotension, tacchycardia, acute renal failure and
   worsening anemia and liver function tests.
   #. Anemia: Source unclear. Hemolysis labs abnormal, coags normal
   (although given vitamin K yesterday). No schistocytes seen on smear.
   Does not appear to be DIC given normal coags
 but with low fibrinogen,
   elevated FDP. Sequestration possible but no spleen enlargement
   appreciated on physical exam. [**Month (only) 60**] be drug-induced (ceftriaxone); this
   was discontinued prior to transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]. [**Doctor First Name 2674**] also possible ([**2-10**]
   malignancy?) though no schistocytes seen on peripheral smear.
   - Repeat peripheral smear
   - Coombs test
   - Consult hematology
   - CT scan of abdomen to assess for RP bleed
   - Q6 hour CBCs, coags
   - Transfuse to hct> 25, platelets>20; transfuse 1U platelets, 2U pRBCs
   - Recheck fibrinogen
   # Hypotension/tachycardia: Likely due to hypovolemia from blood loss
   and poor po intake. Improved overnight.
   Other possibility is infection with urine as most likely source given
   frequent manipulation. Other possibilities include cardiac although no
   ekg changes. Patient has no resp complaints but he does have h/o PE and
   is not on systemic anticoagulation due to bleeding.
   - Will give pRBCs, platelets as above
   - Closely monitor MAP, CVP
 will give IVF bolus as needed (goal
   MAP>65)
   - Urine, blood cultures with no growth at this point
   - Treat empirically with vanc and zosyn for possible urine source
   no indication of active infection at this time, will consider
   discontinuing antibiotics
   -CVL and A line for closer monitoring
   # AMS: Improved. Was likely due to hypotension, possibly infection,
   worsening liver function and kidney function on a number of sedating
   medications, possible hepatic encephalopathy.
   - if mental status worsens, will consider lactulose PR
 currently NPO,
   and unable to place NGT.
   - Empiric tx with abx for possible infectious source as above
   - Consider head CT to evaluate for bleeding if mental status worsens
   - Hold sedating meds
   # Metastatic prostate cancer: defer to primary onc team
   .
   # ARF: Now resolved. Was likely pre-renal due to hypotension and
   tacchycardia.
   # Elevated liver function tests: Likely due to mets, hypotension.
   Improving.
   - Continue to trend
   - Consider lactulose PR if mental status worsens, as above
   # Radiation cystitis: Frank hematuria x2 weeks
   - If clots or not flushing, need to call urology
 already involved
   - Continue cbi
   - cont oxybutinin (may need to hold for mental status changes)
   - cont urojet
   # OSA: cpap at night
   # Chronic pain: Hold sedating pain medications at this time. Will need
   to monitor for withdrawl and maybe with improvement in blood pressure
   can restart renally dosed methadone. Will cont gabapentin.
   # H/O DVT/PE: not anticoagulation candidate, has IVC filter which was
   placed [**2168**].
   # Depression: cont citalopram
   # FEN:  IVF bolus to keep MAP> 65, replete lytes prn, npo for now given
   mental status
   # Access : PICC- d/c once get central access, central access
   # PPx: protonix, pneumoboots
   # Code:  full, confirmed with his oncologist

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer. He presents with hypotension, tachycardia, acute renal failure, worsening anemia, and liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, indicating worsening anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of the anemia. Drug-induced hemolysis should be considered, as well as the possibility of malignancy-related bone marrow suppression.

2. Hypotension and Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure (hypotension) and an elevated heart rate (tachycardia). This combination may indicate hypovolemia due to blood loss or poor oral intake. Infection is also a possible cause, especially considering frequent urinary catheter manipulation. Other possibilities include cardiac dysfunction, although there are no EKG changes noted.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. This may be pre-renal in origin due to hypotension and tachycardia. It is important to monitor fluid balance and kidney function closely.

4. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, suggesting liver dysfunction. This could be due to metastatic disease, hypotension, or medication-related hepatotoxicity.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer, presenting with hypotension, tachycardia, acute renal failure, worsening anemia, and liver function tests. The patient has received blood transfusions and platelet transfusions but continues to have persistent anemia and thrombocytopenia. There are no signs of bleeding on CT abdomen/pelvis. The patient's coagulation studies are normal, but there is evidence of hemolysis with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The patient's peripheral smear does not show schistocytes, suggesting that disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is unlikely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The source of anemia is still unclear. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.
3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating potential liver dysfunction. Further evaluation and management are required.
4. Hemolysis: The presence of hemolysis suggests a possible hemolytic process. Additional testing, such as the Coombs test, is needed to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.
5. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's low blood pressure and high heart"

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer presenting with hypotension, tachycardia, acute renal failure, and worsening anemia and liver function tests. The patient has been diagnosed with radiation cystitis, which is causing frank hematuria for the past two weeks. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. The source of the anemia is unclear, and further investigations such as Coombs test and repeat peripheral smear with schistocytes are pending. Sequestration or drug-induced hemolysis are possible causes, but no spleen enlargement or schistocytes were seen on the smear.

2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing hypotension and tachycardia, likely due to hypovolemia from blood loss and poor oral intake. Close monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) is recommended, with the administration of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and intravenous fluids (IVF) as needed to maintain MAP >65.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient previously had acute renal failure, which was likely pre-renal due to hypotension and tachycardia. Now resolved, it should be closely monitored.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer who
   presents with hypotension, tacchycardia, acute renal failure and
   worsening anemia and liver function tests.
   #. Anemia: Source still unclear.
   * CT abdomen/pelvis without any bleeding source.
   * Hemolysis labs abnormal, coags normal (although given vitamin K
   yesterday). No schistocytes seen on smear. Does not appear to be DIC
   given normal coags
 but with low fibrinogen, elevated FDP.
   Sequestration possible but no spleen enlargement appreciated on
   physical exam.
   * [**Month (only) 60**] be drug-induced (ceftriaxone); this was discontinued prior to
   transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]. [**Doctor First Name 2674**] also possible ([**2-10**] malignancy?); repeat
   peripheral smear with schistocytes
   * Coombs test negative
   - Need to establish plan with urology and oncology
 given that patient
   has considerably blood loss in urine, may urologic procedure for
   correction - ?formalin injection?
   - Q8 hour CBCs, coags
 consider prophylactic blood transfusions
   - Transfuse to hct> 25, platelets>30
   - Recheck fibrinogen daily
   # Hypotension/tachycardia: Likely due to hypovolemia from blood loss
   and poor po intake. CVP 3-13 overnight. Infection unlikely
 afebrile,
   no positive cultures.
   - pRBCs, IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65
   - Closely monitor MAP, CVP

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer. He presents with hypotension, tachycardia, acute renal failure, worsening anemia, and liver function tests. The patient has been given blood transfusions, and his hemoglobin concentration has increased from 26.6% to 27.0%. Coombs test results are negative. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/52 mmHg to 112/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Anemia: The source of anemia is still unclear. Hemolysis labs are abnormal, coagulation tests are normal, and no schistocytes are seen on the smear. Sequestration is possible but no spleen enlargement is appreciated on physical exam. Drug-induced anemia due to ceftriaxone has been ruled out. Malignancy may be a possible cause, but no schistocytes are seen on the peripheral smear. A repeat peripheral"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer, presenting with hypotension, tachycardia, acute renal failure, worsening anemia, and liver function tests. The patient received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 1 unit of platelets. He has been diagnosed with radiation cystitis and will undergo a formalin injection today. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he continues to have diffuse purpura and jaundice. His lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal coagulation profiles.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. The source of anemia is unclear, but it may be related to bleeding secondary to radiation cystitis and decreased production due to metastasis to the bone. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Hemolysis: The patient's lab results indicate positive hemolysis labs, suggesting a possible hemolytic process. However, no schistocytes were seen on the smear, and the coagulation profile is normal, ruling out disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Sequestration is also unlikely without spleen enlargement. The cause of hemolysis needs further evaluation.

3. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's hypotension and tachyc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer. He presents with hypotension, tachycardia, acute renal failure, worsening anemia, and liver function tests. The patient has been transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 1 unit of platelets. He is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors including anemia, radiation cystitis, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, depression, and malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. It is important to determine the cause of anemia and continue blood transfusions as needed to maintain an adequate hematocrit level.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, which may be due to hypotension and blood loss. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary. The patient's urine output should be carefully recorded and maintained.

3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, which could be related to his underlying malignancy, hypotension, or sepsis. Monitoring of liver enzymes and bilirubin levels is important.

4. Radiation Cystitis: The patient has a history of radiation cystitis, which is causing frank hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer. He presents with hypotension, tachycardia, acute renal failure, and worsening anemia and liver function tests. The patient has been diagnosed with radiation cystitis and is scheduled to receive a formalin injection today. He also has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and requires CPAP at night.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to bleeding secondary to radiation cystitis and decreased production secondary to metastasis to the bone. Further investigation is needed to identify the exact source of bleeding.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF was likely pre-renal due to hypotension and tachycardia. It has since resolved.
3. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia are likely due to hypovolemia from blood loss. Close monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) is necessary.
4. Elevated Liver Function Tests: The elevated liver function tests are likely due to metastasis, hypotension, and possibly infection. Trending of liver enzymes and considering lactulose if mental status worsens are recommended.
5. Radiation Cystitis: The patient has radiation cystitis, which is causing frank hematuria. A formalin injection will be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer. He presents with hypotension, tachycardia, acute renal failure, worsening anemia, and liver function tests. The patient underwent a urology procedure and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and one unit of platelets prior to the procedure. His hematocrit level is currently stable overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to radiation cystitis. It has improved following the urology procedure. However, close monitoring of the patient's hematocrit levels is necessary, and transfusion may be required if the hematocrit falls below 25.
2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia are likely due to hypovolemia from blood loss. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of further blood loss, and appropriate interventions such as transfusion of pRBCs and intravenous fluids should be considered to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
3. Metastatic Prostate Cancer: The patient's metastatic prostate cancer should be managed in consultation with the primary oncology team.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure was likely pre-renal due to hypotension and tachycardia. With the resolution"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer and ongoing gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from radiation cystitis. He underwent a urologic procedure for the improvement of bleeding and is currently stable. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (109 bpm) and low blood pressure (92/58 mmHg). His respiratory rate is within normal range (21 breaths per minute) and oxygen saturation is 96%. The patient's laboratory results indicate low white blood cell count (2.1 K/uL), low hemoglobin level (11.5 g/dL), slightly elevated platelet count (78 K/uL), and normal kidney function. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal due to metastatic prostate cancer to the liver. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient has a history of ongoing GI bleed related to chronic radiation cystitis. Although he underwent a urologic procedure for control of bladder bleeding, there is still a risk of further bleeding.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating possible hypotension. This could be due to fluid loss or the effects of the cancer.
3. Infection: The patient's low white blood cell count may indicate an increased risk of infection.
4. Pain management: The patient is experiencing pain, and there is a need for effective pain management without exacerbating his tachycardia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer and ongoing gastrointestinal (GI) bleed due to radiation cystitis. He underwent a urologic procedure for the improvement of bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/58 mmHg to 108/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg. Fluid balance reveals a total input of 2,388 mL and a total output of 1,450 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 938 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen but not on mechanical ventilation. 

Lab results indicate normal white blood cell (WBC) count, hematocrit (Hct), and platelet (Plt) levels, but elevated creatinine (Cr), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), liver enzymes alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg++). 

Assessment and plan include management of ongoing GI bleed related to chronic radiation cystitis"
