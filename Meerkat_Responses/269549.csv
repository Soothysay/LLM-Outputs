","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), gout, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with acute onset fevers, rigors, pain and erythema in the right thumb and index finger, generalized swelling of the hand, and positive blood cultures for Gram-positive cocci in clusters. The initial assessment suggests possible cellulitis of the hand and septic shock. The patient's blood pressure is within the normal range at baseline but has dropped to the 70s during hemodialysis (HD) in the past, causing symptoms. The patient remains asymptomatic in the ICU. The patient's current medications include various antibiotics, analgesics, and medications for ESRD such as Epogen, Nephrocaps, sevelamer, and ASA. The patient's recent lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, PT/PTT/INR, lactic acid, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cellulitis: The patient has signs and symptoms suggestive of cellulitis, including erythema, generalized swelling, and positive blood cultures. If left untreated or improperly managed, it could lead to worsening infection, spread of infection to deeper tissues, sepsis, and potentially amputation of the affected limb.

2. Septic shock: The patient's positive blood cultures and hypotension suggest"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), gout, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presented with acute onset fevers, rigors, right thumb and index finger pain and erythema, which are concerning for hand cellulitis. Blood cultures drawn at another hospital were positive for Gram-positive cocci in clusters.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin (VANC), ceftriaxone (CTX), and clindamycin. He is also receiving fluids intravenously and has a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/66 to 132/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased potassium and calcium levels. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are significantly elevated.

The assessment and plan include treating the suspected hand cellulitis with antibiotics, evaluating for acute gout flare, managing hypotension likely due to septic shock, addressing end-stage renal disease, and monitoring for complications of peritoneal dialysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), presenting with acute onset fevers, rigors, right thumb and index finger pain and erythema, generalized swelling of the hand, and positive blood cultures for Gram-positive cocci in clusters. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/66 to 132/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving vasopressor support with norepinephrine. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactic acid levels, along with low platelet count and potassium levels. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin for suspected sepsis secondary to cellulitis, and toradol for gout flare. The patient's medical history includes ESRD, gout, hypotension, CAD, and FEN. The patient's current disposition is pending clinical improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fevers, rigors, and positive blood cultures suggests a potential sepsis. Prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics is crucial to prevent further complications.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), gout, and chronic atrial fibrillation. He presented with acute onset fevers, rigors, right thumb and index finger pain, and erythema. Physical examination revealed generalized swelling of the hand, concerning for cellulitis. Blood cultures were positive for Gram-positive cocci in clusters. The patient has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cellulitis: The patient's symptoms and positive blood cultures suggest a bacterial infection, specifically cellulitis. This condition can progress to a severe infection if not properly managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates potential hypotension, which may be related to septic shock secondary to the underlying infection.
3. Gout flare: The patient's clinical presentation initially suggested a gout flare; however, it is less likely given the positive blood cultures from another hospital.
4. ESRD: The patient's chronic kidney disease requires ongoing management and attention to fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and medication dosing.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has open skin blisters over his tibias, increasing the risk of further infections.

   # hand cellulitis
 Erythema, generalized swelling concerning for
   cellulitis.  Plastics did not feel that there is any evidence of flexor
   sheath involvement.  Blood cultures drawn at [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital positive
   for GPC in clusters.
   - continue vanc (has to be dosed daily based on level), will d/c CTX

   - f/u Plastics recs
   - will discuss with PCP regarding pulling HD line as most likely seeded
   with GPC
   # gout
 Per Plastics, the joint exam is suspicious for acute gout
   flare.  Now thought to be less likely in the setting of positive BCx
   from OSH.  Patient received toradol 15 mg x 1 yesterday.
   - holding colchicine
   # hypotension
 Likely [**2-12**] septic shock.  Of note, patient
s SBP is
   85-95 at baseline.  Patient does state that in the past, his SBP had
   dropped to the 70s during HD, during which he becomes symptomatic.
   Patient remains asymptomatic thus far in the ICU. Patient does not have
   a cap for his PD catheter, so it is not aseptic. He also has open skin
   blisters over tibias.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), presenting with acute onset fevers, rigors, right thumb and index finger pain, and erythema. The patient also has generalized swelling of the hand, which is concerning for cellulitis. Blood cultures drawn at [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital were positive for Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in clusters.

The assessment and plan include the following:
- Continue vancomycin (Vanc) and discontinue ceftriaxone and clindamycin due to positive blood cultures for GPC.
- Follow up with the physician's office to obtain speciation and sensitivities of the blood cultures.
- Repeat blood cultures.
- Reassess clinically for improvement.
- Follow up with plastics regarding their recommendations.
- Discuss with primary care physician (PCP) regarding pulling the hemodialysis (HD) line as it is likely seeded with GPC.
- The patient may have hypotension due to septic shock, but he remains asymptomatic in the ICU.
- Wean pressors as tolerated.
- Antibiotics for the treatment of underlying infection.
- IV fluids as needed.
- The patient has ESRD and is on PD.
- Follow up with renal records, specifically regarding the question of whether to pull the HD line.
- Figure out PO to IV conversion of Zemplar"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis, who presented with acute onset fevers, rigors, and pain and erythema in the right thumb and index finger. He was diagnosed with bacteremia and cellulitis, most likely caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). He is currently being treated with vancomycin monotherapy for four days, and it is being considered to switch to intravenous nafcillin. The patient's gout flare has been ruled out, and he is receiving colchicine for his symptoms. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, which is believed to be due to septic shock. His blood pressure is usually around 85-95 mmHg but drops to the 70s during hemodialysis sessions, causing symptoms. The patient is on peritoneal dialysis and has open skin blisters over his tibias. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). His medications include ASA, simvastatin, Epogen, Nephrocaps, sevelamer, and enalapril. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is estimated to be 25-30%. His diet is heart-healthy, and he is scheduled for follow-up visits."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), gout, and several other comorbidities. The patient presented with acute onset fevers, rigors, pain, and erythema in the right thumb and index finger. Blood cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), indicating bacteremia and cellulitis. The patient has been treated with vancomycin monotherapy for four days and is now being considered for switching to intravenous nafcillin. 

The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and lactate acid levels. The blood culture sensitivity results indicate that the MSSA strain is sensitive to oxacillin. 

The patient also has a history of gout, but it is currently less likely due to the positive blood cultures from another source. The patient has been given toradol for pain management.

There are concerns about hypotension, which may be related to septic shock. The patient's baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) is 85-95, but it drops to the 70s during hemodialysis (HD). The patient is currently asymptomatic in the ICU, and his blood pressure is stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo M h/o ESRD on PD, gout p/w acute onset fevers, rigors, R thumb
   and index finger pain and erythema
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis.  Baseline BP reportedly 80-90
   mmHg.  Continue vasopressor, hold anti-HTN meds.  Plan run PD net even.
   # hand cellulitis
 Erythema, generalized swelling concerning for
   cellulitis.  Plastics did not feel that there is any evidence of flexor
   sheath involvement.  Blood cultures drawn at [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital positive
   for GPC in clusters.
   - continue vanc (has to be dosed daily based on level), will d/c CTX
   and clindamycin given cx show GPC
   - f/u BCx from [**Hospital3 33**] to obtain speciation, sensitivities
   - f/u repeat BCx
   - reassess clinically for improvement
   - f/u Plastics recs
   - will discuss with PCP regarding pulling HD line as most likely seeded
   with GPC
   BACTEREMIA -- staph aureus.  Portal of entry possibly related to
   central line (dialysis catheter --> no removed), PD catheter, skin
   breakdown (pretibial region).
   RiGHT FINGER SWELLING/TENDERNESS -- likely acute Gout. Colchicine.

 Per Plastics, the joint exam is suspicious for acute gout flare.
   Now thought to be less likely in the setting of positive BCx from OSH.
   Patient received toradol 15 mg x 1 yesterday.
   - holding colchicine
   # hypotension
 Likely [**2-12**] septic shock.  Of note, patient
s SBP is
   85-95 at baseline.  Patient does state that in the past, his SBP had
   dropped to the 70s during HD, during which he becomes symptomatic.
   Patient remains asymptomatic thus far in the ICU. Patient does not have
   a cap for his PD catheter, so it is not aseptic. He also has open skin
   blisters over tibias.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - abx for treatment of underlying infection (see above)
   - IVF PRN
   # ESRD
 On PD.
   - f/u renal recs, specific question ? can we pull the HD line ?
   - figure out PO to IV Zemplar conversion (only appears to be available
   on formulary as IV here)
   - continue Epogen
   - continue Nephrocaps
   - continue sevelamer
   - holding enalapril
   # CAD
 Continue ASA, simvastatin.  Currently unclear given our current
   data whether patient has a history of CHF.
   - obtain OSH records from PCP regarding recent echo data, CHF history,
   etc.
   - holding enalapril

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), presenting with acute onset fevers, rigors, right thumb and index finger pain, and erythema. The patient has hypotension attributed to sepsis and a history of ESRD. He also has cellulitis in his hand, bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus, and possible sources including a dialysis catheter, PD catheter, or skin breakdown. There is suspicion of acute gout flare in the right finger. The patient's blood pressure is maintained with vasopressors, and he is on antibiotics for the underlying infection. He is also being treated for ESRD, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hyperlipidemia (FEN). The patient's current condition is critical, and he is pending clinical improvement in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension attributed to sepsis, indicating a systemic infection that can lead to organ dysfunction.
2. Cellulitis: The patient has erythema and generalized swelling in his hand, concerning for cellulitis, which is a bacterial infection of the skin.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus, indicating the presence of bacteria in his bloodstream.
4. Acute Gout Flare: The patient may have an acute gout"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), gout, and now Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is critically ill.

The patient's chief complaint is hypotension, which is attributed to sepsis. He has a baseline blood pressure of 80-90 mmHg and is being treated with vasopressors to maintain blood pressure above 60 mmHg. Anti-hypertensive medications are held.

The patient has right hand cellulitis, with erythema and generalized swelling. Blood cultures drawn at another hospital were positive for Gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting GPC bacteremia. The source of infection is possibly related to the central line (dialysis catheter), PD catheter, or skin breakdown in the pretibial region. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and will have colchicine for acute gout.

The patient also has ESRD and is continuing with PD. Fluid balance is being maintained to prevent fluid overload. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is being treated with aspirin and simvastatin. A trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is planned to evaluate valvular lesions. The patient is on a heart-healthy diet.

 Likely [**2-12**] septic shock.  Of note, patient
s SBP is
   85-95 at baseline.  Patient does state that in the past, his SBP had
   dropped to the 70s during HD, during which he becomes symptomatic.
   Patient remains asymptomatic thus far in the ICU. Patient does not have
   a cap for his PD catheter, so it is not aseptic. He also has open skin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), gout, and other comorbidities. The patient presented with acute onset fevers, rigors, right thumb and index finger pain, and erythema. Blood cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) on admission. The patient was initially treated with vancomycin but was switched to nafcillin due to the identification of MSSA. 

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 86/47 mmHg, indicating possible septic shock. The patient's heart rate is 93 bpm, respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 16 mmHg, indicating fluid overload. The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 836 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 280 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 12.3 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 8.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 156 mg/dL, and potassium (K+) level of 4.4 mEq/L. The platelet count (Plt)"

   # gout
 Per Plastics, the joint exam is suspicious for acute gout
   flare.  Now thought to be less likely in the setting of positive BCx
   from OSH.  Patient received toradol 15 mg x 1, colchicine 0.6 mg x 1
   thus far. Colchicine is not cleared by PD
 will need to monitor.
   - continue to monitor
   # hypotension
 Likely [**2-12**] septic shock.  Of note, patient
s SBP is
   85-95 at baseline.  Patient does state that in the past, his SBP had
   dropped to the 70s during HD, during which he becomes symptomatic.
   Patient remains asymptomatic thus far in the ICU. Patient does not have
   a cap for his PD catheter, so it is not aseptic. He also has open skin
   blisters over tibias.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), gout, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presented with acute onset fevers, rigors, right thumb and index finger pain, and erythema. Laboratory tests revealed bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and the patient had positive blood cultures. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he requires pressor support. He is receiving antibiotics, specifically nafcillin, and colchicine for gout. 

The patient has several potential medical complications. Firstly, there is concern for cellulitis of the right thumb and index finger, which may require further evaluation and treatment. Secondly, the patient has hypotension that is likely due to septic shock. Thirdly, there are concerns about his ESRD management, including fluid balance, electrolyte disturbances, and medication adjustments. Lastly, the patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of his infections, fluid balance, electrolytes, and other underlying medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yom h/o ESRD on PD, gout now with Staph aureus bacteremia.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis.  Baseline BP reportedly 80-90
   mmHg.  Continue vasopressor, hold anti-HTN meds.  Plan check cortisol
   level --> would consider cotrosyn stimulation test.  Plan run PD net
   even.
   RIGHT HAND CELLULITIS
 Erythema, generalized swelling initially
   concerning for cellulitis --> improved.  Plastics Surgery did not feel
   that there is any evidence of flexor sheath involvement.  Blood
   cultures drawn at [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital positive for Staph aureus --> now
   on Nafcillin.  Monitor vancomycin levels  (has to be dosed daily based
   on level).  Imaging to be arranged either [**Hospital1 5**] or [**Hospital3 33**].  Hand
   Surgery to reassess in context of bacteremia.
   BACTEREMIA -- staph aureus.  Portal of entry possibly related to
   central line (dialysis catheter --> no removed), PD catheter, skin
   breakdown (pretibial region).  ID consultation obtained -->
   recommendations in progress.
   RiGHT FINGER SWELLING/TENDERNESS -- likely component of acute Gout.
   Colchicine use cautiously.
   ESRD
 Continue PD.  Maintain net even fluid balance.
   FLUIDS
 With hypotension & vasopressor dependence, maintain net even
   fluid balance, may require iv fluid boluses.
   CAD
 Continue ASA, simvastatin.  Plan TTE for evalution of valvular
   lesions.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be attributed to sepsis. The patient is currently on vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a confirmed Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. This can lead to systemic infection and further complications if not treated appropriately.

3. Right hand cellulitis: The patient initially presented with erythema and generalized swelling in the right hand, which was concerning for cellulitis. Although the condition has improved, it is important to monitor for any worsening or new developments.

4. Acute gout: The patient's right finger swelling and tenderness could be a component of acute gout. Colchicine is being used cautiously to manage this condition.

5. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient has ESRD and is on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Fluid balance needs to be closely monitored to avoid complications related to fluid overload or underload.

6. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient's bacteremia could potentially be related to a central line, specifically the dialysis catheter. It is important to assess and manage the central line appropriately.

7. Cardiovascular disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is on medication for it. Regular evaluation and management of CAD is essential to prevent further"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yom h/o ESRD on PD, gout now with Staph aureus bacteremia.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis.  Baseline BP reportedly 80-90
   mmHg.  Continue vasopressor, hold anti-HTN meds.  Plan check cortisol
   level --> would consider cotrosyn stimulation test.  Plan run PD net
   even.
   RIGHT HAND CELLULITIS
 Erythema, generalized swelling initially
   concerning for cellulitis --> improved.  Plastics Surgery did not feel
   that there is any evidence of flexor sheath involvement.  Blood
   cultures drawn at [**Hospital3 33**] Hospital positive for Staph aureus --> now
   on Nafcillin.  Monitor vancomycin levels  (has to be dosed daily based
   on level).  Imaging to be arranged either [**Hospital1 5**] or [**Hospital3 33**].  Hand
   Surgery to reassess in context of bacteremia.
   BACTEREMIA -- staph aureus.  Portal of entry possibly related to
   central line (dialysis catheter --> no removed), PD catheter, skin
   breakdown (pretibial region).  ID consultation obtained -->
   recommendations in progress.
   RiGHT FINGER SWELLING/TENDERNESS -- likely component of acute Gout.
   Colchicine use cautiously.
   NSVT
 no apparent electrolyte disturbance.  attributed to
   toxic-metabolic insult (sepsis) on background of cardiomyopathy and
   concurrent use of vasopressor.  Also consider endocardial infection
   would check echo if recurrs, assess for perivalvular abscess.
   ESRD
 Continue PD.  Maintain net even fluid balance.
   FLUIDS
 With hypotension & vasopressor dependence, maintain net even
   fluid balance, may require iv fluid boluses.
   CAD
 Continue ASA, simvastatin.  Plan TTE for evalution of valvular
   lesions.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), gout, and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. The patient is currently experiencing hypotension attributed to sepsis and has a baseline blood pressure of 80-90 mmHg. Vasopressor support is being continued, and anti-hypertensive medications have been held.

The patient also has right hand cellulitis, which initially concerned for cellulitis but has improved. Blood cultures drawn at a previous hospital were positive for Staph aureus, and the patient is now on nafcillin. Vancomycin levels will be monitored daily due to its dosage being based on levels. Imaging will be arranged either at Hospital 1 or Hospital 3, and Hand Surgery will reassess in the context of bacteremia.

Additionally, the patient has bacteremia with Staph aureus, with possible portals of entry including the central line (dialysis catheter), PD catheter, and skin breakdown (pretibial region). An Infectious Disease consultation has been obtained, and recommendations are in progress.

The patient also exhibits right finger swelling and tenderness, likely a component of acute gout. Colchicine use will be done cautiously. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) has occurred, with no apparent electrolyte disturbance. It is attributed"

   80 yo M h/o ESRD on PD, gout p/w acute onset fevers, rigors, R thumb
   and index finger pain and erythema
   .
   # bacteremia, cellulitis
 Erythema, generalized swelling concerning
   for cellulitis.  Plastics did not feel that there is any evidence of
   flexor sheath involvement.  BCx here positive for MSSA on admission. HD
   line removed and positive for MSSA.
   - switched to nafcillin (D6) from vancomycin
   - f/u ID recs
   - deferred CT abdomen for now as it appears that contrast load is not
   desired by this patient
s outpatient nephrologists; could get WBC scan
   if still indicated
   - US of former HD cath site to r/o clot (TEE if negative)
   - Hand Svc signed off
   # gout
 Per Plastics, the joint exam is suspicious for acute gout
   flare.  Now thought to be less likely in the setting of positive BCx
   from OSH.  Patient received toradol 15 mg x 1, colchicine 0.6 mg x 1
   thus far. Colchicine is not cleared by PD
 will need to monitor.
   - Rheum attempted to aspirate R index DIP but could not pull back
   fluid.  They agree that gout is most likely as opposed to septic
   arthritis.
   - consider prednisone 20 mg x 1 per Rheum recs
   - continue to monitor
   # hypotension
 Likely [**2-12**] septic shock.  Of note, patient
s SBP is
   85-95 at baseline.  Patient does state that in the past, his SBP had
   dropped to the 70s during HD, during which he becomes symptomatic.
   Patient remains asymptomatic thus far in the ICU. Patient does not have
   a cap for his PD catheter, so it is not aseptic. He also has open skin
   blisters over tibias. His BCx and Cath Tip Cx were both positive for
   MSSA.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   = bolus fluids if PD runs negative, worry about CHF
   - abx for treatment of underlying infection (see above)
   - IVF PRN
   - getting a random cortisol level
   # ESRD
 On PD. Recently started dual phosphate binding
   - figure out PO to IV Zemplar conversion (only appears to be available
   on formulary as IV here)
   - continue Epogen
   - continue Nephrocaps
   - continue sevelamer, alum ox - holding enalapril
   - f/u renal recs
   # CAD
 Continue ASA, simvastatin.
   - obtain OSH records from PCP regarding recent echo data, CHF history,
   etc.
   - holding enalapril
   # CHF
 Depressed LVSF (EF 25-30%); given patient history, likely
   unchanged from prior.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), gout, and other comorbidities such as coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- The patient presented with acute onset fevers, rigors, right thumb and index finger pain, and erythema, which raised concerns for bacteremia and cellulitis. Blood cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) on admission, and the central venous catheter was also infected with MSSA. The patient was switched from vancomycin to nafcillin.
- The patient's gout flare is less likely due to the positive blood cultures. Rheumatology attempted to aspirate the right index distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint but could not pull back fluid. They agree that gout is most likely and not septic arthritis.
- The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, possibly due to MSSA infection, given his low blood pressure and positive blood cultures. Pressors are being weaned as tolerated, and fluids are being given if PD runs negative to avoid congestive heart failure (CHF).
- The patient has ESRD and is on PD. He recently"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo M h/o ESRD on PD, gout p/w acute onset fevers, rigors, R thumb
   and index finger pain and erythema
   .
   # bacteremia, cellulitis
 Erythema, generalized swelling concerning
   for cellulitis.  Plastics did not feel that there is any evidence of
   flexor sheath involvement.  BCx here positive for MSSA on admission.
   - switched to nafcillin (D6) from vancomycin
   - ID recs: CT hand to r/o focal collection or joint effusion, CT
   abdomen to eval for inflammation/collections at AAA site, obtain
   records to see if patient has endovascular graft in situ, US of former
   HD cath site to r/o clot (TEE if negative), and podiatry consult to
   assess lower extremities
   - Hand Svc signed off
   - s/p removal of HD line; cath tip cultures pos for coag-pos Staph,
   speciation/sensitivities pending (expect MSSA)
   # gout
 Per Plastics, the joint exam is suspicious for acute gout
   flare.  Now thought to be less likely in the setting of positive BCx
   from OSH.  Patient received toradol 15 mg x 1, colchicine 0.6 mg x 1
   thus far. Colchicine is not cleared by PD
 will need to monitor.
   - continue to monitor
   # hypotension
 Likely [**2-12**] septic shock.  Of note, patient
s SBP is
   85-95 at baseline.  Patient does state that in the past, his SBP had
   dropped to the 70s during HD, during which he becomes symptomatic.
   Patient remains asymptomatic thus far in the ICU. Patient does not have
   a cap for his PD catheter, so it is not aseptic. He also has open skin
   blisters over tibias.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - abx for treatment of underlying infection (see above)
   - IVF PRN
   - getting a random cortisol level
   # ESRD
 On PD.
   - figure out PO to IV Zemplar conversion (only appears to be available
   on formulary as IV here)
   - continue Epogen

   - continue sevelamer, add alum ox as phosphate continues to be high
   - holding enalapril
   - f/u renal recs
   # CAD
 Continue ASA, simvastatin.
   - obtain OSH records from PCP regarding recent echo data, CHF history,

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis, presenting with acute onset fevers, rigors, erythema, and tenderness of the right thumb and index finger. The patient's blood cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and he was switched from vancomycin to nafcillin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding potential complications such as bacteremia, cellulitis, hypotension, gout, and septic shock. The assessment plan includes further imaging studies, consultation with plastics and podiatry, and monitoring of various parameters."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), presenting with acute onset fevers, rigors, right thumb and index finger pain, and erythema. The patient is suspected to have bacteremia and cellulitis. Blood cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) on admission and from the hemodynamic (HD) line.

The patient has been switched to nafcillin from vancomycin. Imaging studies are recommended to rule out focal collections or joint effusion in the hand, evaluate for inflammation or collections at the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) site, and assess the lower extremities. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TEE) is also suggested if there is no clot.

The patient's joint exam is suspicious for an acute gout flare. However, due to positive blood cultures from the outside hospital, this diagnosis is less likely. The patient has been given toradol and colchicine, but colchicine is not cleared by PD, so monitoring is necessary.

The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, ranging from 72-85 mmHg. This could be attributed to septic shock, especially considering the presence of MSSA in the blood cultures and catheter tip cultures. Pressors are being weaned as tolerated, and fluids are being given if PD"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), gout, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He is currently in the ICU due to hypotension attributed to sepsis. The patient has a positive blood culture for Staphylococcus aureus and is on nafcillin. He also has right hand cellulitis that has improved, but blood cultures drawn at another hospital were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Imaging is planned to assess for any involvement of the flexor sheath. The patient's right finger swelling and tenderness are likely related to acute gout. He is experiencing nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), which may be attributed to toxic-metabolic insult, underlying cardiomyopathy, and the use of vasopressor. The patient's ESRD will continue with PD, maintaining an even fluid balance. His CAD will be managed with aspirin and simvastatin, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be done to evaluate valvular lesions. The patient's nutritional support will involve a heart-healthy diet. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is attributed to sepsis, and he has a positive blood culture for Staphylococcus aureus. This indicates a bacterial infection that can"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), gout, and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. The patient is currently critically ill and admitted to the ICU.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, ranging from 80-90 mmHg. This is attributed to sepsis and the patient is being treated with vasopressors. It is recommended to continue the vasopressor support and hold antihypertensive medications.

2. Right Hand Cellulitis: The patient initially presented with erythema and generalized swelling of the right hand, which improved. Blood cultures drawn at another hospital were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is currently on Nafcillin and will be monitored for vancomycin levels. Imaging will be arranged to further assess the condition, and Hand Surgery will reassess in the context of bacteremia.

3. Bacteremia: The patient has Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, possibly due to a central line (dialysis catheter, which has been removed), PD catheter, or skin breakdown. An Infectious Disease consultation has been obtained, and recommendations are in progress.
