","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of acute left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, who has received 50% dose systemic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and local intrarterial tPA. She is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient has difficulty finding distal lower extremity (LE) pulses and had difficult arterial access during angiography. She also has aphasia and right-sided weakness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Complications: The patient may be at risk for further neurological complications such as increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, or hemorrhagic transformation due to the recent stroke and administration of tPA.
2. Respiratory Complications: Being intubated, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory infections. Adequate precautions like head of bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls should be taken to reduce the risk.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to maintain it within the desired range. The use of anti-hypertensive medications may need to be adjusted to allow for auto-regulation of cerebral blood flow.
4. Renal Complications: Close monitoring of renal function is important, especially considering the administration of contrast during angiography. Acute kidney injury (AKI) can occur due to decreased"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female admitted to the ICU with acute left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, who has received 50% dose systemic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and local intrarterial tPA. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with difficulty finding distal lower extremity (LE) pulses and difficult arterial access in angiography. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/48 to 159/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is 80.9 kg.

The patient has a history of aphasia and right-sided weakness. Allergies include penicillins, hydrochlorothiazide, and ibuprofen. Medications include metoprolol, hydralazine, and famotidine. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue, right-sided weakness, and difficulty finding distal LE pulses.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient received a total of 1,234 mL and 1,195 mL of intravenous fluids since 12 AM. Blood products totaling 1,120 mL and 330 mL were given. Urine output was 730 mL and 330 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume"
