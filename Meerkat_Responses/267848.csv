   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  She is
   growing GNRs in her blood from the OSH and GNR lactose fermenters in
   her urine (ecoli, klebsiella, enterobacter). She could have urosepsis
   or cholangitis with seeding of urine. On levo, ceftaz, flagyl which
   will cover most GI/uro sources.  Bili is not overwhelmingly elevated,
   calling cholangitis as the source into question, and her elevated LFTs
   could be from shock with initial hypotension.  However, her elevated
   pancreatic enzymes, while could be [**1-17**] shock, seem to more strongly
   indicate a biliary obstructive picture.  Given mental status and
   instrumentation, CNS source is possible, though GNRs in blood and urine
   make it a less likely source.  LP may be risky in patient with large
   meningiona with midline shift.  Must also keep in mind the possibility
   of her seeding her intracranial hardware when bacteremic.  WBC down to
   34 here.

   - ercp following and planning on ERCP in the AM
   - IVF and monitor hemodynamics
   - BCx, UCx, Sputum Cx
   - f/u OSH speciation and sensitivities
   .
   #. respiratory failure: was reportedly intubated for respiratory
   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  She is oxygenating
   well on PSV with minimal support.  Latest gas 7.44/27/95/19. Will
   likely be able to extubate after ERCP.
   - cont PSV at 15/5 for tonight
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - hold sedation and wean ventilation as tolerated following ERCP
   .
   #. CEs: Given low peak troponin and setting, likely is demand
   ischemia.  However, an event while hypotensive is possible.
   Heparinizing her would be risky at this time given upcoming ERCP,
   expecially with trop trending down.
   - ekg now
   - continue to follow
   .
   #. seizure disorder: There are notes indicated increased seizure
   acitivity in the weeks preceeding this event.  Her imaging is felt
   stable from [**2153**].  EEG did not show seizure.  She was initiated on
   keppra at [**Hospital3 140**].
   - continue keppra
   .
   #. Elevated INR: nutrition/vit K deficiency vs. underlying liver
   abnormality vs antibiotic effect.
   - follow
   .
   #. Meningioma: baseline per [**Hospital3 140**] radiology.
   .
   #. AMS: presumably related to infection, though seizure could have been
   involved.  Currently withdrawing all extremities.
   - wean sedation after ERCP and assess mental status.
   - consider involving neurosurg if persistant altered mental status,
   however would need high suspicion to tap shunt

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of meningioma and seizure disorder. She was admitted to the hospital on 2157-12-29 with sepsis. The note states that she is growing Gram-negative rods (GNRs) in her blood from the outside hospital (OSH) and GNR lactose fermenters in her urine, indicating possible urosepsis or cholangitis with seeding of urine.

The patient has been started on antibiotics to cover most GI/uro sources, including levo, ceftaz, and flagyl. The source of infection is uncertain, with cholangitis being questioned due to non-overwhelmingly elevated bilirubin levels and elevated liver enzymes possibly due to shock.

The patient's elevated pancreatic enzymes suggest a biliary obstructive picture, which may indicate a need for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). However, the presence of GNRs in both blood and urine makes a central nervous system (CNS) source less likely, although it cannot be completely ruled out due to the patient's mental status and instrumentation. A lumbar puncture (LP) may be risky given the patient's large meningioma with midline shift.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is expected to be extubated after the ERCP. The plan is to continue pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 15/5 for tonight and"

   A 7cm by 10FR plastic biliary stent was placed successfully with
   excellent drainage of dark, clear bile after it was placed.
   Recommendations: The findings of the ERCP are consistent with biliary
   obstruction, but not cholangitis. Her obstruction may be due to
   papillary stenosis or a periampullary lesion. This could first be
   evaluated with MRCP as an outpatient.
   She will need a repeat ERCP in [**3-21**] weeks for stent removal and possible

   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  She is
   growing GNRs in her blood from the OSH and GNR lactose fermenters in
   her urine (ecoli, klebsiella, enterobacter). She could have urosepsis
   or cholangitis with seeding of urine. On levo, ceftaz, flagyl which
   will cover most GI/uro sources.  Bili is not overwhelmingly elevated,
   calling cholangitis as the source into question, and her elevated LFTs
   could be from shock with initial hypotension.  However, her elevated
   pancreatic enzymes, while could be [**1-17**] shock, seem to more strongly
   indicate a biliary obstructive picture.  Given mental status and
   instrumentation, CNS source is possible, though GNRs in blood and urine
   make it a less likely source.  LP may be risky in patient with large
   meningiona with midline shift.  Must also keep in mind the possibility
   of her seeding her intracranial hardware when bacteremic.  WBC down to
   19.5.  Etiology appears most likely to be urine.
   - convert vanco/zosyn/flagyl -> cipro given pan-sensitive E. coli

   MICU ATTENDUING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Dr [**Known lastname 12663**] and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9827**]
s note and
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  I have also spoken with the
   pt
s daughter.
   The patient remains hemodynamically stable and her blood cultures show
   EColi and Klebsiella, only the EColi of which was also cultured in the
   urine.  Though the ERCP showed not evidence of cholangitis, it did show
   biliary obstruction to the extent a stent was placed.  This, along with
   elevated amylase and LFT
s make me believe her sepsis could be both
   biliary and urosepsis.  The plan is to convert antibiotics to Cipro
   which should cover both organisms.
   Her resp status is stable and if it weren
t for her obtundation, she
   be ready to extubate.  The main diff dx of her obtundation is anoxic
   encephalopathy, sedation from Keppra, electrical status, seeding of her
   VP shunt, etc.  If she
s no better in 24 hr I would pursue a vigorous
   neuro assessment.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of meningioma and seizure disorder. She presented to the hospital on December 29, 2157, with sepsis. The source of infection is suspected to be either urosepsis or cholangitis, with GNRs (Gram-negative rods) in her blood and urine, specifically E. coli and Klebsiella. She underwent an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) on December 31, which showed a biliary obstruction but no evidence of cholangitis. A biliary stent was placed. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and impaired skin integrity. She is receiving appropriate antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, and her vital signs are stable. The plan is to continue weaning off sedation and ventilation after the ERCP. Further evaluation and imaging may be necessary to determine the cause of her altered mental status and seizure disorder."

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished elderly individual admitted to the ICU with sepsis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, which revealed a periampullary diverticulum with a small opening and prominent major papilla. There were no signs of cholangitis or biliary obstruction. A sphincterotomy was performed, and a 7cm by 10FR plastic biliary stent was placed successfully. The findings suggest biliary obstruction due to papillary stenosis or a periampullary lesion. The patient also has respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not addressed or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or lung infections.

2. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's labs show imbalances in potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels. These imbalances can lead to various complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and kidney dysfunction.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is sedated and not fully assessed neurologically. There is a risk of further deterioration in mental status, which could be due to sepsis, medication effects, or other"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  She is
   growing GNRs in her blood from the OSH and GNR lactose fermenters in
   her urine (ecoli, klebsiella, enterobacter). She could have urosepsis
   or cholangitis with seeding of urine. On levo, ceftaz, flagyl which
   will cover most GI/uro sources.  Bili is not overwhelmingly elevated,
   calling cholangitis as the source into question, and her elevated LFTs
   could be from shock with initial hypotension.  However, her elevated
   pancreatic enzymes, while could be [**1-17**] shock, seem to more strongly
   indicate a biliary obstructive picture.  Given mental status and
   instrumentation, CNS source is possible, though GNRs in blood and urine
   make it a less likely source.  LP may be risky in patient with large
   meningiona with midline shift.  Must also keep in mind the possibility
   of her seeding her intracranial hardware when bacteremic.  WBC down to
   34 here.
   - cont vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - narrow abx as culture data and clinical status allows
   - ercp following and planning on ERCP in the AM
   - IVF and monitor hemodynamics
   - BCx, UCx, Sputum Cx
   - f/u OSH speciation and sensitivities
   .
   #. respiratory failure: was reportedly intubated for respiratory
   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  She is oxygenating
   well on PSV with minimal support.  Latest gas 7.44/27/95/19. Will
   likely be able to extubate after ERCP.
   - cont PSV at 15/5 for tonight
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - hold sedation and wean ventilation as tolerated following ERCP
   .
   #. CEs: Given low peak troponin and setting, likely is demand
   ischemia.  However, an event while hypotensive is possible.
   Heparinizing her would be risky at this time given upcoming ERCP,
   expecially with trop trending down.
   - ekg now
   - continue to follow
   .
   #. seizure disorder: There are notes indicated increased seizure
   acitivity in the weeks preceeding this event.  Her imaging is felt
   stable from [**2153**].  EEG did not show seizure.  She was initiated on
   keppra at [**Hospital3 140**].
   - continue keppra
   .
   #. Elevated INR: nutrition/vit K deficiency vs. underlying liver
   abnormality vs antibiotic effect.
   - follow
   .
   #. Meningioma: baseline per [**Hospital3 140**] radiology.
   .
   #. AMS: presumably related to infection, though seizure could have been
   involved.  Currently withdrawing all extremities.
   - wean sedation after ERCP and assess mental status.
   - consider involving neurosurg if persistant altered mental status,
   however would need high suspicion to tap shunt

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of meningioma and seizure disorder. She presented to the hospital with sepsis and is currently in the ICU. She underwent an ERCP procedure, which revealed a periampullary diverticulum but no evidence of cholangitis or biliary obstruction. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, electrolyte/fluid disorder, altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and impaired skin integrity. She is growing gram-negative rods in her blood and urine, indicating a possible source of infection. The patient's elevated liver enzymes and pancreatic enzymes suggest a biliary obstructive picture. She is being treated with antibiotics and will undergo another ERCP in three weeks for stent removal and possible sphincterotomy. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Weaning off sedation and extubation may be possible after the ERCP procedure.
2. Electrolyte/fluid disorder: The patient has imbalances in her electrolytes and fluids. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is required to prevent further complications.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to infection, medication effects, or other underlying causes. Monitoring her neurological status and adjusting sedation as appropriate is important."

   A single non-bleeding periampullary diverticulum with small opening was
   found at the major papilla.
   Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a sphincterotome

   A 7cm by 10FR plastic biliary stent was placed successfully with
   excellent drainage of dark, clear bile after it was placed.
   Recommendations: The findings of the ERCP are consistent with biliary
   obstruction, but not cholangitis. Her obstruction may be due to
   papillary stenosis or a periampullary lesion. This could first be
   evaluated with MRCP as an outpatient.
   She will need a repeat ERCP in [**3-21**] weeks for stent removal and possible

   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  She is
   growing GNRs in her blood from the OSH and GNR lactose fermenters in
   her urine (ecoli, klebsiella, enterobacter). She could have urosepsis
   or cholangitis with seeding of urine. On levo, ceftaz, flagyl which
   will cover most GI/uro sources.  Bili is not overwhelmingly elevated,
   calling cholangitis as the source into question, and her elevated LFTs
   could be from shock with initial hypotension.  However, her elevated
   pancreatic enzymes, while could be [**1-17**] shock, seem to more strongly
   indicate a biliary obstructive picture.  Given mental status and
   instrumentation, CNS source is possible, though GNRs in blood and urine
   make it a less likely source.  LP may be risky in patient with large
   meningiona with midline shift.  Must also keep in mind the possibility
   of her seeding her intracranial hardware when bacteremic.  WBC down to
   19.5.  Etiology appears most likely to be urine.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of meningioma and seizure disorder who presented to the hospital with sepsis. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to suspected biliary obstruction, which revealed a periampullary diverticulum with small opening at the major papilla. There were no signs of cholangitis or biliary obstruction. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis and respiratory failure, and there are concerns about possible urosepsis or cholangitis as sources of infection. The patient's mental status is altered, and she is currently sedated.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which can be caused by several factors such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or inability to protect the airway. Immediate intervention is required to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers or bedsores. This can be caused by prolonged immobility, poor nutrition, and inadequate skin care.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Dr [**Known lastname 12663**] and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided. I have also spoken with her daughter.  I have
   read Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 803**]
s note above and agree with her findings and plan of
   care.
   The patient has had a dramatic improvement in mentation and today is
   awake and following commands. We think this is likely due to stopping
   Keppra which had been newly started at MtAuburn.  She is back on her
   prior Tegretol.
   Her vent status was excellent on PSV 5/5 and low RSBI despite here
   effusions on CXR and exam. We thus elected to extubate her and so far
   she is doing well.  We will try to gradually diurese away her pleural
   effusions with IV lasix, aiming for .5 to 1 liter neg daily.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of meningioma and seizure disorder. She was admitted to the ICU with sepsis and is currently being treated for Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli bacteremia. The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, altered mental status, decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, and possible ischemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already being treated for sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. If not managed properly, sepsis can lead to organ failure and death.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and is on positive pressure ventilation due to respiratory failure. If the patient does not improve or if there are complications during weaning off the ventilator, there is a risk of prolonged respiratory failure or the need for tracheostomy.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved since discontinuing Keppra, but it is still unclear if the altered mental status is due to sepsis, medication side effects, or seizures. If the underlying cause is not addressed, the patient may continue to experience confusion or cognitive impairment.

4. Decreased hemoglobin and platelet count: The patient's hemoglobin and platelet count are low, which may be due to dilutional effects or"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of meningioma and seizure disorder who presented to the hospital with sepsis. She has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by Klebsiella and E. coli, and is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin. The patient is intubated for respiratory failure and has evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray. She also has altered mental status, which may be due to medication side effects or recent sepsis/hospitalization. Her hemoglobin and platelet levels are decreased, and she has an elevated INR. The patient is expected to undergo further evaluation and treatment, including a follow-up ERCP in three weeks.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Klebsiella bacteremia: Klebsiella is a type of bacteria that can cause infections in various parts of the body. In this case, it has led to bacteremia, which is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. This can be serious and may require aggressive treatment.
2. E. coli bacteremia: E. coli is another type of bacteria that can cause infections, including bacteremia. The patient's sensitivity to ciprofloxacin indicates that it is an effective treatment for E. coli infections.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may necessitate continued mechanical ventilation and close monitoring of her oxygenation and ventilation parameters.
4. Volume overload: The presence of pleural effusions on chest X"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  OSH
   cultures show 2 different organisms in blood, Klebsiella and E. coli,
   suggesting both urinary and biliary sources leading to bacteremia. All
   cx sensitive to cipro.
   - cont cipro given pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia and Klebsiella
   bacteremia resistant only to ampicillin, today day [**2-22**]
   - plan for f/u ERCP in [**3-21**] weeks for stent removal and possible
   sphincterotomy
   - IVF and monitor hemodynamics
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: was reportedly intubated for respiratory
   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  She is oxygenating
   well on PSV with minimal support.  Remained intubated [**1-17**] mental status
   which is now improved. Also has e/o volume overload on CXR with pleural
   effusions, but they are small.  Pt successfully extubated yesterday,
   nearly re-intubated overnight given copious secretions.
   - TBB goal (-) one to two liters, via lasix 10 mg IV PRN
   .
   # Altered mental status: ? keppra vs. seizure vs. recent
   sepsis/hospitalization.  Head CT stable, EEG neg. [**Name (NI) 12705**], pt improved
   significantly with D/C Keppra. Sepsis may have also contributed, as
   well as sedation in setting of elevated liver enzymes.  Patient
   continues to be somnolent with limited verbal communication.
   - switched keppra back to prior longstanding home regimen of tegretol,
   d/w pharm re: Keppra IV dosing equivalent to home tegretol
   - cont to have difficulty taking POs, will consider placement of NG
   tube today, as pt failed S/S today
   .
   #. Decreased HCT and PLT: may be dilutional since all lines decreased.
   Otherwise may be med-related given multiple abx tried over past few
   weeks.  Now stabilized.
   - trend daily
   - transfuse for Hct<21
   .
   #. CEs: Given low peak troponin and setting, likely is demand
   ischemia.  Trended down to normal.
   ..
   #. Elevated INR: nutrition/vit K deficiency vs. underlying liver
   abnormality vs antibiotic effect.  Resolved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of meningioma and seizure disorder. She presented to the hospital on 12/29/2157 with sepsis, likely from a urinary and biliary source. She was initially intubated for respiratory protection due to mental status changes. She remains intubated but has shown improvement in mental status. The patient successfully extubated yesterday but nearly required re-intubation overnight due to excessive secretions. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation and producing thick sputum, which is being suctioned. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics over the past few weeks, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has had episodes of respiratory distress, and her ability to clear secretions is a concern. She may require further respiratory support or interventions to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's fluid balance is a concern, with a positive fluid balance of 1,712 mL over the past 24 hours. There are also abnormalities in her sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels, indicating possible electrolyte imbalances.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient continues to have altered mental status, likely due to a combination of factors such as recent sepsis, medication"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  OSH
   cultures show 2 different organisms in blood, Klebsiella and E. coli,
   suggesting both urinary and biliary sources leading to bacteremia. All
   cx sensitive to cipro.
   - cont cipro given pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia and Klebsiella
   bacteremia resistant only to ampicillin, today day [**2-22**]
   - plan for f/u ERCP in [**3-21**] weeks for stent removal and possible
   sphincterotomy
   - IVF and monitor hemodynamics
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: was reportedly intubated for respiratory
   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  She is oxygenating
   well on PSV with minimal support.  Remained intubated [**1-17**] mental status
   which is now improved. Also has e/o volume overload on CXR with pleural
   effusions, but they are small.  Pt successfully extubated yesterday,
   nearly re-intubated overnight given copious secretions.
   - TBB goal (-) one liter, via lasix 10 mg IV PRN
   .
   # Altered mental status: ? keppra vs. seizure vs. recent
   sepsis/hospitalization.  Head CT stable, EEG neg. [**Name (NI) 12705**], pt improved
   significantly with D/C Keppra. Sepsis may have also contributed, as
   well as sedation in setting of elevated liver enzymes.  Patient
   continues to be somnolent with limited verbal communication.
   - switched keppra back to prior longstanding home regimen of tegretol
   - cont to have difficulty taking POs, will consider placement of NG
   tube today
   .
   #. Decreased HCT and PLT: may be dilutional since all lines decreased.
   Otherwise may be med-related given multiple abx tried over past few
   weeks.  Now stabilized.
   - trend daily
   - transfuse for Hct<21
   .
   #. CEs: Given low peak troponin and setting, likely is demand
   ischemia.  Trended down to normal.
   ..
   #. Elevated INR: nutrition/vit K deficiency vs. underlying liver
   abnormality vs antibiotic effect.  Resolved.
   .
   #. Meningioma: baseline per [**Hospital3 140**] radiology.

   Disposition:  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of meningioma and seizure disorder. She presented to the hospital with sepsis and was diagnosed with respiratory failure, electrolyte/fluid disorder, and altered mental status. The patient also has sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient's medical history includes a meningioma and seizure disorder, which may have contributed to her altered mental status. She presented with sepsis, likely due to cholangitis and urosepsis. The source of sepsis is still being evaluated.

The patient's respiratory failure was initially managed with invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated yesterday. However, she nearly required reintubation overnight due to copious secretions. The plan is to continue IVF and monitor hemodynamics.

The patient's altered mental status is still present, and it is unclear whether it is related to keppra (an anti-seizure medication), recent seizures, sepsis, or sedation. The EEG was negative, and the patient has shown significant improvement after discontinuing keppra and switching back to her longstanding home regimen of tegretol.

The patient's laboratory results indicate decreased hematocrit (HCT) and platelet (PLT) levels, which may be dilutional or medication-related. These levels are being trended daily, and transfusion is planned for HCT < 21.

There is a mention of cardiac enzymes (CE"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder due to a meningioma, currently experiencing respiratory distress and altered mental status. He was previously intubated but is now extubated and has copious respiratory secretions. He has a history of sepsis that responded to current management and bilateral pleural effusions attributed to resussitation fluids. The patient also has a history of seizures but no active seizures at present. He is being treated with Tegretol prior to admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory distress and copious secretions may increase the risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has responded to current management, there is still a risk of recurrence if infection persists or new infections occur.
3. Pleural effusions: The underlying bilateral pleural effusions may worsen or lead to complications such as infection or tension pneumothorax if not properly managed.
4. Medication side effects: The altered mental status could be attributed to medications, particularly the sedating component of Keptra.
5. Malnutrition: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and requires nutritional support, which can lead to malnutrition if not properly managed.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobilization and critical illness. Prophyl"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder, now presenting with respiratory distress, copious respiratory secretions, and altered mental status.
- The patient was extubated yesterday and remains extubated.
- The patient's respiratory distress has improved with vigorous suctioning.
- The patient has a history of meningioma and has experienced seizures in the past.
- The patient's sepsis responded to current management.
- The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which are attributed to resussitation fluids.
- The patient's altered mental status has improved.
- The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's recent extubation and presence of bilateral pleural effusions put him at risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection and respiratory worsening is necessary.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has responded to current management, ongoing monitoring for any signs of infection or systemic inflammatory response is essential to prevent recurrence.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's recent resussitation and fluid administration may lead to fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid balance and adjustment of fluid intake/output are crucial to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema.
4. Nutritional support: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and requires nutritional support. Enteral feeding should be initiated carefully to prevent aspiration"

   ADDENDUM:
   Patient
s daughter (HCP) states that she does not want patient to be
   reintubated in the event of respiratory decompensation.  She
   understands that patient may expire if intubation not pursued in the
   context of respiratory failure.  Patient
s daughter states this is
   consistent with patient
s previously expressed wishes.   Also, no CPR.
   Will respect these wishes.  In the event of respiratory decompensation,
   will then focus on patient comfort as primary goal.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder (meningioma) who is currently experiencing respiratory distress. She was extubated yesterday and remains with copious respiratory secretions, requiring frequent suctioning. Her mental status remains abnormal, with limited responses. The patient's recent medical history includes resolving sepsis and bilateral pleural effusions attributed to resuscitation fluids. She has been diagnosed with seizures and is being treated with tegretol. The patient's altered mental status is thought to be attributed to medications, possibly the sedating component of keppra. She is currently NPO and plans are in place to initiate tube feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient was extubated yesterday and has copious respiratory secretions, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Fluid overload - The patient has received resuscitation fluids, leading to the development of bilateral pleural effusions. This could lead to fluid overload and further respiratory distress.
3. Sepsis - Although the patient's sepsis has resolved, there is a risk of recurrence, especially if the urinary source of infection is not adequately treated.
4. Poor nutritional status - The patient is currently NPO and plans are in place to initiate tube feeding. Poor nutrition can lead to delayed wound healing, increased risk of infections, and overall poor recovery.
5. Medication side effects - The patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old individual with a history of seizure disorder (meningioma) who is currently experiencing respiratory distress. The patient was previously extubated but still requires frequent suctioning due to copious respiratory secretions. The patient's mental status remains abnormal, and their responses are limited. 

The patient has been diagnosed with resolving sepsis, attributed to a urinary source, which responded to current management. The patient also has underlying bilateral pleural effusions, likely caused by resuscitation fluids, and plans are in place to allow for net diuresis. 

The patient has a history of seizures related to meningioma and was previously treated with Tegretol prior to admission. 

The patient received resuscitation fluids and plans are in place to allow for net diuresis to return to baseline weight. The altered mental status has improved, and it is believed that this improvement can be attributed to medications, possibly including the sedating component of Keptra. 

The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and plans are in place to initiate total parenteral nutrition (TF) through an enteroflex tube placement. 

In terms of medical complications, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the recent extubation and presence of bilateral pleural effusions. Additionally, the patient may be at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  OSH
   cultures showed 2 different organisms in blood, Klebsiella and E. coli,
   suggesting both urinary and biliary sources leading to bacteremia. All
   cx sensitive to cipro. Repeat cx from here all neg. Slight increase WBC
   today may be concentration, no other sources of infection on CXR.
   - cont cipro given pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia and Klebsiella
   bacteremia resistant only to ampicillin, today day [**3-25**] (6 of abx total
   since blood cx turned negative)
   - plan for f/u ERCP in [**3-21**] weeks for stent removal and possible
   sphincterotomy
   - trend LFTs until normalized, trending down
   - trend CBC
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: was reportedly intubated for respiratory
   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  Pt now extubated
   however mental status still not back to baseline and having thick
   secretions with marginal airway protection. Secretions clear with cough
   and deep suctioning, however pt having difficulty clearing on own. Did
   not pass S&S however daughter does not want any tubes. Also has
   bilateral pleural effusions. Diuresing well with no bump in BUN/Cr yet.
   - TBB goal (-) one to two liters, via lasix 10 mg IV PRN
   - NPO for now, S&S to reassess as mental status clears
   .
   # Altered mental status: ? [**Date Range **] vs. seizure vs. recent
   sepsis/hospitalization.  Head CT stable, EEG neg. [**Name (NI) 12705**], pt improved
   significantly with D/C [**Name (NI) 5122**]. Sepsis may have also contributed, as
   well as sedation in setting of elevated liver enzymes.  Patient now
   more alert and more interactive, but with limited verbal communication.
   - off AEDS due to inability to take PO
s, however pt was apparently off
   meds for several weeks without seizures, will hold for now
   .
   #. CEs: Given low peak troponin and setting, likely is demand
   ischemia.  Trended down to normal.
   ..
   #. Elevated INR: nutrition/vit K deficiency vs. underlying liver
   abnormality vs antibiotic effect.  Resolved.
   .
   #. Meningioma: baseline per [**Hospital3 140**] radiology.

- Blood cultures showed two different organisms, suggesting both urinary and biliary sources leading to bacteremia.
- All cultures were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, but the E. coli bacteremia was also sensitive to ampicillin.
- The patient received continuous ciprofloxacin and her blood cultures turned negative.
- She is scheduled for an ERCP in three weeks for stent removal and possible sphincterotomy.
- Her liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down.
- She has respiratory failure, for which she was intubated, but is now extubated.
- She still has altered mental status and difficulty clearing secretions on her own.
- She has bilateral pleural effusions and is being diuresed with Lasix.
- She has a history of seizures and was off anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), but no seizures have been reported.
- Her troponin levels were elevated, but likely due to demand ischemia.

   #. Sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  OSH
   cultures showed 2 different organisms in blood, Klebsiella and E. coli,
   suggesting both urinary and biliary sources leading to bacteremia. All
   cx sensitive to cipro. Repeat cx from here all neg. Slight increase WBC
   today may be concentration vs. aspiration.
   - cont cipro given pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia and Klebsiella
   bacteremia resistant only to ampicillin, today day [**3-25**] (6 of abx

   #. Respiratory failure: was reportedly intubated for respiratory
   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  Pt now extubated
   however mental status still not back to baseline and having thick
   secretions with marginal airway protection. Secretions clear with cough
   and deep suctioning, however pt having difficulty clearing on own. Did
   not pass S&S however daughter does not want any tubes, will minimize
   aspiration as possible. Also has bilateral pleural effusions.

   significantly with D/C [**Name (NI) 5122**]. Sepsis may have also contributed, as
   well as sedation in setting of elevated liver enzymes.  Patient now
   alert and more interactive, but with limited verbal communication.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of meningioma and seizure disorder.
2. She presented to the hospital on December 29, 2157, with sepsis due to cholangitis or urosepsis.
3. Cultures showed two different organisms in the blood, suggesting both urinary and biliary sources leading to bacteremia.
4. The patient is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin for pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia and Klebsiella bacteremia resistant only to ampicillin.
5. An ERCP is planned in three weeks for stent removal and possible sphincterotomy.
6. Liver function tests are trending down and will be followed until they normalize.
7. A follow-up chest X-ray is also planned.
8. The patient was intubated for respiratory protection but has now been extubated.
9. She still experiences altered mental status and has difficulty clearing secretions on her own.
10. Pleural effusions are present, and the goal is to achieve a target breathlessness level of minus one to two liters using lasix 10 mg IV as needed.
11. The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to various factors such as an old seizure, recent sepsis/hospitalization, or medication-related sedation.
12. The patient is off AEDs due"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yof seizure disorder (meningioma), now with resolving sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- improved.  Attributed to sepsis and perhaps
   seizure (altered mental status).  Now with copious secretions.
   Underlying bilateral pleural effusions.  Monitor for evidence for VAP
   (extubated yesterday).  Maintain upright position, OOB if tolerates.
   SEPSIS -- attributed to urinary source.  Resolved, responded to current
   management.
   PLEURAL EFFUSIONS -- attributed to resussitation fluids.  Plan to allow
   net diuresis.
   HYPOKALEMIA
 replete to >4.0
   SEIZURES -- h/o meningioma.  No active seizures.  Rx with tegretal
   prior to admission.
   FLUIDS -- s/p resussitation.  Plan to allow net diresis, to baseline
   weight.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS  -- improved.  [**Month (only) 51**] be attributed to medications,
   perhaps sedating component of Kepra.  Also consider
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Plan speech/swallow evaluation -->
   consider TF (enteroflex tube) if fails evaluation.

1. Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress
   - The patient presented with respiratory distress, which has improved but still requires monitoring for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. History and Physical Examination:
   - The patient has a history of seizure disorder caused by a meningioma.
   - Vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight decrease in blood pressure.
   - The patient appears more comfortable today, but there are no acute distress or signs of being well-nourished or overweight.
   - The cardiovascular examination shows normal heart rhythm and no murmurs, but there is no mention of edema or orthopnea.
   - Respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds with no crackles, wheezes, or diminished sounds.
   - Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present.
   - Neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, purposeful movement, and normal tone.

3. Labs and Radiology:
   - Blood tests indicate leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count and elevated levels of potassium and creatinine.
   - There is also evidence of anemia and slightly low albumin levels.
   - Other lab results, such as glucose, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and cardiac markers, are within normal range.
   - No imaging studies or additional radiology results are mentioned in the provided progress"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yof seizure disorder (meningioma), now with resolving sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- improved.  Attributed to sepsis and perhaps
   seizure (altered mental status).  Now with copious secretions.
   Underlying bilateral pleural effusions.  Monitor for evidence for VAP
   (extubated yesterday).  Maintain upright position, OOB if tolerates.
   SEPSIS -- attributed to urinary source.  Resolved, responded to current
   management.
   PLEURAL EFFUSIONS -- attributed to resussitation fluids.  Plan to allow
   net diuresis.
   SEIZURES -- h/o meningioma.  No active seizures.  Rx with tegretal
   prior to admission.
   FLUIDS -- s/p resussitation.  Plan to allow net diresis, to baseline
   weight.
   Altered mental status -- improved.  [**Month (only) 51**] be attributed to medications,
   perhaps sedating component of Kepra.  Also consider
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Plan speech/swallow evaluation -->
   consider TF (enteroflex tube) if fails evaluation.

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder (meningioma) who presented with respiratory distress. She has been in the ICU and received treatment for sepsis, which was attributed to a urinary source. The patient's respiratory distress has improved, but she still has copious secretions and underlying bilateral pleural effusions. The pleural effusions are believed to be caused by resussitation fluids, and the plan is to allow for net diuresis.

The patient's altered mental status has also improved, which was initially thought to be due to medications, specifically the sedating component of Kepra. It is also considered that nutritional support may be necessary, as the patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth). A speech/swallow evaluation will be performed to determine if tube feeding (enteroflex tube) is needed.

The patient has been on various medications including furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). She has also received piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and ciprofloxacin in the past.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/66 mmHg to 101/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen"
