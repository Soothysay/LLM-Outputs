","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of COPD, myasthenia gravis, dementia, and diabetes mellitus type II. She presented with respiratory distress and hypernatremia. The patient has several medical complications including pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute kidney injury (ARF), hyperglycemia, lower extremity dry gangrene, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: This condition is characterized by high sodium levels in the blood. It can be secondary to dehydration and may contribute to various symptoms such as confusion, weakness, seizures, or even coma if left untreated. The patient's hypernatremia needs to be corrected slowly to prevent rapid shifts in fluid balance.

2. Pneumonia: The patient shows signs of pneumonia, indicated by leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), bandemia (presence of immature white blood cells), and elevated lactate levels. Aspiration pneumonia versus nursing home acquired pneumonia should be considered, and appropriate diagnostic tests like chest X-ray (CXR) and blood cultures (BCx) should be ordered.

3. UTI: The patient's urine analysis is consistent with a urinary tract infection. Antibiotic treatment should be continued, and urine culture (UCx) should be obtained to identify the specific causative organism.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's kidney function is compromised,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypoxemia. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation but stopped tolerating it. Sodium levels were corrected from 170 to 150. Creatinine (Cr) is trending downward, and urine output (UO) is increasing. The patient's Intensive Sequela Score (ISS) has increased. Methylprednisolone was started at a dose of 40 IV daily. Soft restraints were used, and the patient was grasping at the mask. The family plans to move towards hospice.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 144/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is alert but largely unresponsive, occasionally responding to commands. Physical examination findings include coarse breath sounds bilaterally, dry gangrene in the left lower extremity, and Dopplerable right distal pulse (DP).

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including high sodium, low potassium, and low calcium. Imaging studies are pending.

Assessment and plan include hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, hypernatremia (high sodium), and diabetes mellitus type I. The patient is receiving ICU care including nutrition,"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old lady with COPD, myasthenia gravis, dementia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with respiratory distress and hypernatremia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be corrected slowly to prevent neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has leukocytosis and bandemia, which indicate an infection. If it is confirmed to be pneumonia, it can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urine analysis is consistent with a UTI. If left untreated, it can lead to kidney infection or sepsis.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. This can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.

5. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and her respiratory distress may be due to a worsening of her COPD. This can lead to respiratory failure if not managed adequately.

6. Lower extremity dry gangrene: The patient has dry gangrene in her left lower extremity, which is likely due to peripheral artery disease and diabetes mellitus. This can lead to tissue necrosis and potentially require amputation.

7. Malnutrition: The patient is currently unable"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of COPD, myasthenia gravis, dementia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with respiratory distress and hypernatremia. She has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute renal failure (ARF), hyperglycemia, and lower extremity dry gangrene. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation and requires ICU level of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels could lead to dehydration, neurological complications, and increased risk of infections.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of leukocytosis, bandemia, and elevated lactate suggests a bacterial infection in the lungs, which may worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urinary analysis is consistent with a UTI. If left untreated, it can lead to systemic infections and complications such as urosepsis.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. ARF can be caused by various factors, including dehydration, infections, and medications.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels may indicate poor glycemic control, especially in the setting of stress and steroid use. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia can increase the risk of"

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 144/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is alert and talking but not oriented, responding occasionally to commands, and breathing comfortably on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals dry gangrene in her left lower extremity and no peripheral edema. Her neurologic examination shows occasional responsiveness and improved alertness. The patient has a history of COPD, myasthenia gravis, dementia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has been intubated in the past.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated sodium levels, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, increased white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows low oxygen saturation. Chest X-rays show multifocal pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old lady with COPD, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 1209**], dementia presented with
   respiratory distress and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Most likely secondary to dehydration.  Pneumonia, UTI
   and hyperglycemia are contributing to this.  Need to correct it slowly
   , in first 24 hrs decreased from 170 to 158. Overnight the pace of
   correction has slowed, now plateaued in low 150s. Clinically much
   improved, less obtunded.  I/O positive 4800 yesterday.
   - continue D5
 NS at 150 ml/hour to complete 3 L this afternoon.
   Redraw NA and reaccess fluids with renal at that time
   - serum Na q4h
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Leukocytosis and bandemia.  Elevated lactate.  Aspiration
   vs. Nursing home acquired PNA. CXR consistant with aspiration PNA.
   Blood cultures pending. Respiratory status greatly improved, oxygen
   requirement decreased with vanco and zyosyn.
   - f/u blood cult
   - will continue vanc/zosyn
   -[**2-16**] renal failure ordering vanco doses 1 at a time, with trough after
   each dose.
   .
   # UTI: UA consistent with UTI.  However Urine culture with no growth so
   far
   - Abx as above.
   - f/u UCx
   .
   # ARF: Unclear baseline.  Baseline Cr  in 1s?  Most likely prerenal.
   UOP increasing and Cr steadally improving to 3.0
   - IVF as above
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   -monitor UOP
   .
   # COPD:  History of COPD.  ? home oxygen. Was originally on solumedrol
   125 IV and titrated down yesterday.
   - d/c  solumedrol ( 40  IV daily) as COPD exacerbation unlikely, not
   wheezing.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  Known DM2.  Most likely in the setting of stress
   (infection, respiratory distress) and steroids
   - ISS, increased ISS and added standing low dose glargine in setting of
   BG presistantly in mid to upper 200s.
   -Will need to trend sugars as steroids are stopped and depending on
   further dextrose in IVF.
   - If BG improved consider d/c glargine or decreased ISS to prevent
   hypoglycemia.
   .
   # lower extremity dry gangrene:  Patient has neuropathy and DM2.  Long
   term problem per family.
   - wound care
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now as high aspiration risk, replete lytes prn.
   Disucussed  with family option to feed with known aspiration risk vs no
   further nutrition. Family responable and had started hospice care
   discussion prior to this hospitalization. Would benefit from palliative
   care, SW after transferred out of ICU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of COPD, myasthenia gravis, dementia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with respiratory distress and hypernatremia. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation but is now off it. Her sodium levels have been corrected from 170 to 150. Creatinine levels are trending down and urine output is increasing. She has been given methylprednisolone at 40 IV daily. The patient's family is planning to move towards hospice care. The patient has allergies to no known drugs. She received Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on [**2188-12-20**] 05:59 AM and Vancomycin on [**2188-12-20**] 08:00 PM. She is currently on heparin sodium prophylaxis and other ICU medications include ipratropium, albuterol, and ISS. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 144/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
