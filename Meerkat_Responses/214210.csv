   Assessment and Plan
   26 year-old G7P2 female with a history of polysubstance abuse who
   presents with abdominal pain and hypotension now being admitted post
   cholecystectomy for cholecystitis for management of septic shock.
   # Septic shock:  Patient meets SIRS criteria with with leukocytosis,
   tachycardia, and tachypnea with source of infection likely related to
   cholecystitis.  Significant bandemia of 13% on admission.  s/p
   cholecystetomy on [**11-8**]. Another possible etiology is bacteremia
   introduced by IVDU. Currently requiring levophed for BP support.
   - Cefepime/flagyl for intrabdominal/GB pathology and vancomycin given
   IVDU
   - Murmur likely in the setting of pregnancy, but will check TTE given
   IVDU, murmur and sepsis
   - Central venous line in place, repositioned [**11-8**]
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   # Respiratory failure: Large A-a gradient. MVO2 > 70%.  Minimal
   correction with increased FiO2. Potential sources include ARDS, fluid
   overload, DAH.
   - Try to wean FiO2
 have room to go up on PEEP
   - Hold off on diuresis at this time as patient still requiring pressor
   # DIC:  Elevated INR though normalizing. Platelet count, fibrinogen
   improving. No e/o bleeding currently.
   - Per ob/gyn recs, continue to trend DIC labs
   # Hyperbilirubinemia:  Without elevation of alk phos and transaminases
   essentially normal (AST slightly elevated to 51).  U/S without evidence
   of obstruction.  Likely cholestasis in the setting of sepsis.
   - Monitor
   # Anemia:  Baseline hct unknown.  Overall stable on 2 checks in our
   system.  Likely has baseline anemia in pregnancy.  Low MCV (Fe
   deficiency vs hemoglobinopathy) and elevated RDW.  No clear e/o
   bleeding on imaging and guaiac negative on ED exam.  Given elevated T.
   bili as above, hemolysis also possible although LDH is normal
   haptoglobin reduced, bilirubin largely direct.
   - Continue to monitor hct q8h
   # Chest pain:  In setting of crack cocaine use and since resolved.  No
   significant ischemic changes noted on EKG.  Cardiac enzymes and now
   trending downwards. Concern for heart failure secondary to possible
   cardiac ischemia. CTA at OSH negative for dissection, PE.
   - Receiving morphine prn for abdominal pain and CP
   - Check cardiac enzymes, EKG for any concern for ischemia
   - TTE as above to also evaluate for wall motion abnormalities
   # Polysubstance abuse:  Still actively using with urine tox positive
   for cocaine and opiates.
   - social work/substance abuse consult
   # Pregnancy:  High risk for placental abruption.
   - Continue fetal monitoring
   - Ob recs
   # Hep C:  Status largely unknown.  Thrombocytopenic with elevated INR
   already in the setting of DIC; awaiting albumin to eval for synthetic
   function.  With exception of elevated t.bili, other LFTs not markedly
   abnormal (AST only mildly elevated).
   # FEN:  NPO
   # Access:  Right IJ in place
   # PPx:  Venodynes.  No SC heparin currently given DIC and elevated PTT,
   PT/INR.
   # Code:  FULL.
   # Dispo:  ICU level care

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of polysubstance abuse, presenting with abdominal pain and hypotension. She was admitted post cholecystectomy for cholecystitis and is currently being managed for septic shock. The patient meets SIRS criteria with leukocytosis, tachycardia, and tachypnea, and the source of infection is likely related to cholecystitis or possible bacteremia introduced by intravenous drug use (IVDU).

The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, with a large A-a gradient and MVO2 > 70%. Minimal correction has been seen with increased FiO2. Potential sources of respiratory failure include ARDS, fluid overload, or DAH. The patient's INR is elevated but normalizing, platelet count, and fibrinogen levels are improving, indicating improvement from DIC. There are no signs of bleeding currently.

The patient also has hyperbilirubinemia without elevation of alk phos and transaminases, likely cholestasis in the setting of sepsis. Anemia is present with an unknown baseline hct, likely due to baseline anemia in pregnancy or hemolysis. The patient's chest pain has resolved, and cardiac enzymes are trending downwards, reducing concerns for cardiac ischemia. However, further evaluation with a TTE is recommended to assess for wall motion abnormalities.

The patient is still actively using substances, with urine tox"

   Assessment and Plan
   26 year-old G7P2 female with a history of polysubstance abuse who
   presents with abdominal pain and hypotension now being admitted post
   cholecystectomy for cholecystitis for management of septic shock.
   # Septic shock:  Patient meets SIRS criteria with with leukocytosis,
   tachycardia, and tachypnea with source of infection likely related to
   cholecystitis.  Significant bandemia of 13% most recently.  No clear GB
   necrosis or gas in GB however CT with mesenteric air.  U/S without e/o
   obstruction so cause seems more likely cholecystitis as opposed to
   ascending cholangitis.  Also possible etiology is bacteremia introduced
   by IVDU.  Currently requiring levophed for BP support.
   - cefepime/flagyl for intrabdominal/GB pathology and vancomycin given
   IVDU
   - Murmur likely in the setting of pregnancy, but will check TTE given
   IVDU, murmur and sepsis
   - Central venous line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   - d/w surgery re: ex-lap
   # DIC:  Elevated INR, low platelets, low fibrinogen c/w DIC in the
   setting of sepsis.  Has received cryoprecipitate and FFP with
   improvement in INR to 1.3 (from 1.7).  No e/o bleeding currently.
   - continue to trend DIC labs
   - supportive care
   # Hyperbilirubinemia:  Without elevation of alk phos and transaminases
   essentially normal (AST slightly elevated to 51).  U/S without evidence
   of obstruction.  Likely cholestasis in the setting of sepsis.  Also,
   given anemia, may be elevated d/t hemolysis (haptoglobin and bili
   fractionation pending).
   - checking hapto and fractionate bili (however LDH normal)
   - will monitor
   # Anemia:  Baseline hct unknown.  Overall stable on 2 checks in our
   system.  Likely has baseline anemia in pregnancy.  Low MCV (Fe
   deficiency vs hemoglobinopathy) and elevated RDW.  No clear e/o
   bleeding on imaging and guaiac negative on ED exam.  Given elevated T.
   bili as above, hemolysis also possible although LDH is normal.
   - continue to monitor hct q8h
   - checking hemolysis labs
   # Chest pain:  In setting of crack cocaine use and since resolved.  No
   significant ischemic changes noted on EKG.  CEs not sent in ED (? sent
   at OSH).  CTA at OSH negative for dissection, PE.
   - receiving morphine prn for abdominal pain and CP
   # Polysubstance abuse:  Still actively using with urine tox positive
   for cocaine and opiates.
   - social work/substance abuse consult
   # Pregnancy:  High risk for placental abruption.
   - continue fetal monitoring
   # Hep C:  Status largely unknown.  Thrombocytopenic with elevated INR
   already in the setting of DIC; awaiting albumin to eval for synthetic
   function.  With exception of elevated t.bili, other LFTs not markedly
   abnormal (AST only mildly elevated).
   # FEN:  NPO pending ex-lap and cholecystectomy today.
   # Access:  Right IJ in place.
   # PPx:  Venodynes.  No SC heparin currently given DIC and elevated PTT,
   PT/INR.
   # Code:  FULL.

The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of polysubstance abuse, presenting with abdominal pain and hypotension. She was admitted post-cholecystectomy for cholecystitis and is now being managed for septic shock. The patient meets SIRS criteria with leukocytosis, tachycardia, and tachypnea, with a likely source of infection related to cholecystitis. There is significant bandemia, but no clear GB necrosis or gas in GB. A CT scan shows mesenteric air, suggesting possible cholecystitis or ascending cholangitis. The patient also has a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU), which could be an additional etiology for bacteremia. She is currently requiring levophed for BP support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's condition is critical, and there is a high risk of further deterioration due to sepsis. Continuous monitoring and aggressive management are necessary.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient has elevated INR, low platelets, and low fibrinogen, indicating DIC. This can lead to bleeding complications, and the patient has received cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with improvement in INR.
3. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has elevated bilirubin levels, which could be due to cholestasis in the setting of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill female with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. She underwent a cholecystectomy and is now experiencing septic shock, respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anemia, and intrauterine pregnancy. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with increasing FiO2 requirements. She is receiving multiple pressors and antibiotics. Her coagulation parameters are improving, but she has a history of heroin use. The patient has several lines and catheters in place for ongoing care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with septic shock, indicating a severe infection that could lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated with high FiO2 requirements, indicating difficulty in oxygenating. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to her respiratory condition and narcotic use.
3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient has coagulation abnormalities, which can lead to bleeding or clotting disorders. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels are unchanged since admission, indicating possible ongoing blood loss or inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Intrauterine pregnancy: The patient is pregnant, and close monitoring of both maternal and fetal well-being is essential.
6. Drug addiction: The patient's heroin use may"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill female who underwent a cholecystectomy and is now experiencing septic shock. She remains pressor-dependent and is being treated with vancomycin, flagyl, and cefipime while awaiting pan-culture results. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a fever, tachycardia, and low blood pressure. She requires high levels of oxygen to maintain adequate oxygenation. The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with respiratory failure and volume overload. There are signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) but coagulation parameters have improved. The patient has an intrauterine pregnancy and is anemic with a hematocrit level unchanged since arrival. The patient is sedated and intubated, and several interventions have been implemented to manage her condition, including changes in sedation medications, adjustments to ventilator settings, and monitoring for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's overall prognosis remains critical. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing septic shock, indicating a severe infection that could lead to further organ dysfunction and potential death if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's high FiO2 requirement and volume overload suggest respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not addressed promptly.
3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): Although coagulation parameters have improved, the"

   Assessment and Plan
   26 year-old G7P2 female with a history of polysubstance abuse who
   presents with abdominal pain and hypotension now being admitted post
   cholecystectomy for cholecystitis for management of septic shock.
   # Septic shock:  Patient meets SIRS criteria with with leukocytosis,
   tachycardia, and tachypnea with source of infection likely related to
   cholecystitis.  Significant bandemia of 13% on admission.  s/p
   cholecystetomy on [**11-8**]. Another possible etiology is bacteremia
   introduced by IVDU. Currently requiring levophed for BP support.
   - Cefepime/flagyl for intrabdominal/GB pathology and vancomycin given
   IVDU
   - Murmur likely in the setting of pregnancy, but will check TTE given
   IVDU, murmur and sepsis
   - Central venous line in place, repositioned [**11-8**]
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   # Respiratory failure: Large A-a gradient. MVO2 > 70%.  Minimal
   correction with increased FiO2. Potential sources include ARDS, fluid
   overload, DAH.
   - Try to wean FiO2
 have room to go up on PEEP
   - Hold off on diuresis at this time as patient still requiring pressor
   # DIC:  Elevated INR though normalizing. Platelet count, fibrinogen
   improving. No e/o bleeding currently.
   - Per ob/gyn recs, continue to trend DIC labs
   # Hyperbilirubinemia:  Without elevation of alk phos and transaminases
   essentially normal (AST slightly elevated to 51).  U/S without evidence
   of obstruction.  Likely cholestasis in the setting of sepsis.
   - Monitor
   # Anemia:  Baseline hct unknown.  Overall stable on 2 checks in our
   system.  Likely has baseline anemia in pregnancy.  Low MCV (Fe
   deficiency vs hemoglobinopathy) and elevated RDW.  No clear e/o
   bleeding on imaging and guaiac negative on ED exam.  Given elevated T.
   bili as above, hemolysis also possible although LDH is normal
   haptoglobin reduced, bilirubin largely direct.
   - Continue to monitor hct q8h
   # Chest pain:  In setting of crack cocaine use and since resolved.  No
   significant ischemic changes noted on EKG.  Cardiac enzymes and now
   trending downwards. Concern for heart failure secondary to possible
   cardiac ischemia. CTA at OSH negative for dissection, PE.
   - Receiving morphine prn for abdominal pain and CP
   - Check cardiac enzymes, EKG for any concern for ischemia
   - TTE as above to also evaluate for wall motion abnormalities
   # Polysubstance abuse:  Still actively using with urine tox positive
   for cocaine and opiates.
   - social work/substance abuse consult
   # Pregnancy:  High risk for placental abruption.
   - Continue fetal monitoring
   - Ob recs
   # Hep C:  Status largely unknown.  Thrombocytopenic with elevated INR
   already in the setting of DIC; awaiting albumin to eval for synthetic
   function.  With exception of elevated t.bili, other LFTs not markedly
   abnormal (AST only mildly elevated).

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain and hypotension. She was admitted post-cholecystectomy for cholecystitis and is now being managed for septic shock. The patient has a history of polysubstance abuse and meets SIRS criteria with leukocytosis, tachycardia, and tachypnea. A possible source of infection could be related to cholecystitis or introduced by intravenous drug use. She requires levophed for blood pressure support. She has undergone a cholecystectomy and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention. She has signs of infection and is not responding well to treatment.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure with a large A-a gradient and MVO2 > 70%. This indicates poor oxygenation and potential ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). It is crucial to wean FiO2 and consider increasing PEEP to improve oxygenation.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has elevated INR, but platelet count and fibrinogen levels are improving. DIC is a serious condition that can lead to abnormal bleeding or clotting.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has elevated bilirubin levels without elevation of alk phos and trans"

   - Per ob/gyn recs, continue to trend DIC labs
   # Hyperbilirubinemia:  Without elevation of alk phos and transaminases
   essentially normal (AST slightly elevated to 51).  U/S without evidence
   of obstruction.  Likely cholestasis in the setting of sepsis.
   - Monitor
   # Anemia:  Baseline hct unknown.  Overall stable on 2 checks in our
   system.  Likely has baseline anemia in pregnancy.  Low MCV (Fe
   deficiency vs hemoglobinopathy) and elevated RDW.  No clear e/o
   bleeding on imaging and guaiac negative on ED exam.  Given elevated T.
   bili as above, hemolysis also possible although LDH is normal
   haptoglobin reduced, bilirubin largely direct.
   - Continue to monitor hct q8h
   # Chest pain:  In setting of crack cocaine use and since resolved.  No
   significant ischemic changes noted on EKG.  Cardiac enzymes and now
   trending downwards. Concern for heart failure secondary to possible
   cardiac ischemia. CTA at OSH negative for dissection, PE.
   - Receiving morphine prn for abdominal pain and CP
   - Check cardiac enzymes, EKG for any concern for ischemia
   - TTE as above to also evaluate for wall motion abnormalities
   # Polysubstance abuse:  Still actively using with urine tox positive
   for cocaine and opiates.
   - social work/substance abuse consult
   # Pregnancy:  High risk for placental abruption.
   - Continue fetal monitoring
   - Ob recs
   # Hep C:  Status largely unknown.  Thrombocytopenic with elevated INR
   already in the setting of DIC; awaiting albumin to eval for synthetic
   function.  With exception of elevated t.bili, other LFTs not markedly
   abnormal (AST only mildly elevated).

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of polysubstance abuse who presents with abdominal pain and hypotension. She was admitted post-cholecystectomy for cholecystitis and is now being managed for septic shock. The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, including leukocytosis, tachycardia, and tachypnea, with a likely source of infection related to cholecystitis. Another possible etiology is bacteremia introduced by intravenous drug use (IVDU). The patient is currently requiring levophed for blood pressure support.

The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, as she has large A-a gradients and MVO2 > 70%. There is minimal correction with increased FiO2, and potential sources include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fluid overload, or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Efforts are being made to wean FiO2 and increase PEEP.

Additionally, the patient has signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), with elevated INR though normalizing. Platelet count and fibrinogen are improving, but there are no signs of bleeding currently.

There are several other medical complications noted in the progress note, including hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, chest pain, polysubstance abuse, pregnancy, hepatitis C, and femoral nerve palsy.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for shock and sepsis. He has been receiving invasive ventilation, arterial line, and presep catheter placement. The patient has been experiencing fever, with a maximum temperature of 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit. His vital signs include a heart rate of 79-113 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 107/69 to 82/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight is currently 81.4 kg. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis-induced hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are low, indicating potential sepsis-induced hypotension.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing stress ulcers.
5. Nosocomial infections: The use of invasive lines and catheters can lead to nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections.
6. Organ dysfunction: Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, particularly in the"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 26-year-old female who presented with septic shock secondary to cholecystitis. She underwent an open cholecystectomy and then a C-section. The patient remains critically ill with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and is on mechanical ventilation. She has a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) and polysubstance abuse. The patient's blood cultures grew coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, and she has been on appropriate antibiotics for intrabdominal pathology and IVDU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's initial presentation was septic shock, likely due to cholecystitis. She has received appropriate antibiotics, but ongoing monitoring is required.

2. ARDS: The patient has developed ARDS, which is characterized by severe hypoxia and difficulty in oxygenation. This condition can lead to further respiratory complications and multiorgan dysfunction.

3. DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation): The patient shows signs of DIC, with abnormal coagulation parameters (INR, platelet count, fibrinogen). Close monitoring of DIC labs is necessary, and there should be vigilance for any signs of bleeding.

4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is unknown, and there is a slight decrease overnight. It could be dilutional due to fluid resuscitation or ongoing bleeding. Monitoring the Hct is important to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who presented with septic shock and is now experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She underwent an open cholecystectomy, followed by a C-section, and then exploratory laparotomy. The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, likely secondary to cholecystitis. She remains on multiple antibiotics and vasopressors to maintain hemodynamic stability.

2. ARDS: The patient has developed ARDS, characterized by diffuse bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray and increased peak pressures. Weaning of FiO2 and PEEP will be important for her respiratory support.

3. DIC: The patient shows signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), indicated by elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, and improving fibrinogen levels. Monitoring of DIC labs and close observation for bleeding or clotting complications are essential.

4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has mild hyperbilirubinemia, potentially due to cholestasis in the setting of sepsis. Monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is advised.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is unknown, but there is a slight decrease overnight. It could be dilutional or related to blood loss during surgeries. Continuous monitoring of hematocrit (H"

   I saw and examined the patient with the medical resident, reviewed 24

   ventilation for sepsis and ARDS.  POD #3 s/p CCY, POD #2 s/p
   C-section.  Clinically continues to improve.  Weaned off pressors as of
   10 pm yesterday.  TTE showed no vegetations, evidence of pulm HTN,
   right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis.  Intubated, sedated on
   exam, appeared comfortable.  Tachycardia, regular. Lungs with scattered
   crackles, mostly dependent. No wheeze. Abdomen mildly distended, occ
   bowel sounds, trace bipedal edema.  Opened eyes to command.  Tolerated
   switch to pressure support 8/10 CPAP/40% FiO2 so ventilatory
   requirements continue to decrease.  CXR with decreased patchy bilateral
   infiltrates.  Coagulopathy resolved, improving transaminitis, hct
   stable.
   1) Resolving sepsis, now Hemodynamically stable off pressors, continue
   current antibiotics
   2) Resolving ARDS with decreasing FiO2 and ventilatory requirements.
   Still mildly volume overloaded, will follow ins and outs with goal of
   having [**Telephone/Fax (1) 179**] cc negative overnight.  If continues to improve from
   respiratory standpoint with decreased CPAP to 5, wean PSV as tolerated
   and consider SBT in am.  Will need to reduce sedation.
   3) Nutrition: To start tube feeds at 10 cc/hour as per surgery
   recommendations.  Follow residuals.
   Plan otherwise as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 916**]

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent an open cholecystectomy, cesarean section, and exploratory laparotomy. She presented with septic shock, likely secondary to cholecystitis, and is now diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is improving, off pressors for the past 10 hours, and maintaining a stable blood pressure. However, there is a concern about the ongoing infection as a swab from the cholecystectomy wound is growing Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). This may require a change in antibiotic therapy.

2. ARDS: The patient's A-a gradient is improving, and FiO2 has been decreased overnight to 40% on PEEP 10. Today, a trial of PEEP 8 will be attempted. The goal is to wean the ventilatory requirements and eventually discontinue mechanical ventilation.

3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient initially had an elevated INR and thrombocytopenia, but now the INR has normalized, and platelet count and fibrinogen levels are improving. There are no signs of bleeding currently.

4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has mild transaminitis, which could potentially be ch"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who presented with septic shock, now off pressors and holding stable blood pressure. She had undergone an open cholecystectomy, C-section, and exploratory laparotomy. The patient's TTE showed no vegetation, but right ventricular dilation, hypokinesis, and pressure/volume overload were noted. MSSA was grown from the wound culture, and hospital cultures were negative. The patient has ARDS and is being weaned off FiO2 to 40% with PEEP at 10. She has a history of malignancy, lung cancer. The patient's labs show improvement in WBC count, Hct, and platelet count. She has hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and evidence of polysubstance abuse. Her Hep C status is unknown, and she requires TF per surgery. The patient has multiple lines and is receiving full ICU care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is still at risk for further infections, especially with the presence of MSSA in the wound culture. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt treatment of any signs of infection is necessary.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS may progress or worsen if ventilator settings are not optimized or if there is a secondary infection.
3. Hypotension: Despite being off pressors, the patient's blood pressure can still drop when agitated. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old female who has undergone a cesarean section and cholecystectomy. She presented with septic shock secondary to cholecystitis and is now diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current medical conditions include septic shock, ARDS, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, polysubstance abuse, and hepatitis C.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's initial presentation was septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome if not managed appropriately.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS can progress to respiratory failure if oxygenation and ventilation parameters are not closely monitored and managed.
3. DIC: Although the patient's INR has normalized, there is still a risk of bleeding due to the low platelet count and decreased fibrinogen levels. Close monitoring is required to prevent any bleeding complications.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's elevated bilirubin levels indicate liver dysfunction. Further monitoring is necessary to assess for potential complications related to liver impairment.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct level is 26.2, indicating anemia. Continuous monitoring is required to assess for any worsening of anemia or signs of bleeding.
6. Polysubstance abuse: The patient's active use of cocaine and opiates may contribute to various"

   data.  Coagulopathy resolved.  Continues broad spectrum antibiotics.
   WBC normal. Plan for 1 week course of abx.
 RENAL FAILURE:  Creatine continues to improve.  Good urine output,
   responding well to lasix.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). They are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 70 to 111 beats per minute, blood pressure between 105/65 mmHg and 169/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation.

The patient has received diuretics overnight and has shown good urine output. Their chest X-ray is essentially unchanged from previous examinations. They are currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis and potential infections.

The patient's laboratory results indicate signs of renal failure, with improved creatinine levels. They also have elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's medical team is closely monitoring their condition, providing supportive care, and adjusting treatment plans accordingly. The patient is critically ill and requires continuous ICU care."

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent an open cholecystectomy, cesarean section, and exploratory laparotomy. She presented with septic shock and is now experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has been off pressors for more than 48 hours and is holding stable blood pressure. However, her blood pressure drops when she is agitated, so sedation is being continued. The patient's swab from the cholecystectomy grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and her transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not show vegetation. Cultures from Hospital 1188 were negative, and sputum cultures showed less than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock secondary to cholecystitis. She is now off pressors for more than 48 hours and is holding stable blood pressure. However, her blood pressure drops when she is agitated, so sedation is being continued to prevent agitation and potential hypotension. The patient will continue receiving cefepime, Flagyl, and vancomycin for now, and the length of antibiotic therapy will be discussed with the surgical team.

2. ARDS: The patient is likely experiencing"

   # Septic shock:  Etiology most likely secondary to cholecystits. Pt now
   off pressors for last 36 hrs and holding stable bp.  BP does drop when
   she is agitated so sedation is being continued but will need to be
   lightened for pt to be weaned off vent. Swab from CCY grew MSSA.  TTE
   without vegetation. [**Hospital1 1188**] cultures negative
   - Will cont Cefepime/Flagyl/vanco  for now- will discuss length of tx
   with surgery.
   -Monitor BP now that off pressors.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   # Likely ARDS:  Improving A-a. Decreased Fi02 overnight to 40%, on PEEP
   5- was on PS during day yesterday but back to A/C overnight.
   -Will need to discuss possible decr in sedation and weaning from vent
   today with surgery.
   - no IVF for now- pt put out >1L fluid to 10 Lasix IV o/n
   # DIC:  INR normalized. Platelet count, fibrinogen improving. No e/o
   bleeding currently.
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Mild transaminitis [**11-9**]. Potentially cholestasis
   in the setting of sepsis. LFTs normalizing. Will monitor.
   # Anemia:  Hct 26.2.  Stable at this time. No overt signs of bleeding

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 26-year-old female who presented with septic shock, now off pressors for the past 36 hours and maintaining stable blood pressure. She has a history of open cholecystectomy, cesarean section, and exploratory laparotomy. Swab from the gallbladder grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) without vegetation, and hospital cultures were negative.

The patient has been on cefepime, Flagyl, and vancomycin, which will be continued for now, with discussion about the length of treatment with surgery. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, and there is no evidence of bleeding. Her INR has normalized, and platelet count and fibrinogen levels are improving. There is mild hyperbilirubinemia, potentially due to cholestasis in the setting of sepsis. Liver function tests (LFTs) are normalizing, and the patient's hemoglobin level is stable at 26.2%. 

The patient has a history of polysubstance abuse, with positive urine toxicology for cocaine and opiates on admission. Social work and substance abuse consult have been requested. Hepatitis serologies are pending, and the patient initially presented with thrombocytopenia and elevated INR, already in the setting of disseminated intravascular coagulation"

   Assessment and Plan
 ARDS, ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Continues to clinically improve
   with continued diuresis.  Secretions white and thin. Good cough/gag.
   Tolerating PSV 5/PEEP 5/40% with good gas. Will plan to discontinue
   arterial line.  Given history of polysubstance abuse, continues to
   require fentanyl/versed at higher doses to maintain level of sedation
   for current level of management albeit quite awake and able to protect
   airway. Will consider precidex, asking pharmacy to check what role this
   may have given continued fentanyl/versed (rather than short term
   sedation for her management thus far).
 SHOCK, SEPTIC:  Resolved. Off pressors for more than 36 hours.
   Tolerating diuresis.  Plan to discontinue central line after placement
   of IVs so that she can complete her 7 day course of IV antibiotics.
   Agree with assessment and plan per medical ICU resident.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-year-old woman who is critically ill with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and ARDS. She has a history of sepsis and has undergone a C-section. She is currently sedated and intubated, unable to provide history. The patient is on various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 96/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a set volume of 480 mL and a spontaneous volume of 474 mL. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 250.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged intubation and immobility, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, daily wake-up calls, and mouth care should be implemented to reduce this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization increases the risk of DVT. The patient should be provided with compression stockings to prevent DVT.
3. Nosocomial infections"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old female who presented with septic shock and now has ARDS. The patient underwent an open cholecystectomy, a C-section, and exploratory laparotomy. The patient's blood cultures were negative, and sputum cultures showed less than 25 PMNs. The patient is currently stable and off pressors, with a stable blood pressure. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, likely secondary to cholecystitis. The patient is now off pressors and holding stable blood pressure. A swab from the recent cholecystectomy grew Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient does not have vegetation on TTE, and hospital cultures were negative.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is likely experiencing ARDS. The patient's A-a gradient is improving, and they are stable on a tent mask after self-extubation overnight. 

3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient had signs of DIC, but the INR has normalized, and the platelet count and fibrinogen have improved.

4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has mild transaminitis, potentially due to cholestasis in the setting of sepsis. Liver function tests are normalizing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) and recent C-section. He was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis on POD 6 and has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, sedation, and respiratory support. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/63 to 114/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is currently extubated and responsive to questions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis and is still receiving antibiotics. There is a risk of ongoing infection and sepsis progression.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of crackles in the respiratory/chest examination may indicate pneumonia, which can be a potential complication in critically ill patients.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobility and risk factors, there is a possibility of developing DVT. Prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin has been initiated.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP.
5. Bleeding: The elevated INR and PTT indicate a prolonged clotting time, which increases the"

   night, turned off precidex, has been sleepy ableit easily arousable.
   Denies soar throat, shortness of breath. Occasional cough,
   nonproductive. Lungs with basilar crackles, patient not taking deep
   breaths.  Abdomen soft, occ. Bowel sounds, staples in tact, no erythema
   or discharge.  Minimal pedal edema.   Now extubated, stable albeit
   still sleepy this am.  Plan to hold sedation for now.  When able to
   take po
s (able to protect airway) can reassess need for klonopin and
   methoadone.  Completing course of abx for cholecystitis, unable to take
   flagyl orally so will change to IV.  Continue to monitor in ICU given

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 26-year-old female who presented with septic shock secondary to cholecystitis. She had undergone an open cholecystectomy, cesarean section, and exploratory laparotomy. The patient has a history of ARDS and DIC. She is currently off pressors and maintaining stable blood pressure. A swab from the cholecystectomy grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed no vegetation, and cultures from Hospital1 were negative. The patient's sputum cultures showed less than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs).

The patient has been self-extubated overnight but remains stable. She is afebrile and does not have leukocytosis at this time. She will continue to receive cefepime, Flagyl, and vancomycin for now, and the length of treatment will be discussed with the surgery team.

The patient is likely experiencing ARDS, as indicated by improving arterial-alveolar (A-a) gradient. She is stable on a face tent mask and will continue to receive Lasix diuresis as needed. Sedation will be monitored, and Haloperidol will be changed to 5-10 mg every 6 hours as needed.

The patient's DIC appears to be resolving, with normalized INR and improved platelet count and fibrinogen"

A swab from the cesarean section site grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). An echocardiogram did not show vegetation, and hospital cultures and sputum cultures were negative. The patient self-extubated but remained stable on room air.

The patient is currently on cefepime, Flagyl, and vancomycin for now, and the length of treatment will be discussed with the surgery team. The plan is to monitor the patient's blood pressure, as well as continue to monitor sedation with lorazepam and haloperidol but not methadone due to bradycardia. The patient is negative for intravenous fluids, and no IVF is being given at this time.

The patient's laboratory results show an improved platelet count and fibrinogen level, indicating improvement in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient also has chronic hepatitis C, which will be monitored. The patient's hemoglobin level is stable at 29.9%, with no overt signs of bleeding following operations. The plan is to continue monitoring the hemoglobin level.
