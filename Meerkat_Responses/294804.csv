","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male who was admitted to the floor after being found down at a rehabilitation facility. He had a recent hip fracture and was transferred to the ICU overnight due to low blood pressure and rising sodium levels. The patient is currently on heparin, Imdur, Cardizem, and atenolol, but these medications have been held. He has been diagnosed with fever of unknown origin, hypotension, altered mental status, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type I, and postoperative hip repair.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, there is a possibility of sepsis. Monitoring vital signs and laboratory values closely is essential.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized due to his condition and recent surgery, there is a risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be continued.
3. Pneumonia: With the patient being in the ICU, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia. Monitoring respiratory status and considering appropriate imaging or diagnostic tests if necessary.
4. Wound infection: The patient's hip incision shows signs of erythema, which may indicate a potential wound infection. Close monitoring of the incision site and appropriate wound care are crucial"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old male with history of reported dementia, hear of hearing,
   CAD s/p CABG, Afib s/p PPM who recently was admitted to [**Hospital **] for a left hip fracture after fall, who was found
   down at his NH. He was initially admitted to the floor but was found to
   be intermittently hyportensive and hypernatremic.
   # Hypotension
 The patient
s SBP
s have been stable in the
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for broad spectrum coverage and f/u culture data
   - monitor oxygen saturation and BP
   - will give intermittent IVF bolus with LR given hypernatremia to
   support his BP prn
   - pt's family ok with CVL/pressors if needed
   - f/u TTE today
   # Elevated CK
 The patient had a CK peak yesterday of 1200, however
   the MB fraction is low.  His trops peaked at 0.14.  Given the patient
   recent fall, his elevated CK may be due to muscle break down and not
   cardiac ischemia.
   - Was started back on the heparin gtt overnight, however as this is
   unlikely cardiac will stop the heparin gtt today.
   # Hypernatremia - Secondary to free water deficit, had been getting 200
   cc/h of D5W overnight.  Now Na is down to 151 ( 8 point drop in 1 day).
   - Will decrease IVF to 100cc D5W/hr
   - Recheck pm lytes.
   # ARF
 Resolved - Cr of 2.5 on admission, now down to 1.2, likely near
   his baseline.  Most likely [**3-10**] to hypovolemia. He has been maintaining
   good urine output.
   # Leukocytosis
 WBC has been trending down, currently at 15.7, on
   vanc/zosyn. Wound with mild erythema, CXR without obvious PNA, U/A
   negative. LFTs unremarkable, no diarrhea.  BCx [**3-12**] grew out gram
   positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
   - follow up blood cultures and urine culture; f/u speciation and
   sensitivities of the positive BCx
   - F/u stool for C. Diff
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for now.
   # s/p recent left hip fracture - Incision appears c/d/i so doubt source
   of infection.
   - pain control as needed
   # CAD - will hold BP meds given hypotension. Will continue ASA and
   statin.
   # T2DM - will cover with ISS.
   # Code - DNR/DNI, confirmed on admission

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of reported dementia, heart of hearing loss, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation (Afib) status post pacemaker placement (PPM), and a recent left hip fracture after fall. He was initially admitted to the floor but was found to be intermittently hypotensive and hypernatremic. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.5째C (101.3째F), a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/32 mmHg to 121/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 2 L nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute.

On physical examination, the patient appears lethargic, with poor oral intake and decreased urine output. He has 1+ lower extremity edema and bilateral crackles in the lung bases. His abdomen is soft but tender to palpation, and he grimaces when palpated. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, and elevated troponin T levels. The patient's sodium level is still"

s have been stable in the 90
s to
   120
s.  Has not required fluid boluses.  BCx grew out [**3-12**] gram positive
   cocci in pairs and clusters, so his hypotension may have been due to
   bacteremia.
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for broad spectrum coverage and f/u culture
   data/speciation/sensitivities.  If his sputum culture returns negative
   will d/c zosyn.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of dementia, hearing loss, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker (PPM). He was admitted to the hospital for a left hip fracture after falling and was initially admitted to the floor. However, he was later transferred to the ICU due to intermittent hypotension and hypernatremia. The patient's blood cultures grew out 3-12 gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, suggesting bacteremia as a possible cause of his hypotension. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) and intermittent IV fluid boluses with lactated Ringer's (LR) to support his blood pressure. The patient's family is okay with the use of vasopressors if needed.

The patient had elevated cardiac enzymes (CK 310 -> 994 -> 1202, Troponins 0.08 -> 0.12), but the MB fraction is low, suggesting that the elevated CK may be due to muscle breakdown rather than cardiac ischemia. His Troponins peaked at 0.14. The patient is being restarted on heparin gtt overnight, but it will be stopped today as it is unlikely to be related to cardiac ischemia. He will receive a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to increase his hematocrit"

   [**Age over 90 **] year old male with history of reported dementia, hear of hearing,
   CAD s/p CABG, Afib s/p PPM who recently was admitted to [**Hospital **] for a left hip fracture after fall, who was found
   down at his NH. He was initially admitted to the floor but was found to
   be intermittently hyportensive and hypernatremic with a sodium of 160.

   almost 3L of NS. Patient with WBC 20, 15 on D/C from last
   hospitaliation from hip frx. Concern for possible sepsis/infection;
   however, CXR without evidence of PNA, U/A negative. Wound with mild
   erythema but does not appear frankly infected. Has no reason to be
   adrenally insufficient. No clinical evidence of cardiogenic shock or

   need V/Q for now given ARF, creatinine may improve with IVF so may be
   able to obtain CTA)

   resuscitation, good urine output.
   - continue fluid boluses as needed for volume and pressure support
   - monitor urine output, foley in place

He was recently admitted for a left hip fracture after falling and was initially admitted to the floor.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for several medical complications. These include hypotension, hypernatremia, acute renal failure (ARF), hypoxia, leukocytosis, and a recent left hip fracture. 

For hypotension, the patient is receiving almost 3L of normal saline (NS) and will receive intermittent IV fluid boluses with lactated Ringer's (LR) given his hypernatremia. Heparin gtt has been started due to concern for pulmonary embolism (PE) and hypoxia, particularly in the setting of apparent subadequate deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis post open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with 30 mg daily Lovenox.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of reported dementia, heart of hearing loss, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation (Afib) status post pacemaker placement (PPM), and a recent left hip fracture. He was admitted to the hospital for the hip fracture but was found to be intermittently hypotensive and hypernatremic. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypernatremia, acute renal failure (ARF), hypoxia, leukocytosis, and a recent left hip fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to severe hypovolemia, resulting in altered mental status. This could lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels indicate a free water deficit of approximately 5.6 liters. If not corrected properly, this can cause neurological complications such as seizures or cerebral edema.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's acute kidney injury is likely secondary to hypovolemia. Improving renal function with volume resuscitation is crucial to prevent further complications.

4. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation requires close monitoring and intervention. Prolonged hypoxia can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.

5. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection or a stress response from recent surgery. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

6. Recent Left Hip Fracture: The patient's incision appears clean and dry, reducing the likelihood of infection. However, wound care and pain management are essential to prevent complications.

7. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Holding blood pressure medications is necessary due to hypotension. Continuing aspirin (ASA) and statin therapy is important for cardiovascular health.

8. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM): Covering insulin sensitivity with ISS is necessary, considering the patient's current condition.

9. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: Repleting electrolytes as needed and addressing the free water deficit are important to prevent electrolyte disturbances and maintain fluid balance.

10. Prothrombin Time/Prolonged Partial Thromboplastin Time (PT/PTT): The elevated PT/PTT values indicate a coagulation disorder. Further investigation and appropriate management are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information and diagnostic tests may be required for a comprehensive assessment and accurate diagnosis."

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of [complaint]. The patient's medical history includes [medical history]. The patient is currently experiencing fever, hypotension, altered mental status, and increased cardiac enzymes. They have a history of diabetes mellitus type I, dementia, atrial fibrillation, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient's blood cultures were taken at [date] 09:55 PM. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unknown Origin Fever (FUO): The patient has a persistent fever despite being on antibiotics, indicating a possible ongoing infection. This requires further investigation to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate treatment.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which may indicate poor perfusion and potential organ dysfunction. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure closely to ensure adequate organ perfusion.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing confusion and disorientation, making it difficult to assess their pain levels or communicate effectively. This could be due to various factors such as sepsis, medication effects, or underlying cognitive impairment. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to improve their mental status.

4. Increased Cardiac Enzymes: Elevated levels of cardiac enzymes suggest myocardial injury or ischemia. This could be related to the patient's atrial fibrillation or a more widespread cardiac issue. Further evaluation, such as"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old male with history of reported dementia, hear of hearing,
   CAD s/p CABG, Afib s/p PPM who recently was admitted to [**Hospital **] for a left hip fracture after fall, who was found
   down at his NH. He was initially admitted to the floor but was found to
   be intermittently hyportensive and hypernatremic.
   # Hypotension
 The patient
s SBP
s have been stable in the 90
s to
   120
s.  Has not required fluid boluses.  BCx grew out [**3-12**] gram positive
   cocci in pairs and clusters, so his hypotension may have been due to
   bacteremia.
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for broad spectrum coverage and f/u culture
   data/speciation/sensitivities.  If his sputum culture returns negative
   will d/c zosyn.
   - will give intermittent IVF bolus with LR given hypernatremia to
   support his BP prn
   - pt's family ok with CVL/pressors if needed
   # Elevated CK
 The patient had a CK peak yesterday of 1200, however
   the MB fraction is low.  His trops peaked at 0.14.  Given the patient
   recent fall, his elevated CK may be due to muscle break down and not
   cardiac ischemia.
   - Was started back on the heparin gtt overnight, however as this is
   unlikely cardiac will stop the heparin gtt today.
   - Will transfuse 1 unit of PRBC as his Hct is 22.7 for a goal of >25 in
   the setting of elevated CK.
   - f/u TTE today
   # Hypernatremia - Secondary to free water deficit, had been getting 200
   cc/h of D5W overnight.  Now Na is down to 151 ( 8 point drop in 1 day).
   - Will decrease IVF to 100cc D5W/hr
   - Recheck pm lytes.
   # ARF
 Resolved - Cr of 2.5 on admission, now down to 1.2, likely near
   his baseline.  Most likely [**3-10**] to hypovolemia. He has been maintaining
   good urine output.
   # Leukocytosis
 WBC has been trending down, currently at 15.7, on
   vanc/zosyn. Wound with mild erythema, CXR without obvious PNA, U/A
   negative. LFTs unremarkable, no diarrhea.  BCx [**3-12**] grew out gram
   positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
   - follow up blood cultures and urine culture; f/u speciation and
   sensitivities of the positive BCx
   - F/u stool for C. Diff
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for now.
   # s/p recent left hip fracture - Incision appears c/d/i so doubt source
   of infection.
   - pain control as needed
   # CAD - will hold BP meds given hypotension. Will continue ASA and
   statin.
   # T2DM - will cover with ISS.
   # Code - DNR/DNI, confirmed on admission

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of reported dementia, heart of hearing loss, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation (Afib) status post pacemaker placement (PPM), and a recent left hip fracture after a fall. He was admitted to the hospital for the hip fracture but was found to be intermittently hypotensive and hypernatremic. The patient's blood pressure has been stable in the 90s to 120s without requiring fluid boluses. A blood culture grew out 3-12 gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, suggesting bacteremia as a possible cause of hypotension.

The patient's elevated creatine kinase (CK) level may be due to muscle breakdown from the recent fall rather than cardiac ischemia. His troponin levels are within normal range. Heparin was started but will be discontinued as it is unlikely to be cardiac-related.

The patient has hypernatremia secondary to a free water deficit. His sodium level dropped from 151 to 142 after receiving 200 cc/h of D5W overnight. The IV fluid rate will be decreased to 100 cc D5W/hr to prevent further correction of sodium levels.

Acute renal failure (ARF) resolved, with a decrease in creatinine from 2.5 on admission to 1.2. Leukocytosis is trending down with the current"

   [**Age over 90 **] year old male with history of reported dementia, hear of hearing,
   CAD s/p CABG, Afib s/p PPM who recently was admitted to [**Hospital **] for a left hip fracture after fall, who was found
   down at his NH. He was initially admitted to the floor but was found to
   be intermittently hyportensive and hypernatremic. Blood cx with MRSA on
   vanco and zosyn.

   speciated yesterday, unknown cause.  CXR without evidence of PNA.
   Urine cx negative.  Sputum cx contamintated, C. diff negative.  Only
   possible source if surgical incision  from hip fx repair, though wound
   C/D/I. Has been on vanco and zosyn since admission.   BP
s have been
   120-130 over last 24 hours,  Never required pressors.
   - continue vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia for total of 7 days
   - continue zosyn for now pending results of sputum cx.
   - per family, ok for CVL/pressors
   - PICC placed yesterday

   - will get trauma films of shoulder, elbow and wrist
   # Elevated CK
  Resolving. The patient had a CK peak of 1200,
   however the MB fraction was low.  His trops peaked at 0.14.  Given the
   patient
s recent fall, his elevated CK may be due to muscle break down
   and not cardiac ischemia.   Initially tx
ed with heparin gtt which has
   since been stopped as not felt ot be cardiac ischemia. Given anemia and
   concern for cardiac ischemia, was transfused 1 unit of PRBC as his Hct

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of reported dementia, heart of hearing loss, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and atrial fibrillation status post pacemaker placement. He was admitted to the hospital for a left hip fracture after a fall and subsequently developed MRSA bacteremia, hypotension, hypernatremia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and anemia. The patient's blood cultures grew out MRSA, and he has been on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam since admission. His vital signs are stable, and his blood pressure has been within the normal range without the need for pressors. The patient's CK level is elevated but is thought to be due to muscle breakdown rather than cardiac ischemia. His ejection fraction is mildly depressed at 45-50% with infero-lateral hypokinesis. The patient's hypernatremia has resolved with fluid management, and his renal function has improved from a creatinine level of 2.5 on admission to 0.9 currently. The patient's hip fracture incision appears clean and dry, and there are no signs of infection. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, heparin, and morphine sulfate. The patient's family has been informed of his condition and will be arriving by the weekend.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures grew out MRSA, indicating a bacterial infection. He has been on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, which are appropriate treatments for MRSA bacteremia. However, there is a potential for the infection to spread and cause sepsis, leading to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Monitoring for signs of sepsis, such as fever, hypotension, and altered mental status, is crucial.
2. Right Shoulder Pain: The patient fell on his right side at the nursing home, and there is concern for a fracture. Getting trauma films of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist is necessary to assess for any fractures or injuries.
3. Elevated CK: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) level is elevated, but the MB fraction is low, and troponin levels are within normal limits. Given the patient's recent fall, the elevated CK may be due to muscle breakdown rather than cardiac ischemia. However, it is important to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 7.8 g/dL, indicating anemia. This could be due to blood loss from the hip fracture or chronic disease. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygen saturation and symptoms of fatigue or shortness of breath is necessary.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of reported dementia, heart problems, and recent left hip fracture. He was admitted to the hospital for the hip fracture after falling and was initially on the floor but was moved to the ICU due to intermittent hypotension and hypernatremia. He has a blood infection caused by MRSA and has been on vancomycin and zosyn since admission. His blood pressure has stabilized, and he has been weaned off pressors. He has mild symmetric LVH with a slightly depressed EF at 45-50% and infero-lateral hypokinesis. He has resolved hypernatremia and acute renal failure but remains at risk for cardiac ischemia. His incision from the hip fracture repair appears clean and intact. He has a history of CAD, diabetes, and a code status of DNR/DNI. He is currently receiving nutrition through a PICC line and will be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA Sepsis: The patient's blood infection with MRSA can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's elevated CK levels and history of CAD put him at risk for cardiac ischemia. Further evaluation may be needed to determine the extent of any cardiac damage.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As an elderly patient who is immobilized, the patient is at risk for developing DVT. Prophylaxis with heparin has been started, but close monitoring is essential.
4. Pressure Ulcers: Given the patient's immobility and prolonged stay in the ICU, there is a risk for developing pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessments and appropriate pressure relief measures should be implemented.
5. Infection at Surgical Incision: Although the patient's surgical incision appears clean and intact, there is still a risk for infection. Close monitoring and appropriate wound care should be continued.
6. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and history of dementia make him prone to delirium. Frequent assessment and reorientation can help manage this risk.
7. Medication Reactions/Interactions: Due to the patient's multiple comorbidities and medications, there is a risk for medication reactions or interactions. Close monitoring and regular medication reviews are necessary.
8. Falls: Given the patient's recent fall and hip fracture, he remains at risk for further falls. Proper restraints and frequent supervision are required to minimize this risk.
9. Respiratory Complications: The patient's age and immobilization increase the risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis. Adequate oxygenation and pulmonary hygiene measures should be maintained.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. A thorough evaluation of the patient's condition is necessary to determine the actual medical complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, postop hip repair, and dementia. He was admitted to the ICU with fever of unknown origin, possible sepsis, leukocytosis, and hypotension. The patient is currently being treated for MRSA bacteremia of unclear source. He also has hypernatremia, altered mental status (not delirium), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type I, demand ischemia, probable demand ischemia, malnutrition, and LUE pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of possible sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and even death if not promptly treated.
2. MRSA infection: The presence of MRSA bacteremia indicates a potential source of infection that needs to be identified and treated to prevent further complications.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and further deterioration of renal function may require dialysis.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status can progress to delirium, which is characterized by confusion, disorientation, and agitation. Delirium can increase the risk of falls, complications from immobility, and prolonged ICU stay.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates inadequate tissue perfusion, which"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, postoperative hip repair, and dementia. He was admitted to the ICU with fever of unknown origin (FUO), possible sepsis with leukocytosis and hypotension, now with MRSA bacteremia of unclear source. The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of factors including possible infection, hypotension, and pre-existing dementia. He also has hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type I, demand ischemia, malnutrition, and left upper extremity pain.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including prophylactic antibiotics, anticoagulation, and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. He has multiple lines including a 20-gauge line and a PICC line. Prophylactic measures have been taken for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is being prepared for transfer to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current bacteremia and altered mental status suggest a possible ongoing infection, which can progress to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's renal function is improving, but his cardiovascular and respiratory systems may still be at risk due to the presence of AFib and previous demand ischemia.
3. Malnutrition: The patient's mal"
