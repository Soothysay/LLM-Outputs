   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 359**] is a 75 year-old male with COPD, hypertension, and hepatitis C
   transferred to the CCU from the cardiac cath lab due to his high risk
   with significant stenosis of his left main coronary artery while
   awaiting CABG.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient went for cardiac catheterization today and
   was seen to have 90% stenosis in his left main artery.  He has already
   had a NSTEMI at the OSH and is at significant risk for additional
   cardiac events.
   - Continue heparin gtt, aspirin 325 mg daily, and metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - CABG today.
   # PUMP/Hypertension:  The patient has normal systolic function, however
   was seen to have aortic stenosis during the catheterization.  He
   appears euvolemic on exam.
   - Continue enalapril 10 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], and diltiazem
   120 mg daily.
   # RHYTHM:  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   # COPD:  Per the OSH records, his initial CXR there was clear, however
   he was treated for a community-acquired pneumonia with a 5 day course
   of levofloxacin (which finished today).  He was on a steroid taper.
   - CXR as above for pre-CABG workup.
   - Will DC steroids (given their effect on wound healing) as the
   patient
s respiratory symptoms have improved..
   - Continue nebs: Ipratropium q6h and albuterol q6h prn
   # BPH:
   - Continue terazosin 2 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   #  Depression:
   - Continue fluoxetine 20 mg daily and trazodone 150 mg qhs.
   #  GERD/esophageal dysmotility:
   - Continue home omeprazole and reglan.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and hepatitis C. He was transferred to the CCU from the cardiac cath lab due to high risk with significant stenosis of his left main coronary artery while awaiting CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 164/75 mmHg to 98/24 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is alert and appropriate, with no signs of pallor or cyanosis.

His physical examination reveals a normal-sized left atrium and right atrium, with normal left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size. There is a possible mild hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls, but overall left ventricular systolic function is normal. The ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta are mildly dilated, and there is minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen, and the mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal with mild mitral regurgitation. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion are also noted.

The patient has a history"
