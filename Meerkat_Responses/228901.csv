","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx who presented to the ICU with significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site. The patient underwent coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for a hypopharyngeal bleed, as well as tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient also has a history of right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was not an anticoagulation candidate due to recent bleeding. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and the patient is being monitored for signs of pulmonary embolism (PE) or hypoxia. 

The patient has leukocytosis, which could be related to recent events such as bleeding into the oral-pharynx or aspiration pneumonia (APNA). The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is currently on antibiotics. There is also a new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-rays, indicating a possible infection. 

The patient's laryngeal cancer is complicated by recent bleeding from the right inferior thyroid artery, which required coil embolization. The patient is scheduled to receive radiation therapy today. 

Other issues include anemia, hyponatremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a past cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient is currently NPO for a procedure and is receiving IV fluids as needed. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include recurrent bleeding, PE, aspiration pneumonia, and infection due to immunosuppression from cancer and treatment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. He was admitted for a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and is currently experiencing significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site. The patient underwent coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery by interventional radiology and has been sedated and paralyzed with propofol and vecuronium.

The patient's family wishes to transfer all medical care to Hospital1, and the plan is to start radiation at 10 am on [**5-1**] if the patient is stable enough to go to Hospital Ward Name. The oncology team has requested oncology data from Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2760**], and they suggested weekly erbitux (Ab to EGF receptor).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 137/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a significant medical history including a stroke (CVA), hyponatremia, and squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. He was previously admitted for a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and underwent embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for a hypopharyngeal bleed. The patient also had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placed during this admission. 

The patient's current condition includes bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which was initially managed with packing and coiling. The plan is to continue with radiation therapy today and if the bleeding returns, surgery will be necessary. The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and will continue with current antibiotics until the issue is resolved. The sputum culture shows contamination with oral flora. 

The patient's respiratory status is stable on invasive ventilation, with good oxygenation and ventilation parameters. His neurologic examination is intact, and he is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. 

The patient's lab results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and prolonged partial thromboplastin time. The rest of the labs are within normal limits. 

The patient's physical examination reveals 2+ right lower extremity edema with erythema, indicating possible DVT, and a PICC line in place.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a significant medical history including a stroke (CVA), hyponatremia, and squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx (SCC). The patient was admitted for a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequently experienced significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site. 

The patient's current condition includes being sedated and chronically ill appearing, with a tracheostomy in place and mechanically ventilated. The physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, coarse rhonchi throughout the respiratory system, and edema in the right lower extremity. The patient is also noted to have poor dentition and thick clear secretions in the mouth.

Laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal coagulation studies. Imaging reveals a left lower lobe pulmonary infiltrate and atelectasis, which has improved.

The patient's assessment and plan include several issues:

1. Bleeding from tracheostomy site: The bleeding has been packed and coiled, but the patient requires further evaluation by ENT. If the bleeding returns, surgery may be necessary.
2. Right lower extremity DVT: The patient is not an anticoagulation candidate due to recent bleeding. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed.
3. Respiratory: The patient's sedation will be lightened for transfer, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hyponatremia, and squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx (SCC). He presented to the hospital with hemoptysis and bleeding from his tracheostomy site. The patient had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right leg and underwent filter placement. He was initially admitted for the DVT but developed significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site. The bleeding was packed and coiled, and he underwent embolization of his tumor. The patient has a complicated medical history including aspiration pneumonia (PNA), laryngeal cancer, hypertension, anemia, and hyponatremia. He is currently sedated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding from tracheostomy site: The patient had significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which was packed and coiled. Close monitoring and further ENT involvement will be necessary to prevent recurrence.
2. Right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is not an anticoagulation candidate due to recent bleeding. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed to prevent pulmonary embolism.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a significant medical history, including a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hyponatremia, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx. The patient underwent embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleeding and subsequently developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right leg. He was initially transferred to a rehabilitation facility but was readmitted to the hospital last night for filter placement due to the DVT. 

On the floor, around 3-4 am, the patient experienced bleeding from his tracheostomy site, with approximately 150 cc of blood suctioned. The tracheostomy cuff was filled, and the patient was transferred for monitoring. ENT visualized the tracheostomy and suspected bleeding from the mass. 

The patient completed a course of antibiotics for suspected aspiration pneumonia from a prior admission. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). 

The patient's current medications include lisinopril, folic acid, Hep SQ tid, and allopurinol. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the inability to obtain respiratory system information.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a significant medical history including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and previous embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed. The patient also has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hyponatremia, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right leg.

The patient was admitted for the right leg DVT and is now experiencing significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site. The bleeding has been managed by packing and coiling, but the patient needs to be unpacked by ENT as soon as possible. If bleeding returns, the patient may require surgery. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed due to the patient's inability to receive anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's respiratory status is stable on invasive ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, with improved chest x-ray findings. However, there are concerns about aspiration pneumonia (PNA) given the patient's history of aspiration and current tracheostomy. Antibiotics will be continued until the issue is resolved.

The patient has laryngeal cancer complicated by recent bleeding from the right inferior thyroid artery, which has been managed with coil embolization. Further treatment plans include chemotherapy and radiation therapy as an outpatient.

Other medical issues include hypertension, anemia, hy"

","Summary:
The patient is an ICU admission for suspected sepsis secondary to pneumonia. They were intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient underwent angiography and received multiple antibiotics. They are receiving various medications, including propofol, vecuronium, heparin sodium, lorazepam, ranitidine, and labetalol. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 137/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are in place. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, neurologic status, and other systems are not assessed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, while other values are within normal ranges. The patient's airway management and hemoptysis are concerns. The plan includes ongoing ICU care, glycemic control, nutrition, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and cultures will be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and invasive procedures increase the risk"

   67-yo man w/ SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right inferior
   thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p trache and PEG
   [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/ significant bleeding from
   trache site.
   .
   #. Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.
   - if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
   - s/p mapping and first session XRT today, to continue tomorrow.
   - appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement
 ENT plans to remove packing
   tomorrow.  Med onc wants dental work and CT head and neck, hold off on
   CT today given recent dye load in IR.  Readdress in 24-48 hours after
   monitoring creatinine.
   - follow-up Oncology recs regarding additional chemo (? Cisplatin), to
   be started as outpatient.
   - maintain active T&S
   - no anticoagulation
   - will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   .
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Placed on ventilator for further airway
   protection in the setting of refractory bleeding around trach site.
   Decrease Fi02 tonight given most recent ABG with Pa02 124, repeat at
   11pm.  Keep ventilated overnight and tomorrow while packing removed and
   for next rad onc session. Re-eval bleeding prior to consideration of
   extubation.
   .
   #. RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   - no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   .
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved
   today AM. Diff w/ 86% PMNs.
   - f/u sputum cx data
   - send blood, urine cx as well
   - stopped Vanc / Zosyn, start Clinda as above for ENT coverage
   .
   #. Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, due to complete 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco today. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA
   but has had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this
   admission as well as elevated WBC.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - d/c
d today as he has completed a 10 day course
   - cont aspiration precautions, trache care, nebulizers
   .
   #. Laryngeal Ca - Complicated by recent right inferior thyroid artery
   bleed s/p coil embolization [**3-/2177**] by IR. S/p trache and PEG.
   - f/u onc and rad onc recs as above
   - Green team spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**] in [**Hospital3 1959**]
   .
   #. Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   - cont home lisinopril 40mg daily
   - consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   .
   #. Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secodary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   - continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   - s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   .
   #. Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.
   - f/u Osms-> c/w SIADH, so will fluid restrict
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. COPD - No current complaints of SOB or dypnea, increased cough or
   change in sputum production.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx. He was admitted to the ICU for right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently experiencing significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site. The patient underwent coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleeding and subsequently developed an upper gastrointestinal bleed. He also has a history of aspiration pneumonia and has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is mechanically ventilated and receiving propofol infusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding from tracheostomy site: The patient has been experiencing persistent bleeding around the trachea and into the posterior oropharynx despite previous embolization of the superior and inferior thyroid arteries. If the bleeding continues, aggressive ENT surgery may be required.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, and his recent bleeding into the oropharynx increases the risk of recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Sputum cultures are pending, and antibiotics may be necessary.
3. Laryngeal cancer: The patient has SCC of the larynx,"

   Assessment and Plan
   67-yo man w/ SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right inferior
   thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p trache and PEG
   [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/ significant bleeding from
   trache site.
   .
   #. Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.
   - if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
   - s/p mapping and first session XRT today, to continue tomorrow.
   - appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement
 ENT plans to remove packing
   tomorrow.  Med onc wants dental work and CT head and neck, hold off on
   CT today given recent dye load in IR.  Readdress in 24-48 hours after
   monitoring creatinine.
   - follow-up Oncology recs regarding additional chemo (? Cisplatin), to
   be started as outpatient.
   - maintain active T&S
   - no anticoagulation
   - will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   .
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Placed on ventilator for further airway
   protection in the setting of refractory bleeding around trach site.
   Decrease Fi02 tonight given most recent ABG with Pa02 124, repeat at
   11pm.  Keep ventilated overnight and tomorrow while packing removed and
   for next rad onc session. Re-eval bleeding prior to consideration of
   extubation.
   .
   #. RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   - no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   .
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved
   today AM. Diff w/ 86% PMNs.
   - f/u sputum cx data
   - send blood, urine cx as well
   - stopped Vanc / Zosyn, start Clinda as above for ENT coverage
   .
   #. Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, due to complete 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco today. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA
   but has had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this
   admission as well as elevated WBC.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - d/c
d today as he has completed a 10 day course
   - cont aspiration precautions, trache care, nebulizers
   .
   #. Laryngeal Ca - Complicated by recent right inferior thyroid artery
   bleed s/p coil embolization [**3-/2177**] by IR. S/p trache and PEG.
   - f/u onc and rad onc recs as above
   - Green team spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**] in [**Hospital3 1959**]
   .
   #. Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   - cont home lisinopril 40mg daily
   - consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   .
   #. Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secodary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   - continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   - s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   .
   #. Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.
   - f/u Osms-> c/w SIADH, so will fluid restrict
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. COPD - No current complaints of SOB or dypnea, increased cough or
   change in sputum production.
   - continue home nebs
   .
   #. s/p CVA: No active issues. Not on ASA secondary to bleed.

   67-yo man w/ SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right inferior
   thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p trache and PEG
   [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/ significant bleeding from
   trache site.
   .
   #. Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.  Patient was unpacked on [**2177-5-2**] with resolution of the
   bleeding.  We will hold off on getting a CT as recent radiation will
   increase artifact and it likely will not change treatment.
   - if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
   - Continue XRT to head/neck for bleeding control.
   - appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement.
   - follow-up Oncology recs regarding additional chemo (? Cisplatin), to
   be started as outpatient.
   - maintain active T&S
   - no anticoagulation
   - will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   .
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Placed on ventilator for further airway
   protection in the setting of refractory bleeding around trach site.
   Decrease Fi02 tonight given most recent ABG with Pa02 124, repeat at
   11pm.  Keep ventilated overnight and tomorrow while packing removed and
   for next rad onc session. Re-eval bleeding prior to dropping cuff on
   trach.  If not actively bleeding may be able to drop cuff and use trach
   mask.

   #. RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.

   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved
   today AM. Diff w/ 86% PMNs.  WBC improved after switching to clinda.
   - f/u sputum cx data
   - send blood, urine cx as well
   - stopped Vanc / Zosyn, start Clinda as above for ENT coverage
   .
   #. Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, has comlpeted 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA but has
   had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this admission as

   #. Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   - cont home lisinopril 40mg daily
   - consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   .
   #. Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secodary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   - continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   - s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   .
   #. Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.
   - f/u Osms-> c/w SIADH, so will fluid restrict
   - continue to monitor

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx. He underwent coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for a hypopharyngeal bleed, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient was admitted for a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is now experiencing significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Bleeding from tracheostomy site: The patient initially had stable bleeding but developed slow and persistent bleeding around the trachea and into the posterior oropharynx. He underwent embolization of the superior and inferior thyroid artery by a neurointerventional radiologist. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is currently stable, and the bleeding has been resolved after packing removal. However, there is a concern for rebleeding, and the plan is to continue radiation therapy to the head and neck for bleeding control. If rebleeding occurs, the family would want aggressive ENT surgery.

2. Mechanically ventilated: The patient is placed on mechanical ventilation for further airway protection due to refractory bleeding around the tracheostomy site. The FiO2 will be decreased tonight given the recent ABG with a PaO2 of 124, and repeated at 11 pm."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 67 yo man w/ SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right
   inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p trache and
   PEG [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/ significant bleeding from
   trache site.
   .
   #. Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.  Patient was unpacked on [**2177-5-2**] with resolution of the
   bleeding.  We will hold off on getting a CT as recent radiation will
   increase artifact and it likely will not change treatment.
   - if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
   - Continue XRT to head/neck for bleeding control.
   - appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement.
   - follow-up Oncology recs regarding additional chemo (? Cisplatin), to
   be started as outpatient.
   - maintain active T&S
   - no anticoagulation
   - will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   .
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Placed on ventilator for further airway
   protection in the setting of refractory bleeding around trach site.
   Decrease Fi02 tonight given most recent ABG with Pa02 124, repeat at
   11pm.  Keep ventilated overnight and tomorrow while packing removed and
   for next rad onc session. Re-eval bleeding prior to dropping cuff on
   trach.  If not actively bleeding may be able to drop cuff and use trach
   mask.
   -Trial of PS
 attempt to keep off vent.
   .
   #. RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   -no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   - Cont hep SC
   .
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved
   today AM. Diff w/ 86% PMNs.  WBC improved after switching to clinda.
   - f/u sputum cx data
   - send blood, urine cx as well
   - stopped Vanc / Zosyn, start Clinda as above for ENT coverage
   .
   #. Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, has comlpeted 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA but has
   had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this admission as
   well as elevated WBC.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - d/c
d today as he has completed a 10 day course
   - cont aspiration precautions, trache care, nebulizers
   .
   #. Laryngeal Ca - Complicated by recent right inferior thyroid artery
   bleed s/p coil embolization [**3-/2177**] by IR. S/p trache and PEG.
   - f/u onc and rad onc recs as above
   - Green team spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**] in [**Hospital3 1959**]
   .
   #. Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   - cont home lisinopril 40mg daily
   - consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   .
   #. Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secodary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   - continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   - s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   .
   #. Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.
   - f/u Osms-> c/w SIADH, so will fluid restrict
   - continue to monitor
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx, who was admitted to the ICU for a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site. The patient underwent coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for a hypopharyngeal bleed and subsequently developed a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient is currently mechanically ventilated due to refractory bleeding around the tracheostomy site. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding from tracheostomy site - The patient has a history of bleeding, and the tracheostomy site is currently stable. However, there is a concern for rebleeding, which may require aggressive ENT surgery. The patient's Hct (hematocrit) is stable, and the bleeding has been resolved with embolization and packing. It is important to continue radiation therapy to the head/neck for bleeding control and follow up with oncology recommendations regarding additional chemotherapy.

2. Mechanically ventilated - The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation for airway protection due to refractory bleeding around the tracheostomy site. The plan is to decrease FiO2 tonight and repeat at 11 pm. The patient will remain ventilated overnight and tomorrow while packing is removed and for the next radiation oncology session. Re-evaluation of bleeding"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 67 yo man with SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right
   inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p
   tracheostomy and PEG [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/
   significant bleeding from trache site.
   # Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.  Patient was unpacked on [**2177-5-2**] with resolution of the
   bleeding.  He underwent XRT on [**5-1**] and [**5-2**] and there have been no
   bleeding incidents since.
   -if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery (will readdress
   this issue today with patient)
   -continue XRT to head/neck for bleeding control.
   -appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement.
   -medical oncology notes suggest that chemotherapy could be started as
   outpatient with definitive XRT
   -maintain active T&S
   -no anticoagulation
   -will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Placed on ventilator for further airway
   protection in the setting of refractory bleeding around trach site.
   Could consider taking off vent this morning as he has been tolerating
   pressure support [**4-29**] with no difficulty. Re-eval bleeding prior to
   dropping cuff on trach.  If not actively bleeding may be able to drop
   cuff and use trach mask.
   -trial of PS
 attempt to take off vent this morning
   # RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   -no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   -continue HSQ
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved
   today AM. Diff w/ 86% PMNs.  WBC now back to normal.
   -f/u sputum cx data
   -continue Clindamycin as above for ENT coverage
   # Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, has comlpeted 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA but has
   had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this admission as
   well as elevated WBC.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - d/c
d today as he has completed a 10 day course
   - cont aspiration precautions, trache care, nebulizers
   # Laryngeal Ca - Complicated by recent right inferior thyroid artery
   bleed s/p coil embolization [**3-/2177**] by IR. S/p trache and PEG. Will
   begin chemotherapy likely as outpatient.
   # Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   -cont home lisinopril 40 mg daily
   -consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   # Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secondary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   -continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   -s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   # Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 67 yo man with SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right
   inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p
   tracheostomy and PEG [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/
   significant bleeding from trache site.
   # Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.  Patient was unpacked on [**2177-5-2**] with resolution of the
   bleeding.  He underwent XRT on [**5-1**] and [**5-2**] and there have been no
   bleeding incidents since.
   -if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
   -continue XRT to head/neck for bleeding control.
   -appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement.
   -medical oncology notes suggest that chemotherapy could be started as
   outpatient with definitive XRT
   -maintain active T&S
   -no anticoagulation
   -will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Placed on ventilator for further airway
   protection in the setting of refractory bleeding around trach site.
   Could consider taking off vent this morning as he has been tolerating
   pressure support [**4-29**] with no difficulty. Re-eval bleeding prior to
   dropping cuff on trach.  If not actively bleeding may be able to drop
   cuff and use trach mask.

   # RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   -no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   -continue HSQ
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved

   -f/u sputum cx data
   -continue Clindamycin as above for ENT coverage
   # Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, has comlpeted 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA but has
   had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this admission as
   well as elevated WBC.

   begin chemotherapy likely as outpatient.
   # Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   -cont home lisinopril 40 mg daily
   -consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   # Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secondary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   -continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   -s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx who has undergone coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for a hypopharyngeal bleed, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. He was admitted for a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and is currently experiencing significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site. The bleeding has been stabilized with the help of ENT intervention and embolization of the superior and inferior thyroid artery by interventional radiology. The patient underwent radiation therapy on 05/01 and 05/02, and there have been no bleeding incidents since.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding from tracheostomy site - If rebleeds occur, the family would want aggressive ENT surgery, and it is important to continue radiation therapy to the head/neck for bleeding control.
2. Mechanically ventilated - The patient is currently on ventilator support for airway protection due to refractory bleeding around the tracheostomy site. Considering taking off the vent this morning as he has been tolerating pressure support without difficulty.
3. Right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - The patient has a history of decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy, which are risk factors for DVT. He has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed and no signs of pulmonary embolism (PE) or"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. He underwent tracheostomy and packing for significant pharyngeal bleeding, which has since been removed without rebleeding. The patient is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is undergoing trials of spontaneous breathing. He is receiving clindamycin as prophylaxis against infection. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% FiO2. His heart rate is within normal limits, and blood pressure is stable. 

The patient's recent history includes embolization for hemoptysis and placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter due to a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The DVT treatment was complicated by significant upper airway bleeding. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 18.0 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, and a platelet count of 488. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

The patient's imaging includes a chest X-ray taken on 5-2, which was reviewed. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring for respiratory failure, hemoptysis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and laryngeal cancer. The patient will continue to be watched for a possible drop in hemoglobin due to ongoing bleeding. A repeat CT"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 67 yo man with SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right
   inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p
   tracheostomy and PEG [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/
   significant bleeding from trache site.
   # Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.  Patient was unpacked on [**2177-5-2**] with resolution of the
   bleeding.  He underwent XRT on [**5-1**] and [**5-2**] and there have been no
   bleeding incidents since.
   -if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
 However this
   decision was made a while ago and may need to be readdressed with him
   and his family.
   -continue XRT to head/neck for bleeding control.
   -appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement.
   -medical oncology notes suggest that chemotherapy could be started as
   outpatient with definitive XRT
   -maintain active T&S
   -no anticoagulation
   -will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Patient now weaned off to trach mask and
   doing well.
   # RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   -no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   -continue HSQ
   # Leukocytosis: No new infectious source found. WBC improving on clinda
   and he has reached a baseline [**10-5**].
   -f/u sputum cx data
   -continue Clindamycin as above for ENT coverage
   # Aspiration PNA
 Completed course of ABX for asp pna for MRSA.
   -Cont asp precautions.
   # Laryngeal Ca - Complicated by recent right inferior thyroid artery
   bleed s/p coil embolization [**3-/2177**] by IR. S/p trache and PEG. Will
   begin chemotherapy likely as outpatient.
   # Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   -cont home lisinopril 40 mg daily
   -consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   # Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secondary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   -continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   -s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   # Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.
   Sodium today WNL.
   -continue to monitor
   #. COPD - No current complaints of SOB or dypnea, increased cough or
   change in sputum production.
   -continue home nebs
   # S/p CVA: No active issues. Not on ASA secondary to bleed.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, who underwent coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleeding, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. He was admitted for a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and developed significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site. The bleeding was initially stable upon arrival to the ICU but on hospital day 2, the patient developed slow and persistent bleeding around the trachea and into the posterior oropharynx. The patient was packed by ENT and underwent embolization of the superior and inferior thyroid artery by interventional radiology. His hematocrit (Hct) is currently stable.

The patient underwent radiation therapy (XRT) on [5-1] and [5-2] and there have been no bleeding incidents since. The family's preference is for aggressive ENT surgery if rebleeds occur, but this decision was made a while ago and may need to be readdressed with the patient and his family. Continuing XRT to the head and neck for bleeding control is also recommended. 

The patient is no longer mechanically ventilated and has been weaned off the ventilator to a tracheostomy mask and is doing well. He has a history of right lower extremity DVT without signs of pulmonary embolism (PE) or hemodynamic instability"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. He presented with significant pharyngeal bleeding and underwent tracheostomy and packing for bleeding control. Initial mapping and radiation therapy (XRT) have been performed, with encouraging absence of bleeding following removal of packing. The patient is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is set to undergo a trial of spontaneous breathing (TM) today. He continues to receive clindamycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic. 

The patient's recent history includes hemoptysis, for which he underwent embolization and had packing removed two days ago without rebleeding. His hemoglobin concentration (Hct) will continue to be monitored, and a repeat CT scan will be done when XRT is stabilized. The patient has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently not anticoagulated due to recent bleeding. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed. 

The patient's laryngeal cancer will require discussion regarding the patient's wishes for surgery if he rebleeds, as he was sedated during the family meeting. In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving Nutren Pulmonary (Full) nutritional support at 60 mL/hour. His glycemic control is being monitored. The patient has two lines in place: a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line and an 18-gauge line. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is being provided. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor soon. The physician spent a total of 35 minutes with the patient. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience respiratory failure due to his underlying laryngeal cancer and recent bleeding. Tolerating PSV and undergoing a TM trial today indicate efforts to improve respiratory function.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient's history of hemoptysis suggests a risk of recurrent bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
3. DVT: The patient has been diagnosed with DVT, indicating a potential risk of clot propagation or pulmonary embolism if not properly managed.
4. Bleeding: Given the patient's recent significant pharyngeal bleeding and history of hemoptysis, there is a risk of further bleeding events, particularly if the patient rebleeds and requires surgical intervention.
5. Infection: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (clindamycin), indicating a concern for infection, which can be a complication in ICU settings."
