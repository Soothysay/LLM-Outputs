   Assessment and Plan
   48M h/o seizure disorder, recently started on bactrim for lower
   extremity cellulitis, transfered from OSH with fever, seizure,
   hypotension, and diffuse erythematous rash.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely infectious vs distributive.  No evidence of
   bleeding but did have fever to 103.5 at OSH, though no clear source
   thus far (OSH CXR nl, UA unremarkable); empiric tx for bacterial
   meningitis while awaiting LP.  Given CVP 17-18 after 4L @ OSH and 2-3L
   here, concerning for distributive etiology, particularly in setting of
   diffuse erythematous rash.
   - F/u cx.
   - plan for IR-guided LP on Monday; allow coumadin to drift down
   - treat with empiric antibiotics (CTX, vanco, acyclovir) until then
   given febrile seizure.
   - continue IVF hydration, switch to LR, for goal CVP>[**11-11**].
   - start levophed gtt if MAP<65 despite CVP>[**11-11**].
   - continue H1 and H2 blockade x 24-48hrs given concern for anaphylactic
   reaction to bactrim.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Concerning for infectious process, but may be drug
   induced. Possible sources include parvo, bactrim, dilantin.
   - stop bactrim
   - change to keppra and d/c dilantin
   - Will not attempt LP today due to fluid overload (would need FFP prior
   to LP); plan for IR-guided
   - continue current Abx
   - continue to trend blood counts; Heme/Onc consult
   .
   # respiratory failure: Acute decompensation in airway [**12-31**] agitation,
   then treated with haldol/ativan causing relaxation of airway protection
   in the setting of tongue edema.  CXR also consistent with volume
   overload [**12-31**] aggressive fluid repletion, with likely component of
   distributive vasodilation.
   - pt intubated semi-emergently.
   - continue AC 50% 500 19  5 (7.26/43/78).
   - fentanyl/versed gtt.
   - Diuresis with 20mg lasix x1, then lasix gtt for goal 1.5 to 2 L neg.
   - monitor UOP closely.
   .
   # Agitation: At baseline, pt with ""3rd grade education"", now s/p
   febrile seizure, likely some component of confusion, with poor mental
   reserve, exacerbated by possible infection.  Tox screens negative
   except benzos on urine (? [**12-31**] benzos in hospital)
   - workup infection as above.
   - prn haldol and ativan for agitation.
   .
   # Seizure: s/p febrile seizure today, s/p phosphenytoin load at OSH.
   - Obtain records of seizure history.
   - Appreciate Neurology consult recs; f/u recs and obtain OSH seizure hx
   records if possible.
   - f/u final OSH CT HEAD [**Location (un) **].
   - infectious workup as above
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Cont IV synthroid but wean as tolerated.
   .
   # ARF - likely pre-renal given insensible losses.  Cr 2.1 @ OSH, now
   1.5 after 4L IVF (per report).  ddx also includes rhabdo s/p seizure
   (CK 1116), AIN given recent abx, ATN [**12-31**] hypotension.  Currently making
   urine (400cc in foley upon arrival).
   - check UA for myoglobin, urine lytes, eos.
   - continue fluid repletion cautiously (CVP=18 presently), use LR.
   - GAP = 11.
   .
   # Elevated - on coumadin for h/o DVT/ CVP, elevation maybe [**12-31**] abx.
   - hold coumadin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder, who presented to the hospital with fever, seizure, hypotension, and diffuse erythematous rash. He was transferred from the outpatient setting (OSH) and started on bactrim for lower extremity cellulitis. Upon arrival, he was found to have pancytopenia, respiratory failure, agitation, and acute kidney injury. He was given empiric antibiotics (CTX, vanco, acyclovir) and fluids, but subsequently developed hypotension and required intubation due to airway compromise. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, agitation, seizure disorder, hypothyroidism, acute kidney injury, and elevated INR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to an infectious or distributive cause. It is important to monitor and treat this condition promptly to maintain adequate perfusion and prevent further complications.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and platelet count may indicate an infectious process or drug-induced bone marrow suppression. It is necessary to identify the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute decompensation in airway and subsequent intubation suggest respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory status are essential.
4. Seizure Disorder: The patient's recent febrile seizure and history of seizure disorder require ongoing evaluation and management. Antiepileptic drugs may be necessary to control seizure activity.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism needs ongoing treatment with thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
6. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury. Further evaluation of renal function and appropriate management are required.
7. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR) suggests a coagulation disorder. It is necessary to identify the cause and adjust anticoagulation therapy accordingly.
8. Diffuse Erythematous Rash: The patient's diffuse erythematous rash may be related to an allergic reaction or an infectious process. Monitoring and treatment are essential.
9. Anaphylactic Reaction: The patient's history of anaphylactic reaction to bactrim should be taken into consideration when selecting future antibiotic therapy.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information and diagnostic tests may be required for a comprehensive assessment and accurate diagnosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   48M h/o seizure disorder, recently started on bactrim for lower
   extremity cellulitis, transfered from OSH with fever, seizure,
   hypotension, and diffuse erythematous rash.
   .
   # hypotension - infectious vs distributive etiology most likely.  no
   evidence of bleeding.  he did have fever to 103.5 at OSH, though no
   clear source thus far (OSH CXR nl, UA unremarkable).  LFTs and
   abdominal exam normal.  Given CVP 17-18 after 4L @ OSH and 2-3L here,
   concerning for distributive etiology, particularly in setting of
   diffuse erythematous rash.  will proceed as follows:
   - check CXR, UA, UCx, BCx.
   - plan for LP, will need to reverse with 2-3 UNITS FFP, and repeat INR,
   so will treat with empiric antibiotics (CTX, vanco, acyclovir) until
   then given febrile seizure.
   - continue IVF hydration, switch to LR, for goal CVP>[**11-11**].
   - start levophed gtt if MAP<65 despite CVP>[**11-11**].
   - continue H1 and H2 blockade x 24-48hrs given concern for anaphalactic
   reaction to bactrim.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: concerning for infectious process, but may be drug
   induced. Possible sources include Pna, meningitis, LLE cellulitis.
   Could not get LP yesterday despite multiple attempts.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be due
   to Bactrim, dilantin.
   - stop bactrim
   - change to keppra and d/c dilantin
   - Will not attempt LP today due to fluid overload (would need FFP prior
   to LP)
   - continue current Abx
   - continue to trend blood counts and consider Heme/Onc consult
   .
   # respiratory failure - acute decompensation in airway [**12-31**] agitation,
   then treated with haldol/ativan causing relaxation of airway protection
   in the setting of tongue edema.  CXR also consistent with volume
   overload [**12-31**] aggressive fluid repletion, with likely component of
   distributive vasodilation.
   - pt intubated semi-emergently.
   - continue AC 50% 500 19  5 (7.26/43/78).
   - fentanyl/versed gtt.
   - Diuresis with 20mg lasix x1 with lasix gtt for goal 1.5 to 2 L neg.
   - monitor UOP closely.
   .
   # agitation - at baseline, pt with ""3rd grade education"", now s/p
   febrile seizure, likely some component of confusion, with poor mental
   reserve, exacerbated by possible infection.
   - workup infection as above.
   - add-on tox screen.
   - prn haldol and ativan for agitation.
   .
   # seizure - s/p febrile seizure today, s/p phosphenytoin load at OSH.
   - obtain records of seizure history.
   - neurology consult placed, appreciate recs.
   - check phenytoin level in AM.
   - continue dilantin -> iv dosing 200mg po bid.
   - check tox screen.
   - f/u final OSH CT HEAD [**Location (un) **].
   - infectious workup as above.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo male admit with rash and concern for medication reaction
   initially with presentation complicated by seizure and now with
   persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   1)Panocytopenia-Significant drop by 50% at this time in PLTS and
   WBC
this is in the setting of some volume but certainly not enough to
   explain change by any means.  Certainly medication reaction leading to
   marrow suppression seems most likely at this time.
   -Will consider Bactrim most likely but will change anti-seizure
   medications given possible Dilantin toxicity as contributor
   -Will check viral source
Parvovirus leading suspect from viral
   standpoint
   -Heme to consult to aid in expansion of differential and consideration
   of further testing
   -Will check DIC labs and evaluate to make sure that CVL is not heparin
   coated
   2)Respiratory Failure-_This is hypoxemic respiratory failure which now
   is dominated by significant bilateral pulmonary edema.  We have CVP
   elevation to 17 today.  In addition treatment for likely bacterial
   pneumonia is ongoing and in place.
   -Diuresis today
   -Continue SBX
   -Wean PEEP as possible
   -Lasix gtt today to move to diuresis at goal 2-3 liters negative
   3)Rash-Dermatology into evaluate patient and appreciate support in
   evaluation.
   -Benadryl for now
   -Will continue to evaluate with Derm support
   Seizure-
   -Dilantin in place
will change to keppra for reasons noted above.
   -Concern raised for possible CNS infection and LP attempted over the
   course of multiple hours following FFP administration.  This was
   attempted by all members of the ICU team and no CSF was able to be
   obtained despite multiple attempts.
   -At this time today
patient has need for negative fluid balance with
   marked decrease in compliance and significant evolution of pulmonary
   edema and will not be able to correct coag abnormality today without
   worsening pulmonary status.  Given inability of ICU team to obtain CSF
   will need to move to IR based procedure vs. neurology team attempt.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male who was admitted with a rash and concern for medication reaction. The patient's presentation has been complicated by a seizure and persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are as follows:

1. Panocytopenia: The patient has experienced a significant drop in platelet count (PLTS) and white blood cell count (WBC), which is concerning. The cause could be medication-induced marrow suppression, especially considering the recent administration of Bactrim. Further evaluation and consultation with a hematologist may be necessary to expand the differential diagnosis and consider further testing.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is now dominated by significant bilateral pulmonary edema. The elevated central venous pressure (CVP) of 17 indicates fluid overload. Treatment for likely bacterial pneumonia is ongoing, and diuresis should be initiated to manage the pulmonary edema. The patient's respiratory support should be continued, and efforts should be made to wean the PEEP as possible.

3. Rash: The patient's dermatological evaluation is ongoing, and Benadryl has been given for now. Dermatology support will continue to evaluate the rash and determine appropriate management.

4. Seizure: Dilantin has been started for seizure management, but it will be changed to keppra due to potential toxicity. There are concerns about"

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   48M h/o seizure disorder, recently started on Bactrim for lower
   extremity cellulitis, transferred from OSH with fever, seizure,
   hypotension, and diffuse erythematous rash
   .
   # Hypotension:  Maintaining BP off of pressors. Still spiking fevers
   sepsis was likely a source. Patient to have LP this morning to assess
   for meningitis. Results will need to be interpreted with understanding
   that the patient has been on antibiotics for 48 hours now. Distributive
   etiology initially suspected, and patient was initially started on
   steroids for ?anaphylaxis related to Bacrim.
   - F/u culture data
   - Plan for IR-guided LP this morning
   - Continue meningitis treatment with CTX, vanco, acyclovir
   - Currently off of levophed gtt
   - Can discontinue steroids, H1 blocker which were started for
   anaphylaxis
   .
   # Pancytopenia:  Per heme/onc, likely related to Bactrim. Infection
   also likely a contributor
   - Bactrim held, and put on allergy list
   - Continue current Abx
   - Continue to trend blood counts
   - Heme-onc recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Acute decompensation in airway [**12-31**] agitation,
   then treated with haldol/ativan causing relaxation of airway protection
   in the setting of tongue edema.  CXR also consistent with volume
   overload [**12-31**] aggressive fluid repletion, with likely component of
   distributive vasodilation.
        This morning with pH 7.51, likely due to contraction alkalosis and
   respiratory alkalosis
   - Will decrease RR with hope of increasing pCO2, lowering pH
 this
   should help with respiratory drive as well
   - Fentanyl/Versed
 wean sedation, attempt to transition to pressure
   support this afternoon
   - Patient still fluid up
 autodiuresing well off of Lasix gtt; will
   monitor urine output closely, and give Lasix as needed for goal UOP
   150+cc/hour
   .
   # Agitation:  At baseline, pt with ""3rd grade education"", now s/p
   febrile seizure, likely some component of confusion, with poor mental
   reserve, exacerbated by possible infection.  Tox screens negative
   except benzos on urine (? [**12-31**] benzos in hospital)
   - workup infection as above.
   - prn haldol and ativan for agitation.
   .
   # Seizure: s/p febrile seizure on admission, s/p phosphenytoin load at
   OSH.
   - Obtain records of seizure history.
   - Decrease phenytoin dose as supratherapeutic
   - Appreciate Neurology consult recs; f/u recs and obtain OSH seizure hx
   records if possible.
   - f/u final OSH CT HEAD [**Location (un) **].
   - infectious workup as above
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Cont IV synthroid but wean as tolerated.
   .
   # ARF:  Resolved. Was likely pre-renal given insensible losses.  Cr 2.1
   @ OSH, now 1.5 after 4L IVF (per report).  ddx also includes rhabdo s/p
   seizure (CK 1116), AIN given recent abx, ATN [**12-31**] hypotension.
   Currently making urine (400cc in foley upon arrival).
   .
   # H/o DVT:  Coumadin currently on-hold in anticipation of LP

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder, who was recently started on Bactrim for lower extremity cellulitis. He was transferred from another hospital with fever, seizure, hypotension, and diffuse erythematous rash. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), pancytopenia, agitation, and hypothyroidism. He also has a history of DVT.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Organ dysfunction: The patient's condition can worsen and progress to septic shock or organ failure if the sepsis is not effectively managed.

2. Meningitis: The patient is scheduled for an interventional radiology (IR)-guided lumbar puncture (LP) to assess for meningitis. If meningitis is present, it will require appropriate antibiotic treatment.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has been diagnosed with pancytopenia, which is likely related to Bactrim. If left untreated, pancytopenia can lead to an increased risk of infection, bleeding, and other complications.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to acute decompensation. Improving his respiratory status will be crucial to prevent further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).

5. Agitation: The patient"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis, respiratory failure, and pancytopenia. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to Bactrim. The patient's temperature is 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate is 89 beats per minute, blood pressure is 111/64 mmHg, respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 94% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 1120 cells/microliter, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 182,000 cells/microliter, and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL. The patient's kidney function is within normal limits, but liver enzymes are elevated. The patient's electrolytes are also abnormal, with low sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. The patient's condition has been stable, but there is concern for potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)."

   hypotension, and diffuse erythematous rash.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely infectious vs distributive.  No evidence of
   bleeding but did have fever to 103.5 at OSH, though no clear source
   thus far (OSH CXR nl, UA unremarkable); empiric tx for bacterial
   meningitis while awaiting LP.  Given CVP 17-18 after 4L @ OSH and 2-3L
   here, concerning for distributive etiology, particularly in setting of
   diffuse erythematous rash.
   - F/u cx.
   - plan for IR-guided LP on Monday; allow coumadin to drift down
   - treat with empiric antibiotics (CTX, vanco, acyclovir) until then
   given febrile seizure.
   - continue IVF hydration, switch to LR, for goal CVP>[**11-11**].
   - start levophed gtt if MAP<65 despite CVP>[**11-11**].
   - continue H1 and H2 blockade x 24-48hrs given concern for anaphylactic
   reaction to bactrim.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Concerning for infectious process, but may be drug
   induced. Possible sources include parvo, bactrim, dilantin.
   - stop bactrim
   - change to keppra and d/c dilantin
   - Will not attempt LP today due to fluid overload (would need FFP prior
   to LP); plan for IR-guided
   - continue current Abx

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder, who was recently started on Bactrim for lower extremity cellulitis. He was transferred from another hospital with fever, seizure, hypotension, and a diffuse erythematous rash. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS. He is currently intubated semi-emergently and receiving aggressive fluid repletion due to volume overload and distributive vasodilation. 

The patient's current medications include Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Acyclovir, Furosemide (Lasix), Fentanyl, Dilantin, Pepcid, and Coumadin. He is also receiving IV fluids, vasopressors, and diuretics as needed.

The patient's lab results show pancytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and renal failure. His blood cultures are negative, and his urine culture is also negative. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a diffuse macular rash with resolution centrally and persistent findings peripherally. His neurological examination shows a downgoing toes and withdrawal to pain. His respiratory status is compromised, and he requires mechanical ventilation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder, recently started on Bactrim for lower extremity cellulitis. He was transferred from another hospital with fever, seizure, hypotension, and diffuse erythematous rash. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has a fever, elevated white blood cell count, and an altered mental status.

The patient's current conditions include meningitis, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, agitation, seizure, hypothyroidism, acute renal failure (ARF), and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is being treated with antibiotics, sedation, and anticonvulsants as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Meningitis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever indicate an ongoing infection. The elevated protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid suggests meningitis. It is important to continue treatment with appropriate antibiotics.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low blood cell counts may be due to a drug reaction or infection. Holding the Bactrim and monitoring blood counts are recommended. Further consultation with hematology/oncology is advised.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute decompensation in airway management and tongue edema indicate a high risk for further respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of sedation levels are necessary. Consideration for"

   48M h/o seizure disorder, recently started on Bactrim for lower
   extremity cellulitis, transferred from OSH with fever, seizure,
   hypotension, and diffuse erythematous rash
   .
   # Meningitis: Sepsis v. distributive in setting of ?bactrim allergy
   (tx
d with steroids and H1 blocker initially). Afebrile overnight with
   LP cell count with elevated prot but only 15 WBC; difficult to
   interpret in setting of abx tx x 48 h.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue meningitis treatment with CTX, vanco, acyclovir for now
   .
   # Pancytopenia:  Per heme/onc, likely related to Bactrim. Infection
   also likely a contributor.
   - Bactrim held and put on allergy list
   - Continue current Abx
   - Continue to trend blood counts
   - F/u Heme-onc recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Acute decompensation in airway [**12-31**] agitation,
   then treated with haldol/ativan causing relaxation of airway protection
   in the setting of tongue edema.  CXR also consistent with volume
   overload [**12-31**] aggressive fluid repletion, with likely component of
   distributive vasodilation; cont good UO off diuretic. Sedation weaned
   and now transitioned to PS with good ABG but elevated RSBI.
   - This morning with pH 7.51, likely due to contraction alkalosis and
   respiratory alkalosis
   - Cont light sedation with propofol and fentanyl boluses prn; RSBI/PST
   as tolerated
   - Autodiuresing well off of Lasix gtt; will monitor urine output
   closely, and give Lasix as needed for goal UOP 150+cc/hour
   .
   # Agitation:  At baseline, pt with ""3rd grade education"", now s/p
   febrile seizure, likely some component of confusion, with poor mental
   reserve, exacerbated by possible infection.  Tox screens negative
   except benzos on urine (? [**12-31**] benzos in hospital)
   - workup infection as above.
   - prn haldol and ativan for agitation.
   .
   # Seizure: s/p febrile seizure on admission, s/p phosphenytoin load at
   OSH. Phenytoin level therapeutic today
   - F/u Neurology consult recs
   - infectious workup as above
   - Obtain records of seizure history if possible; f/u final OSH CT HEAD
   [**Location (un) **]
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Cont IV synthroid but transition to po as tolerated.
   .
   # ARF:  Resolved. Was likely pre-renal given insensible losses.  Cr 2.1
   @ OSH, now 1.5 after 4L IVF (per report).  dDx also includes rhabdo s/p
   seizure (CK 1116), AIN given recent abx, ATN [**12-31**] hypotension.
   Currently making urine (400cc in foley upon arrival).

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder, recently started on Bactrim for lower extremity cellulitis, transferred from OSH with fever, seizure, hypotension, and diffuse erythematous rash. The patient has been diagnosed with meningitis, sepsis, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, agitation, seizure, hypothyroidism, acute renal failure (ARF), and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Summary of Progress:
- NGT placed by RN, position confirmed
- Propofol weaned; more awake; RSBI 126
- PICC placed with plan to pull CVL once fosphenytoin given
- Continued good diuresis without additional Lasix
- Good response to sedation with propofol and fentanyl boluses prn; RSBI/PST as tolerated
- Autodiuresing well off of Lasix gtt; will monitor urine output closely, and give Lasix as needed for goal UOP 150+cc/hour
- Phenytoin level therapeutic today
- IV synthroid continued but transitioned to po as tolerated
- Foley catheter placed, currently making urine (400cc in foley upon arrival)
- Restart coumadin today for goal INR [**1-1**]
- Lovenox started for DVT prophylaxis
- H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis
- VAP bundle implemented

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient is being treated with antibiotics, but the presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count suggests ongoing infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of deterioration or worsening of mental status.
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's hypotension, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers, there is a concern for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and organ function is necessary to detect any deterioration.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's low blood counts could be due to Bactrim-induced bone marrow suppression. Monitoring of blood counts and symptoms of infection or bleeding is important.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with an elevated RSBI. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is required. Weaning of sedation should be done cautiously.
5. Agitation: The patient's baseline agitation may be exacerbated by infection or seizure. Sedation with propofol and fentanyl can be used as needed, but close monitoring for respiratory depression is necessary.
6. Seizure: The patient had a febrile seizure upon admission and received fosphenytoin loading. Phenytoin levels are therapeutic, but ongoing seizure activity or postictal state should be monitored.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient is on IV synthroid, which will be transitioned to oral as tolerated. Monitoring of thyroid function and symptoms of hypothy"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder who was recently started on Bactrim for lower extremity cellulitis. He was transferred from another hospital with fever, seizure, hypotension, and diffuse erythematous rash.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including meningitis, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, agitation, seizure, hypothyroidism, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/73 mmHg to 163/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated liver enzymes. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient is currently being treated with various medications including antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftriaxone), antiviral medication (acyclovir), sedatives (propofol and ativan), and antipsychotic medication (haldol). He is also receiving lovenox bridge therapy for his DVT.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include worsening of respiratory failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder, recently started on Bactrim for lower extremity cellulitis. He was transferred from the outside hospital with fever, seizure, hypotension, and diffuse erythematous rash. The patient has been diagnosed with meningitis, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, agitation, seizure, hypothyroidism, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient is currently being treated with ceftriaxone (CTX), vancomycin (Vanco), and acyclovir. It is important to monitor for any deterioration in mental status or new focal neurological deficits.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low blood counts may be due to Bactrim or an underlying hematological condition. Continuing to trend blood counts and following up with hematology/oncology recommendations is crucial.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced acute decompensation in airway agitation. Close monitoring of respiratory status and adjusting sedation as needed with propofol and fentanyl boluses is necessary.
4. Agitation: The patient's confusion and poor mental reserve may be exacerbated by possible infection. Infection workup should be continued, and agitation should be managed with haloperidol and ativan as needed.
5. Seizure: The patient had a febrile"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old male who presented to the ICU with altered mental status and respiratory failure. He was previously extubated but experienced agitation post-extubation, for which PRN haldol was ordered. HSV PCR results were negative, leading to the discontinuation of acyclovir. The patient pulled out his NGT at around 8 PM, and his medications, including levothyroxine and phenytoin, were switched to IV. A speech and swallow evaluation is scheduled to determine if another NGT is necessary. The patient's allergies include Bactrim (oral) and anaphylaxis. His last doses of antibiotics were acyclovir on 05/08/2193 at 01:27 PM, vancomycin on 05/08/2193 at 08:00 PM, and ceftriaxone on 05/09/2193 at 03:39 AM.

Infusions include dilantin, famotidine (Pepcid), enoxaparin (Lovenox), and other medications. There have been no changes to the patient's medical or family history. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data shows that the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 83 bpm with a range of 79-111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from "

   Assessment and Plan
   48M h/o seizure disorder, recently started on Bactrim for lower
   extremity cellulitis, transferred from OSH with fever, seizure,
   hypotension, and diffuse erythematous rash
   # Meningitis: LP results c/w partially treated meningitis. HSV PCR
   negative and ACV stopped.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue meningitis treatment with CTX, vanco X 14 days. (Day #7)
   # Pancytopenia:  Per heme/onc likely [**12-31**] bactrim. Infection also likely
   a contributor. Resolving over last few days.
   - Bactrim held and put on allergy list
   # Agitation:  At baseline, pt with MR and afraid of hospitals now s/p
   febrile seizure, likely some component of confusion, with poor mental
   reserve, exacerbated by possible infection.
   - prn haldol and ativan for agitation.
   # Seizure: s/p febrile seizure on admission, s/p phosphenytoin load at
   OSH.
   - Phenytoin level at goal yesterday
   - F/u Neurology consult recs
   - infectious workup as above
   - EEG c/w encephalopathy. No seizures.
   # H/o DVT: On lovenox but NPO so coumadin being held.
   - Will re-start coumadin if passes speech and swallow. Otherwise may
   require feeding tube placement but will likely not tolerate NGT again.

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder, recently started on Bactrim for lower extremity cellulitis. He was transferred from OSH with fever, seizure, hypotension, and diffuse erythematous rash. The patient has been diagnosed with partially treated meningitis, as indicated by LP results, and HSV PCR negative. Acyclovir has been stopped.

The patient is also experiencing pancytopenia, likely due to bactrim and infection. Bactrim has been held and added to the allergy list. The patient's agitation is at baseline, with MR and fear of hospitals, exacerbated by possible infection. He is receiving prn haldol and ativan for agitation.

Additionally, the patient had a febrile seizure on admission and received a phenytoin load at OSH. Phenytoin levels were at goal yesterday. The patient's EEG showed encephalopathy but no seizures.

The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on lovenox. Coumadin is being held due to the patient being NPO. It will be restarted if the patient passes speech and swallow evaluation, otherwise, a feeding tube placement may be required.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/72 to 171/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths"
