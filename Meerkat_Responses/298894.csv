   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo F w/ DMI and Hx of recurrent DKA p/w DKA
   .
   <I>PLAN:</I>
   .
   <I>## DKA: Tachycardic, but normotensive. Given diarrhea also likely
   very behind on fluid and potassium. AG 32 on presentation. Will need to
   check VBG for pH. Given low sodium will continue to replete with NS and
   give PO potassium. Checking Q2 lytes for now. last FS glucose 280 on
   insulin drip at 6U/hr. When FS glucose 200 will switch to 3U/hr and
   start SC insulin as well as D5NS. Possibly could have been set off by
   acute stress from family situation with increased cortisol vs. acute
   gastroenteritis. Possible C.diff given recent course of cipro.
   - stool for c.diff
   - Q2 lytes then switch to Q4 once glucose<200
   - NS at 1L/hr until glucose<200 then D5NS
   - PO potassium repletion if tolerating PO.
   - Continue insulin ggt at 6U/hr until FS glucose 200 then decrease to
   3U/hr.
   .
   <I>## Recurrent DKA/poorly controlled DM:</I>Pt. has been hospitalized
   several times for this problem in the last several months. One occasion
   [**1-2**] gastroenteritis, one [**1-2**] URI, one [**1-2**] UTI. Appears infection may be
   contributing, possible that pt. does not eat enough or misses her
   insulin when she is feeling ill or stressed psychologically.
   - Stool for c.diff
   - Diabetes teaching
   - close PCP f/u
   .
   <I>## Chest tightness:</I>Resolved. EKG tachycardic w/o signs of
   ischemia. not characteristic for CAD as no actual pain but difficulty
   taking deep breath more c/w anxiety per pt.  negative stress one month
   ago at [**Hospital1 183**]. Has been r/o for MI many times w/ negative troponins. Pt.
   is however poorly controlled diabetic, will have lower threshold for
   checking cardiac enzymes.
   - continue home ASA
   .
   <I>## Diarrhea:</I>Given recent cipro would be concerning for c.diff.
   Also could be viral gastroenteritis, but denies sick contacts. U/A
   negative so doubt recurrent UTI. Very little abd pain and started after
   N/V/D, and no vaginal discharge so doubt PID.
   - stool for c.diff
   - IVF
   .
   <I>## Back pain:</I>per pt. is worse w/ psychological stress. Will try
   to avoid narcotics as would set pt. up for long term narcotics
   dependence as she will likely continue to have psychosocial stressors.
   - Outpt. f/u w/ PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Tylenol for pain
   - Treat anxiety/depression as outpt.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of depression and multiple hospital admissions for recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She presented with DKA and has been treated with insulin and fluid resuscitation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5Â°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 93/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is receiving insulin and has an ongoing infusion of regular insulin at 4.5 units per hour. The patient's laboratory results show a high blood glucose level, elevated white blood cell count, and low sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels. The patient is also experiencing diarrhea, which may be due to a possible Clostridium difficile infection. The plan includes checking venous blood gas for pH, repleting fluids and electrolytes, and starting oral potassium repletion once tolerated. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose level indicates uncontrolled diabetes, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.

2. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's low sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels suggest electrolyte disturbances. These imbalances can affect various bodily functions and need to be corrected promptly.

3. Infection: The presence of diarrhea raises concerns about possible infections such as Clostridium difficile. The patient's recent course of cipro"

   <I>## DKA: Tachycardic, but normotensive. Given diarrhea also likely
   very behind on fluid and potassium. AG 32 on presentation. Will need to
   check VBG for pH. Given low sodium will continue to replete with NS and
   give PO potassium. Checking Q2 lytes for now. last FS glucose 280 on
   insulin drip at 6U/hr. When FS glucose 200 will switch to 3U/hr and
   start SC insulin as well as D5NS. Possibly could have been set off by
   acute stress from family situation with increased cortisol vs. acute
   gastroenteritis. Possible C.diff given recent course of cipro.
   - stool for c.diff
   - Q2 lytes then switch to Q4 once glucose<200
   - NS at 1L/hr until glucose<200 then D5NS
   - PO potassium repletion if tolerating PO.
   - Continue insulin ggt at 6U/hr until FS glucose 200 then decrease to
   3U/hr.
   .
   <I>## Recurrent DKA/poorly controlled DM:</I>Pt. has been hospitalized
   several times for this problem in the last several months. One occasion
   [**1-2**] gastroenteritis, one [**1-2**] URI, one [**1-2**] UTI. Appears infection may be
   contributing, possible that pt. does not eat enough or misses her
   insulin when she is feeling ill or stressed psychologically.
   - Stool for c.diff
   - Diabetes teaching
   - close PCP f/u

   <I>## Chest tightness:</I>Resolved. EKG tachycardic w/o signs of
   ischemia. not characteristic for CAD as no actual pain but difficulty
   taking deep breath more c/w anxiety per pt.  negative stress one month
   ago at [**Hospital1 183**]. Has been r/o for MI many times w/ negative troponins. Pt.
   is however poorly controlled diabetic, will have lower threshold for
   checking cardiac enzymes.
   - continue home ASA
   .
   <I>## Diarrhea:</I>Given recent cipro would be concerning for c.diff.
   Also could be viral gastroenteritis, but denies sick contacts. U/A
   negative so doubt recurrent UTI. Very little abd pain and started after
   N/V/D, and no vaginal discharge so doubt PID.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus and recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She was admitted to the ICU for DKA and has shown improvement with closed anion gap and tolerance to oral intake. However, she is still tachycardic. Infectious work-up has been negative so far. The patient has a history of poorly controlled diabetes with previous A1c levels. Other issues include diarrhea, back pain, and fen/lytes intolerance, all of which have been addressed accordingly. The patient is currently tolerating PO and ambulating.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of DKA: Given the patient's history of recurrent DKA, there is a risk of another episode if her diabetes is not properly managed.
2. Poor glycemic control: The patient's history of poorly controlled diabetes suggests that maintaining stable blood glucose levels may be challenging.
3. Infection: Despite negative results so far, there is still a possibility of an underlying infection that could lead to further complications.
4. Diarrhea or vomiting: Although the symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting have resolved, there is still a potential for recurrence or development of new gastrointestinal issues.
5. Back pain: The patient's back pain, believed to be secondary to a previous motor vehicle accident, may require ongoing evaluation and management.
6. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): As the patient is immobilized in the ICU, there is"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus and recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She presented to the ICU with DKA and was managed with insulin therapy. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 126/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient has shown improvement as her gap has closed and she is now eating. However, she remains tachycardic. Her fluid balance shows a positive balance of 747 mL. The most recent laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, ranging from 49 mg/dL to 164 mg/dL. Other electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The plan includes continuing insulin therapy at 3U/hr until the next set of labs shows closure of the gap. The patient will receive a 1L normal saline bolus, switch to q4h lite fluids, and begin PO potassium repletion. Stool studies are pending for c.difficile, and diabetes teaching is recommended. Close follow-up with the primary care physician is advised.

The patient has resolved symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and back pain. She will be discharged once her symptoms are resolved. The patient is on a lactose-free diet as tolerated and will continue to receive D5NS at 150cc/hr. Heparin prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis are also being provided. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending resolution of symptoms."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with Type I diabetes mellitus admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has shown improvement in glucose control, tolerance to oral intake, and ability to return to subcutaneous insulin. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this scenario include:

1. Gastroparesis: The patient has experienced recurrent nausea and vomiting, which raises concern for gastroparesis, a common complication in patients with diabetes. This condition causes delayed gastric emptying and can lead to further complications if not managed properly.

2. Infection: The patient's history of DKA puts her at higher risk for infections. Clostridium difficile infection (C. difficile, C. diff) is a specific type of infection that can occur in ICU patients due to antibiotic use or disruption of normal gut flora. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever, is crucial.

3. Pain management: The patient has been experiencing pain, and appropriate pain management strategies should be implemented to ensure comfort and minimize any potential complications related to inadequate pain control.

4. Anxiety: The patient's intermittent tachycardia may be secondary to anxiety, pain, and nausea. Proper reassurance and pain control measures should be continued to address these symptoms and prevent further complications.

5. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting need to be managed"
