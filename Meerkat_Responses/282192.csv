   and ESRD on dialysis now with prolonged hospitalization for hypotension
   who is transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for persistent hypotension.
   Hypotension:  Concern once again for septic physiology given rising
   white blood cell count and lethargy.  Most likely source would be his
   back wound but left toe ulcer, hemodialysis line and PICC line are also
   possible sites of infection. It is also possible that his hypotension
   was secondary to increased narcotics dosing on the floor.  For now will
   monitor closely.
   - cautious IVF boluses for SBP < 80
   - blood, urine and sputum cultures given worsening leukocytosis
   - currently on PO vancomycin alone given his history of clostridium
   difficle and prolonged antibiotic use
   - will not change antibiotics at this time
   - continue prednisone 5 mg daily
   - continue midodrine 15 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - will decrease oxycodone back to 5 mg PO Q6H:PRN from 10 mg PO
   Q6H:PRN. Note Fent patch is still on.
   End Stage Renal Disease: Per notes last dialysis was on Saturday.
   - appreciate renal team assistance
   - continue epogen with dialysis
   Sacral Decubitus Ulcers:  Despite flexiseal and medications to create
   liquid stool he continues to have fecal contamination of his wounds.
   - appreciate plastics assistance
   - patient now aggreeable to diverting colostomy, will reconsult surgery
   after discussing with patient
   - continue kinair mattress
   - continue wound care
   Chronic Respiratory Failure:  Continues on trach mask oxygenating well.
   - continue trach mask
   Coronary Artery Disease:  Last echocardiogram with preserved ejection
   fraction.  Had troponin leak on admission which peaked at 0.53.
   - restart simvastatin 10 mg daily
   - continue to hold beta blocker given persistent hypotension
   Atrial Fibrillation: Currently well rate controlled.  [**Country 3664**] score 2.
   Currently not anticoagulated.
   - will hold aspirin until surgical plans can be determined
   Type II Diabetes: Blood sugars currently well controlled.
   - continue lantus with insulin sliding scale
   Peripheral Vascular Disease:  s/p BKA on right with left heel ulcer on
   leg.
   - concern from ID regarding left second toe ulcer.  Will ask podiatry
   to comment in AM
   - continue local wound care
   Plasma Cell Dyscrasia:  Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis, bone marrow
   with 5-10% plasma cells.  Also with known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.
   - Continued outpatient follow up
   Pain Control:  Patient with significant pain from sacral ulcer.
   Unfortunately blood pressures very tenuous in the setting of narcotic
   use.
   - continue tylenol standing 1000 mg PO Q6H
   - continue fentanyl patch 100 mcg Q72 hours
   - decrease oxycodone to 5 mg PO Q6H:PRN
   - continue lidocaine patches to back and heel ulcers
   Upper gastrointestinal bleeding:  No active issues.  Concern for guaiac

   A/P:
   75 with chronic respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy, type II diabetes,
   peripheral vascular disease s/p right BKA, CAD, atrial fibrillation,
   and ESRD on dialysis now with prolonged hospitalization for hypotension
   who is transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for persistent hypotension.
   Hypotension:  Concern once again for septic physiology given earlier
   rising white blood cell count and lethargy, now improving but still on
   pressors, BP 118-154.  Most likely source would be his back wound but
   left toe ulcer, hemodialysis line and PICC line are also possible sites
   of infection. It is also possible that his hypotension was secondary to
   increased narcotics dosing on the floor.  For now will monitor closely.
   - cautious IVF boluses for SBP < 80
   -Wean pressors
   -f/u blood, urine and sputum cultures given worsening leukocytosis
   - currently on PO vancomycin alone given his history of clostridium
   difficle and prolonged antibiotic use
   - continue prednisone 5 mg daily
   - continue midodrine 15 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - oxycodonewas changed  back to 5 mg PO Q6H:PRN from 10 mg PO Q6H:PRN.
   Note Fent patch is still on.
   End Stage Renal Disease: Per notes last dialysis was on Saturday.
   - appreciate renal team assistance
   - continue epogen with dialysis
   Sacral Decubitus Ulcers:  Despite flexiseal and medications to create
   liquid stool he continues to have fecal contamination of his wounds.
   - appreciate plastics assistance
   - patient now aggreeable to diverting colostomy, will reconsult surgery
   after discussing with patient
   - continue kinair mattress
   - continue wound care
   -tocubase with [**Doctor First Name 458**] re: re-scheduling
   Chronic Respiratory Failure:  Continues on trach mask oxygenating well.
   - continue trach mask
   Coronary Artery Disease:  Last echocardiogram with preserved ejection
   fraction.  Had troponin leak on admission which peaked at 0.53.
   - restart simvastatin 10 mg daily
   - continue to hold beta blocker given persistent hypotension
   Atrial Fibrillation: Currently well rate controlled.  [**Country 3664**] score 2.
   Currently not anticoagulated.
   - will hold aspirin until surgical plans can be determined
   Type II Diabetes: Blood sugars currently well controlled.
   - continue lantus with insulin sliding scale
   Peripheral Vascular Disease:  s/p BKA on right with left heel ulcer on
   leg.
   - concern from ID regarding left second toe ulcer.  Will ask podiatry
   to comment in AM
   - continue local wound care
   Plasma Cell Dyscrasia:  Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis, bone marrow
   with 5-10% plasma cells.  Also with known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.
   - Continued outpatient follow up
   Pain Control:  Patient with significant pain from sacral ulcer.
   Unfortunately blood pressures very tenuous in the setting of narcotic
   use.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of chronic respiratory failure, type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. He has been admitted to the ICU due to persistent hypotension and potential sepsis. The patient's current vital signs are stable, but he is still on pressors. His white blood cell count is increasing, indicating a possible infection. The most likely source of infection is his back wound, but other potential sites include his left toe ulcer, hemodialysis line, and PICC line.

Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and is on dialysis. His last dialysis session was on Saturday.
2. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. There is concern for infection in the back wound, left toe ulcer, hemodialysis line, and PICC line.
3. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which may be secondary to sepsis or increased narcotics dosing.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has sacral decubitus ulcers that are not healing despite treatment.
5. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to rely on a tracheostomy for oxygenation.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has preserved ejection fraction but had a troponin leak"

   peripheral vascular disease s/p right BKA, CAD, atrial fibrillation,
   and ESRD on dialysis now with prolonged hospitalization for hypotension
   who is transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for persistent hypotension.
   Hypotension:  Concern once again for septic physiology given rising
   white blood cell count and lethargy.  Most likely source would be his
   back wound but left toe ulcer, hemodialysis line and PICC line are also
   possible sites of infection. It is also possible that his hypotension
   was secondary to increased narcotics dosing on the floor.  For now will
   monitor closely.
   - cautious IVF boluses for SBP < 80
   - blood, urine and sputum cultures given worsening leukocytosis
   - currently on PO vancomycin alone given his history of clostridium
   difficle and prolonged antibiotic use
   - will not change antibiotics at this time
   - continue prednisone 5 mg daily
   - continue midodrine 15 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - will decrease oxycodone back to 5 mg PO Q6H:PRN from 10 mg PO
   Q6H:PRN. Note Fent patch is still on.
   End Stage Renal Disease: Per notes last dialysis was on Saturday.
   - appreciate renal team assistance
   - continue epogen with dialysis
   Sacral Decubitus Ulcers:  Despite flexiseal and medications to create
   liquid stool he continues to have fecal contamination of his wounds.
   - appreciate plastics assistance
   - patient now aggreeable to diverting colostomy, will reconsult surgery
   after discussing with patient
   - continue kinair mattress
   - continue wound care
   Chronic Respiratory Failure:  Continues on trach mask oxygenating well.
   - continue trach mask
   Coronary Artery Disease:  Last echocardiogram with preserved ejection
   fraction.  Had troponin leak on admission which peaked at 0.53.
   - restart simvastatin 10 mg daily
   - continue to hold beta blocker given persistent hypotension
   Atrial Fibrillation: Currently well rate controlled.  [**Country 3664**] score 2.
   Currently not anticoagulated.
   - will hold aspirin until surgical plans can be determined
   Type II Diabetes: Blood sugars currently well controlled.
   - continue lantus with insulin sliding scale
   Peripheral Vascular Disease:  s/p BKA on right with left heel ulcer on
   leg.
   - concern from ID regarding left second toe ulcer.  Will ask podiatry
   to comment in AM
   - continue local wound care
   Plasma Cell Dyscrasia:  Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis, bone marrow
   with 5-10% plasma cells.  Also with known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.
   - Continued outpatient follow up
   Pain Control:  Patient with significant pain from sacral ulcer.
   Unfortunately blood pressures very tenuous in the setting of narcotic
   use.
   - continue tylenol standing 1000 mg PO Q6H
   - continue fentanyl patch 100 mcg Q72 hours
   - decrease oxycodone to 5 mg PO Q6H:PRN
   - continue lidocaine patches to back and heel ulcers
   Upper gastrointestinal bleeding:  No active issues.  Concern for guaiac
   positive NG aspirate on [**11-24**].  Hematocrit stable.  No persistent
   bleeding.
   - continue pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - hold NSAIDs and aspirin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease on dialysis. He was admitted for hypotension and is now back in the ICU due to persistent hypotension. The patient has multiple comorbidities and complications including sepsis, renal failure, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a rising white blood cell count and lethargy, indicating possible infection. Potential sources of infection include his back wound, left toe ulcer, hemodialysis line, and PICC line.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience hypotension despite treatment. It is important to closely monitor his blood pressure and provide cautious IV fluid boluses as needed. Antibiotic therapy should be considered if there is evidence of infection.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease: The patient requires ongoing dialysis management. Collaboration with the renal team is necessary for further evaluation and treatment.
4. Sacral Decubitus Ulcers: The patient has ongoing fecal contamination of his wounds, indicating ineffective wound care. Consultation with the plastics team is needed to explore options such as diverting colostomy.
5. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on tracheostomy mask oxygenation. Continued"

   A/P:
   75 with chronic respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy, type II diabetes,
   peripheral vascular disease s/p right BKA, CAD, atrial fibrillation,
   and ESRD on dialysis now with prolonged hospitalization for hypotension
   who is transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for persistent hypotension.
   Hypotension:  Concern once again for septic physiology given rising
   white blood cell count and lethargy.  Most likely source would be his
   back wound but left toe ulcer, hemodialysis line and PICC line are also
   possible sites of infection. It is also possible that his hypotension
   was secondary to increased narcotics dosing on the floor.  For now will
   monitor closely.
   - cautious IVF boluses for SBP < 80
   - blood, urine and sputum cultures given worsening leukocytosis
   - currently on PO vancomycin alone given his history of clostridium
   difficle and prolonged antibiotic use
   - will not change antibiotics at this time
   - continue prednisone 5 mg daily
   - continue midodrine 15 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - will decrease oxycodone back to 5 mg PO Q6H:PRN from 10 mg PO
   Q6H:PRN. Note Fent patch is still on.
   End Stage Renal Disease: Per notes last dialysis was on Saturday.
   - appreciate renal team assistance
   - continue epogen with dialysis
   Sacral Decubitus Ulcers:  Despite flexiseal and medications to create
   liquid stool he continues to have fecal contamination of his wounds.
   - appreciate plastics assistance
   - patient now aggreeable to diverting colostomy, will reconsult surgery
   after discussing with patient
   - continue kinair mattress
   - continue wound care
   Chronic Respiratory Failure:  Continues on trach mask oxygenating well.
   - continue trach mask
   Coronary Artery Disease:  Last echocardiogram with preserved ejection
   fraction.  Had troponin leak on admission which peaked at 0.53.
   - restart simvastatin 10 mg daily
   - continue to hold beta blocker given persistent hypotension
   Atrial Fibrillation: Currently well rate controlled.  [**Country 3664**] score 2.
   Currently not anticoagulated.
   - will hold aspirin until surgical plans can be determined
   Type II Diabetes: Blood sugars currently well controlled.
   - continue lantus with insulin sliding scale
   Peripheral Vascular Disease:  s/p BKA on right with left heel ulcer on
   leg.
   - concern from ID regarding left second toe ulcer.  Will ask podiatry
   to comment in AM
   - continue local wound care
   Plasma Cell Dyscrasia:  Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis, bone marrow
   with 5-10% plasma cells.  Also with known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.
   - Continued outpatient follow up
   Pain Control:  Patient with significant pain from sacral ulcer.
   Unfortunately blood pressures very tenuous in the setting of narcotic
   use.
   - continue tylenol standing 1000 mg PO Q6H
   - continue fentanyl patch 100 mcg Q72 hours
   - decrease oxycodone to 5 mg PO Q6H:PRN
   - continue lidocaine patches to back and heel ulcers
   Upper gastrointestinal bleeding:  No active issues.  Concern for guaiac
   positive NG aspirate on [**11-24**].  Hematocrit stable.  No persistent
   bleeding.
   - continue pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - hold NSAIDs and aspirin

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease on dialysis. He is admitted to the ICU for persistent hypotension. The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, plasma cell dyscrasia, and pain control issues.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/46 to 154/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low and may be due to septic physiology, increased narcotics dosing, or other causes. The source of infection could be the back wound, left toe ulcer, hemodialysis line, or PICC line.

2. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient is on dialysis, and the last session was on Saturday. He requires ongoing renal support.

3. Sacral decubitus ulcers: Despite medical interventions, the patient's sacral wounds continue to be fecal-contaminated. A colostomy may be necessary for better wound healing.

4. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient is on tracheostomy and"

   A/P:
   75 with chronic respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy, type II diabetes,
   peripheral vascular disease s/p right BKA, CAD, atrial fibrillation,
   and ESRD on dialysis now with prolonged hospitalization for hypotension
   who is transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for persistent hypotension.
   Hypotension:  Originally concerned for septic physiology given earlier
   rising white blood cell count and lethargy, now improving; BP 118-154
   off pressors.  Most likely source would be his back wound but left toe
   ulcer, hemodialysis line and PICC line are also possible sites of
   infection. It is also possible that his hypotension was secondary to
   increased narcotics dosing on the floor. Of special note, the patient
   pressures have improved dramatically after one night of Prednisone
   40mg, so ?adrenal insufficiency.
   - cautious IVF boluses for SBP < 80
   -Con
t hold all pressors
   -f/u blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - currently on PO vancomycin, Meropenem, Daptomycin
   - continue prednisone 40 mg daily
   - continue midodrine 15 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - oxycodone was changed  back to 5 mg PO Q6H:PRN from 10 mg PO Q6H:PRN.
   Note Fent patch is still on.
   End Stage Renal Disease: Per notes last dialysis was on Saturday.
   - appreciate renal team assistance
   - continue epogen with dialysis
   Sacral Decubitus Ulcers:  Despite flexiseal and medications to create
   liquid stool he continues to have fecal contamination of his wounds.
   - appreciate plastics assistance
   - patient now aggreeable to diverting colostomy, will reconsult surgery
   after discussing with patient
   - continue kinair mattress
   - continue wound care
   Chronic Respiratory Failure:  Continues on trach mask oxygenating well.
   - continue trach mask
   Coronary Artery Disease:  Last echocardiogram with preserved ejection
   fraction.  Had troponin leak on admission which peaked at 0.53.
   - restart simvastatin 10 mg daily
   - continue to hold beta blocker given persistent hypotension
   Atrial Fibrillation: Currently well rate controlled.  [**Country 3664**] score 2.
   Currently not anticoagulated.
   - will hold aspirin until surgical plans can be determined
   Type II Diabetes: Blood sugars currently well controlled.
   - continue lantus with insulin sliding scale
   Peripheral Vascular Disease:  s/p BKA on right with left heel ulcer on
   leg.
   - concern from ID regarding left second toe ulcer.  Will ask podiatry
   to comment in AM
   - continue local wound care
   Plasma Cell Dyscrasia:  Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis, bone marrow
   with 5-10% plasma cells.  Also with known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.
   - Continued outpatient follow up
   Pain Control:  Patient with significant pain from sacral ulcer.
   Unfortunately blood pressures very tenuous in the setting of narcotic
   use.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. He was admitted for hypotension and is now back in the ICU for persistent hypotension. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently on several medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and is on dialysis, indicating compromised kidney function. This puts him at risk for further renal deterioration and associated complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests an infection, which could potentially lead to sepsis. The source of infection could be the back wound, toe ulcer, hemodialysis line, or PICC line.
3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's blood pressure improved significantly after starting prednisone, raising the possibility of adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation is necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience hypotension despite being off pressors. This may be due to increased narcotics dosing or another underlying cause.
5. Sacral Decubitus Ulcers: The patient has non-healing sacral decubitus ulcers, which are at risk for further complications such as infection or worsening tissue damage.
6. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on a tracheostomy"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided information. However, based on the 24-hour events and assessment, several potential medical complications can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been consistently below normal levels, indicating ongoing hypotension. This could be due to sepsis or renal failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. This is evident from the presence of leukocytosis, abnormal blood cultures, and the need for antibacterial therapy.

3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is currently experiencing renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has wounds that require debridement, suggesting compromised skin integrity. This increases the risk of infections and poor wound healing.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient is on respiratory support with a tracheostomy mask and has an ABG showing respiratory acidosis. This indicates acute respiratory failure, potentially caused by pneumonia or sepsis.

6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has type I diabetes, which requires careful monitoring of blood glucose levels.

7. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient has critical limb ischemia, indicating compromised blood flow to the extremities. This increases the risk of tissue damage and potential amputation.

8. Pain management: The patient requires pain control for both acute and chronic pain"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and end-stage renal disease. He was admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has been on pressors since 0600, with a blood pressure consistently below 80 systolic. Antibiotics were started, including vancomycin, daptomycin, and meropenem. Hydrocortisone has been given for one more day, with a plan to start prednisone in the morning. The patient received a 1L D5W for free water deficit and underwent surgical debridement of his sacral wound. He also has leukocytosis and an upcoming diverting colostomy surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's current renal function is compromised due to end-stage renal disease. This puts him at risk for further deterioration in kidney function.
2. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis with organ dysfunction indicates a systemic infection that can lead to life-threatening complications if not appropriately managed.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation support. This increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and lung infections.
4. Hypotension: The patient's consistently low blood pressure below 80 systolic despite"

   who is transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for persistent hypotension.
   Hypotension:  Concern once again for septic physiology given earlier
   rising white blood cell count and lethargy, now improving BP 118-154.
   Most likely source would be his back wound but left toe ulcer,
   hemodialysis line and PICC line are also possible sites of infection.
   It is also possible that his hypotension was secondary to increased
   narcotics dosing on the floor.  For now will monitor closely.
   - cautious IVF boluses for SBP < 80
   -Wean pressors
   -f/u blood, urine and sputum cultures given worsening leukocytosis
   - currently on PO vancomycin alone given his history of clostridium

   Chronic Respiratory Failure:  Continues on trach mask oxygenating well.
   - continue trach mask
   Coronary Artery Disease:  Last echocardiogram with preserved ejection
   fraction.  Had troponin leak on admission which peaked at 0.53.
   - restart simvastatin 10 mg daily
   - continue to hold beta blocker given persistent hypotension
   Atrial Fibrillation: Currently well rate controlled.  [**Country 3664**] score 2.
   Currently not anticoagulated.
   - will hold aspirin until surgical plans can be determined
   Type II Diabetes: Blood sugars currently well controlled.
   - continue lantus with insulin sliding scale
   Peripheral Vascular Disease:  s/p BKA on right with left heel ulcer on

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including chronic respiratory failure, type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease on dialysis. He was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension and sepsis. The patient has been on prolonged hospitalization and has a history of back wound, left toe ulcer, hemodialysis line, and PICC line infections. He also has a known retroperitoneal mass and plasma cell dyscrasia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/42-92/29 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on tracheostomy. The patient is alert and oriented, with purposeful movements but unable to stand.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 213 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 26 mEq/L, creatinine (Cr) is 2.7 mg/dL, and lactate level is 1.2 mmol/L.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pain Control: Continue pain management with Tylenol and fentanyl patch.
2. Renal Failure:"

   Blood pressure has been very stable over the past 24 hours. We wonder
   if this may relate to higher doses of steroids. Will transition to
   prednisone at 40 mg/day and then try a slower taper.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old overweight male with chronic renal failure, decubitus ulcer, anemia, and multiple comorbidities including type I diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's blood pressure has been stable over the past 24 hours, and there are ongoing efforts to manage his pain, maintain nutrition, control blood sugar levels, and treat his infections. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he continues to have impaired skin integrity and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening renal function: The patient already has chronic renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function.
2. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics for severe sepsis, indicating an ongoing infection. There is a risk of developing new infections or antibiotic resistance.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient has a decubitus ulcer, which can worsen if proper pressure relief and wound care are not provided.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
5. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease. There is a risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
