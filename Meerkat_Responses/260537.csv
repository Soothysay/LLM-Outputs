 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   61 year old female with COPD on 3L home O2 s/p recent admission [**12-2**]
   for COPD exacerbation and newly diganosed LUL mass now admitted with
   respiratory distress...
   .
   #. Acute hypercarbic respiratory distress/Cough:  Etiology likely
   secondary to COPD exacerbation, although pt has LUL mass and bouts of
   coughing; concern for ? trachobroncheomalacia vs viral infection. No
   sign of bacterial infection but given mass a post-obstructive pneumonia
   could also  be a possibility.  There is no evidence of a new
   conslidation on CXR nor any effusions and pt is afebrile, no WBC; there
   is no pulmonary vascular congestion seen on CXR and BNP 89.  Pt did
   respond well to ativan and possible that anxiety is contributing in
   addition to her underlying disease.
   - continue albuterol q2 prn and ipratropium q6 nebs
   - continue solumedrol, FS QID while on high dose steroids
   - Continue azithromycin 500mg qday (day#1 is [**1-25**])
   - Sputum cultures, blood cultures ordered
   - CT chest w/ and w/o contrast in AM
   - continue supplemental O2 for goal SaO2 88-93%; PaO2 >60; will have
   low threshold to resume non-invasive ventilation for now, consider
   intubation if hypercarbia worsens, increased fatigue, or unable to
   protect airway

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD, who was admitted for a COPD exacerbation and recently diagnosed left upper lobe (LUL) mass. She presented with respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU. She responded well to lorazepam, which may suggest anxiety as a contributing factor along with her underlying disease. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/50 mmHg to 141/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. Her fluid balance shows an intake of 800 mL and output of 470 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 800 mL. 

The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen delivery through an unspecified device, and her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 57 mmHg, PaO2 of 198 mmHg, HCO3- of 30 mEq/L, and O2 saturation of 98%. Her peripheral pulses are not assessed, and her neurologic examination is also not assessed. 

Her laboratory values show a WBC count of 7.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, hematocrit of 31.1%, platelet count of 191 K/uL, creatinine"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Acute respiratory failure - Severe COPD, ? viral process vs atypical
   infection, less likely post obstructive pneumonia, possible
   contribution from GERD superimposed.
   -- Solumedrol 125mg q6, atrovent and albuterol, Increased PPI to [**Hospital1 **],
   azithromycin, send flu swab. Monitor gas exchange closely. ABG, place
   on BiPAP to help relieve work of breathing intermittently. Likely large
   contirbution from anxiety will continue outpatient meds and treat with
   gentle benzodiazepines. Hold off on CT due to tenous respiratory
   status.
   -- at ~11am, patient required intubation for increased work of
   breathing. Intubation was uneventful.
   -- will obtain CT chest
   2. Acidosis/hypotensive: pH decreased this am, will send lactate, bolus
   fluids slowly
   3. Fibromyalgia: continue outpatient medications.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions and complications. The note indicates that the patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure due to severe COPD, with potential viral or atypical infection contributing to the condition. The patient's chest pain, described as burning in the left chest since yesterday early am, along with crackles and wheezes in the respiratory examination, suggests possible pneumonia or exacerbation of underlying lung disease.

Additionally, the patient's blood pressure is low (86/42 mmHg), indicating potential hypotension, and the patient has shown signs of acidosis with a decreased pH level. This could be related to the respiratory failure or another underlying condition. The presence of right lower extremity edema should also be noted, as it may indicate fluid overload or deep vein thrombosis.

The patient has undergone intubation due to increased work of breathing and is currently on BiPAP to relieve the work of breathing intermittently. Further diagnostic tests, such as a CT chest, will be obtained to assess the extent of the respiratory issues. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hematocrit (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), increased creatinine (Cr), and other electrolyte imbalances.

Overall, the potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include worsening respiratory failure, pneumonia, exacerbation of COPD, hypotension, acidosis, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with severe COPD, possible contribution from malignancy, viral process, atypical infection, post obstructive pneumonia, and GERD. The patient complains of coughing fits, chest pain, and burning sensation in the left chest. They have been experiencing respiratory failure and require close monitoring of gas exchange. Bipap has been placed intermittently to relieve the work of breathing. The patient's pH decreased this morning, and lactate will be sent for analysis. Fluids will be given slowly. Outpatient medications for fibromyalgia and anxiety will continue. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and requires ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already shows signs of respiratory failure and requires assistance with breathing using Bipap. Continued deterioration in respiratory function could lead to further respiratory failure and potentially ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).

2. Infection: There is a possibility of atypical infection or post obstructive pneumonia contributing to the patient's condition. If an infection is present, it should be treated promptly to prevent worsening of symptoms and complications.

3. Acidosis/Hypotension: The decrease in pH indicates acidosis, which may be due to metabolic or respiratory causes. If metabolic acidosis is confirmed, it could indicate poor tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and appropriate treatment, such as fluid resuscitation and correction of underlying causes, is necessary to prevent further complications"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD who was admitted for a COPD exacerbation and a newly diagnosed lung mass. She presented with acute hypercarbic respiratory distress and was intubated due to her inability to tolerate BiPAP. She is currently on invasive ventilation, with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her FiO2 is being titrated down, and she will undergo a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) if her respiratory system compliance improves. The patient also has fibromyalgia and is receiving appropriate pain management. Her blood gases show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 54 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 220. Her other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's cough is likely secondary to a COPD exacerbation, although there is a possibility of a viral or post-obstructive pneumonia due to the presence of a left upper lobe mass. There are no signs of bacterial infection, and no new consolidations or effusions were seen on chest X-ray. The patient's B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is 89. The patient's family has been informed about the situation, and a code status of full code has been discussed and"

   61 year old female with COPD on 3L home O2 s/p recent admission [**12-2**]
   for COPD exacerbation and newly diganosed LUL mass now admitted with
   respiratory distress...
   .
   #. Acute hypercarbic respiratory distress/Cough:  Etiology likely
   secondary to COPD exacerbation, although pt has LUL mass and bouts of
   coughing; concern for ? trachobroncheomalacia vs viral infection. No
   sign of bacterial infection but given mass a post-obstructive pneumonia
   could also  be a possibility.  There is no evidence of a new
   conslidation on CXR nor any effusions and pt is afebrile, no WBC; there
   is no pulmonary vascular congestion seen on CXR and BNP 89.   Pt with
   continued cough and shallow breathes with SOB.
   - continue albuterol q2 and q1:prn and ipratropium q6 nebs
   - continue solumedrol, FS QID while on high dose steroids
   - Continue azithromycin 500mg qday (day#2 is [**1-25**])
   - Sputum cultures, blood cultures ordered
   - CT chest w/ and w/o contrast ordered, but will hold off given
   respiratory status
   - continue supplemental O2 for goal SaO2 88-93%; PaO2 >60;  We will try
   another trial of BiPAP as tolerated. Will have low threshold to resume
   non-invasive ventilation for now, consider intubation if hypercarbia
   worsens, increased fatigue, or unable to protect airway
   - continue home lasix 80mg daily
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - cough suppressants and morphine/ativan prn cough
   #. Fibromyalgia:
   -continue home fentanyl patch, SOMA, darvocet, gabapentin, amitryptline
   and Propoxyphene per home regimen
   -Holding home valium for now; giving ativan prn given pt slightly
   sedated after 2mg Ativan given in ED; prefer to monitor closely

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with severe COPD who was admitted for COPD exacerbation and respiratory distress. She required intubation due to increased respiratory distress and refractory hypoxemia despite noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 55 mmHg, PaO2 of 220, and HCO3- of 110 mmol/L. The patient is lightly sedated, with no acute distress, and follows commands. She has decreased breath sounds bilaterally, warm and well-perfused skin, and alert neurologic status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD and recent respiratory distress may lead to further respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and assessing respiratory system infection parameters should be implemented to prevent this complication.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with COPD and a recently diagnosed left upper lobe (LUL) mass. She was admitted for a COPD exacerbation and is currently in respiratory distress.

The assessment indicates that the patient is experiencing acute hypercarbic respiratory distress with cough. The etiology is likely secondary to COPD exacerbation, although the presence of LUL mass and bouts of coughing cannot be ruled out. There is no evidence of bacterial infection, but a post-obstructive pneumonia could also be a possibility, potentially caused by a viral infection. The patient's chest X-ray does not show any new consolidation or effusions, and she is afebrile with no signs of pulmonary vascular congestion. Her brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is 89.

The patient continues to have increased fatigue and is unable to tolerate bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP). Therefore, she was intubated on [1-26]. The plan includes continuing albuterol every 2 hours and ipratropium every 6 hours through nebulizers. Solumedrol will be given four times a day while on high-dose steroids, to be weaned down after one more day. A respiratory system compliance and effort (RSBI) will be done later today, with plans to titrate down the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and trial of pressure support ventilation (PS"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD, recently admitted for a COPD exacerbation and newly diagnosed left upper lobe (LUL) mass. She presented with respiratory distress, which was initially attributed to a COPD exacerbation, but further evaluation revealed no signs of bacterial infection. There is also no evidence of new consolidation on chest X-ray (CXR) or effusions. The patient is afebrile, and her B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is 89, indicating no pulmonary vascular congestion. The patient had continued coughing and shallow breathing with fatigue and was unable to tolerate bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP). She was intubated on 1/26 but is now doing well on pressure support ventilation (PSV).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and inability to tolerate BIPAP suggest acute respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and respiratory parameters will be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Regular chest X-rays and cultures should be obtained to monitor for any signs of infection. Early weaning from mechanical ventilation and maintaining good oral hygiene are important preventive measures.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted for exacerbation of COPD and respiratory distress. She was initially on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) but required intubation due to worsening respiratory distress. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation in the ICU and has shown improvement. The recent events include a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) lasting about 2 hours with good arterial blood gas (ABG) results, but the patient was switched back to assist-control mode due to anxiety and agitation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 126/56 to 159/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is still on fentanyl infusion for pain management.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine level. Imaging reveals perihilar fullness and left-sided effusion on chest X-ray. Microbiology results from sputum, urine, and blood cultures are negative.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's main concern is respiratory failure due to severe COPD. The plan is to extubate the patient today, keeping in mind the risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD and a newly diagnosed left upper lobe mass. She was admitted for a COPD exacerbation and subsequently developed acute respiratory distress. She required invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated and placed on non-invasive ventilation with CPAP. The patient has been experiencing coughing episodes, and sputum gram stain revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. The CT scan showed resolution of an opacity in the right lung at the junction of the major and minor fissure, as well as stable severe centrilobular emphysema. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. She received a dose of azithromycin on January 27th. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 62 beats per minute, blood pressure of 126/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is currently receiving various medications including fentanyl, famotidine, heparin sodium, and diazepam. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to exacerbation of COPD, infection (possibly bacterial or viral), post-obstructive pneumonia, fibromyalgia, anemia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with COPD who was admitted for a COPD exacerbation and a newly diagnosed left upper lobe (LUL) mass. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress and has been intubated. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 62 beats per minute, blood pressure of 126/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 set at 40%. 

The patient's lab results show normal levels for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium. However, there is a slightly elevated glucose level of 221 mg/dL. 

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to an acute exacerbation of COPD, although the presence of a LUL mass could also be contributing to the respiratory distress. There are no signs of bacterial infection, but there is a possibility of post-obstructive pneumonia due to the mass. 

The plan moving forward includes continuing albuterol and ipratropium nebs, decreasing the daily dose of prednisone, continuing azithromycin, following up with sputum culture data, and maintaining home medications for fibromyalgia. The patient's anemia is being monitored, and peripheral lines"

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with severe COPD who was admitted for COPD exacerbation and respiratory distress. She was initially intubated but has since been extubated. The patient's medical history includes fibromyalgia, and she is on several medications including furosemide, gabapentin, heparin, atrovent, solumedrol, and Valium. Her current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 118/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's recent laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL, platelet count of 229 K/uL, blood glucose level of 131 mg/dL, and sodium level of 145 mEq/L. Imaging studies reveal a spiculated left upper lobe mass and severe emphysema. The patient's condition is being managed for respiratory failure, fibromyalgia, and disposition-related issues. She is planned to be transferred to the floor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
