   Assessment and Plan
   56 y.o. F s/p failed kidney transplant on PD with low dose
   immunosuppression had 2 weeks of SOB diagnosed with asthma who
   presented to ED with N/V/ and HA found to have hypertensive emergency.
   # Hypertensive emergency: Manifested as pulm edema. EKG without iscmeic
   changes. Patient endorsed recent lowering of labetolol dose after being
   diagnosed with asthma. Also missed PD last night bc of dyspnea. This is
   in combination to missing PO antihypertensives likely contributed to
   presentation marked by pulmonary edema. Labetolol given in ED decreased
   HR to low 60s. Would like nitroprusside off as soon as possible to
   avoid cyanide toxicity.
   - pulling off nipride, on labetolol gtt.
   -cont clonidine patch
   -urgent PD dialysis should improved BP as well.
   -cycle cardiac enzymes
   -repeat EKG in am
   # Dyspnea: Likely [**12-28**] to worsening pulmonary edema/heart failure with
   volume overload seen on CXR. Also with ?new diagnosis of asthma which
   may have been worsening heart failure all along. She is already on
   lasix and makes urine and reports missing a couple of doses because of
   N/V. Does endorse cough that was chronic with lisinopril but had
   worsened but no sputum production or fever. PE also possible but
   clinical picture more c/w heart failure and no RHS seen on EKG.
   -albuterol nebs q6prn wheezing
   -PD to remove 500 to 1L
   -f/u BNP
   -repeat TEE
   # ESRD: Patient is on PD, N/V likely a symptom of uremia. Also with AG
   metabolic acidosis [**12-28**] to renal failure
   -urgent PD dialysis today
   -f/u electrolytes
   -resume prednisone and cellcept in am
   -appreciate renal recs
   -resume renalgel and calcitriol in am
   # Leukocytosis: Patient is afebrile but has been coughing so lungs are
   likely source. Also because of edema on CXR a consolidation could not
   be ruled out. As she is a dialysis patient with mmunosuppressants on
   board should be covered broadly for HCAP. Does make urine as well so
   UTI or peritoneal infection is possible as well. Viral URI is positive
   but given lack of fever/myalgias flu is unlikely.

   -consider coverage for PCP if not clinically improved
   -repeat CXR after diuresis with PD
   # N/V: Most likely [**12-28**] uremia although post-tussive emesis is also
   possible. ACS is certainly on the differential but no CP or EKG changes
   to suggest this.
   -cycle enzymes as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of failed kidney transplant on peritoneal dialysis (PD), low dose immunosuppression, and recent diagnosis of asthma. She presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and headache, and was found to have hypertensive emergency with pulmonary edema. The patient also has dyspnea, elevated blood pressure, and symptoms consistent with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) such as anemia and uremia. Other notable findings include leukocytosis, possible infection, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency with pulmonary edema: The patient's high blood pressure has led to fluid accumulation in the lungs, causing pulmonary edema. This is a serious condition that requires immediate treatment to prevent further damage to the heart and lungs.
2. ESRD: The patient's chronic kidney disease has progressed to end-stage renal disease, which means her kidneys are no longer able to function adequately. This can lead to complications such as anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and uremia.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests an underlying infection. Considering her immunosuppressed state and the presence of leukocytosis, it is important to investigate and treat any potential infections promptly.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac positive emesis raises concern for gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the source and severity of"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 y.o. F s/p failed kidney transplant on PD with low dose
   immunosuppression had 2 weeks of SOB diagnosed with asthma who
   presented to ED with N/V/ and HA found to have hypertensive emergency,
   improving.
   # Hypertensive emergency: Manifested as pulm edema. EKG without iscmeic
   changes. Patient endorsed recent lowering of labetolol dose after being
   diagnosed with asthma. Also missed PD bc of dyspnea. This is in
   combination to missing PO antihypertensives likely contributed to
   presentation marked by pulmonary edema. Labetolol given in ED decreased
   HR to low 60s. Would like nitroprusside off as soon as possible to
   avoid cyanide toxicity.
   - renal recs
   - d/c nipride gtt as possible and d/c labetalol gtt as possible
   - continue labetalol po and attempt introducing po meds as possible
   - continue clonidine patch
   - PD
   - f/u EKG
   # Dyspnea: Likely [**12-28**] to worsening pulmonary edema/heart failure with
   volume overload seen on CXR. Also with ?new diagnosis of asthma which
   may have been worsening heart failure all along. She is already on
   lasix and makes urine and reports missing a couple of doses because of
   N/V. Does endorse cough that was chronic with lisinopril but had
   worsened but no sputum production or fever. PE also possible but
   clinical picture more c/w heart failure and no RHS seen on EKG.
   -albuterol nebs q6prn wheezing
   -PD today
   -f/u TTE
   # ESRD: Patient is on PD, N/V likely a symptom of uremia. Also with AG
   metabolic acidosis [**12-28**] to renal failure
   -urgent PD dialysis today
   -f/u electrolytes
   -resume prednisone and cellcept
   -appreciate renal recs
   -resume renalgel and calcitriol
   # Leukocytosis: Patient is afebrile but has been coughing so lungs are
   likely source. Also because of edema on CXR a consolidation could not
   be ruled out. As she is a dialysis patient with mmunosuppressants on
   board should be covered broadly for HCAP. Does make urine as well so
   UTI or peritoneal infection is possible as well. Viral URI is positive
   but given lack of fever/myalgias flu is unlikely.
   - f/u culture data
   - CXR in AM
   # N/V: Most likely [**12-28**] uremia although post-tussive emesis is also
   possible. ACS is certainly on the differential but no CP or EKG changes
   to suggest this.
   -cycle enzymes as above
   -zofran prn
   -dialysis as above
   # Anemia: Patient as anemic with baseline hct ~27 and on procrit for
   anemia of chronic disease. With guiac + emesis concern for UGI bleed
   although hemodynamics does not support hypovolemic instability.
   - active T+S
   - PPI daily
   - transfuse Hct<21 or active bleeding
   # HA: CT head negative, ddx migraine ha but improved with BP control,
   now resolved
   -dilaudid to pain control
   # Elevated INR: likely nutritional, no history of liver disease, not on
   anticoagulation. No signs of bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and upper gastrointestinal bleed (melena, GIB). He presented to the ICU with malignant hypertension (hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency) and renal failure. The patient has been receiving various treatments including vasodilators such as nitroprusside and labetalol to control his blood pressure. He also received antibiotics for an infection. The patient tolerated a po diet and had an echocardiogram showing preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF >55%) with mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). 

Medical Complications:
1. Malignant hypertension: The patient initially presented with very high blood pressure, which is a life-threatening condition known as hypertensive emergency or crisis. It can lead to end-organ damage if not promptly treated.
2. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD, indicating chronic kidney disease that has progressed to end-stage. This puts him at risk for further complications related to renal dysfunction.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's history of melena suggests an upper gastrointestinal bleed, which can be caused by various factors such as peptic ulcers, gastritis, or esophageal varices. It is important to monitor for signs of ongoing bleeding and assess for potential sources.
4. Hypotension: Despite treatment, the patient's blood pressure remained elevated, necessitating the use"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of failed kidney transplant on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and low-dose immunosuppression.
- She presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and headache, which were diagnosed as symptoms of hypertensive emergency.
- The patient has been experiencing shortness of breath (SOB) for two weeks and was diagnosed with asthma.
- She missed her PD session and oral antihypertensive medications, leading to pulmonary edema.
- Her blood pressure was initially controlled with nitroprusside and labetalol, but the nitroprusside was discontinued due to concerns of cyanide toxicity.
- The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine, leukocytosis, and signs of possible metabolic acidosis.
- Chest X-ray revealed evidence of pulmonary edema and potential heart failure.
- The patient is currently on PD, and her symptoms of nausea and vomiting may be related to uremia.
- She also has anemia with a baseline hematocrit (Hct) of 27 and is on erythropoietin-stimulating agent (Procit) for anemia of chronic disease.
- The patient's elevated INR is likely due to nutritional deficiencies, and there are no signs of bleeding.
- She has been prescribed prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of failed kidney transplant on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and low-dose immunosuppression. She presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and headache, and was found to have a hypertensive emergency. The patient's symptoms improved after receiving labetalol in the emergency department, which also decreased her heart rate to the low 60s. The medical team wants to discontinue nitroprusside as soon as possible to avoid cyanide toxicity.

The patient has been experiencing dyspnea, which is likely due to worsening pulmonary edema/heart failure with volume overload seen on chest X-ray. She also has a new diagnosis of asthma, which may have been worsening her heart failure all along. The patient is already on lasix and reports missing a few doses because of nausea and vomiting. She endorses chronic cough with lisinopril but no sputum production or fever. Physical examination findings are consistent with heart failure and no right heart strain seen on EKG.

The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on PD. Her nausea and vomiting are likely symptoms of uremia. She also has acid-base metabolic acidosis likely due to renal failure. Urgent PD dialysis is needed today, along with follow-up electrolytes. She should resume prednisone and cellcept, appreciate renal recommendations, and resume renal gel and calcitriol.

The patient has leukocytosis, which may be due to a lung infection. Viral upper respiratory infection (URI) is possible but less likely. Follow-up culture data should be obtained, and antibiotics should be held off for now.

The patient's nausea and vomiting are most likely due to uremia, although post-tussive emesis is also possible. Ruling out acute coronary syndrome (ACS), ondansetron (Zofran) can be given as needed, along with dialysis as mentioned above.

The patient has anemia with a baseline hematocrit (Hct) of ~27 and is on Procrit for anemia of chronic disease. With a positive guaiac test for emesis, concern for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed is present, although hemodynamics do not support hypovolemic instability. Active T+S, PPI daily, and transfusion if Hct <21 or active bleeding are recommended.

The patient's headache has resolved with blood pressure control, and a CT head was negative. Differential diagnosis includes migraine or headache of unknown origin.

The patient's elevated INR is likely nutritional, with no history of liver disease and not on anticoagulation. No signs of bleeding are present. INR should be trended.

ICU care includes ADAT nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with subcutaneous (SQ) UF heparin, stress ulcer with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions. The patient has full code status and will be staying in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan:
   56 y.o. F s/p failed kidney transplant on PD with low dose
   immunosuppression had 2 weeks of SOB diagnosed with asthma who
   presented to ED with N/V/ and HA found to have hypertensive emergency,
   improving.
   # Hypertensive emergency: Manifested as pulm edema. EKG without iscmeic
   changes. Patient endorsed recent lowering of labetolol dose after being
   diagnosed with asthma. Also missed PD bc of dyspnea. This is in
   combination to missing PO antihypertensives likely contributed to
   presentation marked by pulmonary edema.  Very difficult to control.
   - follow renal recs - ? aliskerin, minoxidil
   - attempt to wean labetalol gtt
   - uptitrate labetalol as needed, currently on 200 mg po TID
   - continue clonidine patch
   - continue PD
   - SBP goal 150-160
   # Dyspnea: Likely [**12-28**] to worsening pulmonary edema/heart failure with
   volume overload seen on CXR. Also with ?new diagnosis of asthma which
   may have been worsening heart failure all along. She is already on
   lasix and makes urine and reports missing a couple of doses because of
   N/V. Does endorse cough that was chronic with lisinopril but had
   worsened but no sputum production or fever. PE also possible but
   clinical picture more c/w heart failure and no RHS seen on EKG.
   - albuterol nebs q6prn wheezing
   - continue PD
   # ESRD: Patient is on PD, N/V likely a symptom of uremia. Also with AG
   metabolic acidosis [**12-28**] to renal failure
   - PD
   - continue prednisone and cellcept
   - appreciate renal recs
   - resume renalgel and calcitriol
   # Leukocytosis: Patient is afebrile but has been coughing so lungs are
   possible source.  Viral URI ispossible but given lack of fever/myalgias
   flu is unlikely.
   - f/u culture data

   although hemodynamics does not support hypovolemic instability.
   - active T+S
   - change PPI to po daily
   - transfuse Hct<21 or active bleeding
   - Procrit per renal
   # HA: CT head negative, ddx migraine ha but improved with BP control,

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of failed kidney transplant on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and low-dose immunosuppression. She presented to the emergency department with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and headache, which were found to be associated with a hypertensive emergency. The patient's condition improved with the control of blood pressure, but she developed pulmonary edema, which was difficult to manage. She also had dyspnea, likely due to worsening pulmonary edema/heart failure with volume overload seen on chest X-ray. The patient was diagnosed with asthma, which may have been worsening heart failure all along. She is already on Lasix and makes urine but reported missing a couple of doses due to nausea and vomiting. There were no signs of right heart strain on EKG. The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on PD, with symptoms of uremia such as nausea and vomiting. She also has leukocytosis, which could be due to a possible lung infection or viral upper respiratory infection (URI). The patient tolerated oral diet, and her nausea and vomiting improved with blood pressure control. She was ruled out for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). She has anemia with a baseline hematocrit (Hct) of 27 and is on Procrit for anemia of chronic disease. There is a concern for upper gastrointestinal bleed, although there are no signs of hypovolemic instability. The patient's headache"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU after undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The patient has been experiencing high blood pressure, especially when lying down, and renal wanted to increase labetolol but limited by heart rate. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels. There are concerns about hypertension and the use of erythropoietin stimulating dose. The patient has been prescribed clonidine, lasix, lisinopril, and hydralazine for blood pressure control. The patient's allergies include aspirin, and there is no information provided about previous antibiotic use. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite medication adjustments, indicating potential complications related to uncontrolled hypertension.
2. Renal dysfunction: Elevated serum creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function, which can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and difficulty in eliminating waste products.
3. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels may indicate an ongoing infection, possibly related to the recent surgery or catheter use.
4. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating potential dehydration or ongoing fluid losses, which may require close monitoring and intervention.
5. Pleural effusions: The patient has moderate left-sided and small"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female who had a failed kidney transplant and is currently on peritoneal dialysis with low-dose immunosuppression. She presented to the emergency department with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and headache and was found to have a hypertensive emergency. She has been on various medications including labetalol, clonidine, Lasix, lisinopril, and hydralazine to control her blood pressure. She also has asthma, pulmonary edema, heart failure with volume overload, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), leukocytosis, anemia, and an elevated INR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure remains difficult to control despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications. There is a risk of complications such as stroke, heart attack, or organ damage due to uncontrolled high blood pressure.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema has improved but there is still mild fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can lead to respiratory distress and difficulty in breathing.
3. ESRD: The patient is on peritoneal dialysis for her kidney failure. She may experience symptoms of uremia, including nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. There is also a risk of infection and fluid overload due to impaired kidney function.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an infection."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old female who underwent a failed kidney transplant and is currently on peritoneal dialysis (PD) with low-dose immunosuppression. She presented to the emergency department with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and headache, which were diagnosed as an asthma exacerbation. However, upon further evaluation, she was found to have a hypertensive emergency.

The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control, and she has been weaned off labetalol gtt since 5 pm on 8/31. She is currently on oral medications including clonidine, lasix, lisinopril, and hydralazine. The goal for her systolic blood pressure (SBP) is set at 150-160.

The patient also has dyspnea, which is likely due to worsening pulmonary edema/heart failure with volume overload seen on the chest X-ray. She is being treated with albuterol nebs q6prn for wheezing and will continue with PD.

The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on PD. Her nausea and vomiting may be symptoms of uremia, along with acid-base metabolic acidosis. She will continue with PD and receive renal recommendations.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which is likely due to a lung infection. Her white blood cell count is elevated, and she may require antibiotics. Her anemia is likely due to chronic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female who underwent a failed kidney transplant and is currently on peritoneal dialysis (PD). She presented to the emergency department with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and headache, which were later diagnosed as a hypertensive emergency. She has been treated with various medications to control her blood pressure, including labetalol, clonidine, lasix, lisinopril, and hydralazine. Her blood pressure remains high, ranging from 150s to 170s. The patient also has dyspnea, likely due to worsening pulmonary edema/heart failure with volume overload seen on chest X-ray. She has been receiving albuterol nebs every 6 hours as needed for wheezing. The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on PD, with symptoms of nausea and vomiting likely due to uremia and acidosis. She has leukocytosis that is downward trending without evidence of infection. The patient is anemic with a baseline hematocrit (Hct) of approximately 27 and is on Procrit for anemia of chronic disease. There is a concern for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed, but the patient does not show signs of hypovolemic instability. Her coagulation profile shows an elevated INR, which is likely due to nutritional factors. There are no signs of bleeding, and the patient is not on anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's blood pressure remains difficult to control despite multiple medications. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to end-organ damage.
2. Pulmonary Edema/Heart Failure: The patient's worsening pulmonary edema and dyspnea indicate potential heart failure. If left untreated, this can lead to respiratory distress and cardiac complications.
3. Uremia: As the patient has ESRD and is on PD, she is at risk of developing uremia. If not properly managed, uremia can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and metabolic acidosis.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's anemia and positive Guaiac test raise concerns for possible gastrointestinal bleeding. If significant bleeding occurs, it may result in hypovolemia and require urgent intervention.
5. Infection: Although the patient's leukocytosis is downward trending, it is important to monitor for any signs of infection. Infections can worsen renal function and lead to sepsis.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobility and renal failure. If a DVT develops, it can lead to pulmonary embolism, a life-threatening condition."
