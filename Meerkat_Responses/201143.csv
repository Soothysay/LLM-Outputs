   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   77 y.o. M with h/o Parkinson's, sickle trait, diet controlled DM,
   presented on [**2144-5-12**] from [**Hospital3 1254**] with 2 day history of fever,
   tachycardia and hypotension.  He spiked fevers to 102 and had been
   tachycardic to 130-150s.  Admission Physical exam noted large
   ecchymoses and 2 regions of soft tissue swelling on his left upper
   extremity.  He noted abdominal distension and stated that he had
   worsening L lower back pain over past two days prior to admission. Due
   to pancytopenia noticed on labs and recent fevers, he was transferred
   to [**Hospital1 5**] for further evaluation.
   .
   In the emergency department, initial vitals: T 100.7  BP 100/64   P
   108  RR 18  O2  95% RA.  On transfer to floor, T 103, P78.  Negative
   CXR and LUE U/S.  Empirically started on vancomycin and Zosyn.
   .
   On the medical floor, he continued to spike high fevers even with
   standing acetaminophen.  BCx grew out 1/4 bottles SCN (likley
   contaminant), so his vancomycin was stopped on day of tranfer.  Heme
   onc was consulted for pancytopenia, and the medicine team felt that
   hemophagocytic syndrome, MDS, and lymphoma are possible etiologies. On
   [**5-14**], BM biopsy was completed.  MRI/MRA of abdomen is pending due to
   abdominal distension with U/S that showed echogenic foci in liver.
   .
   [**5-14**]  the patient was triggered for HR in 150s. Per resident, pt was
   found rigoring but with stable BPs. He was bolused with fluids and
   vancomycin was restarted.  He also got one dose of Demerol for rigors.
   Due to sustained tachy cardia, he was transferred to the ICU.
   Vancomycin was stopped on day of transfer

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, sickle trait, and diet-controlled diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with fevers and tachycardia, along with splenomegaly and pancytopenia. The patient has been diagnosed with hemophagocytic syndrome, which is indicated by the presence of hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow biopsy. The cause of the hemophagocytic syndrome is currently unclear, with possibilities including primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or secondary infection-related hemophagocytic syndrome. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), elevated bilirubin levels (direct and total), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low platelet count, low hemoglobin, and low white blood cell count. The patient also has renal impairment, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. Other findings include electrolyte imbalances, elevated cardiac markers (CK, CK-MB, Troponin-T), and abnormal coagulation parameters (PTT, INR).

The patient is currently being treated with dexamethasone for hemophagocytic syndrome and is receiving supportive care in the ICU. He has been placed on full code status, meaning that resuscitative measures will be taken if his heart stops or if he experiences severe respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by disseminated"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, sickle trait, and diet-controlled diabetes mellitus. The patient presented with fevers and tachycardia, along with splenomegaly and pancytopenia. The patient's condition has been complicated by hemophagocytic syndrome, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and hypotension.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated liver enzymes. Additionally, the patient has an increased lactate dehydrogenase level, low calcium and magnesium levels, and abnormal arterial blood gas results.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient may have primary or secondary hemophagocytic syndrome, possibly related to infection. Viral studies are being sent to confirm the diagnosis. The patient is currently on dexamethasone therapy, and further recommendations from a hematologist regarding potential chemotherapy will be followed. The patient's code status remains full code, and there are no transfusions planned at this time. The patient is also being monitored for DIC, and daily ANC (absolute neutrophil count) will be performed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, sickle cell trait, and diet-controlled diabetes. He presented with fevers, tachycardia, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia, consistent with hemophagocytic syndrome. The bone marrow biopsy confirms this diagnosis, ruling out lymphoma. Viral studies are pending to determine the cause of the hemophagocytic syndrome.

The patient has been started on dexamethasone 20mg IV daily for now as the safest option. The family has been discussed regarding potential chemotherapy recommendations from the hematology-oncology team. The patient remains full code, with no transfusions given. 

The patient's condition has been complicated by acute renal failure (ARF), likely due to hypotension and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The elevated creatinine and potassium levels indicate worsening ARF, possibly related to diffuse coagulation throughout small vessels of the kidneys. The elevation in CK is likely secondary to rigors. The urine electrolyte results reveal a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) of 0.1%, suggesting appropriate renal response to hypovolemia. Hematuria is likely related to DIC and possibly Foley trauma.

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypotension. This may be due to vasodilation related to massive immune response, as well as"

   77 y.o. M with h/o Parkinson's, sickle trait and pancytopenia  admitted
   with persistent sinus tachycardia in 150s in setting of high fevers and
   rigors concerning hematophagocytic syndrome of unclear etiology
   (primary vs seconday)
   > Sinus tachycardia: Likely being driven by high fevers of 102-103,
   dramatic improvement with steroids overnight
   - fluid resus LR
   - monitor on telemetry
   > Fever: continues to spike high grade fevers with only 1/4 bottles of
   CNS, likely contaminant.  Still unclear what source of fevers; viral
   studies still pending. Plan on imaging abdomen today (CT scan with non
   ionic contrast). Seems reasonable to cover empirically as we would for
   neutropenic fever (evern though not technically neutropenic) with Vanco
   and Pip-Tazo pending further info on clxs. Although less likely there
   is a possibility of reactivation TB
   - f/u all viral studies
   - f/u cultures, sputum culture if possible
   - treat empirically with vanco/zosyn. Vanco level..
   - trend fever curve
   > Pancytopenia: Currently considering primary BM process i.e. MDS vs
   lymphoma vs hemophagocytic syndrome. s/p BM biopsy today.
   - appreciate Heme Onc recs
   - continue to trend CBC and ANC
   - neutropenic precautions
   - f/u viral studies that could cause marrow suppression.
   > DIC/Tumor lysis: concern for underlying malignancy vs viral process.
   Follow  labs.
   - start allopurinol
   - fractional ferritin.
   - serial DIC/tumor lysis labs q 6hrs
   - will have to find out what he can take as a Jehovah

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, sickle trait, and pancytopenia. He was admitted with persistent sinus tachycardia in the 150s, high fevers, and rigors. The concern is for hematophagocytic syndrome of unclear etiology (primary vs secondary). The patient continues to have high-grade fevers, and it is unclear what the source of the fevers is. There are pending viral studies, and a CT scan with non-ionic contrast is planned today to investigate the source of fever. The patient is being empirically covered with Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam due to the possibility of a reactivation of tuberculosis.

The patient has pancytopenia, and a bone marrow biopsy is being considered to evaluate for primary bone marrow process such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), lymphoma, or hemophagocytic syndrome. The patient is also being followed for DIC/tumor lysis syndrome, and labs are trending.

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, lines management, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition remains in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, sickle trait, and pancytopenia admitted with persistent sinus tachycardia in the 150s, high fevers, and rigors. The patient's symptoms are concerning for hematophagocytic syndrome of unclear etiology (primary vs secondary). The patient has been started on steroids, and there has been a dramatic improvement in his fever overnight. The patient's fever continues to spike high-grade fevers, and it is unclear what the source of the fevers is. Viral studies are still pending, and a CT scan with non-ionic contrast is planned today. The patient will be covered empirically with Vancomycin (Vanco) and Piperacillin-Tazobactam (Zosyn) pending further information on clots. Although less likely, there is a possibility of reactivation tuberculosis. 

The patient also has hematuria, concern for rhabdomyolysis in the setting of his rigors, and elevated creatine kinase (CK). The patient will continue hydration to prevent acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's liver function tests show a rising pattern consistent with liver injury, and a HIDA scan is being considered to clarify the possibility of cholecystitis. 

The patient's pancytopenia is being evaluated for primary bone marrow process with hemophagocytic syndrome. Hemat"

   77 y.o. M with h/o Parkinson's, sickle trait, diet controlled DM- with
   fevers and tachycardia / splenomegaly and pancytopenia now with
   hemophagocytic syndrome.
   # Hemophagocytic syndrome: based on aspirate and core bone marrow
   biopsy.  Currently could be primary vs. secondary related to infection.
   EBV serologies indicative of prior infection, not current. CMV
   negative, other studies pending.
   -follow up additional viral studies including parvovirus B19, VZV IgG
   and IgM, HSV 1 and 2 IgM, HHV8 IgG, fungal blood cultures
   -f/u other culture results
   -dexamethasone 20mg IV qday, rec'd initial dose on p.m. [**5-15**]
   -f/u heme onc recs regarding potential chemotherapy (likely Monday,
   would need transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name 203**])
   -code status d/w family, patient still full code, no transfusions
   -f/u AFB smear of aspirate, no lymphoma on BMB or CT scan
   -send daily tumor lysis labs and DIC labs, patient in DIC currently
   given elevated INR and PTT, low plts and low fibrinogen, elevated D
   dimer; continue D5 with bicarb for TLS
   -daily ANC
   -for DIC and steroid use will increase PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   -will continue vanc / zosyn (although cultures continue to be negative)
   # ARF: creatinine worsening in the setting of hypotension, DIC so
   likely diffuse coagulation throughout small vessels of kidney, CK
   elevation likely secondary to rigors. Slightly improved today, to 1.5.
   -urine lytes reveal a FeNa of 0.1%
   -hematuria likely related to DIC
   -continue fluid D5W w/ 150meq of bicarb at 100cc/hr given non gap
   acidosis and CK > 1000
   # Hematuria: Seems to be improving, will continue to monitor. Check
   urine myoglobin (still pending).
   # Cirrhosis on CT scan: Unclear etiology.
   - Check hepatitis A IgM
   - Will d/w heme/onc re: significance of LFT abnormalities and cirrhosis
   on CT scan
   # LFT abnormalities. Unclear etiology
could represent acalculous
   cholecystitis (but RUQ ultrasound normal on [**2144-5-13**]). ? related to
   hemophagocytic syndrome. Will continue to trend. Will touch base with
   heme/onc. [**Month (only) 8**] need HIDA scan; will discuss with heme/onc.
   # Hypotension: likely related to vasodilation related to massive immune
   response, also contributing factor may be blood loss related to DIC,
   has source of bleeding in urinary tract likely [**1-13**] foley trauma.  Bolus
   w/ LR prn.

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, sickle cell trait, and diet-controlled diabetes mellitus. He presented with fevers and tachycardia, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia, which are now diagnosed as hemophagocytic syndrome. 

The patient has been treated with dexamethasone, and additional viral studies are pending to determine if the hemophagocytic syndrome is primary or secondary. The patient is also being evaluated for potential chemotherapy and will likely be transferred to Hospital Ward 203 for further management.

The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) with worsening creatinine, likely due to hypotension and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). His urine sodium (FeNa) is 0.1%, indicating that his kidneys are conserving sodium effectively. The patient will continue to receive fluids and bicarbonate to manage the acidosis and high levels of creatine kinase (CK).

The patient also has hematuria, which appears to be improving, and his urine myoglobin levels are pending. There is a cirrhosis noted on the CT scan, but the etiology is unclear. The patient's liver function tests (LFT) are abnormal, and further evaluation, including hepatitis A IgM and a HIDA scan, is planned.

The patient has experienced hypotension, which is thought to be related to vasodilation from the massive immune response"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, sickle trait, and diet-controlled diabetes. He presented with fevers, tachycardia, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia, which are now consistent with hemophagocytic syndrome. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure (ARF), hematuria, cirrhosis on CT scan, and liver function test abnormalities. He is currently in the ICU and requires close monitoring and management of his various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemophagocytic Syndrome: This condition can lead to severe inflammation and organ damage. The patient's immune response may continue to cause systemic effects and potentially worsen his condition.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's worsening creatinine levels indicate kidney dysfunction. ARF can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.

3. Hematuria: The presence of blood in the urine could indicate ongoing kidney damage or trauma from procedures such as Foley catheter insertion. Monitoring urine output and assessing kidney function is crucial.

4. Cirrhosis on CT scan: The cause of cirrhosis needs to be investigated further, as it could be related to underlying liver disease or a complication of hemophagocytic syndrome. Management of cirrhosis involves preventing complications like portal hypertension and hepatic encephalopathy.

5. Liver Function Test Abnormalities: Elevated"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, sickle trait, diet-controlled diabetes, fevers, tachycardia, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia. The patient is currently being treated for hemophagocytic syndrome, which could be primary or secondary related to infection. Additional viral studies are needed to determine the cause. The patient is receiving dexamethasone, and further recommendations from the hematology/oncology team regarding potential chemotherapy are awaited.

The patient's ARF (acute renal failure) is worsening, likely due to hypotension and DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation). The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and there is evidence of diffuse coagulation throughout the small vessels of the kidneys. The elevation in CK (creatine kinase) is likely secondary to rigors. The patient's urine sodium fraction (FeNa) is 0.1%, indicating that the kidneys are attempting to conserve sodium. Hematuria is present, which may be related to DIC. The patient is receiving D5W with 150meq of bicarb at 100cc/hr to address non-gap acidosis and CK levels above 1000.

The patient's hematuria seems to be improving, and monitoring will continue. The urine myoglobin should be checked. Cirrhosis is noted on the CT scan, but the etiology"

He presents with splenomegaly, pancytopenia, and hemophagocytic syndrome. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and liver function test abnormalities. He also has a left pleural effusion on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on dexamethasone, and further recommendations from the hematology/oncology team are pending regarding potential chemotherapy. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemophagocytic Syndrome: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest hemophagocytic syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by abnormal immune system activation. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's pleural effusion may compromise his respiratory function. If left untreated, it could progress to acute respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation support.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate possible AKI. Factors such as hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and medication side effects may contribute to kidney injury.
4. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's liver function test abnormalities suggest potential hepatic"

   with persistent sinus tachycardia in 150s in setting of high fevers and
   rigors concerning hematophagocytic syndrome of unclear etiology
   (primary vs seconday)
   > Sinus tachycardia: Likely being driven by high fevers of 102-103,
   dramatic improvement with steroids overnight
   - fluid resus LR
   - monitor on telemetry
    > Fever: continues to spike high grade fevers with only 1/4 bottles of
   CNS, likely contaminant.  Still unclear what source of fevers; viral
   studies still pending. Plan on imaging abdomen today (CT scan with non
   ionic contrast). Seems reasonable to cover empirically as we would for
   neutropenic fever (evern though not technically neutropenic) with Vanco
   and Pip-Tazo pending further info on clxs. Although less likely there
   is a possibility of reactivation TB
   - f/u all viral studies
   - f/u cultures, sputum culture if possible
   - treat empirically with vanco/zosyn. Vanco level..
   - trend fever curve
   > Hematuria: concern also with elevated CK in the setting of his rigors
   for rhabdomyolysis(protein in urine trending down). Will cont hydration
   to prevent ATN
   - check urine myoglobin
   - cont hydration decrease to 100 cc/hr
   -supportive therapy (not a transfusion candidate)
   > Transaminitis: unclear etiology to transaminitis and unexpected CT
   scan (? Cirrhosis): with neg Hep B and C. Unclear etiology (does not
   appear to any liver infiltration by a malignant process ? related to
   hematophg syndrome). Has a rising pattern c/w liver injury. Also with ?
   of cholecystitis on CT scan, seems less likely
   - d/w Onc: ? HIDA scan., could this be [**1-13**] DIC?
    > Pancytopenia: Currently considering primary BM process  with
   hemophagocytic syndrome with evidence of hemophag syndrome on hx (no
   obv secondary etiologies)
   - appreciate Heme Onc recs (would cont empiric steroids for now)
   - continue to trend CBC and ANC
   - neutropenic precautions
   - f/u viral studies that could cause marrow suppression (EBV and CMV
   negative at this point)
   - No evidence of lymphoma on marrow
   - awaiting AFB smear
   - unable to transfuse at this point
   > DIC/Tumor lysis: concern for underlying malignancy vs viral process.
   Follow  labs.
   - start allopurinol
   - serial DIC/tumor lysis labs
   - will have to find out what he can take as a Jehovah

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, sickle trait, and pancytopenia. He was admitted with persistent sinus tachycardia in the 150s in the setting of high fevers and rigors. The initial assessment suggests a possible hematophagocytic syndrome of unclear etiology (primary vs secondary). The patient has been experiencing sinus tachycardia, high-grade fevers, and rigors, which have improved with steroids. There is a concern for an underlying malignancy or viral process. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematophagocytic Syndrome: This is a condition characterized by an excessive immune response that can lead to multi-organ dysfunction. It is often associated with infections, malignancies, or autoimmune disorders.
2. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently above the normal range (100-110 bpm). If left untreated, it may lead to complications such as arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of endocarditis.
3. Fever: The patient's temperature has been spiking high-grade fevers, which could indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. If not properly managed, it can increase the risk of sepsis and septic shock.
4. Rhabdomyolysis: The elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) suggest muscle breakdown. If not addressed, it can lead to kidney injury"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y.o. M with h/o Parkinson's, sickle trait and pancytopenia  admitted
   with persistent sinus tachycardia in 150s in setting of high fevers and
   rigors concerning hematophagocytic syndrome of unclear etiology
   (primary vs seconday)
   > Sinus tachycardia: Likely being driven by high fevers of 102-103,
   dramatic improvement with steroids, now stable
   - decrease IVF (no evidence of tumor lysis and tolerating PO well with
   down trending CK)
   - monitor on telemetry
    > Fever: continues to spike high grade fevers with only 1/4 bottles of
   CNS, likely contaminant.  Still unclear what source of fevers; viral
   studies still pending. Plan on imaging abdomen today (CT scan with non
   ionic contrast). Seems reasonable to cover empirically as we would for
   neutropenic fever (evern though not technically neutropenic) with Vanco
   and Pip-Tazo pending further info on clxs. Although less likely there
   is a possibility of reactivation TB
   - f/u all viral studies
   - All clx neg to date.
   - treat empirically with vanco/zosyn. Vanco level..
   - trend fever curve
   > Hematuria: concern also with elevated CK in the setting of his rigors
   for rhabdomyolysis(protein in urine trending down). Will cont hydration
   to prevent ATN, his CK has improved. Will hold on further IVF
   -supportive therapy (not a transfusion candidate)
   > Transaminitis: unclear etiology to transaminitis and unexpected CT
   scan (? Cirrhosis): with neg Hep B and C. Unclear etiology (does not
   appear to any liver infiltration by a malignant process ? related to
   hematophg syndrome). Has a rising pattern c/w liver injury. Also with ?
   of cholecystitis on CT scan, seems less likely. Concerning that LDH and
   bili continue to rise of unclear etiology.
   - d/w Onc: ? HIDA scan., could this be [**1-13**] DIC?
   - liver consult for ? of obstructive pattern.
    > Pancytopenia: Currently considering primary BM process  with
   hemophagocytic syndrome with evidence of hemophag syndrome on hx (no
   obv secondary etiologies)
   - appreciate Heme Onc recs (would cont empiric steroids for now)
   - continue to trend CBC and ANC
   - neutropenic precautions
   - f/u viral studies that could cause marrow suppression (EBV and CMV
   negative at this point)
   - No evidence of lymphoma on marrow
   - awaiting AFB smear (should have answer
   - unable to transfuse at this point: cont epo
   > DIC/Tumor lysis: concern for underlying malignancy vs viral process.
   Follow  labs.  No evidence of active tumor lysis at this point
   - cont  allopurinol
   - followl DIC/tumor lysis labs
   - will accept
   Additional issues per ICU resident notes

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, sickle trait, and pancytopenia. He was admitted with persistent sinus tachycardia, high fevers, and rigors. The differential diagnosis includes hematophagocytic syndrome of unclear etiology (primary vs secondary), possible contaminant infection, and reactivation TB. The patient is currently being treated empirically with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematophagocytic Syndrome: This is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by excessive immune system activation, leading to widespread inflammation and organ damage. It can cause fever, high cardiac output state (evidenced by sinus tachycardia), and multi-organ dysfunction.

2. Sepsis: The patient's high fevers, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. If the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly, it can progress to sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.

3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, hematuria, and history of rigors raise concerns for rhabdomyolysis, a condition where muscle breakdown occurs due to severe muscle injury or stress. This can lead to kidney damage and other complications.

4. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated"
