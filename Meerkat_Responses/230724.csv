   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo M with h/o COPD, AS s/p AVR, afib, right nephrectomy for RCC,
   colon ca s/p colectomy. Recent admission for PNA, re-admission for
   shortness of breath and fevers. Transferred to the MICU for hypoxia
   following bronchoscopy.
   # Acute respiratory distress: Based on CXR and recent bronchoscopy most
   likely mucus plugging worsened by underlying effusion, atelactasis and
   possible post-obstructive pneumonia. Patient has known DVT, but based
   on significant findings on CXR and current anticoagulation unlikely PE.
   Patient febrile on admission which could be related to recent
   bronchoscopy, however due to rising WBC will cover for HAP until BAL
   returns. No chest pain to suggest ACS or hypotension to suggest AVR
   dysfunction. Less likely CHF as CXR findings unilateral and symptoms
   acute on onset, however patient duiresising well to lasix given on
   floor. No abdominal pain and benign exam therefore unlikely abdominal
   pathology (recent obstructed hernia with demonstrated improvement on
   recent CT scan).
   - Start Vancomycin 1 gram q24hour, Cefepime 2 g IV q12h, Flagyl 500 mg
   IV q8hr for HAP (flagyl based on ID recs and possible post-obstructive
   PNA).
   - Standing NEBs, humidity, chest PT, encourage cough, incentive
   spirometry
   - Position on left side for improved oxygenation
   - Pan-culture, follow BAL
   - Trends cardiac enzymes, EKG in am
   - Continue heparin drip
   - Follow respiratory status closely, if worsens consider intubation and
   bronch
   - If complains of abdominal pain consider KUB to assess hernia
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient with continued fevers on floor. Work-up
   so far unrevealing other than persistant RLL/RML opacities. Negative
   blood culture, urine culture and c. diff X 1. Most likely etiology is
   post-obstructive pneumonia.
   - Treat HAP as above
   - Follow BAL
   - Appreciate ID recs
   # Ventral Hernia: Currently no abdominal pain, benign exam with bowel
   sounds. CT scan [**2178-3-27**] demonstrated partial colonic obstruction with
   CT scan [**2178-3-29**] demonstrating overall improvement.
   - Monitor abdominal exam, consider imaging if changes
   # Recent GI Bleed: HCT stable 32, unlikely to be causing acute change
   in respiratory status. No melena during this admission.
   - Patient high colonoscopy perforation risk due to colonic distension,
   discuss GI long-term plans. Per notes planning to do EGD this admission
   once patient stabilizes.
   - Continue IV pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **]
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac stool
   # DVT: Continue heparin drip for now. Could consider coumadin once GI
   plans are finalized.
   # Chronic Diastolic CHF (EF>55%): Unlikely acute episode due to CXR
   findings and s/p bronch (see above).
   - continue holding Lasix per floor due to limited PO intake
   - Low Na diet, strict I/O's, fluid restriction 1500cc
   # COPD: moderate to severe.
   - standing nebs prn
   # Afib: Rate controlled. Off coumadin temporarily per floor team,
   CHADS2 score is 3 and bioprosthetic valve. Echo showed no evidence of
   thrombus.
   - continue metoprolol and dilt
   - continue heparin for now; consider coumadin if GI bleed stable
   # GERD: Continue pantoprazole.
   # CKD: At baseline.
   - renally dose all meds
   # Triple A: Stable, per vascular surgery will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as
   outpatient.
   # History of ITP: Currently within normal limits. Trend platelets.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, colon cancer status post colectomy, and previous admissions for pneumonia and shortness of breath. He was recently admitted for hypoxia following a bronchoscopy and is now in the MICU.

The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress. He has been febrile on admission, and his white blood cell count is rising, leading to coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) until the results of a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are available. His vital signs include a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 80/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on a face tent, and temperature of 36.2Â°C.

The patient's physical examination reveals atrial fibrillation and poor peripheral pulses. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No abdominal pain or tenderness is noted, and his neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a total white blood cell count of 24.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, troponin-T levels within normal range, and lactic acid at 1.8 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Acute respiratory distress: The most likely cause is mucus plugging worsened by underlying effusion, atelectasis, and possible post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has a known deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but is unlikely to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) due to current anticoagulation. The patient will be started on vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl for HAP. Respiratory support measures such as nebulizers, humidity, chest physiotherapy, and incentive spirometry will be continued. The patient will be positioned on his left side for improved oxygenation.

2. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient has persistent right lower lobe/right middle lobe opacities on chest X-ray, negative blood and urine cultures, and a negative Clostridium difficile test. The most likely etiology is post-obstructive pneumonia. Treatment for HAP will be continued, and the patient's BAL results will be followed.

3. Ventral Hernia: The patient has a history of ventral hernia, but currently, there is no abdominal pain or tenderness. CT scans have shown improvement in the partial colonic obstruction.

4. Recent GI Bleed: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is stable, making acute gastrointestinal bleeding unlikely. No melena has been observed during this admission. The patient is at high risk for perforation due to colonic distension and will have"

   24 Hour Events:
   - talked with primary team, patient being anticoagulated for DVT; had
   thought about a possible filter, but will likely need anticoagulation
   indefinitely for afib so didn't pursue that
   - GI had plans to scope in future, no scheduled scope soon; last
   admission was when he had melena and fatigue, now has slow drifts in
   hct and guiac pos stools; transfused 1u [**3-25**] and 1u [**3-30**].  Yesterday he
   had a guaiac negative stool.
   - ID recommended adding on cipro or tobra for double coverage GNs if he
   deteriorates more
   - would consider PICC today
   - O/N maintains sats on facemask but then desats when removes from face
   - L sided lower back rash noted yesterday

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of COPD, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, colon cancer surgery, and recent admissions for pneumonia and shortness of breath. The patient was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia following a bronchoscopy.

The patient has been experiencing acute respiratory distress, and a chest X-ray showed improvement in findings from previous admissions. The most likely cause of the mucus plugging is worsened by underlying effusion, atelectasis, and possible post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient also has known deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but is currently on anticoagulation therapy.

The patient has been febrile on admission, which could be related to the recent bronchoscopy. The white blood cell count has risen, so coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is being provided until the results of a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are available. There is no chest pain to suggest acute coronary syndrome or hypotension to suggest aortic valve dysfunction. Less likely causes of the symptoms include congestive heart failure, abdominal pathology, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl for HAP, as well as pantoprazole for gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is also on heparin therapy for DVT"

   82 yo M with h/o COPD, AS s/p AVR, afib, right nephrectomy for RCC,
   colon ca s/p colectomy. Recent admission for PNA, re-admission for
   shortness of breath and fevers. Transferred to the MICU for hypoxia
   following bronchoscopy.
   # Acute respiratory distress: CXR somewhat improved. Based on CXR and
   recent bronchoscopy most likely mucus plugging worsened by underlying
   effusion, atelactasis and possible post-obstructive pneumonia. Patient
   has known DVT, but based on significant findings on CXR and current
   anticoagulation unlikely PE. Patient febrile on admission which could
   be related to recent bronchoscopy, however due to rising WBC will cover
   for HAP until BAL returns. No chest pain to suggest ACS or hypotension
   to suggest AVR dysfunction. Less likely CHF as CXR findings unilateral
   and symptoms acute on onset, however patient duiresising well to lasix
   given on floor. No abdominal pain and benign exam therefore unlikely
   abdominal pathology (recent obstructed hernia with demonstrated
   improvement on recent CT scan).    Cardiac enzymes 0.05

   - On Vancomycin 1 gram q24hour, Cefepime 2 g IV q12h, Flagyl 500 mg IV
   q8hr for HAP (flagyl based on ID recs and possible post-obstructive
   PNA).
   - Standing NEBs, humidity, chest PT, encourage cough, incentive
   spirometry
   - Position on left side for improved oxygenation
   - Pan-culture, follow BAL
   - Continue heparin drip
   - Follow respiratory status closely, if worsens consider intubation and
   bronch
   - If complains of abdominal pain consider KUB to assess hernia
   - try to ambulate if possible
   - PT consult
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient with continued fevers on floor. Work-up
   so far unrevealing other than persistent RLL/RML opacities. Negative
   blood culture, urine culture and c. diff X thus far. Most likely
   etiology is post-obstructive pneumonia.  WBC doubled since yesterday,
   although pt. has been afebrile.
   - Treat HAP as above
   - Follow BAL
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - if clinically worsens plan to add tobra per ID recs
   # Ventral Hernia: Currently no abdominal pain, benign exam with bowel
   sounds. CT scan [**2178-3-27**] demonstrated partial colonic obstruction with
   CT scan [**2178-3-29**] demonstrating overall improvement.
   - Monitor abdominal exam, consider imaging if changes
   # Recent GI Bleed: HCT drop from 32
 27.7. Has gotten several fluid
   boluses and had heme negative stool yesterday.  No melena during this
   admission.
   - Patient high colonoscopy perforation risk due to colonic distension,
   discuss GI long-term plans. Per notes planning to do EGD this admission
   once patient stabilizes.
   - Continue IV pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **]
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac stool
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct checks
   # DVT: Continue heparin drip for now. Could consider coumadin once GI
   plans are finalized.
    - once hct stable consider anticoagulation options
   # Chronic Diastolic CHF (EF>55%): Unlikely acute episode due to CXR
   findings and s/p bronch (see above).
   - continue holding Lasix per floor due to limited PO intake, consider
   restarting tomorrow
   - Low Na diet, strict I/O's, fluid restriction 1500cc
   # COPD: moderate to severe.
   - standing nebs prn
   - start spiriva
   # Afib: Rate controlled. Off coumadin temporarily per floor team,
   CHADS2 score is 3 and bioprosthetic valve. Echo showed no evidence of
   thrombus.  Pt. continues to be tachy in 110s.
   - restart metoprolol at half dose
   - continue dilt
   - continue heparin for now; consider coumadin if GI bleed stable
   # GERD: Continue pantoprazole.
   # CKD: At baseline.
   - renally dose all meds

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of COPD, aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (afib), right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and colon cancer status post colectomy. The patient has been admitted multiple times for pneumonia (PNA), shortness of breath, and fevers. He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia following bronchoscopy.

The patient's current presentation includes acute respiratory distress, fevers, and leukocytosis. The acute respiratory distress is likely due to mucus plugging worsened by underlying effusion, atelectasis, and possible post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient also has a known deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but based on significant findings on chest X-ray and current anticoagulation, pulmonary embolism (PE) is unlikely.

The patient's fevers could be related to recent bronchoscopy, but due to rising white blood cell count, coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is being initiated until bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results return. There are no signs of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or aortic valve dysfunction. Chronic diastolic heart failure is less likely as the chest X-ray findings are unilateral and symptoms are acute in onset.

Other assessments include ongoing management for ventral hernia, recent gastrointestinal bleed, and chronic kidney disease."

   24 Hour Events:
   - talked with primary team, patient being anticoagulated for DVT; had
   thought about a possible filter, but will likely need anticoagulation
   indefinitely for afib so didn't pursue that
   - GI had plans to scope in future, no scheduled scope soon; last
   admission was when he had melena and fatigue, now has slow drifts in
   hct and guiac pos stools; transfused 1u [**3-25**] and 1u [**3-30**].  Yesterday he
   had a guaiac negative stool.
   - ID recommended adding on cipro or tobra for double coverage GNs if he
   deteriorates more

   has known DVT, but based on significant findings on CXR and current
   anticoagulation unlikely PE. Patient febrile on admission which could
   be related to recent bronchoscopy, however due to rising WBC will cover
   for HAP until BAL returns. No chest pain to suggest ACS or hypotension
   to suggest AVR dysfunction. Less likely CHF as CXR findings unilateral

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, colon cancer status post colectomy, and previous pneumonia. The patient was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia following a bronchoscopy.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Acute respiratory distress: The patient has worsening mucus plugging worsened by underlying effusion, atelectasis, and possible post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient is febrile on admission, which could be related to the recent bronchoscopy. However, due to rising white blood cell count, coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) has been initiated until the results of a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are available.

2. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient has continued fevers on the floor, and the work-up so far has been unrevealing. Negative blood culture, urine culture, and Clostridium difficile toxin have been found. The most likely etiology is post-obstructive pneumonia. The same treatment plan for HAP as mentioned earlier will be continued, and the BAL results will be followed.

3. Ventral hernia: The patient has a ventral hernia, but currently, there is no abdominal pain, and the exam is benign with bowel sounds present. CT scans"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, and previous surgeries including AVR, nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, and colectomy for colon cancer. He was recently admitted for pneumonia and readmitted for shortness of breath and fevers. He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia following a bronchoscopy. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory distress, fevers, leukocytosis, ventral hernia, recent GI bleed, DVT, chronic diastolic CHF, moderate to severe COPD, atrial fibrillation, GERD, CKD, triple A, history of ITP, and FEN. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress: The patient has worsening respiratory symptoms, including hypoxia and increased work of breathing. There is a concern for mucus plugging, effusion, atelectasis, and possible post-obstructive pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status is essential, and intubation may be considered if there is worsening respiratory function.
2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has persistent fevers and leukocytosis, indicating an ongoing infection. Current antibiotic therapy is appropriate, but further evaluation is needed, including obtaining BAL cultures. If the patient's condition worsens, additional antibiotics may be necessary.
3. Ventral Hernia: Although the patient currently does not"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo M with h/o COPD, AS s/p AVR, afib, right nephrectomy for RCC,
   colon ca s/p colectomy. Recent admission for PNA, re-admission for
   shortness of breath and fevers. Transferred to the MICU for hypoxia
   following bronchoscopy.
   # Acute respiratory distress: Clinically, similar to yesterday. CXR
   somewhat improved. Based on CXR and recent bronchoscopy most likely
   mucus plugging worsened by underlying effusion, atelactasis and
   possible post-obstructive pneumonia. Patient has known DVT, but based
   on significant findings on CXR and current anticoagulation unlikely PE.
   Patient febrile on admission which could be related to recent
   bronchoscopy, however due to rising WBC will cover for HAP until BAL
   returns. No chest pain to suggest ACS or hypotension to suggest AVR
   dysfunction. Less likely CHF as CXR findings unilateral and symptoms
   acute on onset, however patient duiresising well to lasix given on
   floor. No abdominal pain and benign exam therefore unlikely abdominal
   pathology (recent obstructed hernia with demonstrated improvement on
   recent CT scan).    Cardiac enzymes 0.05
0.13

   - On, Cefepime 2 g IV q12h, Flagyl 500 mg IV q8hr for HAP (flagyl based
   on ID recs and possible post-obstructive PNA).
   - Change vanc to 750 q12 (from 1000q12)
   - Standing NEBs, humidity, chest PT, encourage cough, OOB incentive
   spirometry
   - Position on left side for improved oxygenation
   - Follow BAL
   - Continue heparin drip
   - Follow respiratory status closely, if worsens consider intubation and
   bronch
   - If complains of abd apin
 consider KUB
   - try to ambulate
   - PT consulted; f/u recs
   # Tachycardia: ddx includes hypovolemia, secondary to infection (PNA).
   PE is also possibility given known DVT, but diagnosis would not change
   management at this point (patient is on heparin drip).
   - Bolus 1L NS and continue with maintenance fluid @ 100cc/hr
   - Check central/ mixed venous venous sat
   - Hold off on beta-blockers
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient with continued fevers on floor. Work-up
   so far unrevealing other than persistent RLL/RML opacities. Negative
   blood culture, urine culture and c. diff X thus far. Most likely
   etiology is post-obstructive pneumonia.  WBC doubled since yesterday,
   although pt. has been afebrile.
   - Treat HAP as above
   - Follow BAL
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - if clinically worsens plan to add tobra per ID recs
   # DVT: on heparin drip for now. Could consider coumadin once GI plans
   are finalized.
   - Transition to lovenox today: 1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **]
   # Ventral Hernia: Currently no abdominal pain, benign exam with bowel
   sounds. CT scan [**2178-3-27**] demonstrated partial colonic obstruction with
   CT scan [**2178-3-29**] demonstrating overall improvement.
   - Monitor abdominal exam, consider imaging if changes

 27.7. Has gotten several fluid
   boluses and had heme negative stool yesterday.  No melena during this
   admission.
   - Patient high colonoscopy perforation risk due to colonic distension,
   discuss GI long-term plans. Per notes planning to do EGD this admission
   once patient stabilizes.
   - Continue IV pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **]

   # Chronic Diastolic CHF (EF>55%): Unlikely acute episode due to CXR
   findings and s/p bronch (see above).
   - continue holding Lasix per floor due to limited PO intake, consider
   restarting tomorrow
   - Low Na diet, strict I/O's, fluid restriction 1500cc
   # COPD: moderate to severe.
   - standing nebs prn, including spiriva and xopinex started today
   - Consider transitioning to PRN instead of standing xopinex due to
   persistent tachycardia.
   # Afib: Rate controlled. Off coumadin temporarily per floor team,
   CHADS2 score is 3 and bioprosthetic valve. Echo showed no evidence of

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of COPD, aortic stenosis, right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, colon cancer, and recent admissions for pneumonia and shortness of breath. He is currently in the ICU for hypoxia following bronchoscopy. The patient has been febrile on admission, and his WBC count has risen, so he is being covered for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) until the results of a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are available. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a face tent, and he has diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezing, more prominent on the right side with rhonchi and decreased breath sounds on the right. His cardiac status is complicated by atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, and he has a history of DVT, although pulmonary embolism is less likely given current anticoagulation. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 24.8, elevated CRP, and slightly elevated troponin T levels. His electrolytes are within normal limits, but his platelet count is low at 115,000/mL. His renal function is at baseline, and his liver function tests are also within normal limits.

   82 yo M with h/o COPD, AS s/p AVR, afib, right nephrectomy for RCC,
   colon ca s/p colectomy. Recent admission for PNA, re-admission for
   shortness of breath and fevers. Transferred to the MICU for hypoxia
   following bronchoscopy.
   # Acute respiratory distress: CXR somewhat improved. Based on CXR and
   recent bronchoscopy most likely mucus plugging worsened by underlying
   effusion, atelactasis and possible post-obstructive pneumonia. Patient
   has known DVT, but based on significant findings on CXR and current
   anticoagulation unlikely PE. Patient febrile on admission which could
   be related to recent bronchoscopy, however due to rising WBC will cover
   for HAP until BAL returns. No chest pain to suggest ACS or hypotension
   to suggest AVR dysfunction. Less likely CHF as CXR findings unilateral
   and symptoms acute on onset, however patient duiresising well to lasix
   given on floor. No abdominal pain and benign exam therefore unlikely
   abdominal pathology (recent obstructed hernia with demonstrated
   improvement on recent CT scan).    Cardiac enzymes 0.05

   q8hr for HAP (flagyl based on ID recs and possible post-obstructive
   PNA).
   - Standing NEBs, humidity, chest PT, encourage cough, incentive
   spirometry
   - Position on left side for improved oxygenation
   - Pan-culture, follow BAL
   - Continue heparin drip
   - Follow respiratory status closely, if worsens consider intubation and
   bronch
   - If complains of abdominal pain consider KUB to assess hernia
   - try to ambulate if possible
   - PT consult
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient with continued fevers on floor. Work-up
   so far unrevealing other than persistent RLL/RML opacities. Negative
   blood culture, urine culture and c. diff X thus far. Most likely
   etiology is post-obstructive pneumonia.  WBC doubled since yesterday,
   although pt. has been afebrile.
   - Treat HAP as above
   - Follow BAL
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - if clinically worsens plan to add tobra per ID recs
   # Ventral Hernia: Currently no abdominal pain, benign exam with bowel
   sounds. CT scan [**2178-3-27**] demonstrated partial colonic obstruction with
   CT scan [**2178-3-29**] demonstrating overall improvement.
   - Monitor abdominal exam, consider imaging if changes
   # Recent GI Bleed: HCT drop from 32
 27.7. Has gotten several fluid
   boluses and had heme negative stool yesterday.  No melena during this
   admission.
   - Patient high colonoscopy perforation risk due to colonic distension,
   discuss GI long-term plans. Per notes planning to do EGD this admission
   once patient stabilizes.
   - Continue IV pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **]
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac stool
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct checks
   # DVT: Continue heparin drip for now. Could consider coumadin once GI
   plans are finalized.
    - once hct stable consider anticoagulation options
   # Chronic Diastolic CHF (EF>55%): Unlikely acute episode due to CXR
   findings and s/p bronch (see above).
   - continue holding Lasix per floor due to limited PO intake, consider
   restarting tomorrow
   - Low Na diet, strict I/O's, fluid restriction 1500cc
   # COPD: moderate to severe.
   - standing nebs prn
   - start spiriva
   # Afib: Rate controlled. Off coumadin temporarily per floor team,
   CHADS2 score is 3 and bioprosthetic valve. Echo showed no evidence of
   thrombus.  Pt. continues to be tachy in 110s.
   - restart metoprolol at half dose
   - continue dilt
   - continue heparin for now; consider coumadin if GI bleed stable
   # GERD: Continue pantoprazole.
   # CKD: At baseline.
   - renally dose all meds
   # Triple A: Stable, per vascular surgery will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as
   outpatient.
   # History of ITP: Currently within normal limits. Trend platelets.
   # FEN: No IVF, electrolytes prn, advance diet today and monitor for
   aspiration
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with IV heparin
   -Bowel regimen colace

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, and right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, among other conditions. He was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia following a bronchoscopy and has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress, likely due to mucus plugging worsened by an underlying effusion, atelectasis, and possible post-obstructive pneumonia. He also has known deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but it is unlikely to be a pulmonary embolism (PE) based on significant findings on chest X-ray and current anticoagulation.

The patient is febrile on admission, which could be related to the recent bronchoscopy. He is also leukocytic, so coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) has been initiated until the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results return. There are no signs of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or aortic valve replacement dysfunction. While congestive heart failure (CHF) is less likely, the patient is diuresing well to lasix given on the floor.

The patient has a ventral hernia that showed improvement on recent CT scans, so it will be monitored closely. There is no evidence of recent gastrointestinal bleed, but the patient has had a significant drop in hemoglobin (HCT) from 32 to 27.7. He has received several fluid boluses and had heme-negative"

   - PT consulted; f/u recs
   # Tachycardia: ddx includes hypovolemia, secondary to infection (PNA).
   PE is also possibility given known DVT, but diagnosis would not change
   management at this point (patient is on heparin drip).
   - Bolus 1L NS and continue with maintenance fluid @ 100cc/hr
   - Check central/ mixed venous venous sat
   - Hold off on beta-blockers
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient with continued fevers on floor. Work-up
   so far unrevealing other than persistent RLL/RML opacities. Negative
   blood culture, urine culture and c. diff X thus far. Most likely
   etiology is post-obstructive pneumonia.  WBC doubled since yesterday,
   although pt. has been afebrile.
   - Treat HAP as above
   - Follow BAL
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - if clinically worsens plan to add tobra per ID recs
   # DVT: on heparin drip for now. Could consider coumadin once GI plans
   are finalized.
   - Transition to lovenox today: 1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **]
   # Ventral Hernia: Currently no abdominal pain, benign exam with bowel
   sounds. CT scan [**2178-3-27**] demonstrated partial colonic obstruction with
   CT scan [**2178-3-29**] demonstrating overall improvement.
   - Monitor abdominal exam, consider imaging if changes
   # Recent GI Bleed: HCT drop from 32
 27.7. Has gotten several fluid
   boluses and had heme negative stool yesterday.  No melena during this
   admission.
   - Patient high colonoscopy perforation risk due to colonic distension,
   discuss GI long-term plans. Per notes planning to do EGD this admission
   once patient stabilizes.
   - Continue IV pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **]
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac stool
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct checks
   # Chronic Diastolic CHF (EF>55%): Unlikely acute episode due to CXR
   findings and s/p bronch (see above).
   - continue holding Lasix per floor due to limited PO intake, consider
   restarting tomorrow
   - Low Na diet, strict I/O's, fluid restriction 1500cc
   # COPD: moderate to severe.
   - standing nebs prn, including spiriva and xopinex started today
   - Consider transitioning to PRN instead of standing xopinex due to
   persistent tachycardia.
   # Afib: Rate controlled. Off coumadin temporarily per floor team,
   CHADS2 score is 3 and bioprosthetic valve. Echo showed no evidence of
   thrombus.  Pt. continues to be tachy in 110s.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of COPD, aortic stenosis after aortic valve replacement (AVR), right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and colon cancer status post colectomy. He was recently admitted for pneumonia and re-admitted for shortness of breath and fevers. He is now in the MICU for hypoxia following a bronchoscopy.

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory distress, tachycardia, fevers/leukocytosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventral hernia, recent GI bleed, chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), COPD, atrial fibrillation (AF), GERD, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and triple A (abdominal aortic aneurysm).

Assessment and plan:
1. Acute respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory condition is similar to yesterday. Chest X-ray has improved, but there is still concern for mucus plugging, effusion, atelectasis, and possible post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient is febrile, which could be related to the recent bronchoscopy, and there is a rising white blood cell count, so coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is being initiated until the results of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are available. The patient is also on mechanical ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo M with h/o COPD, AS s/p AVR, afib, right nephrectomy for RCC,
   colon ca s/p colectomy. Recent admission for PNA, re-admission for
   shortness of breath and fevers. Transferred to the MICU for hypoxia
   following bronchoscopy.
   # Acute respiratory distress: Clinically, similar to yesterday. CXR
   somewhat improved. Based on CXR and recent bronchoscopy most likely
   mucus plugging worsened by underlying effusion, atelactasis and
   possible post-obstructive pneumonia. Patient has known DVT, but based
   on significant findings on CXR and current anticoagulation unlikely PE.
   Patient febrile on admission which could be related to recent
   bronchoscopy, however due to rising WBC will cover for HAP until BAL
   returns. No chest pain to suggest ACS or hypotension to suggest AVR
   dysfunction. Less likely CHF as CXR findings unilateral and symptoms
   acute on onset, however patient duiresising well to lasix given on
   floor. No abdominal pain and benign exam therefore unlikely abdominal
   pathology (recent obstructed hernia with demonstrated improvement on
   recent CT scan).    Cardiac enzymes 0.05

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, and colon cancer status post colectomy. He was admitted for pneumonia and subsequently readmitted for shortness of breath and fevers. The patient was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia following a bronchoscopy.

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory distress, tachycardia, fevers/leukocytosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventral hernia, recent gastrointestinal bleed, chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, COPD, atrial fibrillation, GERD, chronic kidney disease, triple A syndrome, history of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and feeding tube placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status remains similar to yesterday, with decreased breath sounds on the right side compared to the left and expiratory wheezes. The most likely cause is mucus plugging worsened by underlying effusion, atelectasis, and possible post-obstructive pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo M with h/o COPD, AS s/p AVR, afib, right nephrectomy for RCC,
   colon ca s/p colectomy. Recent admission for PNA, re-admission for
   shortness of breath and fevers. Transferred to the MICU for hypoxia
   following bronchoscopy.
   # Acute respiratory distress: Clinically, similar to yesterday. CXR
   somewhat improved. Based on CXR and recent bronchoscopy most likely
   mucus plugging worsened by underlying effusion, atelactasis and
   possible post-obstructive pneumonia. Patient has known DVT, but based
   on significant findings on CXR and current anticoagulation unlikely PE.
   Patient febrile on admission which could be related to recent
   bronchoscopy, however due to rising WBC will cover for HAP until BAL
   returns. No chest pain to suggest ACS or hypotension to suggest AVR
   dysfunction. Less likely CHF as CXR findings unilateral and symptoms
   acute on onset, however patient duiresising well to lasix given on
   floor. No abdominal pain and benign exam therefore unlikely abdominal
   pathology (recent obstructed hernia with demonstrated improvement on
   recent CT scan).    Cardiac enzymes 0.05
0.13
0.08
   - On, Cefepime 2 g IV q12h, Flagyl 500 mg IV q8hr for HAP (flagyl based
   on ID recs and possible post-obstructive PNA).
   - Change vanc to 750 q12 (from 1000q12)
   - Standing NEBs, humidity, chest PT, encourage cough, OOB incentive
   spirometry
   - Position on left side for improved oxygenation
   - Follow BAL
   - Continue heparin drip
   - Follow respiratory status closely, if worsens consider intubation and
   bronch
   - If complains of abd apin
 consider KUB
   - try to ambulate
   - PT consulted; f/u recs
   - Must follow-up final sensitivities from BAL to determine whether Pt
   needs Vanc of Linezolid
   - Per ID, consider CT scan. Will defer for now, but can reconsider once
   pulomonary issues improved
   - Continuing chest PT, pulmonary toilet
   .
   # Tachycardia: ddx includes hypovolemia, secondary to infection (PNA).
   PE is also possibility given known DVT, but diagnosis would not change
   management at this point (patient is on heparin drip).
   - Bolus 1L NS and continue with maintenance fluid @ 150cc/hr,  until PO
   intake improved
   - Check central/ mixed venous venous sat
   - Hold off on beta-blockers
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Patient with continued fevers on floor. Work-up
   so far unrevealing other than persistent RLL/RML opacities. Negative
   blood culture, urine culture and c. diff X thus far. Most likely
   etiology is post-obstructive pneumonia.  WBC doubled since yesterday,
   although pt. has been afebrile.
   - Treat HAP as above, plan for 14-21 day course
   - Follow BAL
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - if clinically worsens plan to add tobra per ID recs
   # DVT: on heparin drip for now. Started on 2.5 mg Coumadin
   - On lovenox : 1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continuing Coumadin 2.5 mg qD
   # Ventral Hernia: Currently no abdominal pain, benign exam with bowel
   sounds. CT scan [**2178-3-27**] demonstrated partial colonic obstruction with
   CT scan [**2178-3-29**] demonstrating overall improvement.
   - Monitor abdominal exam, consider imaging if changes
   # Recent GI Bleed: HCT drop from 32
 27.7. Has gotten several fluid
   boluses and had heme negative stool yesterday.  No melena during this
   admission.
   - Patient high colonoscopy perforation risk due to colonic distension,
   discuss GI long-term plans. Per notes planning to do EGD this admission
   once patient stabilizes.
   - Continue IV pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **]
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac stool
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct checks
   # Chronic Diastolic CHF (EF>55%): Unlikely acute episode due to CXR
   findings and s/p bronch (see above).
   - continue holding Lasix per floor due to limited PO intake, consider
   restarting tomorrow
   - Low Na diet, strict I/O's, fluid restriction 1500cc
   # COPD: moderate to severe.
   - standing nebs prn, including spiriva and xopinex started today
   - Consider transitioning to PRN instead of standing xopinex due to
   persistent tachycardia.
   # Afib: Rate controlled. Off coumadin temporarily per floor team,
   CHADS2 score is 3 and bioprosthetic valve. Echo showed no evidence of
   thrombus.  Pt. continues to be tachy in 110s.
   - restart metoprolol at half dose, dogixin
   - continue diltiazem
   - transitioning from heparin drip to lovenox today
   - Dig level 0.8 today.
   # GERD: Continue pantoprazole.
   # CKD: At baseline.
   - renally dose all meds
   # Triple A: Stable, per vascular surgery will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as
   outpatient.
   # History of ITP: Currently within normal limits. Trend platelets.
   # FEN: Maintenance fluids, encouraging PO intake, electrolytes prn,
   advance diet today and monitor for aspiration

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, and colon cancer status post colectomy. He was admitted for pneumonia and re-admitted for shortness of breath and fevers. He is currently in the MICU for hypoxia following bronchoscopy.
- The patient's respiratory distress is similar to yesterday, with decreased breath sounds on the right compared to the left, expiratory wheezes, and a facial tent for oxygen delivery. His SpO2 is 95%. There is no chest pain suggesting acute coronary syndrome or hypotension suggesting aortic valve dysfunction.
- The patient has been febrile on admission, which could be related to the recent bronchoscopy. However, due to the rising white blood cell count, coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is being provided until the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results are available.
- The patient has a known deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but it is unlikely to be a pulmonary embolism (PE) given the significant findings on the chest X-ray and current anticoagulation.
- The patient's tachycardia may be due to hypovolemia secondary to infection (pneumonia) or PE. A CT scan has been deferred for now, but can be reconsidered once the pulmonary issues improve.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, and colon cancer status post colectomy. He was recently admitted for pneumonia and re-admitted for shortness of breath and fevers. He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia following a bronchoscopy.

The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory distress, fevers, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 97/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a face tent. He has decreased breath sounds on the right side compared to the left and expiratory wheezes.

The patient has a known deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but is unlikely to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) based on significant findings on chest X-ray and current anticoagulation. He is febrile, which could be related to recent bronchoscopy, and his white blood cell count is rising, so coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is being initiated until the results of a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are available. There is no chest pain to suggest acute coronary syndrome or heart failure, and the abdominal examination is benign.
