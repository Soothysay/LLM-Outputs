   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors for 48 hours, now found to have increasing LFTs in a
   cholestatic pattern.
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT pattern, coagulopathy:  RUQ shows sludge with
   possible mass, stone with some element of chronicity.  Cholangitis may
   be the source of E. coli; however, she inconsistently has RUQ
   tenderness on exam.  She has also improved dramatically in the last 5
   days despite no drainage of the biliary system.
   - monitor LFTs, coags
   - consider CT abdomen to further evaluate biliary system
   - ERCP fellow notified, will proceed tonight if patient decompensates,
   otherwise will have procedure tomorrow
   .
   # Gram-negative sepsis:  Source includes UTI v. cholangitis as above.
   Urine and blood cultures grew E. coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent,
   zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and ertapenem.  Currently hemodynamically stable
   off of pressors for 36 hours.
   - start CTX for E. coli
   - broaden back to vanc/zosyn if decompensates
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP of >60, monitor pulmonary status
   carefully with each bolus
   - restart levophed if needed, though currently hemodynamically stable
   - d/c stress dose steroids
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely related the liver dysfunction.  Interestingly,
   her coagulopathy responded to vitamin K.
   - cont. to monitor coags
   .
   # Hypoxia:  Pt in decompensated heart failure at OSH.  Also has history
   of COPD on multiple inhalers at home.  On exam, pt has bibasilar
   crackles.
   - obtain CXR
   .
   # MAT:  EKG here shows ST with PACs.
   - treat underlying infection
   - IVF boluses as needed
   .
   # Volume status:  Pt aggressively fluid resuscitated in the setting of
   sepsis.  Pt is now requiring 3.5 L NC with coarse bibasilar crackles on
   exam.
   - obtain CXR
   - monitor pulmonary status after all IVF boluses as pt is [**Name (NI) 951**]
   .
   # Depressed mental status:  This is likely delirium on dementia.
   Baseline is unclear.  This is likely related to infectious process.  No
   hypercarbia on ABG.
   - treat underlying infectious process
   - hold neurontin for now given mental status
   - monitor mental status, low threshold to perform head CT given recent
   INR of 6.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), schizophrenia, and previously diagnosed with gram-negative sepsis. The patient presented with cholestasis and required vasopressors for 48 hours. 

Medical Complications:
1. Cholestatic liver function test (LFT) pattern: The patient has an abnormal pattern of liver function tests indicating potential liver dysfunction.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulation disorder, which is likely related to liver dysfunction. Vitamin K administration improved her coagulopathy.
3. Gram-negative sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis caused by E. coli. She was treated with appropriate antibiotics, and her condition improved.
4. Hypoxia: The patient has compromised oxygenation due to decompensated heart failure and underlying COPD.
5. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient's EKG shows sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contractions (PACs).
6. Volume status: The patient requires aggressive fluid resuscitation due to sepsis and now exhibits signs of fluid overload with coarse bibasilar crackles on exam.
7. Depressed mental status: The patient is experiencing delirium or dementia, likely related to the infectious process.
8. Acute kidney injury ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), schizophrenia, and recent hospitalization for gram-negative sepsis. The patient presented with cholestatic liver function test (LFT) pattern, coagulopathy, and right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain with sludge or possible mass, which may indicate cholangitis. However, there is no evidence of cholangitis, so the plan is to monitor LFTs and coagulation profile and proceed with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in the morning.

The patient also has gram-negative sepsis, most likely caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is sensitive to various antibiotics. The source of infection could be a urinary tract infection (UTI) or cholangitis. The patient has improved dramatically over the last five days despite no drainage of the biliary system, and there is no evidence of cholangitis at this time.

Other medical issues include hypoxia due to decompensated heart failure and COPD, coagulopathy related to liver dysfunction, depressed mental status likely due to delirium or dementia, acute kidney injury (ARF) with elevated creatinine levels, and demand ischemia with decreasing troponin levels.

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of cholestasis and is admitted to the ICU for an ERCP procedure. The patient has a history of being overweight/obese and has poor dentition. He denies any pain and his review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/51 mmHg to 122/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus tachycardia.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 169 mL of IV fluids and has had a total output of 225 mL. The patient's urine output is 225 mL, NG output is 21 mL, and stool output is not documented. The patient's blood products and respiratory support are also noted.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is not in acute distress and appears to be overweight/obese. His eyes/conjunctiva are pupils equal and round, his head/ears/nose/throat shows poor dentition, and his cardiovascular exam is normal with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His peripheral vascular exam shows bilaterally present pulses in both upper and lower extremities. The patient's respiratory/chest exam reveals"

   E.COli BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Awaiting
   ERCP per service.  Monitor LFTs.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- possible toxic-metabolic or related to
   medications.  Need to confirm baseline mental status with family.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is sepsis. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and schizophrenia. 

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include:

1. E. coli bacteremia: The patient has an infection caused by E. coli, which could be originating from the urinary tract or hepatobiliary system (possibly cholangitis). The current level of care is responding well to the treatment.

2. Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs): The patient has abnormal liver function tests, specifically a cholestatic pattern. An ultrasound shows sludge with a possible mass versus biliary stone, suggesting chronicity. Cholangitis may be the source of E. coli. An abdominal CT and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are being considered to further evaluate and treat this condition.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing changes in mental status, which could be due to toxic-metabolic factors or medication effects. The baseline mental status needs to be confirmed with family.

4. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has mild pulmonary hypertension as determined by cardiac echo.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, likely related to underlying liver dysfunction. Interestingly, the patient's coagulopathy responded to vitamin K"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis, and
   increasing LFTs.
   SEPSIS -- E. coli isolated in blood.  Possible source includes urinary
   vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis).  Responding to currentl level
   of care.  Continue current management.
   E.COli BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Awaiting
   ERCP per service.  Monitor LFTs.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- possible toxic-metabolic or related to
   medications.  Need to confirm baseline mental status with family.
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutritional deficiency.  Monitor coags
   TACHYCARDIA -- MAT by ECG.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and schizophrenia. The patient is currently in the ICU with sepsis, specifically due to E. coli bacteremia. The source of the bacteremia is unclear but could be from either the urinary tract or hepatobiliary system, possibly cholangitis. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal with a cholestatic pattern, and a recent ultrasound showed sludge with a possible mass versus biliary stone.

The patient also has altered mental status, which could be related to toxic-metabolic factors or medications. It is necessary to confirm the baseline mental status with the patient's family. Additionally, the patient has mild pulmonary hypertension, likely due to chronic lung disease, as determined by cardiac echo. There is evidence of coagulopathy, which is likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis, and nutritional deficiency. The patient has tachycardia, which is multifactorial in origin.

In terms of management, the patient requires continued fluid repletion, monitoring of intake and output, and monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP). Nutritional support is planned to be initiated once the ileus resolves, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be considered if the patient remains nil per"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), schizophrenia, and previous respiratory failure who presented with gram-negative sepsis. She required vasopressors for 48 hours and now presents with increasing liver function tests (LFTs) in a cholestatic pattern. The source of infection is suspected to be cholangitis, with Escherichia coli (E. coli) identified in blood cultures. The patient has been aggressively fluid resuscitated, resulting in coarse bibasilar crackles on examination. She also has anuria, likely secondary to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to multiple hypotensive episodes. Other issues include hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, coagulopathy, hypoxia, and volume overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently experiencing hypercapneic respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation while intubated.
2. Sepsis: The patient presented with gram-negative sepsis, which may lead to further organ dysfunction if not appropriately managed.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has anuria and evidence of ischemic ATN, which can progress to chronic kidney disease if not addressed promptly.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors for 48 hours, now found to have increasing LFTs in a
   cholestatic pattern.
   .
   # Gram-negative sepsis:  Most likely source is cholangitis, GNR
s in
   blood stream not yet speciated here.  Urine and blood cultures grew E.
   coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and
   ertapenem.  Currently borderline hypontensive with MAPs around 60.
   White count is increasing today, with more labile bps.  Suspect recent
   decomponsation is secondary to recent instrumentation.
   - broadened her coverage to include meropenem in case of ESBL and vanc
   in case of
   - O/n had been giving IVF boluses to maintain MAP of >60, unfortunately
   this appears to be compromising pulmonary function, would favor
   levophed if maps dropping below 60 again.
   - f/u AM cortisol, consider cortisol stim.
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.
   Attempts to go up on her pressure support failed to resolve her poor
   minute ventilation and she was placed on A/C with excellent result.
   Unfortunately this morning with her hypercapnea resolved she was noted
   to have an A-A gradient of 172 on labs, I suspect
   - though diuresis would likely be impossible anyway in this anuric
   patient, would hold off even if it were in a patient who is actively in
   and out of septic shock
   - support oxygenation with vent for now
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Suspect Normal Saline
   fluid resuscitation vs. Bicarb wastin RTA in early renal faillure.
   Would bolus back with D5 bicarb or LR over NS if necessary.
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure, ?hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Unable to
   obtain urine lytes [**2-3**] anuria.  Had recent creatinine bump at OSH that
   had been trending down.
   - send urine lytes
   - consult renal for possible impending HD
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT pattern:  ERCP revealed a 2cm stone which could not
   be removed, her CBD was stented, no report as to puss or not.
   Cholangitis may be the source of GNRs, Her LFTs continue to improve
   with abx and are down with stent placement.
   - monitor LFTs, coags
   - plan for ERCP this morning, will f/u recs re: additional imaging;
   appreciate input
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH, but would repeat in house to determine for sure.
   - started lactulose
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely related the liver dysfunction.  Interestingly,
   her coagulopathy responded to vitamin K.
   - cont. to monitor coags
   .
   # MAT:  In and out of MAT all day yesterday, currently in NSR at 80.
   - prn Dilt
   - treat underlying infection
   - IVF boluses as needed

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. However, the patient underwent an ERCP procedure where a 2cm stone was found and could not be retrieved. The patient was intubated and taken back to the ICU. The patient appeared uncomfortable on the ventilator with carbon dioxide retention, so pressure support was increased with better tidal volumes.

The patient has an arterial line placed and received several fluid boluses for borderline low blood pressures with moderate effect. Antibiotics were broadened to cover extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) with [**Last Name (un)**] and vancomycin was given to cover the healthcare-associated infection.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was not specified. The patient is on Diltiazem and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant information.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 80-147 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 86/45 to 102/55 mmHg, respiratory rate between 9-35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors for 48 hours, now found to have increasing LFTs in a
   cholestatic pattern.
   .
   # Gram-negative sepsis:  Most likely source is cholangitis, GNR
s in
   blood stream not yet speciated here.  Urine and blood cultures grew E.
   coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and
   ertapenem.  Currently borderline hypontensive with MAPs around 60.
   White count is increasing today, with more labile bps.  Suspect recent
   decomponsation is secondary to recent instrumentation.
   - broadened her coverage to include meropenem in case of ESBL and vanc
   in case of
   - O/n had been giving IVF boluses to maintain MAP of >60, unfortunately
   this appears to be compromising pulmonary function, would favor
   levophed if maps dropping below 60 again.
   - f/u AM cortisol, consider cortisol stim.
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.
   Attempts to go up on her pressure support failed to resolve her poor
   minute ventilation and she was placed on A/C with excellent result.
   Unfortunately this morning with her hypercapnea resolved she was noted
   to have an A-A gradient of 172 on labs, I suspect
   - though diuresis would likely be impossible anyway in this anuric
   patient, would hold off even if it were in a patient who is actively in
   and out of septic shock
   - support oxygenation with vent for now
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Suspect Normal Saline
   fluid resuscitation vs. Bicarb wastin RTA in early renal faillure.
   Would bolus back with D5 bicarb or LR over NS if necessary.
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure, ?hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Unable to
   obtain urine lytes [**2-3**] anuria.  Had recent creatinine bump at OSH that
   had been trending down.
   - send urine lytes
   - consult renal for possible impending HD
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT pattern:  ERCP revealed a 2cm stone which could not
   be removed, her CBD was stented, no report as to puss or not.
   Cholangitis may be the source of GNRs, Her LFTs continue to improve
   with abx and are down with stent placement.
   - monitor LFTs, coags
   - plan for ERCP this morning, will f/u recs re: additional imaging;
   appreciate input
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH, but would repeat in house to determine for sure.
   - started lactulose
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely related the liver dysfunction.  Interestingly,
   her coagulopathy responded to vitamin K.
   - cont. to monitor coags
   .
   # MAT:  In and out of MAT all day yesterday, currently in NSR at 80.
   - prn Dilt
   - treat underlying infection
   - IVF boluses as needed

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, schizophrenia, and previously diagnosed with renal failure. She presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring vasopressors for 48 hours. The source of infection is suspected to be cholangitis, with gram-negative rods in the blood stream not yet specified. Urine and blood cultures grew Escherichia coli sensitive to several antibiotics.

The patient is currently borderline hypotensive with mean arterial pressures around 60. White blood cell count is increasing, indicating ongoing infection or inflammation. The patient's respiratory function has been compromised, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about hepatic dysfunction, as evidenced by low albumin levels, poor coagulation profile, physical findings of telangiectasias and palmar erythema, and mildly elevated ammonia levels.

The patient also has a history of demand ischemia, schizophrenia, diabetes mellitus type 2, gastritis/pud, and COPD. Her code status is full code per family, but there is a DNR/DNI form in the hospital records. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and other supportive care measures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with gram-negative sepsis, and there is a concern for ongoing infection or decompression secondary"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis, and
   increasing LFTs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, predominately related to sepsis and
   altered mental status, on background of COPD.  Radiographic evidence
   for pleural effusions, or perhaps component of atalectasis.  Need to
   consider possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.
   SEPSIS -- E. coli isolated in blood.  Possible source includes urinary
   vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis).  Responding to current level
   of care.  Continue current management.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis (3rd spacing) and hypovolemia.
   Continue net volume expansion. [**Month (only) 51**] require placement of central line,
   to allow repleteion and monitoring of CVP.
   E.COli BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- possible toxic-metabolic or related to
   medications.  Evidence for component of chronic liver diseaes (elevated
   NH3). Plan continue lactulose.  Currrently not requiring sedation
   continuous infusion.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute. Multifactorial, and attributed to hypovolemia,
   sepsis, ATN, perhaps contrast dye (related to ERCP).
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutrition deficincy.  Improved with Vit K.  Monitor PT, PTT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- MAT by ECG.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP if central
   line replaced.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure yesterday afternoon and was found to have a CBD stone. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the MICU.

The patient experienced hypotension overnight, which required IV fluid boluses. Antimicrobials were expanded due to the presence of E. coli bacteremia, possibly from a urinary or hepatobiliary source. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, showing a cholestatic pattern, and a RUQ US revealed sludge with a possible mass versus biliary stone. Cholangitis could be the source of E. coli, and an abdominal CT should be considered. The patient's altered mental status may be related to toxic-metabolic causes or medication effects, and there is evidence of chronic liver disease with elevated NH3 levels. Lactulose should be continued, and the patient does not require continuous sedation.

The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to hypovolemia, sepsis, ATN, and possibly contrast dye related to the ERCP. There is mild pulmonary hypertension determined by cardiac echo, and the patient has coagulopathy likely related to liver dysfunction, sepsis, and nutritional deficiency. The patient's tachycardia is multifactorial in nature.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis, and
   increasing LFTs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, predominately related to sepsis and
   altered mental status, on background of COPD.  Radiographic evidence
   for pleural effusions, or perhaps component of atalectasis.  Need to
   consider possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.
   SEPSIS -- E. coli isolated in blood.  Possible source includes urinary
   vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis).  Responding to current level
   of care.  Continue current management.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis (3rd spacing) and hypovolemia.
   Continue net volume expansion. [**Month (only) 51**] require placement of central line,
   to allow repleteion and monitoring of CVP.
   E.COli BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- possible toxic-metabolic or related to
   medications.  Evidence for component of chronic liver diseaes (elevated
   NH3). Plan continue lactulose.  Currrently not requiring sedation
   continuous infusion.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute. Multifactorial, and attributed to hypovolemia,
   sepsis, ATN, perhaps contrast dye (related to ERCP).
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutrition deficincy.  Improved with Vit K.  Monitor PT, PTT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- MAT by ECG.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP if central
   line replaced.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and schizophrenia. The patient is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with respiratory failure, sepsis, hypotension, E. coli bacteremia, altered mental status, renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, coagulopathy, tachycardia, and fluid overload.

Summary:
- The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications.
- The patient underwent an ERCP procedure yesterday and was returned to the MICU intubated due to respiratory failure.
- The patient experienced hypotension overnight, which required IV fluid boluses.
- The patient's antimicrobials were expanded.
- The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) indicating a possible cholestatic pattern, possibly related to cholangitis.
- The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to hypovolemia, sepsis, acute tubular necrosis, and possible contrast dye exposure during the ERCP.
- The patient has mild pulmonary hypertension as determined by cardiac echo.
- The patient has coagulopathy, likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis, and nutritional deficiency. Vitamin K administration has improved the coagulopathy.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure and oliguria/anuria. Upon admission, he had a fever and altered mental status. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities, including cirrhosis, which is suggested by marked splenomegaly and moderate ascites seen on ultrasound. He also has intra- and extra-hepatic biliary duct dilation with multiple stones, air, and gallbladder wall thickening, possibly secondary to recent ERCP. These findings were confirmed by CT scan.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels. His blood cultures are pending, but preliminary results indicate gram-negative rods. The patient is also positive for MRSA screen.

The patient requires norepinephrine for hypotension despite IV fluids. He is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and meropenem).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 116/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors for 48 hours, now found to have increasing LFTs in a
   cholestatic pattern.
   .
   # Gram-negative sepsis:  Most likely source is cholangitis, GNR
s in
   blood stream not yet speciated here.  Urine and blood cultures grew E.
   coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and
   ertapenem.  Currently borderline hypontensive with MAPs around 60.
   White count is increasing today, with more labile bps.  Suspect recent
   decomponsation is secondary to recent instrumentation.
   - broadened her coverage to include meropenem in case of ESBL and vanc
   in case of
   - O/n had been giving IVF boluses to maintain MAP of >60, unfortunately
   this appears to be compromising pulmonary function, would favor
   levophed if maps dropping below 60 again.
   - f/u AM cortisol, consider cortisol stim.

   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.
   Attempts to go up on her pressure support failed to resolve her poor
   minute ventilation and she was placed on A/C with excellent result.
   Unfortunately this morning with her hypercapnea resolved she was noted
   to have an A-A gradient of 172 on labs, I suspect
   - though diuresis would likely be impossible anyway in this anuric
   patient, would hold off even if it were in a patient who is actively in
   and out of septic shock
   - support oxygenation with vent for now

   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Unable to
   obtain urine lytes [**2-3**] anuria.  Had recent creatinine bump at OSH that
   had been trending down.
   - send urine lytes
   - consult renal for possible impending HD
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT pattern:  ERCP revealed a 2cm stone which could not
   be removed, her CBD was stented, no report as to puss or not.
   Cholangitis may be the source of GNRs, Her LFTs continue to improve
   with abx and are down with stent placement.
   - monitor LFTs, coags
   - plan for ERCP this morning, will f/u recs re: additional imaging;
   appreciate input

   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH, but would repeat in house to determine for sure.
   - started lactulose

   # Coagulopathy:  Likely related the liver dysfunction.  Interestingly,

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), schizophrenia, and multiple comorbidities. She was admitted to the ICU for gram-negative sepsis, requiring vasopressors for 48 hours. She has been intubated and sedated, with altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient has shown increasing liver function tests in a cholestatic pattern, anuria, hyperchloremic non-gap metabolic acidosis, and possible hepatic dysfunction. Imaging revealed intra- and extra-hepatic biliary duct dilation with multiple stones, air, and gallbladder wall thickening, possibly secondary to recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). There is also marked splenomegaly and moderate ascites, suggesting cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with gram-negative sepsis, which required vasopressors for blood pressure support. She is still receiving antibiotics to cover for possible Escherichia coli infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated due to acute respiratory failure, not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She experienced hypoxia and hypercapnia, necessitating a change in ventilator settings.
3. Anuria: The patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), schizophrenia, and previous episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF). She presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring vasopressors for 48 hours. She has increasing liver function tests (LFTs) in a cholestatic pattern and multiple comorbidities.

Medical Complications:
1. Gram-negative sepsis: The patient has a suspected gram-negative bacteremia, with E. coli identified in blood and urine cultures. She is currently on meropenem and vancomycin due to resistance to ciprofloxacin.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure, which necessitated intubation. She is on mechanical ventilation with pressure-controlled ventilation (PRVC) and assist-control (AC) mode.
3. Anuria: The patient has oliguria progressing to anuria, possibly due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotensive episodes.
4. Cholestatic LFT pattern: The patient has a cholestatic LFT pattern, likely secondary to cholangitis. A 2cm stone in the common bile duct (CBD) could not be removed, and she underwent stent placement.

There are multiple potential medical complications that can arise, including hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, acute kidney injury, cholangitis, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient has low albumin levels, poor coagulation profile, and physical stigmata of liver disease such as telangiectasias and palmar erythema. Cirrhosis is a possibility, and lactulose has been started for hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely related to liver dysfunction, but it responded to vitamin K administration. Continuous monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient is oliguric/anuric, and ischemic acute tubular necrosis is suspected due to multiple hypotensive episodes. Urine electrolytes should be sent, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis, and
   increasing LFTs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, predominately related to sepsis and
   altered mental status, on background of COPD.  Radiographic evidence
   for pleural effusions, or perhaps component of atalectasis.  Need to
   consider possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Encephalopathy.  Possible toxic-metabolic or
   related to medications.  Evidence for component of chronic liver
   diseaes (elevated NH3).  No evidence for acute CVA.  Doubt seizures
   with post-ictal state.  Plan continue lactulose.  Currrently not
   requiring sedation continuous infusion.  Avoid sedatives.  If persists
   or worsens, would check head MRI, EEG and consider CSF analysis.
   TACHYCARDIA -- SVT, suspect re-entrant circuit.  Monitor HR.  Continue
   neosinephrine (rather than levophed) for BP support.
   SEPSIS -- Persisent.  E. coli isolated in blood.  Possible source
   includes urinary vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis).  Moderate
   ascites, raises possibility of Responding to current level of care.
   Continue current management.  Need to discuss plans for further
   intervention -- concern about persistent CBD stone.  General Surgery
   consult, need to consider surgical exploration or percutaneous drainage
   (IR).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis (3rd spacing) and hypovolemia.
   Continue net volume expansion. [**Month (only) 51**] require placement of central line,
   to allow repleteion and monitoring of CVP.
   E.COli BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute. Multifactorial, and attributed to hypovolemia,
   sepsis, ATN.  Monitor UO, BUN,creatinine.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete.
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutrition deficincy.  Improved with Vit K.  Monitor PT, PTT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- MAT by ECG.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP if central
   line replaced.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old individual with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and schizophrenia. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which is primarily attributed to sepsis and altered mental status on a background of COPD. There are radiographic evidence for pleural effusions or perhaps component of atelectasis. Aspiration pneumonia needs to be considered, and mechanical ventilation should be continued with monitoring of arterial blood gas (ABG).

The patient also has altered mental status, possibly related to toxic-metabolic factors or medications. There is evidence for chronic liver disease with elevated NH3 levels. Seizures have been ruled out, and if the altered mental status persists or worsens, further investigations such as head MRI, EEG, and CSF analysis may be required.

Additionally, the patient has experienced a tachycardia, suspected to be a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), possibly due to a re-entrant circuit. The patient's blood pressure is being supported with neosinephrine instead of levophed.

Sepsis is still present, with E. coli isolated in the blood. The possible sources of infection include the urinary tract or hepatobiliary system (possible cholangitis). Moderate ascites raises the possibility of responding to current levels of care. General"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis, and
   increasing LFTs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, predominately related to sepsis and
   altered mental status, on background of COPD.  Radiographic evidence
   for pleural effusions, or perhaps component of atalectasis.  Need to
   consider possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Encephalopathy.  Possible toxic-metabolic or
   related to medications.  Evidence for component of chronic liver
   diseaes (elevated NH3).  No evidence for acute CVA.  Doubt seizures
   with post-ictal state.  Plan continue lactulose.  Currrently not
   requiring sedation continuous infusion.  Avoid sedatives.  If persists
   or worsens, would check head MRI, EEG and consider CSF analysis.
   TACHYCARDIA -- SVT, suspect re-entrant circuit.  Monitor HR.  Continue
   neosinephrine (rather than levophed) for BP support.
   SEPSIS -- Persisent.  E. coli isolated in blood.  Possible source
   includes urinary vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis).  Moderate
   ascites, raises possibility of Responding to current level of care.
   Continue current management.  Need to discuss plans for further
   intervention -- concern about persistent CBD stone.  General Surgery
   consult, need to consider surgical exploration or percutaneous
   drainage.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis (3rd spacing) and hypovolemia.
   Continue net volume expansion. [**Month (only) 51**] require placement of central line,
   to allow repleteion and monitoring of CVP.
   E.COli BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute. Multifactorial, and attributed to hypovolemia,
   sepsis, ATN.  Monitor UO, BUN,creatinine.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete.
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutrition deficincy.  Improved with Vit K.  Monitor PT, PTT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- MAT by ECG.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP if central
   line replaced.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), schizophrenia, and several other medical conditions. She presented with gram-negative sepsis and required vasopressors. She has been experiencing increasing liver function tests (LFTs) in a cholestatic pattern with gram-negative rods (GNRs) and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she has been hemodynamically stable despite recurrent bouts of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). She underwent percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) drain placement, which revealed a large impacted stone in the common bile duct (CBD) with a markedly dilated biliary tree. There is evidence of cholangitis, and the stent has migrated into the duodenum or proximal jejunum. The patient also has moderate ascites, a nondilated gallbladder with air and sludge, and no evidence of bowel obstruction or perforation. She has been intubated for respiratory failure, which is not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's mental status is altered, and she has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, elevated troponin, oliguria/anuria/renal failure, and non-anion"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old overweight/obese individual who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is unknown. Over the past 24 hours, the patient underwent several interventions including EKG monitoring, percutaneous drain insertion for perctranshepatic cholangiography, and placement of a percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTC) catheter. The patient also experienced episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that were successfully managed with medication. The patient's condition has been complicated by septic shock, oliguria/anuria/renal failure, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, elevated troponin levels, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's clinical presentation suggests septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe infection, low blood pressure, and impaired organ function.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's oliguria/anuria indicates impaired kidney function, which may progress to renal failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Non-anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's ABG results show a decreased bicarbonate level, indicating metabolic acidosis. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory support indicates respiratory failure, which could be due to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or other underlying lung"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), schizophrenia, and other medical conditions. She presented with gram-negative sepsis and required vasopressors for 48 hours. She now has increasing liver function tests (LFTs) in a cholestatic pattern. The most likely source of the sepsis is cholangitis, with GNRs in the blood stream resistant to ciprofloxacin but sensitive to meropenem. The patient is also experiencing oliguria/anuria/renal failure, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure (not ARDS), tachycardia, elevated troponin, altered mental status (not delirium), and possibly hepatic encephalopathy. She has been intubated for ERCP and developed hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. She also has anuric renal failure, likely due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by multiple hypotensive episodes. Other potential issues include hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, myocardial infarction (MAT), demand ischemia, COPD exacerbation, schizophrenia management, diabetes management, and gastrointestinal issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition suggests ongoing sepsis, which can lead to multiple organ"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis,
   choledocholithiasis (retained CBD stone) and persistently abnormal
   LFTs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, predominately related to sepsis and
   altered mental status, on background of COPD.  Radiographic evidence
   for pleural effusions, or perhaps component of atalectasis.  Need to
   consider possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Encephalopathy.  Possible toxic-metabolic or
   related to medications.  Evidence for component of chronic liver
   diseaes (elevated NH3).  No evidence for acute CVA.  Doubt seizures
   with post-ictal state.  Plan continue lactulose.  Currrently not
   requiring sedation continuous infusion.  Avoid sedatives.  If persists
   or worsens, would check head MRI, EEG and consider CSF analysis.
   TACHYCARDIA -- Underlying MAT, and probable new SVT, suspect re-entrant
   circuit and evidence for atrial flutter.  Monitor HR.  Continue
   neosinephrine (rather than levophed) for BP support.
   SEPSIS -- Persisent.  E. coli and GPC isolated in blood.  Possible
   source includes urinary vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis) and
   line related.  Evidence for biliary obstruction and cholangitis --> due
   to retained CBD stone --> now s/p percutaneous drainage per IR.
   Moderate ascites, raises possibility of SBP.  Continue current
   management.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis (3rd spacing) and hypovolemia.
   Continue net volume expansion. [**Month (only) 51**] require placement of central line,
   to allow repleteion and monitoring of CVP.  Monitor cardiac enzymes.
   E. Coli & GPC BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  And now
   line-related.  Continue antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.  Check
   cardiac echo to assess for veggetations.  Await identification of GPC.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   ABD DISTENTION -- 3rd spacing, intraabdominal sepsis.  Monitor bladder
   pressure (may be contributing to renal failure).
   ACIDOSIS -- persistent.  Multifactorial.  Attributed to sepsis, acute
   renal failure.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute. Oliguric.  Multifactorial, and attributed to
   hypovolemia, sepsis, ATN.  Monitor UO, BUN,creatinine.  [**Month (only) 51**] require
   renal replacement therapy soon, if acceptable to patient.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- repleted iv to normal value.
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutrition deficincy.  Improved with Vit K.  Monitor PT, PTT.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP --> aim for
   > 10 cmH2O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.
   GOALS OF CARE -- repeated requests to meet with family HCP without
   success.  Maintain contact, hope to meet today to update and define
   plans.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, schizophrenia, who is currently suffering from sepsis, choledocholithiasis (retained common bile duct stone), and persistently abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, altered mental status, tachycardia, sepsis, hypotension, bacteremia, abnormal liver function tests, abdominal distention, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, hypophosphatemia, pulmonary hypertension, and coagulopathy.

The patient's treatment plan includes mechanical ventilation, lactulose for encephalopathy, neosinephrine for blood pressure support, antimicrobials for bacteremia, renal replacement therapy, vitamin K for coagulopathy, and close monitoring of various parameters.

The patient's goals of care include meeting with the family healthcare provider to update and define plans, maintaining contact, and hope to meet today to update and define plans."

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure and is intubated and mechanically ventilated. This indicates a severe condition that requires immediate attention.

2. Sepsis: The patient has persistent sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. The presence of E. coli and GPC bacteria in the blood suggests a possible source of infection.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is showing signs of encephalopathy, which may be due to toxic-metabolic causes or related to medications. Chronic liver disease could also contribute to this condition.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has an underlying MAT (Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia) and a probable new SVT (Supraventricular Tachycardia), indicating an abnormal heart rhythm. This needs to be closely monitored.

5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia. It is essential to continue volume expansion and monitor the patient's response.

6. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which is likely multifactorial and related to hypovolemia, sepsis, and acute tubular necrosis. Renal replacement therapy may be required soon.

7. Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs): The patient's LFT"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   Remains intubated, mechanically ventilated.
   Recurrent SVT yesterday, with evidence for a-flutter --> now on
   Amnioderone.
   With overall clinical decline, persistent sepsis, abnormal LFTs (know
   retained stone and dilated intrahepatic ducts) --> surgical evaluation
   recommended percutaneous drainage.
   IR place percutaneous tube, with return of thick material.
   Remains on vasopressors.
   Mental status somewhat improved, now occasionally turning head to
   voice.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis,
   choledocholithiasis (retained CBD stone) and persistently abnormal
   LFTs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, predominately related to sepsis and
   altered mental status, on background of COPD.  Radiographic evidence
   for pleural effusions, or perhaps component of atalectasis.  Need to
   consider possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Encephalopathy.  Possible toxic-metabolic or
   related to medications.  Evidence for component of chronic liver
   diseaes (elevated NH3).  No evidence for acute CVA.  Doubt seizures
   with post-ictal state.  Plan continue lactulose.  Currrently not
   requiring sedation continuous infusion.  Avoid sedatives.  If persists
   or worsens, would check head MRI, EEG and consider CSF analysis.
   TACHYCARDIA -- Underlying MAT, and probable new SVT, suspect re-entrant
   circuit and evidence for atrial flutter.  Monitor HR.  Continue
   neosinephrine (rather than levophed) for BP support.
   SEPSIS -- Persisent.  E. coli and GPC isolated in blood.  Possible
   source includes urinary vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis) and
   line related.  Evidence for biliary obstruction and cholangitis --> due
   to retained CBD stone --> now s/p percutaneous drainage per IR.
   Moderate ascites, raises possibility of SBP.  Continue current
   management.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis (3rd spacing) and hypovolemia.
   Continue net volume expansion. [**Month (only) 51**] require placement of central line,
   to allow repleteion and monitoring of CVP.  Monitor cardiac enzymes.
   E. Coli & GPC BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  And now
   line-related.  Continue antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.  Check
   cardiac echo to assess for veggetations.  Await identification of GPC.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   ABD DISTENTION -- 3rd spacing, intraabdominal sepsis.  Monitor bladder
   pressure (may be contributing to renal failure).
   ACIDOSIS -- persistent.  Multifactorial.  Attributed to sepsis, acute
   renal failure.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute. Oliguric.  Multifactorial, and attributed to
   hypovolemia, sepsis, ATN.  Monitor UO, BUN,creatinine.  [**Month (only) 51**] require
   renal replacement therapy soon, if acceptable to patient.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- repleted iv to normal value.
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutrition deficincy.  Improved with Vit K.  Monitor PT, PTT.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP --> aim for
   > 10 cmH2O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.
   GOALS OF CARE -- repeated requests to meet with family HCP without
   success.  Maintain contact, hope to meet today to update and define
   plans.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), schizophrenia, and now presents with sepsis, choledocholithiasis (retained common bile duct stone), and persistently abnormal liver function tests (LFTs).

The patient's current medical issues include respiratory failure, altered mental status, tachycardia, sepsis, hypotension, bacteremia, abnormal LFTs, abdominal distention, acidosis, renal failure, hypophosphatemia, pulmonary hypertension, coagulopathy, and nutritional support.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is persistent and primarily related to sepsis and altered mental status, on a background of COPD. There is radiographic evidence for pleural effusions or perhaps component of atelectasis. Aspiration pneumonia should also be considered.

2. Altered mental status: The patient has encephalopathy, which is possible toxic-metabolic or related to medications. There is evidence for a component of chronic liver disease (elevated NH3). No evidence for acute cerebral vascular accident (CVA) is present. Seizures with post-ictal state are doubtful. Continuing lactulose is planned. Avoidance of"

   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  At

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and schizophrenia. She presented with gram-negative sepsis and required vasopressors. She has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including septic shock, hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure, hyperchloremic non-gap metabolic acidosis, acute mental status changes, anuria, supraventricular tachycardia, cholestatic liver function pattern, possible hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, myocardial ischemia, COPD exacerbation, schizophrenia, diabetes mellitus type 2, gastritis/pulmonary embolism, and femoral hernia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock due to VRE bacteremia. This condition is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment.
2. Hypoxic and Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is contributing to her hypoxia and hypercapnia. This can lead to further deterioration of her condition and may require mechanical ventilation.
3. Hyperchloremic Non-Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an ongoing metabolic acidosis that needs to be corrected. If left untreated, it can have serious implications on various organ functions.
4. Acute Mental Status Changes (AMS): The patient's AMS could be multifactorial, including"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and schizophrenia. She presented with gram-negative sepsis and required vasopressors. She was found to have increasing liver function tests (LFTs) in a cholestatic pattern with gram-negative bacilli (GNR) and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she is hemodynamically stable but with recurrent bouts of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). She has decompressed biliary tree with thick green output from the drain. The stone has not been retrieved, but drainage seems effective with a drastic drop in LFTs. The patient has also been intubated for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which revealed a 2cm stone that could not be removed, and her common bile duct (CBD) was stented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient has VRE bacteremia that was missed by prior antibiotics and is now covered. The most likely source is cholangitis with GNR in the bloodstream, which is resistant to ciprofloxacin but sensitive to meropenem. There is also evidence of GPCs in pairs in chains from the anaerobic bottle.

  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.
   Overnight post-procedure, increasing tachypnea, ABG showed impaired
   oxygenation, which improved on increased PEEP.  ABG also suggested
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, without full respiratory
   compensation.  Pt at risk to develop ARDS.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), schizophrenia, and multiple comorbidities. The patient presented with gram-negative sepsis and required vasopressors. She was found to have increasing liver function tests (LFTs) in a cholestatic pattern with gram-negative rods (GNR) and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Septic Shock: The patient has a history of sepsis and is now experiencing septic shock due to VRE bacteremia. This is likely from the source of cholangitis, with GNR in the bloodstream. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she is hemodynamically stable but with recurrent bouts of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).

2. Hypoxic and Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient was electively intubated for ERCP and experienced increased abdominal girth. She returned to the floor intubated and somnolent, with air hunger, acidemia, and hypercapnea. ABG showed impaired oxygenation, which improved with increased PEEP. The patient is at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Hyperchloremic, Non-Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis without anion gap, suspected to be due to normal saline fluid resuscitation or bicarbonate wasting renal tubular acidosis in early renal failure. A D5 bicarb bolus was administered.

4. Acute Mental Status Changes (AMS): The patient has likely multifactorial AMS, including toxic metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic failure, hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory failure, and possible hepatic encephalopathy. Other less likely etiologies include nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), post-ictal state, and hospital-acquired bacterial meningitis.

5. Anuria: The patient is anuric, suspecting ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to multiple hypotensive episodes requiring pressors and during ERCP. Muddy brown casts were found on urine sediment.

6. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient experienced SVT, likely atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) or atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). Adenosine was given, followed by amiodarone.

7. Cholestatic Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has a cholestatic pattern of LFTs, which improved with antibiotic treatment and st"

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and sepsis. They have been sedated and intubated, unable to provide a history. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics (vancomycin, linezolid, meropenem), vasopressors (phenylephrine), antiarrhythmic (amiodarone), and others. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 139 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 127/66 to 173/84 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is 98% on endotracheal tube with FiO2 of 40%. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode on the ventilator, set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 15 cmH2O, RR set at 24, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. ABG results show pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 35, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 245. Physical examination reveals crackles in the anterior chest, diminished breath sounds, distended abdomen, and trace edema in both lower extremities.

   pleural
   effusion most likely pneumonia, conceivably pulmonary hemorrhage. Left
   lower
   lobe is persistently consolidated, and accompanying small left pleural
   effusion unchanged. Severe cardiomegaly is stable as is vascular
   congestion
   in the left lung. ET tube ends at the upper margin of the clavicles, no

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  E. coli and now VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is
   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstones. White count cont to be elevated, now slightly trending up
   again after improvement on linezolid.  Having loose stool despite
   holding lactulose. Still requiring neo to maintain pressures, but
   tolerating diuresis with CVVH. Afebrile on CVVH.
   - cont linezolide d3/14
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - send C. dif given loose stool and increased leukocytosis
   - consider Flagyl if decompensates
   - send fungal markers

  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now
   less of a priority.
    - daily SBTs

   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Nearly resolved with d5
   and bicarb, better treatment of infection

   Completed IV amio load. On Neo, avoid Levo given SVT.
   - transition to PO amiodarone given tolerating tube feeds now, start at
   200 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - if able to taper off pressors, consider transitioning to CCB

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and schizophrenia. The patient presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring vasopressors, and is now found to have increasing liver function tests (LFTs) in a cholestatic pattern with gram-negative rod (GNR) and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:
1. Septic Shock: The patient has septic shock caused by E. coli and now VRE bacteremia. The most likely source is cholangitis. A percutaneous drain has been placed, but large gallstones cannot be removed. The white blood cell count continues to be elevated, slightly trending up again after improvement on linezolid. The patient is having loose stools despite holding lactulose. She is still requiring neo to maintain pressures but tolerating diuresis with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient is afebrile on CVVH.
- Continue linezolide.
- Send C. diff given loose stool and increased leukocytosis.
- Consider Flagyl if decompensates.
- Send fungal markers.
- Trend LFTs daily.
- Add on diff.
- Consider ID consult.

   CXR [**1-31**]
   Extensive consolidation in the right lung has increased substantially
   since
   [**1-28**] and [**1-30**], accompanied by increasing moderate right
   pleural
   effusion most likely pneumonia, conceivably pulmonary hemorrhage. Left
   lower
   lobe is persistently consolidated, and accompanying small left pleural
   effusion unchanged. Severe cardiomegaly is stable as is vascular
   congestion
   in the left lung. ET tube ends at the upper margin of the clavicles, no
   less
   than 6.5 cm from the carina, 3 cm above optimal placement. New
   dual-channel
   right supraclavicular central venous line ends in the low SVC alongside
   an
   indwelling left internal jugular line. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly
   is
   unchanged.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.

   # Septic Shock:  E. coli and now VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is
   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstone. White count cont to be elevated, now slightly trending up
   again after improvement on linezolid.  On neo to maintain pressures to
   tolerate CVVH, cont to avoid levo given SVT.

  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now
   less of a priority.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), schizophrenia, and recent hospitalizations for sepsis, cholecystitis, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

The patient presented with gram-negative sepsis and required vasopressors. She now has increasing liver function tests (LFTs) in a cholestatic pattern, with bacteremia caused by Gram-negative rods (GNR) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC). The source of infection is suspected to be cholangitis. A percutaneous drain was placed, but she still has a large gallstone that cannot be removed.

The patient also has hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure, for which she was electively intubated during ERCP. She remained somnolent after the procedure and developed air hunger, with an arterial blood gas revealing acidemia and hypercapnea. She tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) but overall severe sepsis makes extubation less of a priority at this time.

She also has hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis, which is nearly resolved with d5 and bicarb, better treatment of infection. The patient is likely experiencing multifactorial acute mental status changes (AMS) due to toxic metabolic enceph"

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC:  Cholangitis, biliary sepsis status post CBD stent,
   retained stone.  WBC drifting back up, will check a repeat
   differential.  Abdominal exam benign and unchanged.  Still requiring
   low-dose neo.  Repeat blood/urine/bile cultures sent. Continue current
   antibiotics.
 DIARRHEA:  Send stool for C.diff given rising WBC.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Secondary to ATN. No started on CVVH. Plan for
   gradual removal of volume albeit this will be slow given poor
   nutritional status, low albumin.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Reasons for difficutly to
   wean is multi-factorial.  Mostly limited by volume overload and
   possible VAP.  Sputum gram stain and culture sent again given rising
   WBC to see if there is a new organism not covered by broad spectrum
   antibiotics.
 ATIAL FIBRILLATION/FLUTTER:  Plan to change amiodarone drip to per
   NGT now that she is tolerating tube feeds.
 ALTERED NUTRITIONAL STATUS:  Tolerating initiation of tube feeds
   without residuals.  Titrate to goal.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Following simple commands
   (wiggle toes) intermittently.  Remains off sedation, appears
   comfortable.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several ongoing medical complications. The patient's chief complaints include respiratory failure and sepsis. 

The patient has a history of cholangitis and biliary sepsis status post CBD stent, retained stone. They are still requiring low-dose neomycin. There is also an ongoing issue with diarrhea, and a stool culture for C.diff has been sent. The patient is experiencing acute renal failure secondary to ATN and has been started on CVVH. 

The patient is also dealing with respiratory failure, not ARDS, and has difficulty weaning due to volume overload and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). A sputum gram stain and culture have been sent again. Additionally, the patient has atrial fibrillation/flutter and will have their amiodarone drip changed to per NGT now that they are tolerating tube feeds. 

The patient has altered nutritional status and is tolerating initiation of tube feeds without residuals. They also have altered mental status, following simple commands intermittently, and remain off sedation, appearing comfortable.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through tube feeds, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and various prophylactic measures including DVT prevention, stress ulcer prevention, and VAP prevention. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  E. coli and now VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is
   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstones. White count cont to be elevated, now slightly trending up
   again after improvement on linezolid.  Having loose stool despite
   holding lactulose. Still requiring neo to maintain pressures, but
   tolerating diuresis with CVVH. Afebrile on CVVH.
   - cont linezolide d3/14
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - send C. dif given loose stool and increased leukocytosis
   - consider Flagyl if decompensates
   - send fungal markers
   - trend LFTs daily
   - add on diff
   - consider ID consult
   - cholecystectomy when stable
   - appreciate surgery recs
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now
   less of a priority.
    - daily SBTs
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Nearly resolved with d5
   and bicarb, better treatment of infection
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure,  also with
   elevated ammonia concerning for hepatic encephalopathy.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes as noted elsewhere
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Had recent
   creatinine bump at OSH that had been trending down.  Muddy brown casts
   on urine sediment. Started CVVH yesterday, tolerated neg balance with
   Neo.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - UF 50cc negative/hr as tolerated
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #  SVT- likely AVRT/AVNRT in morning, response to vagal maneuver.  H/O
   MAT.  Recurrent episode of AVRT/AVNRT in evening, with subsequent a.
   flutter noted following adenosine.  Evidence of MAT on repeat ECG.
   Completed IV amio load. On Neo, avoid Levo given SVT.
   - transition to PO amiodarone given tolerating tube feeds now, start at
   200 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - if able to taper off pressors, consider transitioning to CCB
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH.  Repeat abdominal u/s shows no evidence of cirrhosis by report.
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to liver dysfunction but coagulopathy
   responded to vitamin K.  Overall dysfunction likely [**2-3**]  septic shock
   and possible low grade DIC.  No active hemorrhage.
   .
   # Demand ischemia:  Trop I had trended down at OSH.  Trop elevated
   again in setting of recent SVTs then trended down.
   .
   # COPD:
   - serial CXR
   - nebulizers prn
   - cont. Advair
   .
   # Schizophrenia:
   - cont home antipsychotics
   - hold neurontin for now given mental status
   .
   #  DM2
   - insulin SS
   .
   #  Gastritis/PUD
   - cont. protonix

She presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring vasopressors, and now has increasing liver function tests in a cholestatic pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia. The most likely source of infection is cholangitis, and a percutaneous drain was placed. She continues to have elevated white blood cell count and is still on linezolid. She also has loose stools despite holding lactulose and is still requiring neo to maintain pressures, but tolerating diuresis with CVVH. She is afebrile on CVVH.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  E. coli and now VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is
   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstones. White count cont to be elevated, now slightly trending up
   again after improvement on linezolid.  Having loose stool despite
   holding lactulose. Still requiring neo to maintain pressures, but
   tolerating diuresis with CVVH. Afebrile on CVVH.
   - cont linezolide d3/14
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - send C. dif given loose stool and increased leukocytosis
   - consider Flagyl if decompensates
   - send fungal markers
   - trend LFTs daily
   - add on diff
   - consider ID consult
   - cholecystectomy when stable
   - appreciate surgery recs
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now
   less of a priority.
    - daily SBTs
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Nearly resolved with d5
   and bicarb, better treatment of infection
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure,  also with
   elevated ammonia concerning for hepatic encephalopathy.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes as noted elsewhere
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Had recent
   creatinine bump at OSH that had been trending down.  Muddy brown casts
   on urine sediment. Started CVVH yesterday, tolerated neg balance with
   Neo.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - UF 50cc negative/hr as tolerated
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #  SVT- likely AVRT/AVNRT in morning, response to vagal maneuver.  H/O
   MAT.  Recurrent episode of AVRT/AVNRT in evening, with subsequent a.
   flutter noted following adenosine.  Evidence of MAT on repeat ECG.
   Completed IV amio load. On Neo, avoid Levo given SVT.
   - transition to PO amiodarone given tolerating tube feeds now, start at
   200 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - if able to taper off pressors, consider transitioning to CCB
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH.  Repeat abdominal u/s shows no evidence of cirrhosis by report.
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to liver dysfunction but coagulopathy
   responded to vitamin K.  Overall dysfunction likely [**2-3**]  septic shock
   and possible low grade DIC.  No active hemorrhage.
   .
   # Demand ischemia:  Trop I had trended down at OSH.  Trop elevated
   again in setting of recent SVTs then trended down.
   .
   # COPD:
   - serial CXR
   - nebulizers prn
   - cont. Advair
   .
   # Schizophrenia:
   - cont home antipsychotics
   - hold neurontin for now given mental status

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), schizophrenia, and presenting with gram-negative sepsis, requiring vasopressors. The patient has multiple medical complications, including septic shock, oliguria/anuria, respiratory failure, tachycardia, altered mental status, hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN), possible cirrhosis, and demand ischemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Septic shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock due to gram-negative bacterial infection. If not appropriately managed, it may lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially death.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has anuria and evidence of ischemic ATN. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not treated promptly and adequately.

3. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and there are signs of hepatic encephalopathy. If left untreated, this can lead to hepatic failure and coma.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure. Improper management may result in persistent respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  E. coli and now VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is
   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstones. White count cont to be elevated, fortunately trending down.
   Having loose stool despite holding lactulose. Still requiring neo to
   maintain pressures, but tolerating diuresis with CVVH. Afebrile on
   CVVH.
   - cont linezolide d3/14
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - send C. dif given loose stool and increased leukocytosis
   - consider Flagyl if decompensates
   - send fungal markers
   - trend LFTs daily
   - cholecystectomy when stable
   - appreciate surgery recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Patient has been
   20L positive since admission due to aggressive rescuscitation for
   sepsis. Currently pt is significantly volume overloaded, and this AM
   CXR shows worsening fluid overload. Fortunately, pt
s respiratory
   status is stable only requiring FiO2 of 50%. Nonetheless, pt would
   likely improve significantly in terms of respiratory status and in
   general after diuresis.
   - Aim for goal negative 200cc/hr via CVVH
   - Wean off neosynephrine as BPs allow but would prioritize diuresis
   over weaning pressors
   - Wean off ventilators to goal PIP/PEEP of [**5-6**] and as pt tolerates
   - Consider extubation tomorrow after SBT
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now
   less of a priority.
    - daily SBTs
   - Wean to 5/5 per above.
   - If pt becomes agitated would favor propofol over fentanyl/midazolam.
   If forced to use midazolam/fentanyl would use in boluses rather than
   drip.
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Nearly resolved with d5
   and bicarb, better treatment of infection
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure,  also with
   elevated ammonia concerning for hepatic encephalopathy. Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes as noted elsewhere
   -Will consider antipsychotics if pt becomes delirious given strong
   psych history
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Had recent
   creatinine bump at OSH that had been trending down.  Muddy brown casts
   on urine sediment. Started CVVH yesterday, tolerated neg balance with
   Neo.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - UF 50cc negative/hr as tolerated
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #  SVT- likely AVRT/AVNRT in morning, response to vagal maneuver.  H/O
   MAT.  Recurrent episode of AVRT/AVNRT in evening, with subsequent a.
   flutter noted following adenosine.  Evidence of MAT on repeat ECG.
   Completed IV amio load. On Neo, avoid Levo given SVT.
   - Continue PO amiodarone given tolerating tube feeds now, start at 200
   mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - if able to taper off pressors, consider transitioning to CCB
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH.  Repeat abdominal u/s shows no evidence of cirrhosis by report.
   Her decompensated cirrhotic picture may have been a sequealae of
   sepsis.
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to liver dysfunction but coagulopathy
   responded to vitamin K.  Overall dysfunction likely [**2-3**]  septic shock
   and possible low grade DIC.  No active hemorrhage.
   .
   # Demand ischemia:  Trop I had trended down at OSH.  Trop elevated
   again in setting of recent SVTs then trended down.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia. She presented with gram-negative sepsis and required vasopressors. She also has increasing liver function tests in a cholestatic pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia. The patient underwent ERCP and developed hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including septic shock, acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, oliguria/anuria, hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, and demand ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with gram-negative sepsis and required vasopressors. She also has ongoing bacteremia, which increases the risk of further septic episodes.
2. Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient has a history of CHF and is now showing signs of worsening heart failure with fluid overload.
3. Oliguria/anuria: The patient is experiencing reduced urine output, which can be due to renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and ammonia levels, suggesting possible liver dysfunction or hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulation disorder indicated by abnormal bleeding and clotting parameters.
6. Demand ischemia: The patient has elevated troponin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia. She presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring vasopressors, and now has increasing liver function tests in a cholestatic pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia. The source of infection is most likely cholangitis, and the patient underwent percutaneous drain placement but still cannot remove large gallstones. She is still requiring neo to maintain pressures but tolerating diuresis with CVVH. The patient is also experiencing oliguria/anuria, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), tachycardia, altered mental status (not delirium), acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, and hyperchloremic non-gap metabolic acidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis/hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has an ongoing infection indicated by the presence of GNR and GPC bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis. The hypoxic respiratory failure is likely due to the patient's underlying COPD and acute respiratory distress.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria/anuria, elevated creatinine levels, and muddy brown casts on urine sediment suggest ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). CVVH has been started, and the patient is tolerating it well.
3. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's low album"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  E. coli and now VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is
   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstones. White count cont to be elevated, fortunately trending down.
   Having loose stool despite holding lactulose. Still requiring neo to
   maintain pressures, but tolerating diuresis with CVVH. Afebrile on
   CVVH.
   - cont linezolide d3/14
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - send C. dif given loose stool and increased leukocytosis
   - consider Flagyl if decompensates
   - send fungal markers
   - trend LFTs daily
   - cholecystectomy when stable
   - appreciate surgery recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now
   less of a priority.
    - daily SBTs
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Nearly resolved with d5
   and bicarb, better treatment of infection
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure,  also with
   elevated ammonia concerning for hepatic encephalopathy.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes as noted elsewhere
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Had recent
   creatinine bump at OSH that had been trending down.  Muddy brown casts
   on urine sediment. Started CVVH yesterday, tolerated neg balance with
   Neo.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - UF 50cc negative/hr as tolerated
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #  SVT- likely AVRT/AVNRT in morning, response to vagal maneuver.  H/O
   MAT.  Recurrent episode of AVRT/AVNRT in evening, with subsequent a.
   flutter noted following adenosine.  Evidence of MAT on repeat ECG.
   Completed IV amio load. On Neo, avoid Levo given SVT.
   - transition to PO amiodarone given tolerating tube feeds now, start at
   200 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - if able to taper off pressors, consider transitioning to CCB
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at

   # Septic Shock:  E. coli and now VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is
   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstones. White count cont to be elevated, fortunately trending down.
   Having loose stool despite holding lactulose. Still requiring neo to
   maintain pressures, but tolerating diuresis with CVVH. Afebrile on
   CVVH.
   - cont linezolide d3/14
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage

  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now
   less of a priority.
    - daily SBTs

   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Nearly resolved with d5
   and bicarb, better treatment of infection

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), schizophrenia, and recent hospitalizations for sepsis and cholecystitis. She presented with biliary sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. The patient has been intubated and sedated, requiring mechanical ventilation. She is currently on vasopressors for septic shock and has multiple comorbidities including liver dysfunction, coagulopathy, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's mental status is altered due to a combination of factors such as sepsis, retained sedatives, hypercapnea, and possible hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation and circulatory collapse. It requires immediate medical attention and management of infection sources.
2. Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a history of CHF and may be experiencing an acute exacerbation of her condition due to sepsis and fluid overload.
3. Hypoxic and Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure with low oxygen levels (hypoxia) and high carbon dioxide levels (hypercapnia). This requires ongoing mechanical ventilation support and optimization of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of dementia and schizophrenia who was admitted with biliary sepsis complicated by septic shock, acute renal failure, and improving on antibiotics. The patient also has a percutaneous drain in place and is draining bilious fluid. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Anemia: The patient has microcytic anemia and was transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The increased protonix to q12 and the check pm hct indicate ongoing management of anemia.

2. Shock, Septic: The patient has biliary sepsis from a retained stone, which is causing ongoing septic shock. She is still on low-dose phenylephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 for volume removal. The patient is on meropenem and linezolid, both of which are antibiotics.

3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient is oliguric and suspected to have ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

4. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient had acute respiratory failure but is now planned to be extubated today. She tolerated a 90-minute spontaneous breathing trial without difficulty.

5. Tachycardia, Other: The patient had"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of cholangitis and the concern of potential sepsis. The patient's medical history is significant for acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypertension, obesity, and chronic heart failure (CHF). The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies.

The patient was intubated and received mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. They were also on pressors throughout the day to maintain blood pressure. The patient's hemoglobin level dropped from 25% to 21%, so they received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Protonix dosage was increased from 40mg IV Q24 to 40mg IV Q12H due to gastrointestinal issues.

The patient underwent an echocardiogram, which showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 60%, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), and largely unremarkable findings. The patient's central venous oxygen saturation (CV O2 sat) is 80%. The patient has not required any sedation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F)
- Heart rate: 70 bpm (range: 65-91 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 103/40 mmHg (range: 57-140/66-89 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute ("

   # Septic Shock:  E. coli and now VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is
   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstones. White count cont to be elevated, fortunately trending down.
   Having loose stool despite holding lactulose. Still requiring neo to
   maintain pressures, but tolerating diuresis with CVVH. Afebrile on
   CVVH.
   - cont linezolide d3/14
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - send C. dif given loose stool and increased leukocytosis
   - consider Flagyl if decompensates
   - send fungal markers
   - trend LFTs daily
   - cholecystectomy when stable
   - appreciate surgery recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Patient has been
   20L positive since admission due to aggressive rescuscitation for
   sepsis. Currently pt is significantly volume overloaded, and this AM
   CXR shows worsening fluid overload. Fortunately, pt
s respiratory
   status is stable only requiring FiO2 of 50%. Nonetheless, pt would
   likely improve significantly in terms of respiratory status and in
   general after diuresis.
   - Aim for goal negative 200cc/hr via CVVH
   - Wean off neosynephrine as BPs allow but would prioritize diuresis
   over weaning pressors
   - Wean off ventilators to goal PIP/PEEP of [**5-6**] and as pt tolerates
   - Consider extubation tomorrow after SBT
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now
   less of a priority.
    - daily SBTs
   - Wean to 5/5 per above.
   - If pt becomes agitated would favor propofol over fentanyl/midazolam.
   If forced to use midazolam/fentanyl would use in boluses rather than
   drip.
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Nearly resolved with d5
   and bicarb, better treatment of infection
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure,  also with
   elevated ammonia concerning for hepatic encephalopathy. Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes as noted elsewhere
   -Will consider antipsychotics if pt becomes delirious given strong
   psych history
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Had recent
   creatinine bump at OSH that had been trending down.  Muddy brown casts
   on urine sediment. Started CVVH yesterday, tolerated neg balance with
   Neo.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - UF 50cc negative/hr as tolerated
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #  SVT- likely AVRT/AVNRT in morning, response to vagal maneuver.  H/O
   MAT.  Recurrent episode of AVRT/AVNRT in evening, with subsequent a.
   flutter noted following adenosine.  Evidence of MAT on repeat ECG.
   Completed IV amio load. On Neo, avoid Levo given SVT.
   - Continue PO amiodarone given tolerating tube feeds now, start at 200
   mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - if able to taper off pressors, consider transitioning to CCB
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH.  Repeat abdominal u/s shows no evidence of cirrhosis by report.
   Her decompensated cirrhotic picture may have been a sequealae of
   sepsis.
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to liver dysfunction but coagulopathy
   responded to vitamin K.  Overall dysfunction likely [**2-3**]  septic shock
   and possible low grade DIC.  No active hemorrhage.
   .
   # Demand ischemia:  Trop I had trended down at OSH.  Trop elevated
   again in setting of recent SVTs then trended down.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of cholangitis and a history of schizophrenia, diabetes mellitus type 2, COPD, and cirrhosis. The patient is currently intubated and in the ICU due to septic shock secondary to E. coli and VRE bacteremia. He also has acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and hepatic dysfunction. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103-140 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem and linezolid. He has undergone percutaneous drain placement for cholangitis and is currently on CVVH for renal support. The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of factors such as toxic metabolic encephalopathy, retained sedatives, hypercapnea, and elevated ammonia levels. His urine output is low, and he has muddy brown casts on urinalysis, suggesting ischemic acute tubular necrosis.

The patient experienced an episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that responded to vagal maneuvers and adenosine. He is currently on amiodarone for rhythm control. His coagulopathy has improved with vitamin K administration, but his liver"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever and dyspnea. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. He received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit to 19%. The patient passed a spontaneous breathing test with a respiratory inhalation resistance index of 68. Propofol weaning was initiated. The patient has no known drug allergies and was administered meropenem and linezolid on the previous day. He is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever and dyspnea. 

Flowsheet Data:
The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), a current temperature of 35°C (95°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/53 mmHg to 136/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently 113 kg and he has a height of 63 inches. Central venous pressure is 10 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 6,900 mL and output of 8,392 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,492 mL. 

Respiratory support indicates that the patient is on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery, standby mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 485 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 36, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 18 cmH2O, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to FiO2 ratio of 172. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pH 7.48, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 24 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) 34 mEq/L, base excess (BE) -2 mEq/L, oxygen saturation (SaO2) 100%, and venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) 86%. 

Physical examination findings are not available for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments due to patient's condition. 

Lab results show hemoglobin (Hgb) of 7.4 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) of 130 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) of 160 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 24 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 138 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 4"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 75F dementia / schizophrenia admitted with
   biliary sepsis c/b septic shock, ARF, has PCT biliary drain, amio for
   SVT. Was off pressors, now with low dose neo restarted to allow CVVH
   volume removal. Transfused 1 unit prbcs. Tolerating well PS/SBT.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.5 BP 120/40  HR 70  RR 20 with sat 100 on PSV
   [**10-6**] 0.5   7.40/43/140.   WD F, awake, alert, following simple
   commands. biliary drain. Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 3+ edema.
   Labs notable for WBC 11.1K, HCT 25, K+ 3.4, na 131 (133) , Cr 1.0.
   Agree with plan to manage E. coli / VRE biliary sepsis c/b MOSF with
   [**Last Name (un) 614**] / linezolid for 14d course.  Hemodynamics improving, thoughs still
   requiring low dose vasopressor to maintain SBP >100, MAP > 55, to
   tolerate volume removal. TTE rather unimpressive.  Continue w/ biliary
   drain to gravity. Surgery and GI following.  D/w GI plan for repeat
   attempt at stone extraction via ercp as pt continues to improve. ARF
   likely ischemic [**2-3**] sepsis, RD meds, f/u c renal team. For volume
   overload / ARF, continue CVVH to remove volume 200-300cc/h as long as
   neo <0.5.  Did well on SBT and is awake and follows simple commands.
   WIll move to extubate.  MS clearing, but not yet to baseline. Reassess
   post extubation. Consider resuming psych meds once able to take POs
   (noting possible interaction btw ssri and linezolid). SVT has responded
   to amio - continue. Appropriate hct bump post transfusion. Continue to
   monitor, on PPI. ICU: Sq hep, full code, HD line and CVL. Can d/c
   a-line post extubation. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of dementia and schizophrenia, admitted for biliary sepsis possibly leading to septic shock and acute renal failure. He has a biliary drain in place and was treated with amiodarone for supraventricular tachycardia. The patient was previously on mechanical ventilation but has now been extubated successfully. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.5°F, blood pressure of 120/40 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with a saturation of 100% on partial support ventilation. His mental status is awake and alert, following simple commands. The patient has a history of edema and anemia. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, potassium, sodium, and creatinine levels. The patient's condition is improving, but he still requires low-dose vasopressors to maintain stable blood pressure and tolerate volume removal through continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The plan includes managing E. coli and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus biliary sepsis with meropenem and linezolid for 14 days. Biliary drainage will continue, and surgery and gastroenterology will be consulted for further management. The patient's acute renal failure is likely ischemic due to sepsis, medication-related, and"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 75F dementia / schizophrenia admitted with
   biliary sepsis c/b septic shock, ARF, has PCT biliary drain, amio for
   SVT. Was off pressors, now with low dose neo restarted to allow CVVH
   volume removal. Transfused 1 unit prbcs. Tolerating well PS/SBT.

   commands. biliary drain. Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 3+ edema.
   Labs notable for WBC 11.1K, HCT 25, K+ 3.4, na 131 (133) , Cr 1.0.
   Agree with plan to manage E. coli / VRE biliary sepsis c/b MOSF with
   [**Last Name (un) 614**] / linezolid for 14d course.  Hemodynamics improving, thoughs still
   requiring low dose vasopressor to maintain SBP >100, MAP > 55, to
   tolerate volume removal. TTE rather unimpressive.  Continue w/ biliary
   drain to gravity. Surgery and GI following.  D/w GI plan for repeat
   attempt at stone extraction via ercp as pt continues to improve. ARF
   likely ischemic [**2-3**] sepsis, RD meds, f/u c renal team. For volume
   overload / ARF, continue CVVH to remove volume 200-300cc/h as long as
   neo <0.5.  Did well on SBT and is awake and follows simple commands.
   WIll move to extubate.  MS clearing, but not yet to baseline. Reassess
   post extubation. Consider resuming psych meds once able to take POs
   (noting possible interaction btw ssri and linezolid). SVT has responded
   to amio - continue. Appropriate hct bump post transfusion. Continue to
   monitor, on PPI. ICU: Sq hep, full code, HD line and CVL. Can d/c

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications and conditions include:

1. Anemia: The patient has been diagnosed with anemia, which is microcytic in nature. This could be related to previous peptic ulcer disease. The patient received a blood transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (pRBCs).

2. Septic Shock: The patient is suspected to have septic shock due to biliary sepsis from a retained stone. The stone could not be removed by ERCP, and the patient is currently on meropenem and linezolid antibiotics.

3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, but it is not ARDS. The plan is to extubate the patient today as they are not sedated and tolerated a 90-minute spontaneous breathing trial without difficulty.

4. Ischemic Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient is suspected to have ischemic ATN, which is supported by oliguria/anuria. The patient is on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) and still remains oliguric.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of dementia and schizophrenia. She was admitted with biliary sepsis and septic shock, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), oliguria/anuria, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient has shown improvement on antibiotics and is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) and amiodarone for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).

The patient's medical history includes biliary sepsis due to a retained stone, which is improving with percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) drain in place. There is ongoing discussion regarding the removal of the stone, with both the gastrointestinal (GI) and surgery teams deferring further intervention for now. The patient will require outpatient follow-up.

The patient also has microcytic anemia, likely secondary to peptic ulcer disease (PUD). She is currently on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and her hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable. Guaiacol stool testing is being performed, along with active treatment for stress ulcers and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Regarding the potential medical complications that can arise, the patient is at risk for septic shock due to her ongoing biliary sepsis. There is also a concern for acute kidney injury (AK"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's current condition shows that she is off pressors, extubated, and started on Abilify. She remains on invasive ventilation but has been weaned off it successfully. The patient's vital signs indicate a slightly elevated heart rate (66 bpm), normal blood pressure (118/48 mmHg), and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 35.2°C. Oxygen saturation is at 100% through a nasal cannula.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for respiratory failure and acute kidney injury. The patient has been receiving multiple IV infusions, including KCl (CRRT), heparin sodium, and antibiotics (Meropenem and Linezolid).

Flowsheet data shows an ongoing fluid balance deficit of -1,491 mL and -2,347 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's total intake is 6,901 mL and 4,693 mL, while the total output is 8,392 mL and 7,040 mL. The patient's urine output is significantly low at 119 mL and 43 mL. Other parameters, such as CVP, weight, and drainages, are within normal limits.

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on standby ventilator mode with an FiO2 of 50% and SpO2 of 100%. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, HCO3- of 113 mEq/L,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a chief complaint of biliary sepsis. She was admitted to the ICU and underwent several interventions including external drain placement, ERCP for stone removal, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), and HD (hemodialysis). The patient also received multiple rounds of antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and other ICU medications.

24-hour events included maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 70s without the need for pressors, negative fluid balance, and stable vital signs. The patient's pain level was reported as mild and located in the abdomen.

Fluid balance showed an overall negative balance of -5,152 mL since yesterday, with input totaling 8,710 mL and output totaling 13,862 mL. The patient's weight has decreased from 96.6 kg at admission to 84.3 kg currently.

Respiratory support included oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, maintaining SpO2 at 99%. ABG results showed a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 33 mmHg, and HCO3- of 80 mEq/L.

Physical examination revealed well-nourished, overweight-obese appearance, clear breath sounds, tender mild diffuse abdomen, and edema in both lower extremities. Neurologic examination showed the patient to be attentive, following commands, responsive to verbal stimuli, with no assessed movement, tone"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of biliary sepsis, likely caused by a retained stone. He has been admitted to the ICU for septic shock, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has improved with antibiotics and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration). He is currently on meropenem and linezolid for infection. The patient has anemia, oliguria/anuria, tachycardia, heart failure, and altered mental status. The plan is to continue with CVVH, possibly followed by HD (hemodialysis), and to continue antibiotics for a total of 14 days. The patient's oliguria/anuria is likely due to ATN (acute tubular necrosis) in the setting of sepsis and poor forward flow. He has been extubated and is doing well, but will continue to monitor respiratory status. His tachycardia, now in normal sinus rhythm, will continue on amiodarone. The patient's heart failure is stable with an EF (ejection fraction) of 60%. His altered mental status has resolved, but he may have had toxic metabolic encephalopathy, retained sedatives, hypercapnea, or hepatic encephalopathy.
