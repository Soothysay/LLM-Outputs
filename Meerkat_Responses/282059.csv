","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of mechanical valve and coumadin use who experienced a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and subsequent generalized seizures. He was treated with keppra and anticoagulation was stopped, leading to a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarct. The patient has had persistent low-grade fevers and mental status changes. His hemoglobin concentration (HCT) dropped, and he received two packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is prolonged, and heparin was held but readjusted per heparin sliding scale. His electrocardiogram (EKG) showed mild QT prolongation, and troponin levels are elevated. The patient has a fever, hypotension, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Falls: The patient's impaired balance and gait due to the stroke increase the risk of falls.
2. Delirium/confusion: The patient's altered mental status may be secondary to the stroke and intermittent fevers.
3. CVA (stroke, cerebral infarction): The patient has had multiple strokes, including a left MCA infarct.
4. Alteration in nutrition: The patient's dysphagia diet may pose challenges in maintaining adequate nutrition.
5. Retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed), spontaneous: The patient's history of"

The patient is a 70-year-old male with no known drug allergies, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been receiving infusions of heparin sodium and metoprolol. Vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 116/56 to 174/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 89 kg, with a height of 70 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 780 mL and output of 200 mL. The patient has received blood products totaling 569 mL. Lab results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC) at 316 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) at 9.0 g/dL, blood glucose at 147 mg/dL, potassium (K+) at 3.7 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) at 135 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) at 104 mEq/L, and magnesium (Mg++) at 2.2 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

- Had a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and experienced generalized seizures, treated with keppra
- Anticoagulation was stopped due to the SAH, leading to a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarct
- The patient has had persistent low-grade fevers and mild MS change, which has slightly worsened
- Overnight, the patient received two packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a drop in hematocrit (HCT) from 23.5 to 25
- Prothrombin time (PTT) was prolonged to 150, and heparin was held and readjusted per heparin sliding scale
- The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) yesterday showed mild QT prolongation with T-wave inversion in the anterolateral distribution, which is new compared to the EKG on [**7-15**]
- EKG today is pending
- Romi showed Troponins at 0.02x3
- Temperature (Tmax) was 100.8, and the patient remained slightly hypertensive to normotensive

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of mechanical aortic valve, coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, and esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy. He was admitted to the MICU for intermittent hypotension, persistent fevers, EKG changes, and concern for retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed). The patient's recent medical history includes a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke.

During the past 24 hours, the patient's temperature has fluctuated between 38.1°C and 37.2°C. His heart rate has been stable between 74 and 106 beats per minute. Blood pressure readings have shown variability ranging from 161/91 mmHg to 108/64 mmHg. Respiratory rate has been within normal limits at 19 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation has remained at 97% on room air.

The patient has been comfortable in bed and eating normally without any acute events overnight. Allergies to medications were not reported. He is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium and metoprolol. Other medications include aspirin, statin, and proton pump inhibitors.

Physical examination revealed general oxygen saturation of 3 on room air, some difficulty finding words, normal neurological examination, clear to auscultate in the head, neck,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of mechanical aortic valve, coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, and esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy. He was admitted to the ICU for intermittent hypotension, persistent fevers, EKG changes, and concern for retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed). 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), blood pressure ranging from 161/91 mmHg to 108/76 mmHg, heart rate between 74 and 106 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His weight is currently 89 kg.

The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium, metoprolol, and other ICU medications. He has a history of allergies to no known drugs. 

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals an absence of peripheral pulses and skin assessment. Neurologic assessment shows impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, as well as impaired balance, gait, motor function, and transfers. He also has hypothermia.

The patient's medical history includes a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-inch tall and 89 kg individual who was previously on neuro service. They have no known drug allergies. The patient is currently receiving continuous heparin sodium infusion at a rate of 1,375 units per hour. They are also on metoprolol medication.

Vital signs show a maximum temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit), current temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius (98.4 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate ranging from 61 to 90 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/65 to 160/97 mmHg, respiratory rate between 13 and 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation level of 96%.

The patient's weight is currently 89 kg, with a decrease of 7 kg since admission. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 793 mL and output of 1,875 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,082 mL. Urine output is recorded at 1,875 mL.

Respiratory support is not required, and the patient is maintaining an oxygen saturation level of 96%. ABG results are not provided in the note.

Physical examination findings include absent peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities, unassessed skin condition, and unassessed neurologic status.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and slightly elevated platelet count."
