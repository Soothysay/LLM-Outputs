The patient is an 88-year-old male with significant past medical history, including atrial fibrillation and hypertension. He presents with chest pain, jaundice, and choledocholithiasis. The patient experienced an episode of bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) this morning but remained asymptomatic and vital signs were stable. There have been no reports of bloody stools.

The patient has a history of a decubitus ulcer present at admission. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/79 mmHg to 153/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications including ampicillin/sulbactam, statins, nitrates, diltiazem, H2 blockers, and prophylactic antibiotics.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and liver enzymes. The patient's potassium and magnesium levels are low, and his blood glucose level is within normal range. An electrocardiogram was performed, which did not show any ischemic changes.

Plan:
1. Monitor hct every 6 hours.
2. Activate transfusion service and perform type and screen.
3. Consult gastroenterology for possible endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP"

The patient underwent an endoscopy and colonoscopy, revealing multiple shallow ulcers in the duodenal bulb with evidence of recent bleeding. The patient's H pylori serology should be checked and treated if positive. A full colonoscopy is warranted due to the presence of red blood in the distal colon. The patient has had several melanotic stools during the preparation for colonoscopy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/66 to 146/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 8,425 mL and a total output of 3,030 mL, resulting in a balance of 5,395 mL. The patient has received various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and ampicillin/sulbactam. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 5.9 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin levels ranging from 26.2-30.9 g/dL, and normal platelet count of 155 K/uL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, history of lower gastrointestinal bleed, cholelithiasis, chest pain, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring due to his unstable condition. 

On admission, the patient had a hemoglobin level of 36g/dL and was hemodynamically stable. He underwent an endoscopy and colonoscopy, which revealed multiple shallow ulcers in the duodenal bulb with evidence of recent bleeding. The patient was started on IV pantoprazole and will be checked for H. pylori serology. A flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed but was unrevealing due to poor preparation, and the patient is now being prepared for a full colonoscopy tomorrow.

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 102/34 mmHg to 146/86 mmHg. His heart rate has been relatively stable between 71-87 beats per minute. Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, maintaining an SpO2 of 96%. The patient's temperature has been within normal range, with no signs of fever. His white blood cell count has been within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show slightly elevated levels of creatinine, liver enzymes, and troponin-T. His potassium level is slightly low, while his sodium and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and was found to have multiple shallow ulcers in the duodenal bulb with evidence of recent bleeding. A flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed a likely lower GI bleed. The patient's hemoglobin levels dropped from 36 to 30 but remains hemodynamically stable. A full colonoscopy is planned.

The patient also has choledocholithiasis with biliary obstruction, as indicated by cholestatic rise in liver function tests (LFTs). An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was initially planned but has been deferred due to the active GI bleed.

Additionally, the patient experienced chest pain, but an electrocardiogram (EKG) did not show ischemic changes. The patient is likely experiencing demand ischemia. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and is being treated with rate control medication. Other medical issues include hyperlipidemia (HL), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and cholelithiasis.

The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring. The patient's vital signs are stable, and there are no significant changes in the flow sheet data. Laboratory results indicate slight variations in white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, and platelet count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued GI bleeding: The patient has experienced significant GI bleeding, and there is a risk of further bleeding"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of cholelithiasis and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). He underwent a colonoscopy which revealed severe diverticulosis but no source of bleeding was identified. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is currently hemodynamically stable. He is suspected to have a diverticular bleed. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, but his total bilirubin is still elevated. He has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib), benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), and a decubitus ulcer. He is currently on hold for an elective rupture of pancreas (ERCP) due to active bleeding. The patient's blood pressure is controlled with medication, but he is tachycardic. He has a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder includes hyperphosphatemia and hypernatremia. He also has a history of a duodenal ulcer and previous upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGI). The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has dropped from 30% to 26% since admission. The patient is actively bleeding and requires transfusion. The plan is to perform a colonoscopy today, and ERCP will be deferred. The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature 35.6Â°C, heart rate 82 bpm, blood pressure 126/74 mmHg, respiratory rate 29 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on nasal cannula, and he is alert and oriented. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Diverticular bleed: The patient has severe diverticulosis and is suspected to have a diverticular bleed. If the bleeding continues, it may lead to further drop in hemoglobin levels and hemodynamic instability.
2. Cholelithiasis with biliary obstruction: The patient has cholelithiasis and is showing signs of biliary obstruction. If left untreated, this may lead to complications such as cholangitis.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of AFib. If not properly managed, it can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
4. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer. If not properly managed, it can worsen and lead to infection or other complications.
5. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has hyperphosphatemia and hypernatremia. If not corrected, these electrolyte imbalances can lead to various complications.
6. Duodenal ulcer: The patient has a history of a duodenal ulcer and previous UGI bleeding. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to further bleeding or perforation."

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of cholelithiasis and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). He underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed severe diverticulosis but no source of bleeding was identified. The patient then underwent an angiogram, where no source of bleeding was found either. He received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is currently stable. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), and hyperphosphatemia. He also has an ulcer on his left great toe. The patient is currently on maintenance fluids with D5 and holding home lasix, imdur, flomax, and dilt. Long-term management may involve reconsidering Coumadin and possibly a tagged scan if bleeding increases. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diverticular Bleeding: The patient's severe diverticulosis puts him at risk for recurrent bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic stability, and ongoing assessment of gastrointestinal bleeding symptoms will be necessary.
2. Anticoagulation Management: The patient's atrial fibrillation requires anticoagulation therapy to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events. However, the recent bleeding episode raises concerns about the balance between anticoagulation and bleeding risk. Reevaluation of the patient's anticoagulation regimen may be warranted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). The patient underwent a colonoscopy at the bedside, which showed severe diverticulosis and blood in the splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. An angiogram was performed, but no source of bleeding was identified. The patient received a transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is currently hemodynamically stable. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and a decubitus ulcer present at admission. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6Â°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 126/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole and ampicillin/sulbactam. The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated potassium, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has an equivocal Helicobacter pylori antibody test.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient's history of LGIB and severe diverticulosis may increase the risk of re-bleeding.
