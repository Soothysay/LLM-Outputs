   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 1715**] is a 57 year old female with a PMH significant for
   schizophrenia admitted on [**2153-11-9**] for laryngeal CA now transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] s/p trach, PEG, and tooth extraction.
   .
   # s/p tracheostomy: Patient underwent trach in anticipation of XRT and
   chemotherapy for laryngeal CA. Has been stable, airway patent,
   breathing spontaneously.
   - f/u ENT recs
   - pain control with acetaminophen and fentanyl patch
   .
   # rhonchi on lung exam: Likely [**2-12**] difficulty clearing secretions with
   trach in place. Ddx includes pneumonia.
   - repeat CXR to evaluate for pneumonia
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
   .
   # s/p PEG: Okay to use PEG.
   - begin tube feeds.
   .
   # hypotension/low urine output: Likely [**2-12**] hypovolemia in setting of
   NPO x days with minimal maintenance fluids. Has been fluid-responsive.
   - IV fluids
   - hold antihypertensive meds
   .
   # Laryngeal CA: Per primary oncologist. Plan will be to begin XRT and
   chemotherapy in 10 days.
   - follow-up with oncology team recs.
   .
   # CAD:
   - will need to verify home meds and restart cardiac meds when stable
   and clinically indicated
   .
   # Schizoaffective disorder. Patient is competent, but legal and psych
   has been involved. Patient consented and signed in presence of sister
   [**Name (NI) 225**] and Mother (next-of-[**Doctor First Name 23**]).

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 1715], a 57-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, was admitted on [2153-11-9] for laryngeal CA. She underwent tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and tooth extraction. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving invasive ventilation due to the tracheostomy. The plan is to observe her in the ICU setting for approximately 48 hours until the tracheostomy site matures. The patient's condition is complicated by laryngeal CA, CAD, and schizoaffective disorder. She is currently sedated with propofol and receiving ABG and CXR to rule out post-op pneumothorax. The patient is competent and has provided consent for treatment in the presence of her sister [Name (NI) 225] and mother [Name (NI) 1715]. The plan is to begin XRT and chemotherapy in 10 days. She will also be restarted on betablocker, ace-I, and ASA when stable. Other plans include TF per nutrition recommendations, repletion as necessary, PPI for mouth care, and PIV access.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 57-year-old individual with a history of schizophrenia, tobacco abuse, and now diagnosed with laryngeal cancer. The patient has undergone tracheostomy, G-tube placement, and tooth extraction. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and tolerating the tracheostomy tube well. The main concerns and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to pharmacological causes or hypovolemia. The plan is to continue with IV fluid bolus and resuscitation.

2. Renal function: The patient has prerenal azotemia, indicating compromised kidney function. The plan is to continue with IV fluid bolus.

3. Tobacco abuse: The patient may require a nicotine patch to manage nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

4. Nutritional support: The patient needs to initiate tube feeding (TF) via G-Tube.

5. Dental extraction: Optimize pain management for the dental procedure.

6. Laryngeal cancer: The patient requires a tracheostomy to bypass upper airway obstruction. Further treatment such as radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy is awaiting.

7. Schizophrenia: Verify medications and resume treatment for schizophrenia.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, tobacco abuse, and now diagnosed with laryngeal cancer. The patient has undergone a tracheostomy, gastrostomy tube placement, and tooth extraction. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is tolerating the tracheostomy tube well. The respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, standby ventilator mode, set Vt (tidal volume) of 400 mL, PS (peak inspiratory pressure) of 5 cmH2O, RR (respiratory rate) set at 12, PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) at 40%, and RSBI (rapid shallow breathing index) of 38.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8Â°C (100.1Â°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/55 to 176/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, poor dentition, intact tracheostomy tube, and no signs of lymphadenopathy or edema. The cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, and the respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds with no wheezing or crackles.

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history significant for schizophrenia, admitted on [**2153-11-9**] for laryngeal cancer. She underwent tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and tooth extraction. The patient has been stable post-procedure with a patent airway and is breathing spontaneously.

On examination, the patient has coarse breath sounds and diffuse rhonchi. Her abdomen is soft with bowel sounds present. There are no significant findings on external examination. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 62 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 123/62 mmHg to 151/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.3 thousand/mL, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, glucose level of 120 mg/dL, sodium of 137 mEq/L, potassium of 3.4 mEq/L, and creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL. The platelet count is 232 thousand/mL.

Assessment and plan:
1. The patient underwent tracheostomy in anticipation of radiation therapy and chemotherapy for laryngeal cancer. The airway is patent, and the patient is breathing spontaneously.
2. Rhonchi on lung examination may indicate difficulty"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.
   She will have speech/ swallow evaluation when ready to transition to
   PMV. She will transfer to the floor since there have been no problems
   with worsening hypotension and oliguria. Oncology staff to decide
   regarding chemotherapy and radiation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, admitted for laryngeal cancer and undergoing tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and tooth extraction. She has been stable with an airway patent, breathing spontaneously, and off all sedation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 123/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's blood glucose level is 120 mg/dL, and her white blood cell count is within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient underwent tracheostomy in anticipation of radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy for laryngeal cancer. The airway is patent, and she is breathing spontaneously.
2. The patient has rhonchi on lung examination, which may indicate difficulty clearing secretions with the tracheostomy in place. Pneumonia is a possible diagnosis, and a repeat chest X-ray is recommended to evaluate for pneumonia. Albuterol and ipratropium nebs should be continued.
3. The patient has undergone PEG and can use the PEG tube. Tube feeds should be initiated.
4. The patient is experiencing hypotension and low urine output, likely due to hypovolemia resulting from being NPO for several days with"
