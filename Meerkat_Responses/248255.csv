   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   75 yo F w hx of Afib HTN, DM2 s/p recent hospitalization for
   osteomyelitis now presenting w/ acute unresponsiveness and apnea as
   well as acute hydrothorax s/p chest compressions.
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status:
   Given that pt. has been having multiple episodes of acute altered
   mental status and nonresponsiveness most likely represents seizures.
   Pt. is on trifluoperazine and amytriptiline which can lower the seizure
   threshold and may have accumulated after recent step down in her renal
   function and worsening of her likely NAFLD.
   - Lactulose
   - Appreciate neurology recs
   -  get continuous EEG
   - Hold psychotropic meds
   .
   #. Osteomyelitis:
   Patient has history of phlegmon in lower spine, being treated with Vanc
   and Flagyl since previous hospitalization, long term course. Ortho
   Spine aware of patient.
   -F/u ESR/CRP
   -F/u spine recs
   - continue vanc/flagyl
   .
   #Hydrothorax: Most likely [**12-25**] small rupture of diaphragm causing
   leakage of ascites into chest cavity. If pt. continues to produce large
   amounts of ascites will need to diurese before chest tube comes out.
   Does not appear to be blood comming from chest tube and Hct stable.
   - Chest tube to suction
   - CXR in am.
   #. Hypotension:
   Pts. hypotension appears to be positional, only occurs when pt. is
   rolled onto her L side, most likely that ascites fluid is accumulating
   in the chest cavity during rolls and shifting her mediastinum/causing
   venous kinkage.
   - chest tube
   .
   #. CHF:  extremely fluid overloaded.
   - continue diuresis when HD stable
   .
   #. Renal failure: At recent baseline
   - trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #. Cirrhosis: Low MELD. Stable, noted on CT.  Could be cause of AMS
   - Lactulose
   - diuresis when stable

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was previously hospitalized for osteomyelitis and is now presenting with acute unresponsiveness and apnea, as well as acute hydrothorax following chest compressions.

Assessment and plan:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of acute altered mental status and nonresponsiveness, which are likely seizures. This may be due to accumulation of trifluoperazine and amitriptyline, which can lower the seizure threshold. The neurology recommendations include administering lactulose, obtaining continuous EEG, and holding psychotropic medications.

2. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a history of phlegmon in the lower spine and is being treated with vancomycin and Flagyl since the previous hospitalization. Long-term treatment is advised, and follow-up with ESR/CRP and spine recommendations is necessary. Continuing vancomycin and Flagyl is also recommended.

3. Hydrothorax: It is likely a small rupture of the diaphragm causing leakage of ascites into the chest cavity. If the patient continues to produce large amounts of ascites, diuresis before chest tube removal may be required. The plan includes placing the chest tube on suction and obtaining a chest X-ray in the morning.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is positional, occurring when rolled"

   - continue chest tube to suction
   2.       Hypotension: Intermittent low-dose pressor requirement without
   clear etiology.  CVP 4, suspect hypovolemia
   -  [**Year (4 digits) **], EKG, cardiac markers to assess cardiac etiology.
   - Albumin given CVP 4
   3.       Neuro:  Suspect intermittent seizure activity
   - discuss with neuro role for dilantin
   - continuous EEG
   4.       Pleural effusion:  transudate
 suspect hepatic hydrothorax
   versus CHF
   - Continue chest tube for time being, will need to diurese when stable.
   5.       Cardiology:
   - new wall motion abnormalities on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] consult cardiology and
   repeat [**First Name3 (LF) **].
   - EKG, markers.
   6.       Cirrhosis:
   - will need to start aldactone/lasix when hemodynamics improved
   - lactulose
   - Liver service to see
   7.       ID:  h/o cdiff; osteo
   - continue vancomycin to complete course outlined by ID
   - continue flagyl in setting of recent cdiff infection

   Assessment and Plan
   75yoF with multiple recent admissions; returns to ICU in setting of
   seizure-like activity and subsequent respiratory failure.
   1.       Respiratory failure:  Intubated in setting of respiratory
   distress possibly post-seizure activity.  Suspect etiology was
   accumulation of pleural effusion
   - Awaken, once off sedation will SBT and plan to extubated if passes.
   - No evidence of PNA
   - continue chest tube to suction
   2.       Hypotension: Intermittent low-dose pressor requirement without
   clear etiology.  CVP 4, suspect hypovolemia
   -  [**Year (4 digits) **], EKG, cardiac markers to assess cardiac etiology.
   - Albumin given CVP 4
   3.       Neuro:  Suspect intermittent seizure activity
   - discuss with neuro role for dilantin
   - continuous EEG
   4.       Pleural effusion:  transudate
 suspect hepatic hydrothorax
   versus CHF
   - Continue chest tube for time being, will need to diurese when stable.
   5.       Cardiology:
   - new wall motion abnormalities on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] consult cardiology and
   repeat [**First Name3 (LF) **].
   - EKG, markers.
   6.       Cirrhosis:
   - will need to start aldactone/lasix when hemodynamics improved
   - lactulose
   - Liver service to see
   7.       ID:  h/o cdiff; osteo
   - continue vancomycin to complete course outlined by ID
   - continue flagyl in setting of recent cdiff infection
   - f/u cultures

   I have seen and examined the patient with the fellow and agree
   substantially with the assessment and plan with the following
   modifications/emphasis:
   Overnight, hct stable, significant chest tube drainage but yellow
   colored, and remains on very small dose of phenylephrine.  Is waking up
   currently and responsive

   Abd: soft NT ND, obese
   Ext: bilateral edema
   Chest tube: no air leak, draining about 100-200/hour
   Assessment:
   1)       Acute Respiratory Failure
   2)       Hypotension
   3)       Mental Status Change
   4)       Cirrhosis
   5)       Pleural Effusion s/p chest tube placement
   Discussion: See note from yesterday for full discussion.  In short, I
   suspect patient had a seizure leading to need for intubation and the
   chest compressions may have caused damage leading to sudden filling of
   left chest with fluid.  Currently improving and is ready for
   extubation.
   Plan:
   1)       Extubation
   2)       Keep CT to suction
   3)       Re-evaluate BP after extubation
   Addendum: Patient extubated and looking fine.  She came off
   vasopressors almost immediately after extubation thus may be related to
   positive pressure/sedation.  We will continue to watch closely and
   further evaluation if recurs.  Currently, all cultures are negative, no
   signs of infection, ECHO without any pericardial fluid and EF improved
   from previous.

   osteomyelitis now presenting w/ acute unresponsiveness and apnea as
   well as acute hydrothorax s/p chest compressions.
   #. Hypotension:
   Patient still with pressor requirement, with increase in neo
   overnight.  Still suspect hypovolumia with over 2L lost from chest tube
   in last 24hrs.  Must additional consider active bleeding as cause, with
   8pt drop in hct.  However, no active source of bleeding immediately
   obvious.  Should consider GI bleed, as well as potential RP or occult
   LE bleed following femoral line placement.  Patients sinus tachycardia
   would also be consistent with hypovolumic losses.  Additional
   considerations are PE, with continued 5L requirement.  Anxiety may also
   be contributing factor.

   I have seen and examined the patient and agree substantially with the

   phenylephrine.  Continues to remain off the ventilator

   Assessment/Plan:
   1) Hypotension:
   - Repeat rectal exam for blood, transfuse 2 Units -> If no GI source
   found and if does not respond properly to transfusion, then will check
   CT scan to rule out retroperitoneal bleed
   - Check adrenal axis
   - Also, will change ceftriaxone to Cefempime and continue vancomycin
   and flagyl which will cover for all possible infectious  causes
   (pneumonia - LLL collapse on CXR, urine [which was positive], and
   already on flagyl for c. dif)
   2) Cirrhosis
   3) Possible Seizures: re-visit possibility of seizure prophylaxis with
   neurology
   4) Pleural effusion
   - continued drainage from the tube - given scenario of acute
   accumulation in the chest and lack of bleeding, I suspect there was a
   diaphragmatic injury during the code yesterday.
   5) Hypoxia - likely combination of pleural effusion plus possible HAP -
   being treated with antibiotics and tube draining effusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was recently hospitalized for osteomyelitis and presented with acute unresponsiveness and apnea. She also had acute hydrothorax after chest compressions. The patient continues to require pressors, suggesting hypotension. There is concern for hypovolemia, active bleeding, pulmonary embolism, or anxiety as contributing factors. Anemia is present but no clear source of bleeding has been identified. The patient successfully extubated yesterday but still has a large oxygen requirement, likely due to compressive atelectasis with hydrothorax. There is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with increased sputum and hypoxia hidden in the effusion. 

The patient has had multiple episodes of acute altered mental status, most likely representing seizures. She is on medications that can lower the seizure threshold, which may have accumulated due to recent renal function deterioration and worsening of likely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 

The patient has a history of phlegmon in the lower spine, being treated with vancomycin and metronidazole since the previous hospitalization. Ortho Spine is aware of the patient's condition. 

There is a concern for hydrothorax, most likely due to a small rupture of the diaphragm causing leakage of ascites into"

   Imaging: TTE:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal half of the
   inferior wall and mid-inferior septum and inferolateral walls. The
   remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). The estimated
   cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
   ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space
   which most likely represents a fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-11-5**], regional
   left ventricular systolic function is now improved. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
   [**2125-11-14**]:
   Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier.
   Lines in tubes remain in place in a standard position. Vascular
   congestion
   has minimally improved. Small bilateral effusions noted on the left
   side are
   unchanged. There is persistent collapse of the left lower lobe. Left
   perihilar opacities are stable. There is no evident pneumothorax

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient was extubated and expressed hunger afterwards.
- An EEG was not performed due to manpower and machine issues, but no further obvious seizure activity was observed.
- The patient's urine analysis showed mild positivity, and they were started on ceftriaxone. Culture results are pending.
- The patient received albumin infusions and is being weaned off phenylephrine. Their saturation and pressure dropped at 3:30 AM, and their pressor requirement increased to 1.5, now at 0.8. They were given a 1L NS bolus.
- The patient's cardiac efficiency improved from 35% to 50% after a TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram).
- The patient has allergies to Demerol and Codeine, both causing nausea/vomiting.
- Antibiotics administered include vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole.
- Infusions include phenylephrine at 0.8 mcg/kg/min and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.
- Other medications given include lorazepam (Ativan).
- The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, stable blood pressure, and normal oxygen saturation.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows central venous pressure within normal range.
- Fluid balance indicates an ongoing positive balance.

   Imaging: TTE:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal half of the
   inferior wall and mid-inferior septum and inferolateral walls. The
   remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). The estimated
   cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
   ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
   mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space
   which most likely represents a fat pad.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-11-5**], regional
   left ventricular systolic function is now improved. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
   [**2125-11-14**]:
   Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier.
   Lines in tubes remain in place in a standard position. Vascular
   congestion
   has minimally improved. Small bilateral effusions noted on the left
   side are
   unchanged. There is persistent collapse of the left lower lobe. Left
   perihilar opacities are stable. There is no evident pneumothorax

   #. Altered Mental Status:
   Given that pt. has been having multiple episodes of acute altered
   mental status and nonresponsiveness most likely represents seizures.
   Pt. is on trifluoperazine and amytriptiline which can lower the seizure
   threshold and may have accumulated after recent step down in her renal
   function and worsening of her likely NAFLD.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was admitted recently for osteomyelitis and is now presenting with acute unresponsiveness and apnea, as well as acute hydrothorax following chest compressions.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of acute altered mental status and nonresponsiveness, which most likely represents seizures. This may be due to the accumulation of psychotropic medications (trifluoperazine and amitriptyline) after recent deterioration in renal function and worsening of her likely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
   - Lactulose should be administered to manage hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Continuous EEG should be obtained to monitor seizure activity.
   - Psychotropic medications should be withheld.

2. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a history of phlegmon in the lower spine, which is being treated with vancomycin and Flagyl since the previous hospitalization. Orthopedic spine recommendations should be followed up, and the current regimen of antibiotics should continue.

3. Hydrothorax: The patient likely has a small rupture of the diaphragm causing leakage of ascites into the chest cavity. If the patient continues to produce large amounts of ascites, diuresis should be initiated before removing the chest tube. The chest"

   75 yo F w hx of Afib HTN, DM2 s/p recent hospitalization for
   osteomyelitis now presenting w/ acute unresponsiveness and apnea as
   well as acute hydrothorax s/p chest compressions.
   #. Hypotension:
   Has now been weened off pressors.  Most likely etiology was from fluid
   loss from chest tube.  Still continues to have brisk output, but may be
   mobilizing peripheral edema now.  2 units of PRBC with appropriate
   response, and oncotic pressure may also have helped.  No source of hct
   drop was identified.
   --will trend [**Hospital1 **] hct.
   -- continue to monitor chest tube output.
   -- recheck albumin, and dose albumin if hypotensive
   #Anemia:  As discussed, no clear source of bleeding.  Guaic negatvie.
   Responded appropriatly to 2units yesterday and has maintained level.
   Should still entertain potential RP bleed, but will hold off on imaging
   if hct remains stable.  Hemolysis labs unremrkable.
   - check [**Hospital1 **] hct.
   # Tachycardia:  Sinus tachycardia.  Less likely due to hypovolumia as
   now off pressors.  Raging between 110-140.  With hypoxia should
   consider PE, and may cta if refmains tachycardic.  No pain or signs of
   infection.  No great response to dig load.  Will consider metoprolol
   12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] today now that off pressors.
   #hypoxia:  successfully extubated [**11-14**], still with large o2
   requirment.  Likely due to compressive atelectasis w/ hydrothorax.
   Could potentially have VAP with increased sputum and hypoxia hidden in
   effusion.
   -switch ctx to cefepine for pseudomonas coverage, but will look to peel
   back if possible today.
   - send off sputum culture.
   #. Altered Mental Status:
   Given that pt. has been having multiple episodes of acute altered
   mental status and nonresponsiveness most likely represents seizures.
   Pt. is on trifluoperazine and amytriptiline which can lower the seizure
   threshold and may have accumulated after recent step down in her renal
   function and worsening of her likely NAFLD.
   - Lactulose
   - Appreciate neurology recs, recommended keppra if we felt strongly or
   can hold off until gets 24hr EEG.

   and Flagyl since previous hospitalization, long term course. Ortho
   Spine aware of patient.
   -F/u ESR/CRP
   -F/u spine recs

   amounts of ascites will need to diurese before chest tube comes out.
   Does not appear to be blood comming from chest tube and Hct stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was admitted to the ICU for acute unresponsiveness, apnea, and acute hydrothorax after experiencing chest compressions. The patient has been weaned off pressors and continues to have brisk output from the chest tube, indicating ongoing fluid loss. No clear source of bleeding has been identified. The patient responded well to 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and maintained her hemoglobin level. 

The patient remains tachycardic with a heart rate between 110-140 beats per minute, which is less likely due to hypovolemia as she is now off pressors. The patient's oxygen requirement is large, and she may have compressive atelectasis with hydrothorax. There is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with increased sputum and hypoxia hidden in the effusion. 

The patient has had multiple episodes of acute altered mental status and nonresponsiveness, most likely representing seizures. She is on trifluoperazine and amitriptyline, which can lower the seizure threshold. The patient's renal function has worsened, and she has a history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo F w hx of Afib HTN, DM2 s/p recent hospitalization for
   osteomyelitis now presenting w/ acute unresponsiveness and apnea as
   well as acute hydrothorax s/p chest compressions.
   #. Hypotension:
   Has now been weened off pressors.  Most likely etiology was from fluid
   loss from chest tube.  Still continues to have brisk output, but may be
   mobilizing peripheral edema now.  2 units of PRBC with appropriate
   response, and oncotic pressure may also have helped.  No source of hct
   drop was identified.
   --will trend [**Hospital1 **] hct.
   -- continue to monitor chest tube output.
   .
   #Anemia:  As discussed, no clear source of bleeding.  Guaic negatvie.
   Responded appropriatly to 2units yesterday and has maintained level.
   Should still entertain potential RP bleed, but will hold off on imaging
   if hct remains stable.  Hemolysis labs unremrkable.
   - check [**Hospital1 **] hct.
   # Tachycardia:  Sinus tachycardia.  Less likely due to hypovolumia as
   now off pressors.  Raging between 110-140.  With hypoxia should
   consider PE, and may cta if refmains tachycardic.  No pain or signs of
   infection.  No great response to dig load.  Will consider metoprolol
   12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] today now that off pressors.
   #hypoxia:  successfully extubated [**11-14**], still with large o2
   requirment.  Likely due to compressive atelectasis w/ hydrothorax.
   Could potentially have VAP with increased sputum and hypoxia hidden in
   effusion.
   -switch ctx to cefepine for pseudomonas coverage, but will look to peel
   back if possible today.
   - send off sputum culture.
   #. Altered Mental Status:
   Given that pt. has been having multiple episodes of acute altered
   mental status and nonresponsiveness most likely represents seizures.
   Pt. is on trifluoperazine and amytriptiline which can lower the seizure
   threshold and may have accumulated after recent step down in her renal
   function and worsening of her likely NAFLD.
   - Lactulose
   - Appreciate neurology recs, recommended keppra if we felt strongly or
   can hold off until gets 24hr EEG.
   -  get continuous EEG
   - Hold psychotropic meds, but start haldol per psych for anxiety.
   #. Osteomyelitis:
   Patient has history of phlegmon in lower spine, being treated with Vanc
   and Flagyl since previous hospitalization, long term course. Ortho
   Spine aware of patient.
   -F/u ESR/CRP
   -F/u spine recs
   - continue vanc/flagyl
   #Hydrothorax: Most likely [**12-25**] small rupture of diaphragm causing
   leakage of ascites into chest cavity. If pt. continues to produce large
   amounts of ascites will need to diurese before chest tube comes out.
   Does not appear to be blood comming from chest tube and Hct stable.
   - Chest tube to suction
   - CXR in am.
   - CT chest to evaluate for degree of diaphragmatic perforation.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   need to get thorasics consult to address intervention if continues to
   have large output with associated hypotension.
   #. CHF:  extremely fluid overloaded.   TTE shows improved cardiac
   function.
   - continue diuresis when HD stable
   #. Renal failure: At recent baseline
   - trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #. Cirrhosis: Low MELD. Stable, noted on CT.  Could be cause of AMS
   - Lactulose
   - diuresis when stable
   - f/u hepatology labs
   - f/u hepatology recs, holding lasix/aldactone in setting of
   hypotension, will f/u w/ liver clinc

   Assessment and Plan
   75yoF with multiple recent admissions; returns to ICU in setting of
   seizure-like activity and subsequent respiratory failure.
   1.       Respiratory failure:  Intubated in setting of respiratory
   distress possibly post-seizure activity.  Suspect etiology was
   accumulation of pleural effusion
   - Awaken, once off sedation will SBT and plan to extubated if passes.
   - No evidence of PNA
   - continue chest tube to suction
   2.       Hypotension: Intermittent low-dose pressor requirement without
   clear etiology.  CVP 4, suspect hypovolemia
   -  [**Month/Year (2) **], EKG, cardiac markers to assess cardiac etiology.
   - Albumin given CVP 4
   3.       Neuro:  Suspect intermittent seizure activity
   - discuss with neuro role for dilantin
   - continuous EEG
   4.       Pleural effusion:  transudate
 suspect hepatic hydrothorax
   versus CHF
   - Continue chest tube for time being, will need to diurese when stable.
   5.       Cardiology:
   - new wall motion abnormalities on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] consult cardiology and
   repeat [**First Name3 (LF) **].
   - EKG, markers.
   6.       Cirrhosis:
   - will need to start aldactone/lasix when hemodynamics improved
   - lactulose
   - Liver service to see
   7.       ID:  h/o cdiff; osteo
   - continue vancomycin to complete course outlined by ID
   - continue flagyl in setting of recent cdiff infection
   - f/u cultures

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis believed to be caused by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), vertebral osteoporosis, and multiple recent admissions. The patient was readmitted to the ICU due to seizure-like activity, respiratory failure, and hypotension.

The patient's current condition includes being intubated due to respiratory distress possibly post-seizure activity, with a suspicion of accumulation of pleural effusion. She is weaning down on oxygen but still has significant chest tube output, likely hepatohydrothorax. The patient is also experiencing intermittent low-dose pressor requirements without clear etiology, now off for 12 hours.

Neurological symptoms suggest intermittent seizure activity, and continuous EEG will be attempted tomorrow. Consideration is being given to keppra for seizure prophylaxis. The patient has a pleural effusion that is believed to be a transudate, suspecting hepatic hydrothorax versus congestive heart failure (CHF). There is concern about macro-perforation of the diaphragm during CPR. The patient's borderline blood pressures prevent diuresis.

The patient also has cirrhosis attributed to NASH. The liver service provided recommendations for diuresis, lactulose, and outpatient follow-up. The patient will need to start spironolactone/lasix when hemodynamics improve.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis believed to be caused by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), vertebral osteoporosis, and multiple recent admissions. She was readmitted to the ICU due to seizure-like activity and subsequent respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient had a transfusion of 2 units of red blood cells, resulting in a post-transfusion hematocrit of 29%. She did not tolerate lying flat, so a CT scan could not be obtained. The patient was off pressors, with continuous chest tube output. She received haloperidol for agitation and slept through the night. The patient's allergies include Demerol (meperidine HCl) and codeine, both causing nausea and vomiting. Her last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. The patient was also on various other medications such as thiamine, ASA, pantoprazole, ISS, simvastatin, lidocaine patch, and ferrous sulfate.

24-hour events included transfusion of 2 units of red blood cells for a hematocrit of 23-24, resulting in a post-transfusion hematocrit of 29%, with negative guaiac test and hemolysis labs sent. The patient did not tolerate lying flat, so unable to get a CT scan. She was off pressors, with continuous chest tube output"

   Assessment and Plan
   75yoF with multiple recent admissions; returns to ICU in setting of
   seizure-like activity and subsequent respiratory failure.
   1.       Respiratory failure:  Intubated in setting of respiratory
   distress possibly post-seizure activity.  Suspect etiology was
   accumulation of pleural effusion
   - Awaken, once off sedation will SBT and plan to extubated if passes.
   - No evidence of PNA
   - continue chest tube to suction
   2.       Hypotension: Intermittent low-dose pressor requirement without
   clear etiology.  CVP 4, suspect hypovolemia
   -  [**Month/Year (2) **], EKG, cardiac markers to assess cardiac etiology.
   - Albumin given CVP 4
   3.       Neuro:  Suspect intermittent seizure activity
   - discuss with neuro role for dilantin
   - continuous EEG
   4.       Pleural effusion:  transudate
 suspect hepatic hydrothorax
   versus CHF
   - Continue chest tube for time being, will need to diurese when stable.
   5.       Cardiology:
   - new wall motion abnormalities on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] consult cardiology and
   repeat [**First Name3 (LF) **].
   - EKG, markers.
   6.       Cirrhosis:
   - will need to start aldactone/lasix when hemodynamics improved
   - lactulose
   - Liver service to see
   7.       ID:  h/o cdiff; osteo
   - continue vancomycin to complete course outlined by ID
   - continue flagyl in setting of recent cdiff infection
   - f/u cultures

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), who has been admitted multiple times recently. The patient is currently in the ICU due to a seizure-like activity and subsequent respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate of 120 bpm), normal blood pressure (121/70 mmHg), and slightly elevated respiratory rate (19 breaths per minute). Oxygen saturation is at 96% with the use of a nasal cannula. 

The patient has been intubated due to respiratory distress, possibly related to a post-seizure activity or accumulation of pleural effusion. There is no evidence of pneumonia, and the chest tube is being continued to suction.

The patient also exhibits intermittent hypotension, requiring low-dose pressor support. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 4, suggesting possible hypovolemia. An EKG and cardiac markers have been ordered to assess for cardiac etiology, and albumin has been given to increase CVP.

Neurologically, the patient is suspected to have intermittent seizure activity, and a discussion has been initiated regarding the use of dilantin. Continuous EEG monitoring is planned.

A pleural effusion, classified as a transudate, is present. The cause is suspected to be either hepatic hydrothorax or congestive heart"

   75 yo F w hx of Afib HTN, DM2 s/p recent hospitalization for
   osteomyelitis now presenting w/ acute unresponsiveness and apnea as
   well as acute hydrothorax s/p chest compressions.
   #. Hypotension:
   Has now been weened off pressors.  Most likely etiology was from fluid
   loss from chest tube.  Still continues to have brisk output, but may be
   mobilizing peripheral edema now.  2 units of PRBC with appropriate
   response, and oncotic pressure may also have helped.  No source of hct
   drop was identified.
   --will trend [**Hospital1 **] hct.
   -- continue to monitor chest tube output.
   -- recheck albumin, and dose albumin if hypotensive
   #Anemia:  As discussed, no clear source of bleeding.  Guaic negatvie.
   Responded appropriatly to 2units yesterday and has maintained level.
   Should still entertain potential RP bleed, but will hold off on imaging
   if hct remains stable.  Hemolysis labs unremrkable.
   - check [**Hospital1 **] hct.
   # Tachycardia:  Sinus tachycardia.  Less likely due to hypovolumia as
   now off pressors.  Raging between 110-140.  With hypoxia should
   consider PE, and may cta if refmains tachycardic.  No pain or signs of
   infection.  No great response to dig load.
   #hypoxia:  successfully extubated [**11-14**], still with moderate o2
   requirment.  Likely due to compressive atelectasis w/ hydrothorax.
   Could potentially have VAP with increased sputum and hypoxia hidden in
   effusion.
   -Con
t cefepime for pseudomonas coverage, but will look to peel back if
   possible today.
   - send off sputum culture.
   #. Altered Mental Status:
   Given that pt. has been having multiple episodes of acute altered
   mental status and nonresponsiveness most likely represents seizures.
   Pt. is on trifluoperazine and amytriptiline which can lower the seizure
   threshold and may have accumulated after recent step down in her renal
   function and worsening of her likely NAFLD.
   - Appreciate neurology recs, recommended keppra if we felt strongly or
   can hold off until gets 24hr EEG.
   -  get continuous EEG
   - Hold psychotropic meds, but start haldol per psych for anxiety.
   #. Osteomyelitis:
   Patient has history of phlegmon in lower spine, being treated with Vanc
   and Flagyl since previous hospitalization, long term course. Ortho
   Spine aware of patient.
   -F/u ESR/CRP
   -F/u spine recs
   - continue vanc/flagyl
   #Hydrothorax: Most likely [**12-25**] small rupture of diaphragm causing
   leakage of ascites into chest cavity. If pt. continues to produce large
   amounts of ascites will need to diurese before chest tube comes out.
   Does not appear to be blood comming from chest tube and Hct stable.
   - Chest tube to suction
   - CXR in am.
   - Appreciate thoracics recs, will plan to water seal and re-eval at 2
   hours
   -Consider diuresis today to minimize CT ouput
   #. CHF:  extremely fluid overloaded.   TTE shows improved cardiac
   function.
   - continue diuresis when HD stable
   #. Renal failure: At recent baseline
   - trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #. Cirrhosis: Low MELD. Stable, noted on CT.  Could be cause of AMS

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was previously hospitalized for osteomyelitis and presented with acute unresponsiveness and apnea. The patient also has a history of phlegmon in the lower spine, being treated with vancomycin and Flagyl since the previous hospitalization.

The patient's current condition includes impaired skin integrity, tachycardia, anxiety, hypotension, anemia, hypoxia, altered mental status, osteomyelitis, hydrothorax, congestive heart failure (CHF), renal failure, cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's tachycardia should be further evaluated for potential PE, especially considering her recent immobilization and risk factors such as advanced age and history of atrial fibrillation.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's increased sputum production and hypoxia hidden in the effusion may indicate VAP. It is important to monitor and treat this condition promptly.

3. Seizures: The patient's multiple episodes of acute altered mental status and nonresponsiveness may represent seizures. Appropriate evaluation, including continuous EEG, should be conducted to confirm the diagnosis and determine the cause.

4. Diaphragmatic injury: The patient"

   75 yo F w hx of Afib HTN, DM2 s/p recent hospitalization for
   osteomyelitis now presenting w/ acute unresponsiveness and apnea as
   well as acute hydrothorax s/p chest compressions.
   #. Hypotension:
   Has now been weened off pressors.  Most likely etiology was from fluid
   loss from chest tube.  Still continues to have brisk output, but may be
   mobilizing peripheral edema now.  2 units of PRBC with appropriate
   response, and oncotic pressure may also have helped.  No source of hct
   drop was identified.
   --will trend [**Hospital1 **] hct.
   -- continue to monitor chest tube output.
   -- recheck albumin, and dose albumin if hypotensive
   #Anemia:  As discussed, no clear source of bleeding.  Guaic negatvie.
   Responded appropriatly to 2units yesterday and has maintained level.
   Should still entertain potential RP bleed, but will hold off on imaging
   if hct remains stable.  Hemolysis labs unremrkable.
   - check [**Hospital1 **] hct.
   # Tachycardia:  Sinus tachycardia.  Less likely due to hypovolumia as
   now off pressors.  Raging between 110-140.  With hypoxia should
   consider PE, and may cta if refmains tachycardic.  No pain or signs of
   infection.  No great response to dig load.
   #hypoxia:  successfully extubated [**11-14**], still with moderate o2
   requirment.  Likely due to compressive atelectasis w/ hydrothorax.
   Could potentially have VAP with increased sputum and hypoxia hidden in
   effusion.
   -d/c cefepime today given negative cx at 48 hours
   - send off sputum culture.
   #. Altered Mental Status:
   Given that pt. has been having multiple episodes of acute altered
   mental status and nonresponsiveness most likely represents seizures.
   Pt. is on trifluoperazine and amytriptiline which can lower the seizure
   threshold and may have accumulated after recent step down in her renal
   function and worsening of her likely NAFLD.
   - Appreciate neurology recs, recommended keppra if we felt strongly or
   can hold off until gets 24hr EEG.
   -  get continuous EEG
   - Hold psychotropic meds, but start haldol per psych for anxiety.
   #. Osteomyelitis:
   Patient has history of phlegmon in lower spine, being treated with Vanc
   and Flagyl since previous hospitalization, long term course. Ortho
   Spine aware of patient.
   -F/u ESR/CRP
   -F/u spine recs
   - continue vanc/flagyl
   #Hydrothorax: Most likely [**12-25**] small rupture of diaphragm causing
   leakage of ascites into chest cavity. If pt. continues to produce large
   amounts of ascites will need to diurese before chest tube comes out.
   Does not appear to be blood comming from chest tube and Hct stable.
   - Chest tube to water seal today
   - CXR in am.
   - Appreciate thoracics recs, will plan to water seal and re-eval in am
   -Consider diuresis today to minimize CT ouput
   -Will resuscitate with albumin if hypotensive
   #. CHF:  extremely fluid overloaded.   TTE shows improved cardiac
   function.
   - Diurese with lasix gtt today
   #. Renal failure: At recent baseline
   - trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #. Cirrhosis: Low MELD. Stable, noted on CT.  Could be cause of AMS

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was recently hospitalized for osteomyelitis and is now presenting with acute unresponsiveness and apnea, as well as acute hydrothorax following chest compressions.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which could be due to prolonged bed rest or immobility.
2. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia, which may be caused by hypoxia, infection, or other underlying factors.
3. Anxiety: The patient is anxious, which may be related to her current medical condition or previous hospitalization.
4. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, likely caused by fluid loss from the chest tube and mobilization of peripheral edema.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but the source of bleeding has not been identified. She responded appropriately to 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) yesterday and has maintained her level.
6. Altered mental status: The patient has had multiple episodes of acute altered mental status and nonresponsiveness, which may represent seizures. She is on medications that can lower the seizure threshold.
7. Hypoxia: The patient still requires moderate oxygen supplementation, likely due to compressive at"

   75yoF with multiple recent admissions; returns to ICU in setting of
   seizure-like activity and subsequent respiratory failure.
   1.       Respiratory failure:  Intubated in setting of respiratory
   distress possibly post-seizure activity.  Suspect etiology was
   accumulation of pleural effusion. Extubated [**11-14**], now weaning down on
   oxygen.  Still with significant CT output, likely [**12-25**]
   hepatohydrothorax.  ?macro trauma to diaphragm during CPR.  Broadened
   ABx for ?VAP 2 days ag0.  Sputum cx negative.  Now hemodynamically
   stable with no fevers and neg cultures x 48 hours.
   - d/c cefepime, continue vanco for osteo
   2.       Hypotension: had intermittent low-dose pressor requirement
   without clear etiology, now off pressors x 2 days.   TTE with improved
   EF from prior.  Albumin still > 3, although trending down s/p SPA.
   - monitor albumin daily and consider transfusing if hypotensive again
   3.       Neuro:  Suspect intermittent seizure activity
   - continuous EEG today
   - consider keppra for SZ prophylaxis based on EEC results
   4.       Pleural effusion:  transudate
 suspect hepatic hydrothorax
   versus CHF.  Almost 4 L of chest tube output.  ?macro-perforation of
   diaphragm during CPR.  Thoracics saw yesterday, recommend diuresis and
   then CT to water seal.
   - start lasix gtt today with goal neg 500 ccs to 1L
   - attempt CT to water seal, then repeat CXR
   5.   Cirrhosis: attributed to NASH.  Liver service saw, recs for
   diuresis, lactulose, and outpt f/up.
   - starting lasix gtt today, plan to add aldactone if BPs tolerate
   6. Tachycardia: ST vs. SVT yesterday, rates up to 140s, partial dig
   load, now rates in the 110s improved BPs.  Cardiac markers flat. ?[**12-25**]
   large volume shifts given high CT output vs. BBL withdrawal.
   - starting to diurese today
   - once tolerating diuresis, will restart BBL slowly
   7. ID:  h/o cdiff; osteo
   - continue vancomycin to complete prior course outlined by ID
   ([**2125-12-16**])
   - continue flagyl in setting of recent cdiff infection (to end 5 days p

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis believed to be caused by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), vertebral osteoporosis, and multiple recent admissions. The patient was readmitted to the ICU due to seizure-like activity, subsequent respiratory failure, and hypotension. 

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from her current condition. These include respiratory failure, hypotension, possible intermittent seizure activity, pleural effusion with suspected hepatohydrothorax or congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, tachycardia, and an infection history of Clostridium difficile (CDiff) and osteoporosis.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's respiratory failure could progress to further respiratory distress or even respiratory arrest if not properly managed. The hypotension could lead to shock if not treated promptly. The possible intermittent seizure activity may indicate ongoing neurological issues and could potentially worsen if not addressed.

The pleural effusion, with suspected hepatohydrothorax or CHF, may continue to accumulate and cause respiratory compromise if not effectively managed. The patient's cirrhosis may progress to liver failure if not managed appropriately. The tachycardia may indicate underlying cardiac issues that need further evaluation.

Lastly, the patient's history of C. difficile infection and osteoporosis should be monitored closely to prevent any exacerbation of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis believed to be due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and vertebral osteoporosis. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing seizure-like activity and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is now weaning down on oxygen. She has significant chest tube output, likely hepatohydrothorax. She also has hypotension, which has required intermittent low-dose pressor support, but is now off pressors. The patient's neurologic status is suspect for intermittent seizure activity, and continuous EEG is planned. There is a large pleural effusion, possibly due to macro-perforation of the diaphragm during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The patient's cirrhosis is attributed to NASH, and the liver service recommends diuresis, lactulose, and outpatient follow-up. The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile infection and osteomyelitis, and is being treated with vancomycin and Flagyl. She has tachycardia, which is being managed with digoxin. The patient's cardiac markers are flat, and there is a possibility of large volume shifts given the high chest tube output versus blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract. The plan is to start diuresis today and restart blood transfusion slowly once tolerating diuresis. The patient's respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of arrest and hepatohydrothorax. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, antipsychotics, and proton pump inhibitors. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/68 to 150/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient's weight is 90.4 kg, and height is 67 inches. Central venous pressure is 11 mmHg, and fluid balance shows a negative balance of 3,172 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula.

Physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, and tone. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and lactate levels. Other lab results are within normal range or slightly elevated. The patient has a history of impaired skin integrity, tachycardia, anxiety, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and abnormal differential may indicate an underlying infection. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis or infection"

   seizure-like activity and subsequent respiratory failure.
   1.       Respiratory failure:  Intubated in setting of respiratory
   distress possibly post-seizure activity.  Suspect etiology was
   accumulation of pleural effusion. Extubated [**11-14**], now weaning down on
   oxygen.  Still with significant CT output, likely [**12-25**]
   hepatohydrothorax.  ?macro trauma to diaphragm during CPR.  Broadened
   ABx for ?VAP yesterday.  Sputum cx negative.
   - Continue vanco + cefepime x 48 hours total, consider d/cing cefepime
   tomorrow if hemodynamically stable
   2.       Hypotension: had intermittent low-dose pressor requirement
   without clear etiology, now off x 12 hours.   TTE with improved EF from
   prior.
   - check albumin today
   3.       Neuro:  Suspect intermittent seizure activity
   - continuous EEG: will attempt tomorrow
   - consider keppra for SZ prophylaxis
   4.       Pleural effusion:  transudate
 suspect hepatic hydrothorax
   versus CHF.  Almost 4 L of chest tube output.  ?macro-perforation of
   diaphragm during CPR.  Still with borderine BPs so unable to diurese.
   - Thoracic surgery consult for ?any operative intervention for
   diaphragm/hepatohydrothorax
   5.   Cirrhosis: attributed to NASH.  Liver service saw, recs for
   diuresis, lactulose, and outpt f/up.
   - will need to start aldactone/lasix when hemodynamics improved
   6. Tachycardia: ST vs. SVT yesterday, rates up to 140s, partial dig
   load, now rates in the 110s with borderline BPs but off pressors.
   Cardiac markers flat.
   - monitor
   7. ID:  h/o cdiff; osteo

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, believed to be caused by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), vertebral osteoporosis, and multiple recent admissions. The patient was readmitted to the ICU due to seizure-like activity, respiratory failure, and hypotension.

The patient has been receiving respiratory support and is currently on a nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 96%. She is being weaned down from mechanical ventilation after experiencing respiratory distress, possibly due to the accumulation of pleural effusion. The patient had a chest tube inserted, which resulted in significant CT output, suggesting hepatohydrothorax.

The patient also experienced intermittent hypotension without a clear etiology, requiring intermittent low-dose pressor support. However, the patient is now off pressors for the past 12 hours. An echocardiogram showed improved ejection fraction compared to prior evaluations.

The patient is suspected to have intermittent seizure activity and will undergo continuous EEG monitoring starting tomorrow. Consideration is being given to administering keppra for seizure prophylaxis.

The patient has a pleural effusion classified as a transudate, which may be attributed to hepatic hydrothorax or congestive heart failure. Almost 4 liters of chest tube output have been recorded. The patient is still borderline hypotensive, making it difficult to diurese. A thoracic surgery consult has been requested"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis believed to be caused by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), vertebral osteoporosis, and multiple recent admissions. She was readmitted to the ICU due to seizure-like activity, respiratory failure, and hypotension. 

During her stay in the ICU, the patient received thoracic surgery consultation for high CT output, recommendations for diuresis and chest tube placement, and a dose of Haldol to manage agitation. She also received antibiotics for an infection, specifically ceftriaxone, vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.5°C, heart rate 114 bpm, blood pressure 126/68 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%. She is on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, along with increased levels of creatinine, glucose, and troponin T. Her liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are within normal range. Urine microscopy reveals the presence of yeast, while sputum microscopy is negative for growth.

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis believed to be caused by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), vertebral osteoporosis, and multiple recent admissions. She was readmitted to the ICU due to seizure-like activity, subsequent respiratory failure, and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/68 to 150/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. Her weight has decreased from 92.5 kg at admission to 90.4 kg currently.

The patient has received several doses of antibiotics including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. She is also on other medications such as haloperidol (Haldol), pantoprazole (Protonix), and unspecified ICU medications.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, slightly elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests including elevated alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis believed to be caused by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), vertebral osteoporosis, and multiple recent admissions. She was readmitted to the ICU due to seizure-like activity, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has allergies to Demerol, Codeine, and antibiotics including Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, and Cefepime. She has been receiving various medications in the ICU, including Haloperidol, Pantoprazole, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), current temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 114 bpm with a range of 109-126 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/49-150/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with a range of 17-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for seizure-like activity. 

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,540 mL, including 469 mL of total in and 700 mL of IV fluids. The output includes 4,712 mL of total out, with 2,085 mL of blood products. The patient's urine output is 612 mL, and there is a negative fluid balance of -3,172 mL. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen delivery and has a SpO2 of 96%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are available but not mentioned in the note. 

Physical examination findings are incomplete, with assessments not performed on peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, tone, and movement. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, platelet count of 153 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 26 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, sodium of 140 mEq/L, potassium of 3.9 mEq/L, chloride of 106 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 32.1 %, glucose of 123 mg/dL, and calcium of 8.0 mg/dL. Other lab values are also provided, including liver enzymes, coagulation profile, and electrolyte levels. 

The patient's assessment includes impaired skin integrity, tachycardia, anxiety, and hypotension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. Upon admission, the patient was placed on supplemental oxygen and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected pneumonia. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/36 to 132/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the left lung fields, with crackles heard on auscultation. The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and elevated troponin T level. The patient was started on lasix to promote diuresis and improve fluid balance. A CT scan was performed and interpreted as showing no focal consolidations or effusions. The patient's condition has been stable overnight, with good urine output and stable blood pressure. The patient's EEG was started to monitor for any changes in mental status. Allergies to Demerol and codeine were documented. The patient is currently receiving furosemide (lasix) at a rate of 8 mg/hour, pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo F w hx of Afib HTN, DM2 s/p recent hospitalization for
   osteomyelitis now presenting w/ acute unresponsiveness and apnea as
   well as acute hydrothorax s/p chest compressions.
   #. Hypotension:
   Has now been weened off pressors.  Most likely etiology was from fluid
   loss from chest tube.  Still continues to have brisk output, but may be
   mobilizing peripheral edema now.  2 units of PRBC with appropriate
   response, and oncotic pressure may also have helped.  No source of hct
   drop was identified.
   --will trend [**Hospital1 **] hct.
   -- continue to monitor chest tube output.
   -- recheck albumin, and dose albumin if hypotensive
   #Anemia:  As discussed, no clear source of bleeding.  Guaic negatvie.
   Responded appropriatly to 2units yesterday and has maintained level.
   Should still entertain potential RP bleed, but will hold off on imaging
   if hct remains stable.  Hemolysis labs unremrkable.
   - check [**Hospital1 **] hct.
   # Tachycardia:  Sinus tachycardia.  Less likely due to hypovolumia as
   now off pressors.  Raging between 110-140.  With hypoxia should
   consider PE, and may cta if refmains tachycardic.  No pain or signs of
   infection.  No great response to dig load.
   #hypoxia:  successfully extubated [**11-14**], still with moderate o2
   requirment.  Likely due to compressive atelectasis w/ hydrothorax.
   Could potentially have VAP with increased sputum and hypoxia hidden in
   effusion.
   -d/c cefepime today given negative cx at 48 hours
   - send off sputum culture.
   #. Altered Mental Status:
   Given that pt. has been having multiple episodes of acute altered
   mental status and nonresponsiveness most likely represents seizures.
   Pt. is on trifluoperazine and amytriptiline which can lower the seizure
   threshold and may have accumulated after recent step down in her renal
   function and worsening of her likely NAFLD.
   - Appreciate neurology recs, recommended keppra if we felt strongly or
   can hold off until gets 24hr EEG.
   -  get continuous EEG
   - Hold psychotropic meds, but start haldol per psych for anxiety.
   #. Osteomyelitis:
   Patient has history of phlegmon in lower spine, being treated with Vanc
   and Flagyl since previous hospitalization, long term course. Ortho
   Spine aware of patient.
   -F/u ESR/CRP
   -F/u spine recs
   - continue vanc/flagyl
   #Hydrothorax: Most likely [**12-25**] small rupture of diaphragm causing
   leakage of ascites into chest cavity. If pt. continues to produce large
   amounts of ascites will need to diurese before chest tube comes out.
   Does not appear to be blood comming from chest tube and Hct stable.
   - Chest tube to water seal today
   - CXR in am.
   - Appreciate thoracics recs, will plan to water seal and re-eval in am
   -Consider diuresis today to minimize CT ouput
   -Will resuscitate with albumin if hypotensive
   #. CHF:  extremely fluid overloaded.   TTE shows improved cardiac
   function.
   - Diurese with lasix gtt today
   #. Renal failure: At recent baseline
   - trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #. Cirrhosis: Low MELD. Stable, noted on CT.  Could be cause of AMS
   - diuresis today

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was recently hospitalized for osteomyelitis and presented with acute unresponsiveness and apnea. She also has acute hydrothorax following chest compressions. The patient has been weaned off pressors and continues to have brisk output from the chest tube. She has received 2 units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate response and is being monitored for peripheral edema. Her hematocrit levels are stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient may experience recurrent hypotension due to ongoing fluid loss from the chest tube. Close monitoring of the chest tube output and ongoing assessment of her hemodynamic status is necessary. Administering additional fluids or blood products as needed may be required.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia has responded appropriately to the transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells. However, potential causes of bleeding should still be considered, and further investigation may be necessary if her hemoglobin levels continue to drop.
3. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia, which could be related to hypoxia or other underlying conditions. It is important to monitor her heart rate and consider potential causes such as pulmonary embolism or infection.
4. Hypoxia: The patient is still requiring moderate oxygen supplementation, likely due to"

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis, possible recent seizures, and acute respiratory failure. She was intubated and had a chest tube (CT) placed. The patient was extubated several days ago but remains with high CT output. She is currently tolerating waterseal and on a lasix drip. The plan is to transfer her to the floor once a bed is available. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Volume overload: The patient has edema in both lower extremities and fluid balance showing a negative balance, indicating ongoing fluid losses. Continuous monitoring and administration of lasix may help manage this condition.
2. Infection: The patient has been on antibiotics for suspected Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and osteomyelitis. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial.
3. Respiratory issues: Although the patient was extubated, there may still be concerns about her respiratory function, especially with crackles in the mid lung fields and bronchial breath sounds at the bases. Continued monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory support if needed is important.
4. Seizure risk: The patient's history of possible recent seizures should be taken into consideration. Close monitoring for any seizure activity or changes in mental status is essential.
5. Bleeding risk: The patient's prolonged PTT and low platelet count"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, and osteomyelitis. He presented to the hospital with symptoms of nausea and vomiting, and was found to have an elevated white blood cell count and fever. The patient's condition worsened, and he developed septic shock, requiring intensive care unit admission. 

Upon admission to the ICU, the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation. He underwent several procedures, including chest tube placement and central line insertion. 

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 117 beats per minute, blood pressure of 103/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. His temperature is within normal range. 

The patient has a positive fluid balance, indicating possible volume overload. He has edema in both lower extremities. 

Laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL and a low albumin level of 3.2 g/dL, indicating possible renal dysfunction and malnutrition. Other laboratory values are within normal limits.

The patient's chest X-ray shows improvement in ejection fraction, but there are no significant changes in his abdominal or neurological exams. 

The patient's current medications include lasix for volume overload, vancomycin for osteomyelitis, Flagyl for possible Clostridium difficile infection,"
