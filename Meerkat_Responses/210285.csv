","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a chief complaint of left hip pain and a history of left hip revision. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to hyperkalemia. The patient's 24-hour events include resolution of hyperkalemia, stable packed cell volume (HCT), and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) that was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE) but showed significant motion artifact. The patient's allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, and other medications are noted. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Flowsheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings. Laboratory results show elevated potassium levels, low hemoglobin, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals patchy nodular opacities in the right upper and middle lobes, which may be consistent with an infectious etiology such as pneumonia or aspiration. The main pulmonary artery measures up to 3.2 cm in diameter, indicating possible pulmonary artery hypertension. The assessment and plan include pain control, treatment of hyperkalemia, and ICU care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary complications: The presence of patchy nodular opacities in the right upper and middle lobes suggests a possible infectious etiology, such as pneumonia or aspiration. This could lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if"

   pulmonary artery. The subsegmental arteries cannot be evaluated due to
   motion artifact.
   2. Patchy nodular opacities in the right upper lobe and right middle
   lobe,
   most compatible with infectious etiology such as pneumonia or
   aspiration. Clinical correlation is recommended. Non-specific minimally
   prominent mediastinal and gastrohepatic lymph nodes.
   3. Main pulmonary artery measures up to 3.2 cm in diameter which may
   represent a component of pulmonary artery hypertension.

 Resovled. etiology unclear as patient with normal
   potassium immediately post-op (4.7) but then up to 7.0.  Could be
   secondary to RBC lysis from cell [**Doctor Last Name 971**], decreased renal function from
   dehydration, LR, or some combination of the above.  Peripheral blood
   samples were not lysed and K+ remained elevated on repeat checks, but
   trended downward. ABG to confirm that patient is not acidotic and

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of anxiety, HTN, COPD, and thrombocytopenia who underwent left hip replacement revision surgery. He presented with left hip pain and was transferred to the ICU due to hyperkalemia. His vital signs show tachycardia, and he has been experiencing fever and leukocytosis. Imaging results indicate patchy nodular opacities in the right upper and middle lobes, which may be indicative of pneumonia or aspiration. The patient's lab results reveal elevated potassium levels, decreased hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia or aspiration: The presence of patchy nodular opacities in the right upper and middle lobes suggests a possible infectious etiology such as pneumonia or aspiration. This requires further investigation and appropriate treatment.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient initially presented with hyperkalemia, which has since resolved. However, the etiology is unclear, and it could be secondary to RBC lysis, decreased renal function, or a combination of both. Monitoring of potassium levels and renal function is necessary.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated above his pre-operative baseline, possibly due to pain or pulmonary embolism (PE). A poor-quality CT angiography (CTA) did not definitively rule out PE, so further investigation is"

   One portable view. Comparison with [**2103-1-25**]. The lungs remain clear. The
   heart and mediastinal structures are unremarkable. The bony thorax is
   grossly
   intact. There is no significant change.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 53 year old male with a history of anxiety, HTN, COPD, and
   thrombocytopenia s/p left hip replacement revision now found
   unresponsive on the floor with concern for an aspiration event. Now
   much improved without evidence of aspiration.
   # Unresponsiveness
   Patient found unresponsive with brown secretions. His ABG was
   consistent with an acute respiratory acidosis. Likely [**1-9**] apnea
   insetting of post-op pain medications, probable OSA.
   -- improved
   -- respiratroy and mental status at baseline
   -- would consider outpatient sleep study
   # Respiratory distress
   Initial concern for SBO and aspiration.  Likely was secondary to apneic
   event. Has been afebrile (low grade) and CXR unchanged. No e/o illeus
   on KUB.
   -- NGT if e/o obstruction/ileus
   -- aspiration precautions
   # low grade fevers, bibasilar crackles
   With distended abdomen (at baseline) and pain, likely atelectasis
   -- IS 10x/hr

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of anxiety, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and thrombocytopenia who underwent a left hip replacement revision. The patient was found unresponsive on the floor with concern for aspiration, but has since improved without evidence of aspiration.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 102/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula with FiO2 of 35%. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, overweight/obese, normal heart sounds, crackles at the lung bases, scattered wheezes, right lower extremity edema of 1+, left lower extremity edema of 3+, and no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic assessment is not complete due to the patient's unresponsiveness.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. Electrolyte imbalances and abnormal kidney function may indicate renal failure or other kidney-related issues.

Radiology findings show clear lungs without any active disease, and an unremarkable bowel gas pattern.

The patient's assessment and plan include unrespons"

","Summary:
The patient is a postoperative hip replacement patient who presented with decreased responsiveness, apnea, and suspected undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient tolerated BiPAP for a few hours but did not require it overnight. The patient has been passing flatus and has a history of fatigue, anemia, and obesity. Vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate between 89-122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 76-145 mmHg, respiratory rate between 9-19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is currently on various ICU medications, including pain management and sedation. 

The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, decreased breath sounds at the bases, distended abdomen, trace edema in both lower extremities, inability to stand, warm skin, and altered mental status. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, elevated troponin-T, and other abnormalities in electrolytes and kidney function tests. Imaging reveals an unremarkable gas pattern in the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, inconsistent with small bowel obstruction.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Airway management issues, including inability to protect airway due to altered mental status and risk for aspiration. The patient has a history of pain medication use and sedation, which may exacerbate O"
