   range 68-130 in our system but Dr.[**Name (NI) 12068**] note from pulm clinic notes
   her O2 sat to be 96% on RA in [**Month (only) **]. Oxygenation improved on NRB.
   Negative d dimer makes PE unlikely. Recurrent aspiration seems like a
   likely possible trigger. Most likely a pneumonitis; pneumonia possible
   given WBC count but difficult to interpret in setting of steroids.
   - Continue Bipap 10/5 for now
   - On levofloxacin and azithromycin (for anti-inflammatory effect) for
   planned 5 day course
   - Add vancomycin for potential resistant organism given that
   respiratory status is not improving.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been maintained on CPAP/high flow nebs in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 106/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and has been started on various medications including levofloxacin, azithromycin, vancomycin, and solumedrol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is currently at 94%, indicating some degree of respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of respiratory support may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Pneumonia: The elevated WBC count suggests the possibility of an infection, such as pneumonia. The use of antibiotics like levofloxacin and azithromycin indicates that the healthcare team is considering this complication.
3. Aspiration: Recurrent aspiration seems to be a likely trigger for the patient's respiratory issues. Close monitoring for signs of aspiration and consideration of measures to prevent it are important.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis. Regular assessment for signs and symptoms of DVT"

   her O2 sat to be 96% on RA in [**Month (only) **]. Oxygenation improved on NRB.
   Negative d dimer makes PE unlikely. Recurrent aspiration seems like a
   likely possible trigger. Most likely a pneumonitis; pneumonia possible
   given WBC count but difficult to interpret in setting of steroids.
   - Continue high flow mask
   - Continue levoflox for CAP and vanco for HAP
   - Will hold off on checking vanco trough given normal renal function,
   but will continue to trend creatinine and reassess as course

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia who was admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. The patient's oxygenation has improved with high-flow nasal cannula but remains on it. The negative d-dimer makes pulmonary embolism unlikely, suggesting that recurrent aspiration could be a trigger for her symptoms. Pneumonitis or pneumonia is possible given the elevated WBC count. The patient has a past medical history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, and femoral hernia repair. She is currently receiving IV steroids, levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia, and vancomycin for healthcare-associated pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 94/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's ABG results are pending. Her laboratory values show slightly elevated creatinine levels but otherwise normal results. The patient's DNR status is noted, but she is okay to be intubated if necessary. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and hypoxia, along with an elevated WBC count, suggest the possibility of pneumonia. Monitoring for worsening respiratory symptoms and maintaining appropriate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonias. She was admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. The patient's oxygen saturation improved on high-flow nasal cannula but not with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). The negative d-dimer makes pulmonary embolism unlikely. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting possible pneumonia. She is currently on high-flow oxygen, levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia, vancomycin for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and solumedrol for immunosuppression. Her heart rhythm is currently sinus, and she has a history of dementia and feeding difficulties. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status but is okay to intubate. Her sister, who is a healthcare proxy, has been informed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and the need for high-flow oxygen indicate a potential risk for respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The elevated white blood cell count and the use of antibiotics suggest a possible infection, such as pneumonia.
3. Aspiration: The patient's history of recurrent aspiration pneumonias and feeding difficulties raise concerns about aspiration events during her hospital stay.
4. Dementia: The patient's history of dementia may complicate her ability to communicate her symptoms or follow medical instructions.
5. Immunosuppression: The use of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. She has been weaned off oxygen but experienced desaturation briefly and was placed on bipap 10/5, which did not help significantly. The patient was then placed on a high-flow mask with supplemental oxygen, which improved her condition. She is currently on high-flow nasal cannula with FiO2 of 95% and is not intubated. The patient's baseline oxygen saturation is unclear, with a range of 68-130 in our system, but her oxygen saturation was previously noted to be 96% on room air by Dr. [**Name (NI) 12068**] from pulmonary clinic notes in [**Month (only) **]. Negative d-dimer makes pulmonary embolism unlikely. Recurrent aspiration seems like a likely trigger for her current condition, which is most likely a pneumonitis; pneumonia is also possible given the white blood cell count but difficult to interpret in the setting of steroids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of recurrent aspiration and the presence of fever, cough, and hypoxia, pneumonia is a potential medical complication.

   81yo F with h/o recurrent aspiration PNAs admitted with fever, cough,
   hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear patient's baseline PO2 with
   range 68-130 in our system but Dr.[**Name (NI) 12068**] note from pulm clinic notes
   her O2 sat to be 96% on RA in [**Month (only) **]. Oxygenation improved on NRB.
   Negative d dimer makes PE unlikely. Recurrent aspiration seems like a
   likely possible trigger. Most likely a pneumonitis; pneumonia possible
   given WBC count but difficult to interpret in setting of steroids.
   - Continue Bipap 10/5 for now
   - On levofloxacin and azithromycin (for anti-inflammatory effect) for
   planned 5 day course
   - Add vancomycin for potential resistant organism given that
   respiratory status is not improving.
   - Continue Solumedrol 125 mg IV q6H
   - Nebs
   - Recheck ABG
   - Sputum cx NGTD
   - f/u blood cxs  NGTD
   - complete ROMI , ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. She is currently on BiPAP support and has shown improvement in oxygenation. Negative d-dimer makes pulmonary embolism unlikely, and recurrent aspiration seems like a possible trigger for her condition. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, and there is a possibility of pneumonia. She is being treated with levofloxacin, azithromycin, and vancomycin. Her vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 94/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated potassium, and normal liver function tests. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.43, pCO2 of 39, pO2 of 65, HCO3 of 27, and base excess of 1. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, dementia, and is currently not intubated. Her code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) but okay to intubate. The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement and she will stay in the ICU.

   - Will hold off on checking vanco trough given normal renal function,
   but will continue to trend creatinine and reassess as course

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to recurrent aspiration. Her oxygenation has improved on high flow mask. Other conditions include lone atrial fibrillation currently in sinus rhythm, dementia, and fecal incontinence. She is receiving multiple medications including levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia, vancomycin for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and solumedrol for possible pneumonitis. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) order but is okay to be intubated. Her sister, who is also her healthcare proxy, can be reached at [contact information].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's recurrent aspiration puts her at risk for pneumonia. She is already receiving treatment with levofloxacin and vancomycin.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is receiving respiratory support, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures should be taken to prevent this, such as proper hand hygiene, oral care, and regular assessment of the endotracheal tube.
3. Aspiration events: The patient's history of recurrent aspiration increases the risk of further aspiration events while in the ICU. Close monitoring and measures to prevent aspiration, such as a soft diet and holding off on speech and swallow evaluation, should be implemented.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia who was admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. The patient's baseline oxygen saturation is unclear, but it has improved on non-rebreather mask. A negative d-dimer makes pulmonary embolism unlikely, and recurrent aspiration seems to be a likely trigger. Oxygenation has improved, and the patient is currently on high flow nasal cannula. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, suggesting possible infection or inflammation. Other lab results show normal levels for hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and calcium. The patient's platelet count is within normal range. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is being treated for hypoxic respiratory failure, possibly secondary to recurrent aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia. The plan includes continuing high flow mask, levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia, and vancomycin for healthcare-associated pneumonia. Steroids are being continued as well. The patient is also being monitored for lone atrial fibrillation, dementia, and feeding difficulties. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis and peripheral lines. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status but is okay to intubate, and her code status is DNR as well. The patient's sister, who is also the healthcare power of attorney, has been contacted."

   81yo F with h/o recurrent aspiration PNAs admitted with fever, cough,
   hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear patient's baseline PO2 with
   range 68-130 in our system but Dr.[**Name (NI) 12068**] note from pulm clinic notes
   her O2 sat to be 96% on RA in [**Month (only) **]. Oxygenation improved on NRB.
   Negative d dimer makes PE unlikely. Recurrent aspiration seems like a
   likely possible trigger. Most likely a pneumonitis; pneumonia possible
   given WBC count but difficult to interpret in setting of steroids.
   - Continue high flow mask
   - Continue levoflox for CAP and vanco for HAP
   - Will hold off on checking vanco trough given normal renal function,
   but will continue to trend creatinine and reassess as course
   progresses.
   - Continue Solumedrol 125 mg IV q6H. Today is day 2 of 3 before taper.
   - Continue Nebs
   # Lone Afib: Currently in sinus.
   - continue asa
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Dementia: continue home meds
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, possible aspiration risk
   - Tolerates soft diet, continue with this

   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonias admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. The patient has been on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen support and has shown improvement in oxygenation. The negative d-dimer rules out pulmonary embolism (PE) as a likely cause. Recurrent aspiration seems to be a possible trigger for her current condition, which is most likely a pneumonitis or pneumonia.

The patient has several medical conditions, including hypoxic respiratory failure, lone atrial fibrillation currently in sinus rhythm, dementia, fecal incontinence (FEN), and a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status but not do not intubate (DNI). The patient's baseline oxygen saturation range is unclear, but it is mentioned that her oxygen saturation was 96% on room air according to a note from the pulmonary clinic.

The patient is being treated with levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and vancomycin for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). The steroid Solumedrol is being continued at a dose of 125 mg IV every 6 hours. Nebulizations are also being continued.

The patient's laboratory values indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 5.8 to 14.1 thousand cells/mm3, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and normal platelet counts."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia who was admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. She is currently in the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, but has shown slow improvement. She did not require NIPPV overnight. The patient has altered mental status, orthodeoxia, and a potential shunt physiology. She has been on nebs, steroids, vanc/levo, and continues to receive these treatments. A TTE has been done and the results are pending. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's primary issue is hypoxic respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration of oxygen levels in the blood and potentially result in organ damage or failure if not properly managed.
2. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia increases the risk of further infections and complications, such as lung abscesses or sepsis.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could indicate a neurological complication or be a result of the underlying condition. Monitoring for any changes in mental status and assessing potential causes, such as infections or hypoxia, is crucial.
4. Orthodeoxia: The patient's presence of orthodeoxia suggests a potential shunt physiology, which can cause poor oxygenation and ventilation"

   Negative d dimer makes PE unlikely. Recurrent aspiration seems like a
   likely possible trigger. Most likely a pneumonitis; pneumonia possible
   given WBC count but difficult to interpret in setting of steroids.
   Hypoxia may be secondary to pulmonary hypertension cardiogenic sources
   (shunt) given echo findings.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia admissions. She was admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. Upon evaluation, she had an oxygen saturation of 90% on high flow nasal cannula, and a trans-thoracic echo showed moderate pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid regurgitation, and atrial septal defect with a left-to-right shunt at rest. Her respiratory support included high flow nasal cannula, and she received antibiotics for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/74 to 154/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. She weighed 52.2 kg and was 67 inches tall. Her fluid balance showed an intake of 984 mL, output of 875 mL, and a negative balance of -109 mL.

Her laboratory results indicated leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.1, elevated creatinine levels, and normal troponin T levels. Other lab values were within normal ranges, including hemoglobin, platelet count, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests.

The patient's physical examination revealed clear lungs, distant heart sounds, and no edema. Neurological assessment showed she was alert and oriented.

Plan and Assessment:
The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure was likely due to recurrent aspiration, which may have triggered a pneumonitis or pneumonia. Negative d-dimer ruled out pulmonary embolism as a cause. The trans-thoracic echo findings suggested cardiogenic sources of hypoxia, possibly related to pulmonary hypertension and an atrial septal defect.

The patient's chest X-ray showed no evidence of pneumothorax. She continued on high flow nasal cannula, and her antibiotic regimen was adjusted to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was also started on prednisone taper, nebulizer treatments, and a fiber supplement to improve nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation remains low despite being on high flow nasal cannula. Further interventions may be necessary to improve oxygenation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's elevated WBC count suggests an ongoing infection, and she is at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been added to her treatment regimen.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The trans-thoracic echo revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension. Monitoring and treatment will be required to manage this condition.
4. Aspiration risk: The patient's history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia indicates an ongoing risk for aspiration. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation and dietary modifications have been implemented to reduce this risk.
5. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance is slightly negative, indicating a need for careful monitoring and management to prevent dehydration or fluid overload.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's BUN:creatinine ratio is increasing, suggesting a possible electrolyte imbalance. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to maintain electrolyte balance.
7. PEG discussion: The patient's poor oral intake and preserved EF make her a candidate for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement to ensure adequate nutrition."

   her O2 sat to be 96% on RA in [**Month (only) **]. Oxygenation improved on NRB.
   Negative d dimer makes PE unlikely. Recurrent aspiration seems like a

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonias, admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to recurrent aspiration leading to pneumonitis or pneumonia. The patient also has moderate pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid regurgitation, and an atrial septal defect with left-to-right shunt at rest. She is currently receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen, levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia, vancomycin for healthcare-associated pneumonia, and a steroid taper. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slightly low oxygen saturation of 90%. Her blood work shows mild leukocytosis, normal hemoglobin, platelet count, and renal function. The patient is expected to continue with the current treatment plan and further investigations will be done as needed. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's baseline oxygen saturation is unclear, and she may experience further deterioration in oxygenation due to recurrent aspiration or development of new lung infections.
2. Pulmonary hypertension exacerbation: The patient already has moderate pulmonary hypertension, which can worsen with further respiratory distress or infection.
3. Cardiogenic sources of hypoxia: The patient has an atrial septal defect with left-to-right shunt, which could contribute to hypoxia if the shunt flow increases.
4. Aspiration pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia, admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. She has a small atrial septal defect (ASD) and pulmonary hypertension. The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure and is not improving with current interventions. There is a concern for pneumonia, and further evaluation is needed. The patient has altered mental status, but it is not delirium. She has altered nutrition and a history of other pneumonias. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shunt: The patient continues to be profoundly hypoxemic, and a bubble study will be pursued to evaluate for a shunt.
2. Pneumonia: There is a concern for pneumonia, and confirmation is pending with radiology. If a pneumonia is confirmed, the patient may require a chest tube placement.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient will empirically start heparin gtt after possible pntx tube placement, despite a negative d-dimer on admission.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to being critically ill and receiving respiratory support.
5. Malnutrition: The patient has alteration in nutrition, which may lead to further complications if not addressed properly.
6. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which can worsen with the presence of hypoxia and pneumonia.

s film. TTE showed moderate pulmonary hypertension (PASP + RA
   pressure 50-60mmHg), 2+ TR, and ASD with L to R shunt at rest. - will
   order bubble study to evaluate for reversal of shunt flow with
   activity. Hypoxia may be secondary to pulmonary hypertension
   cardiogenic sources (shunt) given echo findings.  Bubble study showed
   ASD, not significant to explain hypoxia. Also may consider pulmonary
   hypertension, although degree of pulmonary hypertension noted on echo
   (PASP + RA = 50-60mmHg) may not be significant enough to explain
   significant hypoxemia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonias who was admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. The patient's oxygen saturation levels remain in the range of 88-92%. A bubble study showed an atrial septal defect (ASD), but not enough shunt to explain hypoxia. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/78 mmHg to 154/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and temperature of 36.7 C. The patient's weight has increased from 50.6 kg at admission to 52.2 kg currently.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1578 mL and output of 830 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 748 mL. The patient is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy and has an ABG result of 7.43/39/49/25/1 with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 61.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a WBC count ranging from 5.8 to 14.1 thousand cells/mcL, hemoglobin levels between 15.6 and 46.4 g/dL, and platelet count between 290 and 302 thousand cells/mcL. The patient's creatinine level is 0."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonias admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing worsening hypoxic respiratory failure despite receiving high-flow oxygen. The negative d-dimer makes pulmonary embolism unlikely, but recurrent aspiration seems like a possible trigger. There is also a concern for pneumonia, but it is difficult to interpret in the setting of steroids. The chest X-ray is concerning for a possible pneumothorax on the right, but this has been reviewed by radiology and they do not feel there is a pneumothorax on today's film.

The echocardiogram showed moderate pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure + right atrial pressure 50-60mmHg), 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and atrial septal defect with left-to-right shunt at rest. A bubble study was ordered to evaluate for reversal of shunt flow with activity. Hypoxia may be secondary to pulmonary hypertension cardiogenic sources (shunt) given the echo findings. The bubble study showed ASD, but not significant enough to explain hypoxia. Other possible causes of hypoxia may include pulmonary hypertension, although the degree noted on echo may not be significant enough to explain significant hypoxemia.

The patient's current plan includes continuing high-flow mask oxygen, discussing the possibility of intubation with the family, and considering empiric treatment"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonias admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing worsening hypoxic respiratory failure, maintaining oxygen saturation levels between 88-92%. Oxygenation improved with the use of a non-rebreather mask (NRB). 

The assessment suggests that recurrent aspiration seems to be a likely trigger, possibly causing pneumonitis or pneumonia. However, the diagnosis of pneumonia is difficult to interpret due to the patient's steroid use. The chest X-ray initially showed concerns for a possible pneumothorax (PTX) on the right side, but radiology reviewed the film again and did not find evidence of PTX. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure + right atrial pressure = 50-60mmHg), 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and an atrial septal defect (ASD) with a left-to-right shunt at rest. 

A bubble study was performed to evaluate for the reversal of shunt flow with activity. The study confirmed the presence of an ASD but did not show significant shunting to explain the patient's hypoxia. The hypoxia may be secondary to pulmonary hypertension or cardiogenic sources (shunt) given the echo findings.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia admitted to the ICU with fever, cough, and hypoxia. She is currently hypoxic with oxygen saturation levels ranging from 88-92%. The bubble study showed an atrial septal defect (ASD) but not enough shunt to explain the hypoxia. The patient has moderate pulmonary hypertension, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and an ASD with left-to-right shunt at rest. She is on high-flow oxygen via a mask and being considered for intubation. She is receiving antibiotics and other medications. Her nutritional status is concerning, and there is a discussion about starting tube feeds. The patient has a DNR status but is okay to be intubated. There will be a family meeting today to discuss further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia, which increases the risk of respiratory infections and worsening hypoxia.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has moderate pulmonary hypertension, which can contribute to her hypoxia and may require specific treatment.
3. Atrial septal defect (ASD): Although the bubble study showed an ASD, it is not significant enough to explain the patient's hypoxia. However, it can still lead to right-sided heart strain and further complications.
4. Tricuspid regurgitation: The patient has 2+ tricuspid"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia who was admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. She has been consistently hypoxemic despite receiving ongoing steroids and antibiotics. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 129/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a venti mask with high-flow nebulization. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds with end-inspiratory squeaks predominantly on the left side. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and altered liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits. The assessment and plan include hypoxemia, alteration in nutrition, and altered mental status. The patient has been placed on empiric treatment for pulmonary embolism and will undergo a CT angiography to assess for parenchymal lung disease and pulmonary embolism. The patient is also receiving continuous steroids and antibiotics. Nutrition support will be initiated through total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate). 

Potential medical complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's low oxygen saturation and diminished breath sounds with end-inspiratory squeaks may indicate a possible pulmonary emb"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Family meeting held, discussed issue of intubation and unlikelihood
   of extubation if placed on mechanical ventilation. No decision-making
   but patient and family still processing prognosis. Patient and family
   receptive to PEG tube placement but acknowledge she is not well enough
   for procedure at present.
   - CTA (prelim read)--showed impacted LLL bronchi with partial collapse
   of LLL but cannot exclude superimposed infection. Right bibasilar
   atelectasis, dilated and partially fluid-filled esophagus.
   - Now on coughilator TID, not coughing or producing sputum per patient.
   - Got Picc line placed overnight; wet read of follow-up CXR said
   difficult to assess termination point and recommended pulling back tip
   4cm for better visualization, which was done by IV team but no
   follow-up imaging.

   Assessment and Plan
   81yo F with h/o recurrent aspiration PNAs admitted with fever, cough,
   hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: CT revealed impacted portions of left
   lower lobe with distal collapse, consistent with plugging and perhaps
   overlying infection. [**Month (only) 8**] be most likely cause for patient's hypoxia.
   Responding well to coughilator, maintained O2 sats 92-99% since 10pm
   last night. Superimposed infectious component likely. PE unlikely given
   wet read of CT. Cardiogenic etiology unlikely, as even though patient
   has ASD with L to R shunting, it is not large enough to explain
   hypoxia. Pulmonary hypertension may be contributing, however difficulty
   to interpret severity of pulmonary hypertension noted on echo in
   setting of hypoxia from pulmonary disease.
   - Continue high flow mask, increase O2 or change to BiPAP if necessary
   - F/u final CT read
   - Continue coughilator TID and chest PT to mobilize secretions from
   left lower lobe.
   - If producing secretions with coughilator, send respiratory culture
   and if positive can tailor antibiotics
   - Abx: On vanc (day 1 [**2117-4-17**]) and cefepime (day 1 [**4-20**]), s/p 5 days of
   levofloxacin
   - Patient is NPO; will stay on IV steroids today is day 2 of solumedrol
   60mg IV q8h
   - Continue Nebs
   - Pending final read of CT, will d/c lovenox (concern from tech that
   there were PEs, although wet read negative for PE).
   # Nutrition: Albumin steadily downtrending (3.2) and patient NPO
   - Patient too sick at present to tolerate PEG placement; NG or dobhoff
   placement difficult in light of hypoxia
   - PICC placement with goal of TPN.
   - Nutrition left recommendations, will continue to leave recs in POE
   when patient is ready.
          Will provide daily TPN recommendations in POE- Once PICC
   placed
          Start w/ Day 1 TPN- 1L(150 dextrose/ 70 gr protein) 800
   kcals and will advance pending glycemic control 1250mL(220 dextrose/65
   gr protein/30 fat) to provide 1308 kcals
          Continue RISS as ordered
          Please check trig
          ppft in IR vs PEG when medical stable enough
   - Repeat CXR to confirm Picc line tip in SVC before starting TPN
   - Check triglycerides
   - If continues to improve with coughilator and chest PT, may be able to
   revisit Dobhoff/NG tube placement later in today or tomorrow.
   # Lone Afib: Currently in sinus.
   - continue asa
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Osteoporosis--stable
   - On calcium carbonate/vitamin D
   - Holding home alendronate in setting of esophageal dysmotility/chronic
   aspiration.
   # Dementia: continue home meds
   # Prophylaxis:
   - Will d/c lovenox if final PE CT negative
   - Re-start heparin
   - Pneumoboots

   # DISPO: in ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia who was admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia.
- The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, with impacted portions of the left lower lobe consistent with plugging and perhaps overlying infection.
- The patient's oxygen saturation levels have improved from 92-99% since last night.
- The patient is responding well to the coughilator and maintained O2 sats.
- The superimposed infectious component is likely, and there is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
- The cardiogenic etiology is unlikely due to the patient's atrial septal defect with left-to-right shunting.
- The patient may have pulmonary hypertension contributing to the hypoxia, but its severity is difficult to interpret in the setting of pulmonary disease.
- The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and other lab results show normal or near-normal values.
- The patient has been prescribed antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, for suspected infection.
- The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and will continue to receive IV steroids.
- The patient's albumin levels are down trending, indicating possible malnutrition.
- The patient is too sick at present to tolerate percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and nasoga"

   overlying infection. [**Month (only) 8**] be most likely cause for patient's hypoxia.
   Responding well to MIE/cough assist, maintained O2 sats 92-99% since
   10pm last night. Superimposed infectious component likely. PE unlikely

   patient has ASD with L to R shunting, it is not large enough to explain
   hypoxia. Pulmonary hypertension may be contributing, however difficulty
   to interpret severity of pulmonary hypertension noted on echo in
   setting of hypoxia from pulmonary disease.
   - Continue high flow mask, increase O2 or change to BiPAP if necessary
   - F/u final CT read
   - Continue coughilator TID and chest PT to mobilize secretions from
   left lower lobe.
   - If producing secretions with MIE/cough assist, send respiratory
   culture and if positive can tailor antibiotics
   - Abx: On vanc (day 1 [**2117-4-17**]) and cefepime (day 1 [**4-20**]), s/p 5 days of
   levofloxacin
   - Patient is NPO; will taper IV steroids today to 30mg IV q8h
   - Continue Nebs
   - will d/c lovenox (concern from tech that there were PEs, although wet
   read negative for PE).
   # Nutrition: Albumin steadily downtrending (3.2) and patient NPO
   - Patient too sick at present to tolerate PEG placement; NG or dobhoff
   placement difficult in light of hypoxia
   - PICC placement with goal of TPN.
   - Nutrition left recommendations, will continue to leave recs in POE
   when patient is ready.
          Will provide daily TPN recommendations in POE- Once PICC
   placed
          Start w/ Day 1 TPN- 1L(150 dextrose/ 70 gr protein) 800
   kcals and will advance pending glycemic control 1250mL(220 dextrose/65
   gr protein/30 fat) to provide 1308 kcals
          Continue RISS as ordered
          Please check triglycerides
          ppft in IR vs PEG when medical stable enough
   - Repeat CXR to confirm Picc line tip in SVC before starting TPN
   - Check triglycerides
   - If continues to improve with MIE and chest PT, may be able to revisit
   Dobhoff/NG tube placement later in today or tomorrow.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonias admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure due to impacted portions of the left lower lobe with distal collapse, consistent with plugging and perhaps overlying infection. The patient is responding well to MIE/cough assist, maintaining O2 sats 92-99% since last night. Superimposed infectious component is likely, and PE unlikely given the wet read of CT. Cardiogenic etiology is also unlikely due to a small atrial septal defect (ASD) with left-to-right shunting. Pulmonary hypertension may be contributing, but the severity is difficult to interpret in the setting of hypoxia from pulmonary disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Hypoxic respiratory failure due to impacted portions of the left lower lobe with distal collapse.
   - Superimposed infection is likely, which may lead to worsening respiratory symptoms.
   - Aspiration pneumonia can recur if proper precautions are not taken.

2. Cardiovascular Complications:
   - Small ASD with left-to-right shunting, which may contribute to pulmonary hypertension.
   - Pulmonary hypertension may lead to right ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure.

3. Infectious Complications:
   - Impacted portions of the left lower lobe with distal collapse may be predisposed to recurrent infections.

   # DISPO: in ICU
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and atrial fibrillation admitted to the ICU with fever, cough, and hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure due to impacted portions of the left lower lobe, possibly with superimposed infection. The patient's oxygen saturation levels have improved since starting the coughilator. Her blood cultures were negative. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a PICC line placed for potential total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She has been prescribed antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, and is also receiving steroids. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order but is allowed to be intubated. Her family was updated today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and hypoxia suggest a possible pneumonia. The CT scan revealed impacted portions of the left lower lobe with distal collapse, consistent with plugging and perhaps overlying infection. This indicates a potential complication of pneumonia.

2. Aspiration: The patient's history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and the presence of esophageal dysmotility suggest an increased risk for aspiration. This can lead to further respiratory complications and pneumonia.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient is at risk for DVT and PE due to immob"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Family meeting held, discussed issue of intubation and unlikelihood
   of extubation if placed on mechanical ventilation. No decision-making
   but patient and family still processing prognosis. Patient and family
   receptive to PEG tube placement but acknowledge she is not well enough
   for procedure at present.
   - CTA (prelim read)--showed impacted LLL bronchi with partial collapse
   of LLL but cannot exclude superimposed infection. Right bibasilar
   atelectasis, dilated and partially fluid-filled esophagus.
   - Now on coughilator TID
   - Got Picc line placed overnight; wet read of follow-up CXR said
   difficult to assess termination point and recommended pulling back tip
   4cm for better visualization, which was done by IV team but no
   follow-up imaging.
   - O2 sats improved overnight (92-99%)

   Assessment and Plan
   81yo F with h/o recurrent aspiration PNAs admitted with fever, cough,
   hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: CT revealed impacted portions of left
   lower lobe with distal collapse, consistent with plugging and perhaps
   overlying infection. [**Month (only) 8**] be most likely cause for patient's hypoxia.
   Responding well to coughilator, maintained O2 sats 92-99% since 10pm
   last night. Superimposed infectious component likely. PE unlikely given
   wet read of CT. Cardiogenic etiology unlikely, as even though patient
   has ASD with L to R shunting, it is not large enough to explain
   hypoxia. Pulmonary hypertension may be contributing, however difficulty
   to interpret severity of pulmonary hypertension noted on echo in
   setting of hypoxia from pulmonary disease.
   - Continue high flow mask, increase O2 or change to BiPAP if necessary
   - F/u final CT read
   - Continue coughilator TID and chest PT to mobilize secretions from
   left lower lobe.
   - If producing secretions with coughilator, send respiratory culture
   and if positive can tailor antibiotics
   - Abx: On vanc (day 1 [**2117-4-17**]) and cefepime (day 1 [**4-20**]), s/p 5 days of
   levofloxacin
   - Patient is NPO; will stay on IV steroids today is day 2 of solumedrol
   60mg IV q8h
   - Continue Nebs
   - Pending final read of CT, will d/c lovenox (concern from tech that
   there were PEs, although wet read negative for PE).
   # Nutrition: Albumin steadily downtrending (3.2) and patient NPO
   - Patient too sick at present to tolerate PEG placement; NG or dobhoff
   placement difficult in light of hypoxia
   - PICC placement with goal of TPN. Nutrition left recommendations, will
   continue to leave recs in POE when patient is ready.
   - Repeat CXR to confirm Picc line tip in SVC before starting TPN
   - Check triglycerides
   - If continues to improve with coughilator and chest PT, may be able to
   revisit Dobhoff/NG tube placement later in today or tomorrow.

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonias who was admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. The CT scan revealed impacted portions of the left lower lobe with distal collapse, consistent with plugging and perhaps overlying infection. The most likely cause for the patient's hypoxia is likely to be pneumonia, particularly considering the superimposed infectious component. 

The patient is responding well to the coughilator, maintaining O2 sats between 92-99% since last night. The assessment suggests that the patient may have hypoxic respiratory failure, which is responding to coughilator therapy. 

The plan includes continuing high-flow mask oxygen, increasing O2 or changing to BiPAP if necessary, following up with the final CT read, continuing coughilator therapy and chest physiotherapy to mobilize secretions from the left lower lobe, sending respiratory culture if producing secretions, and tailoring antibiotics if the culture is positive. The patient is currently NPO, so she will stay on IV steroids today, which is day 2 of solumedrol 60mg IV q8h. Nebulizers will also be continued.

Regarding nutrition, the patient's albumin levels are steadily downtrending, and she is NPO. She is too sick at present to tolerate PEG placement, and NG or doboff placement is difficult in light of hypoxia. A PICC placement has been done"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia, currently admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. She has been experiencing persistent hypoxemia despite receiving steroids and antibiotics. A CT scan from yesterday revealed left lower lobe (LLL) collapse with secretions in the LLL bronchus. The patient is feeling better today after the use of cough/assist. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, blood pressure ranging from 109/57 mmHg to 147/82 mmHg, heart rate between 60-81 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on high-flow nasal cannula. She is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. Physical examination shows symmetric chest expansion and scattered rhonchi in the lungs. Her extremities are warm and without edema. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and normal liver function. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's critical condition and prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of developing VAP due to mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and advanced age increase the risk of DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if left untreated.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and"

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia admissions. She was admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. A chest CT revealed mucous plugging, partial collapse of the left lower lobe, and multifocal pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure has significantly improved with aggressive chest physiotherapy. The plan is to continue with MIE (medication not specified), aggressive chest physiotherapy, weaning of FiO2 as tolerated, antibiotics (vanc and cefepime for 14 days), sputum culture if possible, tapering of IV steroids, nebs, TPN, RISS, and consideration for a feeding tube if the patient continues to do well.

The patient also has lone atrial fibrillation currently in sinus rhythm, osteoporosis, dementia, and is on prophylactic heparin and pneumoboots. The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) status but is willing to be intubated, and there is a DNR/DNI form present. The contact person is the patient's sister and healthcare proxy, along with a friend who is involved in the patient's care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, worsening of the patient's dementia, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to prolonged immobilization and use of heparin prophylaxis, and complications related to the patient's osteoporosis"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia who was admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. She has been receiving aggressive efforts at mucous clearance and is starting to show improvement in hypoxemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 116/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. She is alert and oriented but appears resigned. Physical examination reveals no acute distress or lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show mild anemia, leukocytosis, and normal kidney and liver function. The patient is currently on TPN (total parenteral nutrition) and is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged or recurrent episodes of hypoxemia due to pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
2. Potential worsening of the patient's altered mental status, which may be related to the underlying pneumonia or other factors.
3. Possible development of pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobilization and lack of regular repositioning.
4. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the use of mechanical ventilation.
5. Potential complications associated with total parenteral nutrition (TPN), such as catheter-related infections or electrolyte imbalances.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia admitted to the ICU with fever, cough, and hypoxia. She has been receiving aggressive efforts at mucous clearance and is showing improvement in oxygenation. The patient's medical history includes alteration in nutrition, altered mental status (not delirium), and pneumonia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving intravenous antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) for a 14-day course. The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) status but is willing to be intubated for a limited period. A consultation for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has been arranged for early next week if her oxygenation remains stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be minimized by following proper ventilation techniques, maintaining good airway hygiene, and regularly assessing the patient for any signs of infection.
2. Barotrauma: Prolonged exposure to high levels of positive pressure during mechanical ventilation can lead to barotrauma, which is damage to the lung tissue. Close monitoring of airway pressures and regular chest X-rays can help detect this complication early.
3. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Improper settings on the ventilator can cause VILI, leading to further lung damage."

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. She was found to have mucous plugging and partial collapse of the left lower lobe with multifocal pneumonia on chest CT. The patient has been treated with aggressive chest physiotherapy, antibiotics, and weaning off oxygen. She also has a history of dementia, osteoporosis, and lone atrial fibrillation.

Potential Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial condition of hypoxia indicates respiratory failure. Continued monitoring and support will be required to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of mucous plugging and partial collapse of the left lower lobe suggests a severe case of pneumonia. The patient is currently receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment, but there is a risk of complications such as sepsis or progression of lung involvement.
3. Aspiration: Given the patient's history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia, there is a risk of further aspiration events leading to worsening respiratory status or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has been on therapeutic anticoagulation due to a previous PE. Monitoring for signs of DVT or PE and ensuring proper anticoagulation management is essential.
5. Delirium or worsening cognitive function: The patient has a history of dementia, and the current ICU"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia, admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. A chest CT revealed mucous plugging and partial collapse of the left lower lobe with multifocal pneumonia. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and aggressive chest physiotherapy, which has improved her condition. She is currently on antibiotics (Vancomycin and Cefepime) for a total 14-day course, with the last day of antibiotics on 4/30 and a subsequent 5-day course of levofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, although her blood pressure remains low. Fluid balance is slightly negative. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and normal kidney function. The patient's medical history includes osteoporosis, dementia, and lone atrial fibrillation. She has been placed on a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order, but not do-not-intubate (DNI). The patient's nutrition is being managed through a nasogastric tube (NGT) with tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, which could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
2. Aspiration: Due to her history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and current need for mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of further aspiration events, leading to lung infections or complications such as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxia. They have been admitted to the ICU and are receiving various medications and treatments. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have low blood pressure and an elevated respiratory rate. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, as well as abnormal kidney function. The patient is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a PICC line in place. They have a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation indicates a potential risk for hypoxemia. This could be due to underlying lung pathology such as pneumonia or respiratory muscle weakness. Oxygen delivery devices like nasal cannula may not provide sufficient oxygenation. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and considering alternative oxygen delivery methods may be necessary.

2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection. The patient's history of pneumonia and presence of IV lines increase the risk of bloodstream or catheter-related infections. Regular assessment of temperature, white blood cell count, and cultures may help identify and treat any infections promptly.

3. Renal Dysfunction: The abnormal kidney function tests (elevated creatinine and decreased blood urea nitrogen) indicate possible acute kidney injury. The use of nephrotoxic medications, decreased"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. A chest CT revealed mucous plugging and partial collapse of the left lower lobe with multifocal pneumonia. The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure but has shown significant improvement with aggressive chest physiotherapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and complications such as acute lung injury or sepsis.
2. Multifocal Pneumonia: The presence of multifocal pneumonia indicates an infection in multiple areas of the lungs, which may require extended antibiotic therapy and can increase the risk of worsening respiratory function.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of hypoxic respiratory failure can progress to more severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not properly managed.
4. Osteoporosis: The patient has a diagnosis of osteoporosis, which increases the risk of fractures, especially with impaired mobility and reduced calcium absorption due to esophageal dysmotility.
5. Dementia: The patient's cognitive impairment due to dementia may affect her ability to follow medical instructions and increase the risk of medication errors or non-compliance.
6. Lone Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's lone atrial fibrillation requires monitoring and anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events, such as"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted with fever, cough, and hypoxia. A chest CT revealed mucous plugging and partial collapse of the left lower lobe with multifocal pneumonia. The patient is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, but has shown significant improvement with aggressive chest physiotherapy. Other conditions include lone atrial fibrillation (currently in sinus rhythm), osteoporosis, dementia, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) order but is willing to be intubated. She also has a do not intubate (DNI) form. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 87/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for some throat dryness and pain. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hypoxic respiratory failure, further aspiration events, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, progression of lone atrial fibrillation, and complications related to prolonged bed rest and immobility."
