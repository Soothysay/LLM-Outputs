   HD dependence M/W/F and recent chemo with (taxol, gemzar) now
   presenting with n/v/d/ new afib with RVR, metastatic disease
   1-Tachycardia: patient presented with Afib. Was in and out of sinus o/n
   now in sinus tachycardia. Likely [**2-18**] sepsis (likely source UTI) in
   setting of neutropenia. Pt has been afebrile overnight. BP currently
   stable but pt fluid overloaded (seen as pulm edema on CXR) and unable
   to give further fluid boluses
   -Will continue metoprolol 10 IV q 4  for rate control
   -Cont cefepime, zosyn, flagyl
   2- AMS- a first possibly [**2-18**] effects of narcotics, now possibly related
   to uremia. However, pt
s family states that pt has become increasingly
   somnolent at home for at least the last week and suspect this is
   related to his metastatic disease. Hepatic encephalopathy could also be
   contributing considering liver failure with liver [**Month/Day (2) **] however as pt is
   already having considerable diarrhea, lactulose has been held
   -HD today as below.
   3-ESRD on HD- Uremia is likely cause of pt
s current AG acidosis. Pt
   AMS may be currently [**2-18**] uremia now that effects of narcotics have worn
   off. Pt
s family would like to see if HD will allow him to wake up at
   all and talk to them at this time. They do understand that HD at this
   time is a temporizing measure and that this will not change his overall
   prognosis
   -Plan for HD today with 2uPRBCs to be transfused during HD
   -Ca repletion ordered.
   4-[**Name (NI) 3491**] Pt likely with chronic anemia but also now with guaiac
   positive stools. ? source of GI bleed.
   -Monitor HCT closely
   - transfuse 2 uPRBCs during HD.
   5-Hypoglycemia- likely [**2-18**] continuing liver failure. Pt not awake
   enough to be safe for PO intake. Do not think TPN would be beneficial
   at this time and would not want to make pt uncomfortable with NGT.
   -Cont D10 gtt at 20cc/hr
   6- Thrombocytopenia: likely related to bone marrow suppression. No
   evidence of bleeding now. Continue to monitor.
   7- Metastatic bladder ca: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3481**] spoke with family yesterday and
   they understand that his disease is end stage and agree not to further
   treat his Ca at this time. They are beginning to think about
   comfort-oriented care but would like to see if the pt could wake up in
   the next few days with current treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer, presenting with somnolence, anemia, diarrhea, renal failure, and metastatic disease. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on comfort-oriented care. The patient's family has decided to make him DNR/DNI, but they would like to wait a few days to see if there is any improvement in his mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient presented with atrial fibrillation and is now in sinus tachycardia. This could be due to sepsis, likely from a urinary tract infection, in the setting of neutropenia. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but he is fluid overloaded and unable to receive further fluid boluses. Continuing metoprolol 10 IV q 4 for rate control is recommended.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's increasing somnolence may be related to his metastatic disease or uremia. Hepatic encephalopathy could also be contributing, considering liver failure. Lactulose has been held due to the patient's considerable diarrhea.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Hemodialysis (HD): The patient's uremia may be causing his current altered mental status. The family would like to see if HD will allow him to wake up and communicate with them. HD is a temporizing measure and will"

   1) Tachycardia: patient presented with Afib. No obvious explanation.
   Assess for myocardial infarction. With thrombocytopenia and prolonged
   INR and renal failure, a PE is less likely. Would check A-a gradient on
   room air and obtain LENI's with peripheral edema. Also check thyroid
   function.
   2) Fever: concern about infection with neutropenia. CXR not impressive
   for infiltrate but there may be slight increase in markings at right
   base and left base. On broad spectrum antibiotics; will repeat CXR in
   AM. Blood cultures pending.
   3) Anemia: probably related to marrow suppression. No evidence of GI
   bleeding. Guaiac stool.
   4) Thrombocytopenia: likely related to bone marrow suppression. No
   evidence of bleeding now. Continue to monitor.
   5) Hypotension: patient with hx of hypertension. Present BP likely
   relatively hypotensive now. Has dry mucus membranes and decreased
   tissue turgor. Will give additional fluids now. With renal failure,
   would watch bicarbonate with normal saline fluid resuscitation. Would
   not give lactated ringers because of anuria. [**Month (only) 51**] need D5W with bicarb
   as part of fluid resuscitation if serum bicarb begins to drop.
   6) Metastatic bladder ca: discuss future therapy with oncology.
   7) Altered mental status: Patient given narcan with some improvement.
   He is on narcotics at home and may have taken extra doses or may now
   have delayed metabolism because of liver [**Month (only) **] and abnormal LFT's.
   Continue with narcan for now. Uremia may also be contributing to
   altered mental status.
   8) Chronic renal failure: electrolytes and acid-base status acceptable.
   Mental status may be due, in part, to uremia. No volume overload now.
   No immediate need for dialysis.
   9) Acidosis: combined anion gap acidosis, probably from uremai, and
   metabolic alkalosis, likely from volume depletion and vomiting.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of somnolence. The patient has been unresponsive and unable to provide a history. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C, heart rate of 138 bpm, blood pressure of 132/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 2 LNC.

The patient's physical examination shows scleral icterus, poor dentition, symmetric chest expansion with crackles at the left base, and warm skin with jaundice. Neurologic examination reveals response to noxious stimuli and normal tone.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 33,000/mm3, and elevated creatinine levels at 6.3 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), prolonged PT/PTT/inr, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's medical history includes chronic renal failure, malignancy, and hypertension. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has received blood products. The patient's family has decided to make the patient do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Tachycardia: The patient presented with atrial fibrillation."

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These include:

1. Tachycardia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing sinus tachycardia. This may be due to sepsis, likely originating from a urinary tract infection, especially considering the patient's neutropenia.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's increasing somnolence could be attributed to several factors such as the effects of narcotics, uremia, or hepatic encephalopathy. It is important to note that the patient's family believes this change is related to metastatic disease.

3. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and a decreased glomerular filtration rate. This may contribute to uremic symptoms and the need for hemodialysis.

4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, indicating anemia. This could be due to chronic disease or gastrointestinal bleeding, suggested by the presence of guaiac-positive stools.

5. Hypoglycemia: The patient is experiencing low blood sugar levels, likely secondary to liver failure and inadequate intake.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is commonly associated with bone marrow suppression.

7. Metastatic bladder cancer: The patient has advanced metastatic bladder cancer, with large pelvic masses. The family"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic bladder cancer, who is currently in the ICU. He has been experiencing increasing somnolence, which may be related to his metastatic disease. The patient also has a history of anemia, chronic renal failure, and cancer. He presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), likely secondary to sepsis from a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but he is fluid overloaded and unable to receive further fluid boluses. 

The patient's altered mental status may be due to several factors, including narcotics, uremia, or hepatic encephalopathy. The family wishes to continue with hemodialysis (HD) to see if it improves the patient's wakefulness and ability to communicate. 

The patient has a guaiac positive stool, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. His platelet count is low, likely due to bone marrow suppression. He is also hypoglycemic, likely due to continuing liver failure. 

The patient's family understands that his disease is end-stage and agrees not to further treat his cancer at this time. They are considering comfort-oriented care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient has atrial fibrillation with RVR, which could lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient likely had sepsis secondary to a UTI, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death if not treated promptly.
3. Fluid overload: The patient is currently fluid overloaded, which can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
5. Chronic renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid retention, and uremia.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac positive stool suggests possible gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and shock if significant.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count can increase the risk of bleeding, especially if there is any additional trauma or invasive procedures.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia can lead to confusion, seizures, or even coma if not corrected promptly.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and additional information or tests may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 67-year-old male with bladder cancer and large pelvic masses, who has been dependent on hemodialysis (HD) and recently underwent chemotherapy with taxol and gemzar.
- The patient presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and metastatic disease.
- The patient's tachycardia is likely due to sepsis, possibly originating from a urinary tract infection (UTI), considering the patient's neutropenia.
- The patient experienced hypotension, which was not addressed by administering metoprolol.
- The patient's altered mental status (AMS) was initially attributed to narcotics, then uremia, and now is thought to be caused by hepatic encephalopathy and/or advancing metastatic disease.
- The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on HD required discontinuation of further HD sessions as the patient's condition is not expected to improve.
- The patient likely has chronic anemia but is also experiencing guaiac positive stools, indicating a potential gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
- The patient's hypoglycemia is likely due to continuing liver failure, as the patient is not awake enough for oral intake.
- The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely related to bone marrow suppression. No evidence of bleeding has been"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of bladder cancer and metastatic disease. He is currently in the ICU due to altered mental status, tachycardia, anemia, renal failure, and other medical complications. The patient's condition has been deteriorating despite receiving comfort measures, chemotherapy, and hemodialysis. The family has agreed not to pursue further treatment for his end-stage metastatic bladder cancer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presented with atrial fibrillation and hypotension, which could be indicative of sepsis, likely originating from a urinary tract infection. However, the patient has been afebrile in the ICU.
2. Altered Mental Status (AMS): Initially thought to be related to narcotics, then uremia, and now likely hepatic encephalopathy and/or advancing metastatic disease.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient underwent hemodialysis on 11/28 but no further sessions are planned as the patient is comfort care.
4. Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding: The patient has guaiac positive stools, indicating possible GI bleeding. The source of the bleed needs to be determined.
5. Hypoglycemia: Likely continuing liver failure. The patient is not awake enough to safely take oral intake.
6. Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to bone marrow suppression.
