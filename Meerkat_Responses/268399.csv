   86 yo M with PMH of Parkinson's, c. difficile, chronic renal
   insufficeny, stage 4 decub ulcer who presents from nursing home with
   fevers, increased sputum production, and proteus bacterimia and UTI now
   requiring pressor support.
   # Hypotension: On presentation met sepsis criteria with elevated WBC
   with bandemia, fever, hypotension and known source of infection in
   urine and blood.  Patient developed hypotension refractory to fluids,
   started dopamine - with rise of sbp to 100's and stable.  A line
   attempted multiple times, but unsuccessful as patient has high
   calcified peripheral arteries.  WBC count down to 23 from 33 on
   admission.  Cr improving.
   - continue peripheral dopamine for bp support
 has poor anatomy for IJ
   or SC CVL placement
   - continue broad spectrum antiobiotics to cover proteus UTI/bacteremia
   with zosyn, c. diff with vancomycin po and flagyl iv.  Needs total of 7
   days of treatment for HAP to end [**2114-12-10**].  C. diff tx duration for 2
   week after all other antibiotics are stopped
   - UOP goal >30
   - Follow-up blood, urine, sputum and stool cultures
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve
   # Goals of Care: Patient with poor functional status at baseline,
   DNR/DNI.  Given need for pressor support, may not return to baseline
   function
   -family meeting with daughter today
   -will alter treatment as outline pending outcome of family meeting
   # UTI:  Ucx from rehab (+) for proteus sensitive to Zosyn and resistant
   to cipro/levo/bactrim.  Foley replaced on admission.
   - Zosyn for 14 days of treatment for complicated UTI
   # Oliguria:  Has been oliguric since admission.  Received a total of
   2.5L of fluid, has elevated JVP.  No CVP available as has no central
   access.
   - dopamine to maintain UOP>30, can trail fluid boluses to see if
   increases UOP
   # PNA:  Diffusely rhonchorous, pleural effusions, ? RLL PNA, has
   significant secretions, per patient, has had increased sputum
   production.
   - contune iv vanco and zosyn for hospital aquired pneuomnia for total
   of 7 days of treatment to end on [**2114-12-10**]
   - influenza DFA pending
   # Protocolitis:  Abd was concerning on admission as he was tender with
   guarding, CT scan showed proctocolitis, also with profuse diarrhea
   concerning for c. diff as has history of this. WBC count trending down
   with abx treatment.  Abdominal pain improving
   - C. diff assay negative x1 though very high suspicion, can have
   negative assay and still be infected
   - continue po vanc and iv flagyl empirically
 should continue for 2
   weeks after last antibiotics are stopped
   - consider surgery c/s for eval if worsens
   # Diarrhea:  Has hx of c. diff, given markedly elevated WBC on
   admission, c. diff high on differential.  Though he is bacteremic and
   has a UTI such a significant leukocytosis is more c/w c. diff than with
   the other infections.
   - c. diff assay - if positive, meets criteria for severe C. diff given
   WBC, fever and age and merits po vanco treatment
   - cover with po vancomycin and iv flagyl as above
   # ARF on CRI: Improving.  Cr 3.9 on admission, trending down to 3.4
   this morning.  Per NH notes, has CRI, though baseline Cr appears to be
   0.9. Likely pre-renal, has received 4L NS.  Had a lot of blood clots in
   foley at rehab.  Per CT read, no hydro, per rads no need for renal u/s.
   Received total of 2.5L NS on the floor and had gotten 4L NS in ED for a
   total of 6.5L.
   - EF 70%, will carefullly monitor respiratory status
   - trend
   - ensure proper function of foley given clots, may neeed flushing
   - low threshold to c/s urology
   # Elevate INR:  [**11-30**] this morning, not on coumadin, unclear cause.
   Likely nutritional.
   - vitamin K 10mg iv x2
   -recheck coags tomorrow
   # Abnormal EKG: Initial EKG was irregularly irregular, hr in 60's, no
   hx of afib, pt asymptomatic.  Repeat EKG was NSR.
   - no intervention needed
   # Parkinson's:  Continue home meds
   - Speech/swallow eval consult placed
   # Stage IV decubitus ulcer: Has had for several years per daughter.
   - wound care c/s placed
   # Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure:  EF 70% per OSH
   - careful monitoring of respiratory status with fluids
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, chronic renal insufficiency, stage 4 decubitus ulcer, and previous CABG surgery. He was admitted to the ICU with sepsis due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia. He required pressor support and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient also has oliguria, diarrhea, acute renal failure, and impaired skin integrity. He has a complicated UTI caused by Proteus, which is sensitive to Zosyn. His goals of care include maintaining urine output, following up with blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures, and ensuring proper fluid balance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may persist due to sepsis and may require continued dopamine support.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if not adequately managed with fluid balance and medication adjustments.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen if not appropriately treated with antibiotics and respiratory support.
4. UTI: The patient's complicated UTI may lead to further complications if not effectively treated with appropriate antibiotics.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's stage 4 decubitus ulcer may worsen without proper wound care and pressure relief.
6. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea, likely due to Clostridium difficile infection, may continue if not treated with appropriate antibiotics"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, chronic renal insufficiency, stage 4 decubitus ulcer, and c. difficile infection. He presents with fevers, increased sputum production, and bacteremia due to Proteus infection in the urine and blood. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, diarrhea, renal failure, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing refractory hypotension that requires pressor support. There is a need for central venous access to administer appropriate pressors and maintain blood pressure.
2. UTI: The patient has a confirmed UTI caused by Proteus bacteria, which is sensitive to Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). Treatment with Zosyn should be continued for 14 days.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has signs of pneumonia, possibly community-acquired (CAP), with diffuse rhonchi and pleural effusions. Treatment with IV Vancomycin and Zosyn should be continued for 7 days.
4. Diarrhea/C. difficile infection: The patient has a history of c. difficile infection and presents with profuse diarrhea. Empirical treatment with oral Vancomycin and IV Flagyl should be continued for 2 weeks after stopping other antibiotics.
5. Acute Renal Failure:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of Parkinson's disease who was admitted to the ICU with a stage IV decubitus ulcer, fever, hypotension, and a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Proteus bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin. The patient had been treated with ciprofloxacin prior to admission. He also had increased diarrhea and a traumatic Foley catheter placement with clots passing through the Foley. The patient's blood pressure in the emergency department was in the 140s, and he was given 4 liters of normal saline. A coude catheter was placed, and the patient complained of abdominal pain. A CT scan of the abdomen showed proctocolitis, bilateral effusions with dependent consolidations, and mild hydronephrosis.

The patient received IV fluids to improve urine output and started on dopamine via a peripheral line. He was also put on Zosyn, IV vancomycin, PO vancomycin, and metronidazole for possible pneumonia and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has allergies to cephalosporins, and the last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 93/39 to 140/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery and has a sinus rhythm. Physical examination findings include no acute distress, clear breath sounds, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present and distended, tender to palpation, and trace edema in both extremities. Neurologic examination was not assessed.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 28.8 thousand cells/microliter, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, platelet count of 99 thousand cells/microliter, creatinine level of 3.6 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 94 mg/dL, and other laboratory values within normal ranges. Imaging reveals bilateral atelectasis versus infiltrate on chest X-ray. Microbiology results show Proteus bacteremia resistant to quinolones.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has severe sepsis with shock, likely due to multiple sources including the gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, skin breakdown, and pulmonary system. The patient is also experiencing chronic kidney disease with acute failure, Parkinson's disease, impaired skin integrity, hypothyroidism, and coagulopathy. The patient is critically ill and requires ongoing management of these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing severe sepsis with shock, and there is a risk of further complications or deterioration if the infection is not effectively controlled.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's chronic kidney disease may progress to acute kidney injury due to factors such as hypovolemia, sepsis, and nephrotoxic medications.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral atelectasis versus infiltrate, which may indicate pneumonia. This condition needs to be monitored and treated appropriately.
4. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient is being treated with metronidazole for possible C. difficile infection. Monitoring for symptoms and complications related to this infection is important.
5. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's stage IV decubitus ulcer needs ongoing wound care to prevent further complications such as infection or worsening of the ulcer.
6. Parkinson's Disease: The patient's Parkinson's disease may be exacerbated by medication side effects or the stress of critical illness.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism should be monitored and managed to prevent complications related to thyroid hormone deficiency."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a complex medical history, including Parkinson's disease, chronic renal insufficiency, stage 4 decubitus ulcer, and a history of c. difficile infection. The patient presents with fevers, increased sputum production, and bacteremia caused by Proteus, as well as a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including hypotension, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (both hospital-acquired and community-acquired), renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's current condition includes refractory hypotension requiring dopamine infusion, oliguria with elevated JVP, rhonchi on auscultation with possible right lower lobe pneumonia, profuse diarrhea concerning for c. difficile colitis, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia and low blood pressure.

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover the identified infections, including Zosyn for UTI and bacteremia, vancomycin for c. difficile and pneumonia, and metronidazole for possible colitis. The patient's goals of care include maintaining urine output >30 mL/hr, following up on blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures, and trending WBC count and fever curve.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis with organ dysfunction, further deterioration"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is critically ill and being treated in the ICU. The patient has a history of severe sepsis with shock, chronic kidney disease with acute failure, Parkinson's disease, impaired skin integrity, hypothyroidism, and coagulopathy. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with increased secretions leading to desaturation in the mid-80s. The patient was placed on a non-rebreather mask and received pulmonary toilet, and a scopolamine patch was started. Hypotension was managed with titration of dopamine. There was difficulty placing a nasogastric tube. The patient's mental status has declined, and they are unable to draw blood for morning labs. Allergies include cephalosporins, with a rash occurring after the last dose of antibiotics. The patient is not receiving oral medications due to the inability to obtain enteral access.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient may experience increased respiratory distress due to possible increased pulmonary edema, aspiration of pulmonary secretions, and mucous plugging. Continuous pulmonary toilet, elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees, and ongoing antibiotic therapy will be continued to monitor and manage this condition.

2. Chronic Kidney Disease with Acute Failure: The patient may have chronic kidney disease with acute failure, possibly due to prolonged distributive shock/hypovolemia. Discrete IV fluid boluses will be given, and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with severe sepsis and shock. The source of sepsis includes the gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, skin breakdown, and pulmonary system. The patient has known Proteus bacteremia. The patient's condition has worsened, with decreased mental status, continued hypotension requiring titration of dopamine, difficulty placing a nasogastric tube, and diminished secretions. The patient is unable to take oral medications due to lack of enteral access. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 117 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 117/51 mmHg to 89/31 mmHg. The patient is on respiratory support with a face tent and has an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's respiratory status has declined, with wheezes on the right side and rhonchi diffusely. The patient's extremities are cool and clammy, and peripheral pulses are absent on the right side and weak on the left side. Neurologically, the patient is sedated and follows simple commands. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Severe Sepsis with Shock - The patient is being treated with intravenous vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole. Dopamine infusion is being titrated for hypotension.
2. Respiratory Distress - Pulmonary toilet is being continued, and"
