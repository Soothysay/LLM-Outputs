   Assessment and Plan
   68-year-old man with severe shock (source most likely decub, but UTI
   and PICC line also in DDx) on a background history of T4 paraplegia
   (?myelitis) complicated by decubiti, neurogenic bladder, PEs and UTIs.
   Severe sepsis
     * Source control
 Try to get PIVs.  If he remains fluid-responsive,
       would then pull PICC line.  If not, will need CVL.   Ask plastics
       (who knows him well) to consult about decub with possible abscess
       and osteomyelitis.
     * ABX
 vanco (MRSA), Zosyn (GNR based on prior Cx).  No evidence for
       C diff at present.
         He does not have a clinical syndrome consistent with
   pneumonia.  His CT findings are suggestive of aspiration and warrant
   follow-up.  Zosyn is adequate to cover for aspiration; the risk of
   atypical infection in aspiration would seem to be low.  This does not
   appear to be a primary pneumonia.
     * Hemodynamics
 appears hypovolemic at present.  Will volume
       challenge, although with some care given low EF.
     * Drotrecogin
 doesn
t meet criteria
     * Steroids
 cortstym appropriate
     * Urine cx >100,000 GNR, f/u speciation, continue tobramycin
     * Pull PICC line if cx positive
     * Sputum cx not acceptable
     * Swithced foley yesterday
   Decubitus ulcers
     * Quite long-standing
     * Wound care and plastics consult.  [**Month (only) 60**] need additional imaging for
       osteo.
     * Evaluated by plastics
     * Gram stain 1+ polys and 2+ GNR
   PE s/p IVC filter:
     * Hold warfarin today; goal INR 2
 3.  Monitor closely.  If he does
       not continue his rapid improvement, convert to heparin and hold
       warfarin. Multiple abx on board likely affecting level
   CAD/CHF (systolic, chronic)
          No evidence of volume overload.  Hold antihypertensives;
   continue aspirin.
          His troponin is elevated, but appears to be chronically so

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with severe shock and a background history of T4 paraplegia, complicated by decubiti, neurogenic bladder, pulmonary embolisms, and urinary tract infections. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Severe shock: The patient's low blood pressure (hypotension) indicates severe shock. The source of the shock is likely due to a decubitus ulcer, but urinary tract infection (UTI) and peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC) line are also possible causes.

2. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has an existing sacral decubitus ulcer, which may have led to severe sepsis. There is a concern for abscess and osteomyelitis. Plastics consultation is recommended for further evaluation and management.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The urine cultures show a significant growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR), indicating a UTI. Tobramycin has been started for treatment, and wound cultures have been obtained.

4. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis due to the suspected decubitus ulcer infection. Source control measures, including getting peripheral intravenous (PIVs) and pulling the PICC line if the patient remains fluid-responsive, are planned.

5. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's CT findings suggest aspiration, which warrants follow-up. However, there is"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 68-year-old man with severe shock, likely due to a sacral decubitus ulcer. He has a background history of T4 paraplegia, neurogenic bladder, pulmonary embolisms (PEs), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and chronic heart failure (CHF). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/63 to 110/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), low creatinine (Cr), and troponin levels within normal range. Other lab values indicate hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and dilutional hemoconcentration. 

The patient has received several antibiotics including vancomycin, tobramycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for suspected infections such as MRSA, GNR, and aspiration. 

The patient's fluid balance reveals a total intake of 4,422 mL, with 4,022 mL given intravenously.

   Assessment and Plan
   68-year-old man with severe shock (source most likely decub, but UTI
   and PICC line also in DDx) on a background history of T4 paraplegia
   (?myelitis) complicated by decubiti, neurogenic bladder, PEs and UTIs.
   Severe sepsis
     * Source control
 Try to get PIVs.  If he remains fluid-responsive,
       would then pull PICC line.  If not, will need CVL.   Ask plastics
       (who knows him well) to consult about decub with possible abscess
       and osteomyelitis.
     * ABX
 vanco (MRSA), Zosyn (GNR based on prior Cx).  No evidence for
       C diff at present.
         He does not have a clinical syndrome consistent with
   pneumonia.  His CT findings are suggestive of aspiration and warrant
   follow-up.  Zosyn is adequate to cover for aspiration; the risk of
   atypical infection in aspiration would seem to be low.  This does not
   appear to be a primary pneumonia.
     * Hemodynamics
 appears hypovolemic at present.  Will volume
       challenge, although with some care given low EF.
     * Drotrecogin
 doesn
t meet criteria
     * Steroids
 cortstym appropriate
     * Urine cx >100,000 GNR, f/u speciation
     * Sputum cx not acceptable
     * Swithced foley yesterday
   Decubitus ulcers
     * Quite long-standing
     * Wound care and plastics consult.  [**Month (only) 60**] need additional imaging for
       osteo.
     * Evaluated by plastics
     * Gram stain 1+ polys and 2+ GNR
   PE s/p IVC filter:
     * Hold warfarin today; goal INR 2
 3.  Monitor closely.  If he does
       not continue his rapid improvement, convert to heparin and hold
       warfarin. Multiple abx on board likely affecting level
   CAD/CHF (systolic, chronic)
          No evidence of volume overload.  Hold antihypertensives;
   continue aspirin.
          His troponin is elevated, but appears to be chronically so
   (for unclear reasons)
 does not appear to be ACS/unstable plaque.
          Ruled out for ACS with 3 negative enzymes
   ANEMIA
   - stool guiacs, likely due to IVF, will monitor
   Seizure disorder
     * Continue keppra

","The patient is a 68-year-old man with severe shock, likely due to a decubitus ulcer, urinary tract infection (UTI), and possible infection from a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. He has a history of T4 paraplegia, complicated by decubiti, neurogenic bladder, pulmonary embolisms (PEs), and UTIs. His current condition is severe sepsis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 87/63 mmHg to 110/78 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% on high-flow nasal cannula. 

The patient's lab results show elevated ESR/CRP levels, mildly elevated cardiac enzymes, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and a hematocrit (HCT) level of 22%. The patient's WBC count has increased from 4.7 to 6.2 K/uL. His platelet count has decreased from 317 to 226 K/uL. Troponin levels are elevated but within a chronic range. Other lab values include elevated PT/PTT/INR levels and low calcium/magnesium/phosphate levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of T4 paraplegia, complicated by decubiti, neurogenic bladder, PEs, and UTIs. He is currently in the ICU for sepsis. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 82/56 mmHg and a heart rate of 87 bpm. He is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Tobramycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam), and other ICU medications. The patient has received fluid resuscitation and is tolerating it well without respiratory distress. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. GNR in urine: The presence of GNR bacteria in the urine suggests a possible urinary tract infection. This should be monitored and treated accordingly.
2. PICC line: Cultures are pending on the PICC line, indicating a possible central line infection. This will need to be evaluated and managed appropriately.
3. Sacral decubitus: The patient has an abnormal CT scan of the sacral decubitus, which may require further evaluation by the plastics team.
4. PNA (Pneumonia): The patient's chest x-ray is pending, but it is likely aspergillus. The current antibiotics (Vanco, Zosyn) should be continued, and follow-up chest x-rays will be done.
5. Hemodynamics: The patient's hemodynamics have improved, but close monitoring is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with severe shock, likely due to a decubitus ulcer, but also possibly related to a urinary tract infection (UTI) and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. He has a history of T4 paraplegia, neurogenic bladder, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and UTIs. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure at baseline levels. He has been diagnosed with sepsis and is currently being treated with vancomycin and tobramycin. There is a suspicion of pneumonia, as indicated by increasing opacity in the right lung base on the chest X-ray. Sputum culture results show the presence of Gram-positive cocci in pairs and yeast, indicating a possible bacterial and fungal infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The increasing opacity in the right lung base on the chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia. The patient's desaturation event may be related to mucus plugging, which can further complicate pneumonia.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The urine cultures growing >100,000 Acinetobacter suggest a significant UTI. The patient's low tobramycin level indicates that the current dose may not be therapeutic, necessitating an adjustment in the antibiotic regimen.
3. Decubitus ulcers: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished 71-year-old male with no known drug allergies. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected aspiration pneumonia. Upon admission, his vital signs were within normal range, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 101/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.

During his stay in the ICU, the patient received various treatments, including antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin), tobramycin infusion, and other ICU medications. His fluid balance has been closely monitored, with a total input of 3,290 mL and output of 2,415 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 875 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. His blood glucose levels have been relatively stable, ranging from 83 to 92 mg/dL. Other lab values, such as creatinine, potassium, sodium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are within normal limits.

A chest X-ray revealed slightly decreased lung volumes with increased opacity in the right lung base, which may indicate early consolidation or aspiration versus atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax was"

   follow-up.  Zosyn is adequate to cover for aspiration; the risk of
   atypical infection in aspiration would seem to be low.  This does not
   appear to be a primary pneumonia., continue this regimen until further

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 68-year-old man with severe shock, likely due to a decubitus ulcer but also possibly related to a urinary tract infection (UTI) and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line.
- The patient has a background history of T4 paraplegia, decubiti, neurogenic bladder, pulmonary embolisms (PEs), and UTIs.
- The patient is currently septic and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin for MRSA and Zosyn for gram-negative bacteria based on prior cultures.
- The patient does not have evidence of pneumonia, but there are findings suggestive of aspiration on a chest X-ray.
- The patient appears hypovolemic and will be volume-challenged with some caution due to low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
- The patient does not meet criteria for drotrecogin.
- Corticosteroids are being considered.
- The patient has a urinary tract infection with over 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU) of gram-negative rods (GNR), and further speciation is needed.
- The PICC line should be removed if the culture is positive.
- Sputum cultures are not acceptable and will be resent.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a chief complaint of sepsis. He has a history of T4 paraplegia, decubiti, neurogenic bladder, pulmonary embolisms (PEs), and urinary tract infections (UTIs). The patient's current assessment includes sepsis, GNR in urine, PICC line, sacral decubitus ulcer, pneumonia (likely aspirated), hemodynamics, PE with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, chronic congestive heart failure (CAD/CHF), and seizure disorder. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics and other ICU medications. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in his hemodynamic status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GNR in urine: The presence of Gram-negative rods (GNR) in the urine indicates a potential urinary tract infection. If left untreated or inadequately treated, this could lead to worsening of the infection and potentially spread to other parts of the body.
2. PICC line: The patient has a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line for intravenous access. There is a risk of infection associated with central lines, which can lead to bloodstream infections.
3. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which is a pressure ulcer that has developed due to prolonged pressure on the sacrum. If not managed properly, this ulcer may worsen and increase the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of T4 paraplegia, complicated by decubiti, neurogenic bladder, pulmonary embolisms, and urinary tract infections. He is currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 101/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient's medical history includes shock, chronic coronary artery disease/ congestive heart failure, seizure disorder, and possible acute coronary syndrome. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, tobramycin, and vancomycin. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's blood cultures have grown gram-negative rods and yeast.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GNR in urine - The patient is currently on antibiotics, specifically piperacillin/tazobactam and tobramycin, awaiting sensitivity results. It is crucial to monitor for any signs of persistent infection or resistance to the current treatment.
2. PICC line - Cultures are pending, indicating that there might be a concern for infection related to the peripheral inserted central catheter line.

","The patient is a 68-year-old man with severe shock, likely due to decubitus ulcers, urinary tract infection (UTI), and possibly infected intravenous catheter (PICC line). He has a background history of T4 paraplegia, neurogenic bladder, pulmonary embolisms (PEs), UTIs, and sepsis. The patient is currently on tobramycin for UTI and aspiration pneumonia coverage. An MRI is scheduled to evaluate for osteomyelitis. 

Hemodynamics are at baseline blood pressure, and volume resuscitation is provided as needed. Autonomic dysfunction is noted. Drotrecogin therapy is not indicated, and steroids are not recommended. Urine culture shows >100,000 Acinetobacter, which is being treated with tobramycin, with dosage adjustment planned. The PICC line should be removed if the culture is positive. Sputum culture is pending. Foley catheter was changed upon admission. 

The patient has long-standing decubitus ulcers, and an MRI of the lower spine is scheduled. Plastics and general surgery do not believe the ulcers are actively infected. A gram stain shows 1+ polys and 2+ GNR, without speciation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with severe shock, likely due to decubitus ulcers, urinary tract infection (UTI), and a potentially infected peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC line). He has a history of T4 paraplegia, neurogenic bladder, pulmonary embolism (PE), and UTIs. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 94/58 mmHg and heart rate of 87 bpm. He is receiving tobramycin for the UTI and will continue treatment for a total of 7 days. An MRI is scheduled to evaluate for osteomyelitis. The patient requires suctioning for aspiration, incentive spirometry, and has an IVC filter in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's severe shock and presence of multiple infections (UTI, decubitus ulcers, PICC line) indicate the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary.
2. Decubitus Ulcers: The patient has long-standing decubitus ulcers, which can become infected and worsen if not properly managed. Regular wound assessment and appropriate wound care are essential.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a high colony count of Acinetobacter in his urine culture, indicating a significant UTI. Adjusting the dose of tobramycin and considering other"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 68-year-old man with shock - on a background
   history of T4 paraplegia (? myelitis) complicated by decubiti,
   neurogenic bladder, PEs and UTIs.
   1. Sepsis: Hemodynamics have improved overall and we now have
   documentation of autonomic instability in prior hx which may have
   contributed to initial BP lability though clearly shock due to
   urosepsis was a component.
   Issues:
   a. GNR in urine
 Acinetobacter sensi to tobra plan 7 days, adjusted by
   last pk and trough
   b. PICC - cultures pending neg to date will maintain
   c. sacral decub- abnl CT, plastics feels bone bx not indicated. Gen
   [**Doctor First Name **] also commented that do not think acute issue( even with peri
   rectal stranding on CT) but we still favor MRI for comparison to last
   to see if active evidence of osteo
   If unchanged, no need for 6 weeks of Rx
   2. PE s/p IVC filter - Hold warfarin today; goal INR 2
 3.  Monitor
   closely.
   3. CAD/CHF (systolic, chronic)
       No evidence of volume overload.  Continue aspirin. [**Month (only) 60**] be able to
   restart regimen
   4. Seizure disorder: Continue keppra

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of T4 paraplegia, complicated by decubiti, neurogenic bladder, pulmonary embolisms (PEs), and urinary tract infections (UTIs). The patient is currently in the ICU for sepsis. 

Key findings from the note include:
- The patient has improved hemodynamics, with stable vital signs and better oxygenation.
- There is evidence of autonomic instability in the patient's history, which may have contributed to initial blood pressure lability.
- The patient has gram-negative rods (GNR) in his urine, identified as Acinetobacter species, which is sensitive to tobramycin. The plan is to continue the antibiotic for 7 days.
- A peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line culture is pending and will be maintained.
- The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which showed abnormal findings on CT. An MRI is favored for further evaluation.
- The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed. Warfarin therapy will be held, aiming for an INR of 2, and the patient will be monitored closely.
- The patient has chronic systolic heart failure (CHF) and coronary artery disease (CAD), with no evidence of volume overload. Aspirin therapy will be continued, and the patient will be able to restart other"
