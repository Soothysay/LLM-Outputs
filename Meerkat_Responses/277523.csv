   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of COPD and pulmonary hypertension who presented with shortness of breath, cough, and increased sputum production. She required intubation in the emergency department due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of severe obstructive lung disease and multiple intubations in recent months. Her flu swab was negative.

The patient's current assessment includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to underlying COPD and a new right middle lobe pneumonia. She is being aggressively weaned off ventilation to BiPAP, with a goal of maintaining PCO2 levels in the 60s. She is also receiving solumedrol for recent steroid taper, continuing with zosyn and vancomycin for healthcare-associated pneumonia with a history of pseudomonas pneumonia prior. Nebulizers and propofol for sedation are also being continued in hopes of extubation in the next day.

The patient's other conditions include hyperglycemia, likely related to steroids, for which she is being started on humalog insulin. She has a history of coronary artery disease with a stable ejection fraction of 50-55% and no evidence of current ischemia. Medications for CAD, including Plavix, lisinopril, and statin, as well as tele monitoring, are being continued. She is also stable on her depression medications, including nortripty"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of COPD and pulmonary hypertension who presented with shortness of breath, cough, and increased sputum production. She has been intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of severe obstructive lung disease and multiple intubations in recent months. Her flu swab was negative. The patient is currently being aggressively weaned off ventilation to use BiPAP. She is also receiving daily IV solumedrol, continuing with zosyn for HCAPNA, nebs, and may discontinue azithromycin if urine legionella is negative. Sputum cultures will be followed up for further speciation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and new right middle lobe pneumonia are contributing to her respiratory failure. Weaning off ventilation to BiPAP will be important to prevent further complications.
2. Hypovolemia: Despite stable pressures, the patient's urologic output is decreasing. Holding intravenous fluids for now, but considering IVF bolus for volume resuscitation after extubation to increase urine output.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is likely due to steroid use. Humalog insulin subcutaneously will be used for now.
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's CAD is stable, with a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of COPD and pulmonary hypertension who presented with shortness of breath, cough, and increased sputum production. She required intubation in the emergency department due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of severe obstructive lung disease and multiple intubations in recent months. The flu swab was negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and new right middle lobe pneumonia may contribute to persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure. Weaning off ventilation and using BiPAP could be challenging due to her severe obstructive lung disease and history of multiple intubations.

2. Infection: The patient has a history of pseudomonas pneumonia prior and is currently being treated with zosyn and vancomycin for hospital-acquired community-acquired pneumonia (HCAPNA). There is a risk of developing antibiotic-resistant infections, especially pseudomonas.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's use of steroids may contribute to hyperglycemia. Insulin therapy may be required to manage blood glucose levels.

4. Cardiovascular Disease: The patient has a history of CAD with a stable ejection fraction of 50-55%. It is important to continue medications such as Plavix, lisinopril, and statin to manage her cardiovascular condition.

5. Depression: The patient is stable on her home regimen of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of COPD and pulmonary hypertension who presented with shortness of breath, cough, and increased sputum production. She has been intubated in the emergency department due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of severe obstructive lung disease and multiple intubations in recent months. Her flu swab was negative. The current plan is to aggressively wean off ventilation to BiPAP, with a goal of maintaining hypercarbia in the 60s. She will continue on zosyn and vancomycin for hospital-acquired pneumonia, considering discontinuing vancomycin today as there are no gram-positive cocci in the sputum. Nebulizers will also be continued. Propofol will be used for sedation in hopes of extubating in the next day. She has several other medical conditions including hyperglycemia, coronary artery disease, depression, and renal failure. She is maintained on various medications for these conditions and has code status of full code. The patient's disposition is pending in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for several days, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Proper infection control measures and surveillance are essential to prevent this complication.
2. Barotrauma: Due to the patient's severe obstructive lung disease and history of multiple intubations, there"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary hypertension, presenting with shortness of breath, cough, and increased sputum production. She is currently intubated in the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. Her recent medical history includes multiple intubations, severe obstructive lung disease, and a previous pneumonia caused by pseudomonas. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing sinus tachycardia. Her blood gas analysis shows hypercarbia and acidosis. Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal sodium and potassium levels, and elevated bicarbonate level. The patient's sputum gram stain shows the presence of 2+ GNRs (gram-negative rods), and her flu swab is negative. The patient has a history of depression, stable on home regimen, and is currently on multiple medications for various conditions including COPD, hypertension, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Weaning from mechanical ventilation: The patient's attempt to wean off ventilation was unsuccessful due to hypercarbia and acidosis. She will be aggressively weaned to bipap and continue with nebs (nebulized treatments) to support her respiratory function.
2. Pseudomonas infection: The patient has a history of pseudomonas pneumonia, which can be a potential complication given the presence of GNRs"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of COPD and pulmonary hypertension who was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient also has a history of severe obstructive lung disease, multiple recent intubations, and a possible right middle lobe pneumonia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 155/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's physical examination shows a severely kyphotic spine, dry mucous membranes, clear oropharynx, supple neck, no jugular venous distention or lung abnormalities, and normal heart sounds. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal sodium, potassium, and glucose levels, and moderately elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed: The presence of trace blood from the orogastric tube suggests a possible upper GI bleed, which could be due to conditions such as gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. The patient is currently being managed with proton pump inhibitors and nasogastr"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary hypertension. She presented with shortness of breath, cough, and increased sputum production, leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation in the emergency department.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of severe obstructive lung disease and previous intubations. She is being aggressively weaned off ventilation to BiPAP. Medications include Solumedrol, Zosyn, nebulizers, and consideration for discontinuing Azithromycin if urine Legionella is negative. Follow-up on sputum cultures is planned.

2. Hypovolemia: The patient's pressures are stable, but urine output is decreasing. It is decided to hold intravenous fluids for now. After extubation, a consideration for IVF bolus for volume resuscitation to increase urine output will be made.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient is on steroids, which may contribute to hyperglycemia. Humalog insulin subcutaneously is being used for now.

4. CAD (Coronary Artery Disease): The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a last ejection fraction of 50-55%. There is no evidence of current ischemia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary hypertension. She presented with shortness of breath, cough, and increased sputum production, leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure and requiring intubation in the emergency department.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to her underlying severe obstructive lung disease and a new right middle lobe pneumonia. She has a history of multiple intubations in recent months, and a flu swab was negative.

The plan is to aggressively wean off ventilation and transition to bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) 8/4 at night. The patient will also be changed from intravenous solumedrol to oral prednisone, and zosyn will be continued for presumed pneumonia, considering her history of pseudomonal infections. Azithromycin will be discontinued, and follow-up chest x-rays will be scheduled.

The patient is also being treated for hypovolemia, as indicated by decreasing urine output. The recommendation is to encourage oral fluid intake and consider a bolus if mean arterial pressure (MAP) is less than 60 or urine output is less than 30 mL/day.

Additionally, the patient has hyperglycemia, which is believed to be related to steroid use. Humalog insulin will be administered subcutaneously for now.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation but was successfully extubated with good tolerance of nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemia and acute paroxysms of dyspnea, raising the possibility of right middle lobe (RML) pneumonia as a potential trigger. The plan includes continuing antibiotic therapy, moving to oral prednisone, and considering intermittent high-level support from [Hospital1] to relieve respiratory distress and potentially reduce the need for intubation.

Other medical conditions mentioned in the note include bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and impaired skin integrity. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is set to full code, and her current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of hypoxemia, progression of pneumonia, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential complications related to impaired skin integrity. Close monitoring and appropriate management are essential to address these potential complications and ensure the patient's well-being."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of COPD and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath, cough, and increased sputum production. She required intubation in the emergency department due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been doing well off the ventilator. Her current medications include fentanyl, methylprednisolone, prednisone, ciprofloxacin, nebulizers, and various other medications for chronic conditions such as CAD, depression, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a positive gram-negative rod (GNR) in her sputum, indicating a possible bacterial pneumonia. She is currently on antibiotics (Zosyn), but if she develops symptoms of pneumonia, such as increased fever, worsening cough, or increased sputum production, she may require additional interventions like bronchoscopy or changes in antibiotic therapy.

2. Hypovolemia: Although the patient's blood pressures are stable, there is concern for hypovolemia due to her poor oral intake and ongoing fluid losses. Close monitoring of her urine output and blood pressure will be necessary to ensure adequate hydration. If her mean arterial pressure (MAP) falls below 60 or her urine output is less than 30 mL/day, she may require fluid boluses.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, and diabetes. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing shortness of breath and has a low oxygen saturation level of 91% on a nasal cannula. She has been receiving various medications, including fentanyl for pain management, methylprednisolone, and antibiotics for the pneumonia. The patient's fluid balance shows an overall positive balance of 1,029 mL. Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. She has impaired skin integrity and is at risk for developing pressure ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation level and history of COPD put her at risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and possible adjustment of oxygen therapy may be necessary.
2. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient still has a positive Gram-negative rod in her sputum. This indicates that there may still be an ongoing infection, and the antibiotic regimen may need to be reassessed.
3. Fluid Overload: The positive fluid balance suggests the possibility of fluid overload. Careful monitoring of the patient's fluid intake and output is essential to prevent further fluid accumulation and potential complications such as pulmonary edema.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and suspected Legionella infection. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. The patient's pain is controlled with fentanyl, and she is receiving antibiotics for her infections. Her vital signs are stable, but she has an increased heart rate and low oxygen saturation. Fluid balance shows an overall positive balance of 1,029 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.3 K/uL, elevated glucose levels, and normal kidney function. Imaging tests reveal no evidence of Legionella infection or influenza viruses. The patient's urine culture is negative, and her blood cultures have no growth so far. She is on mechanical ventilation and has multiple IV lines. The patient's pain, pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, and glycemic control need to be addressed. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is unknown.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which indicates respiratory failure or severe pneumonia. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Infection: Despite receiving antibiotics, the patient may still be at risk of developing new infections or experiencing a worsening of current infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
3. Skin breakdown"

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of COPD and pulmonary hypertension who presents with shortness of breath, cough, and increased sputum production. She has been intubated in the emergency department due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and new right middle lobe pneumonia contribute to her respiratory failure. She has a history of severe obstructive lung disease and multiple recent intubations. Flu swab is negative. The plan is to aggressively wean off ventilation to BiPAP 8/4 qhs, change IV solumedrol to oral prednisone, continue zosyn for presumed pneumonia, discontinue azithromycin, and follow up with sputum cultures. Nebulizers will be continued.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient's pressures are stable, but her urine output is decreasing. She may be dry. Encourage oral fluid intake and consider bolus if mean arterial pressure (MAP) is less than 60 or urine output is less than 30 mL/day.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is likely due to steroids. Humalog insulin will be administered subcutaneously.

   requiring intubation in ED
   .
   # COPD:  Severe. Has had multiple intubations in recent months. Flu
   swab neg. Currently doing well off of ventilator.
   - Continue prednisone. Taper to 40mg over next few days, then slow
   taper over several weeks.
   - Initially suspected to have RLL. GNR noted in sputum gram stain,
   although sputum culture without significant growth. Was initially on
   Zosyn, and transitioned to levofloxacin on [**2206-5-5**]. Clinically does not
   appear to have a pneumonia, although may have bronchitis.
   - Continue nebs
   - COPD regimen optimized
 includes montelukast, salmeterol, titropium,
   and short-acting bronchodilators
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  Likely [**12-30**] steroids. Requiring little Humalog sliding
   scale coverage. Expect blood glucose to quickly normalize as steroids
   are tapered.
   .
   # CAD:  Stable, last EF 50-55%. No evidence of current ischemia.
   - Cont plavix, lisinopril, statin per home regimen
   .
   # Gastritis:  Was on PPI previously. Given that she is also on Plavix,
   transitioned to H2 blocker.
   .
   # Depression:  Stable on home regimen.
   - Cont nortriptyline, paroxetine
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Persistent. No other indications of substance
   withdrawal. Initially suspected to have MAT, but appears to be in sinus
   tachycardia on most recent EKG. Denies pain. Did have discomfort in
   abdomen after eating desert last evening.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with severe COPD, pulmonary hypertension, and a history of multiple intubations. She was admitted with shortness of breath, cough, and increased sputum production, leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation in the emergency department. She is currently weaned off the ventilator.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient initially had a suspected right lower lobe pneumonia with Gram-negative rods noted in the sputum gram stain. However, the sputum culture did not show significant growth, and she is clinically doing well without signs of pneumonia. She has been transitioned from Zosyn to levofloxacin.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient likely developed hyperglycemia due to the use of corticosteroids. Her blood glucose levels were elevated, but she only required a minimal amount of Humalog sliding scale coverage, and it is expected that her blood glucose will normalize as the steroids are tapered.
3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has stable CAD with an ejection fraction of 50-55%. She is continuing her home regimen of Plavix, lisinopril, and a statin.
4. Gastritis: The patient was previously on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) but was transitioned to an H2 blocker due to being on Plavix.
5. Depression: The patient is stable on her home"

   - Continue O2 as needed.
   - COPD regimen optimized
 includes montelukast, salmeterol, titropium,
   and short-acting bronchodilators
   # Hyperglycemia:  Likely [**12-30**] steroids. Requiring little Humalog sliding

   # Depression:  Stable on home regimen.
   - Cont nortriptyline, paroxetine
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Persistent. No other indications of substance
   withdrawal. Initially suspected to have MAT, but appears to be in sinus
   tachycardia on most recent EKG. Denies pain. Did have discomfort in
   abdomen after eating dessert last evening.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with severe COPD, pulmonary hypertension, and a history of multiple intubations. She was admitted with shortness of breath, cough, and increased sputum production, resulting in hypercarbic respiratory failure that required intubation in the emergency department. She has shown improvement and is now off the ventilator.

The patient's medical history includes severe COPD, with optimization of her COPD regimen including montelukast, salmeterol, tiotropium, and short-acting bronchodilators. She also has hyperglycemia likely due to steroid use, stable coronary artery disease with an ejection fraction of 50-55%, gastritis, and depression.

The patient's current medications include prednisone, levofloxacin, Spiriva, and salmeterol. She is also on a regimen of medications for her CAD, depression, and gastritis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient has been diagnosed with CAP based on symptoms and sputum gram stain showing Gram-negative rods. She is being treated with levofloxacin for a 7-day course.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be at risk due to her severe COPD and potential immobility.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia likely due to steroid use. Close monitoring"

   and increased sputum production with hypercarbic respiratory failure
   requiring intubation in ED
   .
   # COPD:  Severe. Has had multiple intubations in recent months. Flu
   swab neg. Currently doing well off of ventilator.
   - Continue prednisone. Taper to 40mg over next few days, then slow
   taper over several weeks.
   - Initially suspected to have RLL. GNR noted in sputum gram stain,
   although sputum culture without significant growth. Was initially on
   Zosyn, and transitioned to levofloxacin on [**2206-5-5**]. Clinically does not
   appear to have a pneumonia, although may have bronchitis.
   - Continue nebs
   - COPD regimen optimized
 includes montelukast, salmeterol, titropium,
   and short-acting bronchodilators
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  Likely [**12-30**] steroids. Requiring little Humalog sliding
   scale coverage. Expect blood glucose to quickly normalize as steroids
   are tapered.
   .
   # CAD:  Stable, last EF 50-55%. No evidence of current ischemia.
   - Cont plavix, lisinopril, statin per home regimen
   .
   # Gastritis:  Was on PPI previously. Given that she is also on Plavix,
   transitioned to H2 blocker.
   .
   # Depression:  Stable on home regimen.
   - Cont nortriptyline, paroxetine
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Persistent. No other indications of substance
   withdrawal. Initially suspected to have MAT, but appears to be in sinus
   tachycardia on most recent EKG. Denies pain. Did have discomfort in
   abdomen after eating desert last evening.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with severe COPD, pulmonary hypertension, and a history of multiple intubations in recent months. She was admitted with shortness of breath, cough, and increased sputum production. The patient required intubation in the emergency department and was initially suspected to have right lower lobe pneumonia. However, she is now doing well off the ventilator and does not appear to have pneumonia, although she may have bronchitis. Her vital signs are stable, and her respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen with a SpO2 of 97%. 

The patient's allergies include tetracyclines, and her last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin, azithromycin, and piperacillin. She has been started on Spiriva and salmeterol, and her prednisone taper has been adjusted from 60mg PO daily to 50mg PO daily. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for vague complaints of heaviness to the stomach after eating ice cream. The patient denies chest pain, palpitations, or increased shortness of breath. There is no numbness, tingling, or jaw pain. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and normal hemoglobin and creatinine levels. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, and her blood glucose levels have been fluctuating but are expected to normalize as steroids are tapered."
