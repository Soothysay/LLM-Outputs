   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo woman being transferred to MICU service for ongoing
   management of hypertension.  She is s/p coiling of R MCA aneurysm
   earlier this admission and has remained in the ICU on a labetolol gtt
   to maintain SBPs < 160.  Significant data include a persistent
   respiratory acidosis with a pCO2 in 50.  Torso CT yesterday with mod
   b/l pulmonary effusions and some evidence of volume overload.

Hypertension:
   -labetolol gtt in addition to ACE-I, ca channel blocker, and HCTZ
   -start transition to PO so can transition to the floor
   -clarify what target BP should be (no bleed prior to coiling)
Respiratory Acidosis:
   -looks like is chronic in nature
   -? underlying COPD
Cognition
   -AAOx3, clear

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with ongoing management of hypertension. She underwent coiling of a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm earlier during this admission. She has been in the ICU receiving labetalol infusion to maintain systolic blood pressures below 160 mmHg. The significant data include persistent respiratory acidosis with a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 50 and evidence of volume overload on torso CT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite receiving labetalol, an ACE inhibitor, a calcium channel blocker, and hydrochlorothiazide. The target blood pressure needs to be clarified, and a plan should be made to transition her to oral medications for long-term management on the floor.

2. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient has chronic respiratory acidosis with a high pCO2 level, indicating inadequate ventilation. This could be due to an underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

3. Cognition: The patient's cognitive status is clear and alert, as indicated by her ability to follow simple commands and respond to verbal stimuli.

4. Pulmonary Effusions: The torso CT showed moderate bilateral pulmonary effusions, which could be indicative of fluid overload or an underlying lung pathology. Further evaluation and treatment may be required to address this issue.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who was admitted to the ICU for ongoing management of her condition. She underwent coiling of a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm earlier in the admission and has been receiving labetalol infusion to maintain systolic blood pressures below 160 mmHg.

The patient's significant data include persistent respiratory acidosis with a high pCO2 level of 50 and evidence of volume overload as seen on torso CT scan. There are also findings of bilateral pulmonary effusions.

The assessment and plan include management of hypertension, respiratory acidosis, and cognition. For hypertension, the patient is currently on labetalol infusion in addition to ACE inhibitor, calcium channel blocker, and hydrochlorothiazide. It is planned to transition her to oral medication and eventually move her to the floor.

For respiratory acidosis, it is noted that the condition appears to be chronic in nature, possibly due to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Further evaluation is needed to confirm this.

Regarding cognition, the patient is alert, oriented to time, place, and person, with clear thinking.

The remainder of the issues is being managed by the ICU team.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include worsening hypertension, exacerbation of respiratory acidosis, and potential complications related to the presence of bilateral pulmonary effusions. These may include cardiac complications, pulmonary infection, or further fluid overload."

   # Right ICA aneurysm: s/p coiling [**2121-2-4**], repeat head CTA no bleed.
   - Neurosurgery to follow.
   - Goal SBP 140-160. Will discuss with Neurosurg.
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient has prior history. No current chest pain or
   headache to suggest emergency. Currently on multiple medications with
   labetolol drip and remains poorly controlled.
   - Increase Lisinopril to 40 mg qd
   - Change Metoprolol to Labetolol 100mg QID
   - Continue Felodipine 10 mg qd (maximum dose 20 mg qd)
   - Change HCTZ to Chlorthalidone 50mg Daily
   - Hold Labetolol gtt and assess Blood pressure on PO meds.
   - Goal SBP < 160. Clarify with Neurosurg how long patient needs strict
   blood pressure control
   .
   # Right parietal infarct: New, most likely secondary to coiling
   procedure. Patient has prior history of R pontine/caudate stroke with
   residual left sided weakness.
   - Continue ASA, plavix
   - Neurosurgery following.
   .
   # Hypercarbia: Patient was respiratory acidosis (hypercarbia) with
   metabolic compensation. Most likely has underlying COPD, questionable
   tobacco use. CT chest demonstrates effusion but no significant evidence
   of COPD.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Place on BiPap as needed
   - NEBs
   - Consider outpatient PFTs
   .
   # Anemia: Slow trend down 30->25. Now stable 23. CTA head and torso no
   bleed or hemorrhage. No other signs of bleeding. Pt with Hematuria
   which may contribute to some of this anemia.
   - Reticulocyte count, LDH, T. Bili, Haptoglobin
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac stool
   .
   # Thyroid Disorder: Low TSH and borderline T3/T4 consistent with sick
   euthyroid.
   - Discontinue leovthyroxine
   .
   # Urinary tract infection: Urine culture no growth.
   - Discontinue Ciprofloxacin.
   - Monitor and re-send if febrile or WBC elevated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of hypertension and a right internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm that was previously coiled. The patient has been transferred from the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for blood pressure management.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure of 166/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP mask. The patient is well-nourished, overweight/obese, and interactive.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, total carbon dioxide, glucose, and electrolytes. Imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray, are pending.

The assessment and plan include several conditions:

1. Right ICA aneurysm: The patient underwent coiling on [**2121-2-4**], and a repeat head CT angiography showed no bleed. Neurosurgery will follow up with the patient.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on multiple medications, including a labetalol drip, but remains poorly controlled. The plan is to increase Lisinopril to 40 mg daily, change Metoprol"

   Assessment and Plan: 65 y/o F PMH HTN with right ICA aneurysm s/p
   coiling by IR on [**2121-2-4**]. Patient is being transferred from SICU to
   MICU for blood pressure management.
   .
   # Right ICA aneurysm: s/p coiling [**2121-2-4**], repeat head CTA no bleed.
   - Neurosurgery to follow.
   - Goal SBP 140-160. Clarify with Neurosurg how long patient needs
   strict blood pressure control.
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient has prior history. No current chest pain or
   headache to suggest emergency. Currently on multiple medications with
   labetolol drip and remains poorly controlled.
   - Increase lisinopril to 40 mg qd
   - Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 75 mg TID uptitrate further if needed
   - Continue Felodipine 10 mg qd (maximum dose 20 mg qd)
   - Continue HCTZ 25 mg qd
   - Continue Labetalol drip overnight, attempt to wean in morning. Start
   with increasing lisinopril, consider increasing metoprolol further or
   switching to po labetalol if needed.
   - Discontinue Metoprolol IV prn
   - Goal SBP < 160. Clarify with Neurosurg how long patient needs strict
   blood pressure control
   .
   # Right parietal infarct: New, most likely secondary to coiling
   procedure. Patient has prior history of R pontine/caudate stroke with
   residual left sided weakness.
   - Continue ASA, plavix
   - Consult neurology in am. Confirm blood pressure control (whether with
   acute infarct BP needs to be > 140).
   .
   # Acid-Base status: Patient was respiratory acidosis (hypercarbia) with
   metabolic compensation. Most likely has underlying COPD, questionable
   tobacco use. CT chest demonstrates effusion but no significant evidence
   of COPD.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Place on BiPap as needed
   - NEBs
   - Consider outpatient PFTs
   .
   # Anemia: Slow trend down 30->25. Now stable 27.7. CTA head and torso
   no bleed or hemorrhage.
   - Active T&S
   - Guaiac stool
   .
   # Thyroid Disorder: Low TSH and borderline T3/T4 consistent with sick
   euthyroid.
   - Discontinue leovthyroxine
   .
   # Urinary tract infection: Urine culture no growth.
   - Discontinue Ciprofloxacin.
   - Monitor and re-send if febrile or WBC elevated

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of hypertension and a right internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm that underwent coiling on [**2121-2-4**]. She is currently in the ICU for blood pressure management. The patient also has a history of right pontine/caudate stroke with residual left-sided weakness. She has been diagnosed with a right parietal infarct, most likely secondary to the coiling procedure. The patient's acid-base status shows respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation, likely due to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 27.7, which is stable. Her thyroid function tests indicate low TSH and borderline T3/T4 levels consistent with sick euthyroid syndrome. The patient has a negative urine culture, indicating no urinary tract infection. She has hypercholesterolemia and depression, both of which are not currently being treated. The patient is on multiple medications for blood pressure control, including labetalol, lisinopril, metoprolol, felodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains poorly controlled despite being on multiple medications. If blood pressure is not managed appropriately, it could lead to complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or myocardial infarction.
2. Right ICA"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female admitted to the MICU for ongoing management of hypertension. She underwent coiling of a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm earlier during this admission and has been in the ICU on a labetalol infusion to maintain systolic blood pressures (SBPs) below 160.

The significant findings include persistent respiratory acidosis with a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 50, indicating impaired ventilation. The patient also has evidence of volume overload, as shown by torso CT with moderate bilateral pulmonary effusions.

The plan includes continuing management of hypertension with additional medications such as ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient is also being transitioned to oral labetalol for potential transfer to the floor.

Further assessments and plans are recommended for respiratory acidosis, considering the possibility of chronic underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cognition, balance, gait, knowledge, transfers, and chest pain require evaluation by the ICU team.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypertension, hypertensive crisis or emergency, impaired ventilation leading to respiratory failure, and pulmonary edema due to volume overload.

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable with ongoing management of hypertension and monitoring for potential complications."

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypertension. She was admitted to the MICU for the management of hypertension following the coiling of a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm. The patient has a history of allergies to codeine and pruritis. She has been on various medications including label, heparin sodium, ciprofloxacin, and others.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
- Heart rate: 84 bpm (range: 66-90 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 157/62 mmHg (previous range: 136/51-169/73 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (range: 10-20 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 99% on nasal cannula
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms, which may indicate chronic respiratory acidosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic sleep apnea.

The patient's physical examination findings are generally unremarkable, except for right lower extremity edema, which is absent. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movements. However, muscle tone has"
