   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O ALCOHOL ABUSE
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 TRAUMA, S/P
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 46 year old male with a history of
   alcohol abuse and end stage liver disease who was admitted to the
   trauma serivce on [**2156-10-23**] after falling down the stairs in his home
   and suffering multiple fractures now transferred to the MICU service
   for management of end stage liver disease and altered mental status.
   Altered Mental Status:  Differential diagnosis includes primary
   neurologic processes related to his intracranial hemorrhage versus
   hepatitic encephalopathy in the setting of trauma.  Other potential
   etiologies to worsen known encephalopathy include infection and GI
   bleeding. Blood and urine cultures are pending.  No stool cultures
   sent.  No ascites on abdominal CT for paracentesis.
   - NGT in place for Lactulose currently getting, titrate to [**2-11**] stools
   per day per liver recs
   - Keep NPO and use NGT for all meds
   - Have started Rifaximin
   - Will get RUQ u/s this am but per OSH notes, has had persistent
   biliary tree duct dilatation, intra and extra hepatic
   - Will obtain MRCP once able to lay still
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - stool Cdiff pending
   - per neuro surgery will attempt to maintain SBP < 160, INR < 1.5, Plts
   > 80 in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage
   - appreciate neurosurgical consult
   End stage liver disease: Details unclear.  Secondary to alcohol abuse.
   Still drinking.  Unclear baseline hepatic function. Known history of
   ascites and encephalopathy.  Hepatology is following.
   - IV PPI
   - RUQ ultrasound today
   - holding diuretics
   - aggressive lactulose/rifaximin
   - aggressive control of coagulopathy given intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   Concern for GI Bleed: Was guaic positive and Hct trending down.  Recent
   stools are not bright red nor melenic. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   appears stable on repeat CT's.
   - Has 18g and 20g x2
   - Keep active T&S --> send new one today
   - Hct's [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for active bleeding or Hct <21
   - Try to maintain INR <1.5 and Plts >80 although will be difficult in
   liver pt
   Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia:  Patient intubated for airway
   protection.  Now breathing well on nasal cannula with evidence of new
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   - ceftriaxone/azithromycin for pneumonia, day [**1-17**]
   - consider broadening coverage if pt spikes fevers
   Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: Now stable on two subsequent CT scans.
   Neurosurgery is following.
   - continue dilantin for seizure prophylaxis
   - dilantin level in the AM
   - Q4H neurochecks
   - repeat head CT in AM
   - will target INR < 1.5, platelets > 80, SBP < 160
   Anemia/? DIC:  Patient with low haptoglobin, small schistocytes,
   elevated d-dimer, concerning for DIC although this is difficult to
   assess in patient's with liver disease. Patient also with grossly
   guaiac positive stools with negative NG lavage.
   - Send for manual smear
   - Q8H hematocrits, platelets, coags
   - will treat with platelets, FFP, PRBCs as necessary, as above
   - goals hct > 21, platelets > 80, INR < 1.5
    Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative.  Does not
   need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection.
   - local wound care
    Peripheral Arterial Disease: Dopplerable pulses.  Healing ulcer on
   right great toe which does not appear infected.
   - local wound care
   - consider vascular consult

 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 TRAUMA, S/P
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 46 year old male with a history of
   alcohol abuse and end stage liver disease who was admitted to the
   trauma serivce on [**2156-10-23**] after falling down the stairs in his home
   and suffering multiple fractures now transferred to the MICU service
   for management of end stage liver disease and altered mental status.
   Altered Mental Status: DDx: primary neurologic processes related to his
   intracranial hemorrhage versus hepatitic encephalopathy due to trauma,
   infection, or GI bleed. Blood and urine cultures are pending.  No stool
   cultures sent.  No ascites on abdominal CT for paracentesis.
   - NGT in place for Lactulose currently getting, titrate to [**2-11**] stools
   per day per liver recs
   - Keep NPO and use NGT for all meds
   - Have started Rifaximin
   - Will get RUQ u/s this am but per OSH notes, has had persistent
   biliary tree duct dilatation, intra and extra hepatic
   - Will obtain MRCP once able to lay still
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - stool Cdiff pending
   - per neuro surgery will attempt to maintain SBP < 160, INR < 1.5, Plts
   > 80 in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage
   - appreciate neurosurgical consult
   End stage liver disease: Outside records without evidence of HepB or C
   infection, some autoimmune serologies negative as well. Thought now to
   be secondary to alcohol abuse.  Still drinking.  Unclear baseline
   hepatic function.
   - F/u with hepatology today
   - IV PPI
   - RUQ ultrasound today
   - holding diuretics
   - aggressive lactulose/rifaximin
   - aggressive control of coagulopathy given intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   Concern for GI Bleed: Was guaic positive and Hct trending down.  Recent
   stools are not bright red nor melenic. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   appears stable on repeat CT's.
   - Has 18g and 20g x2
   - Keep active T&S --> send new one today
   - Hct's [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for active bleeding or Hct <21
   - Try to maintain INR <1.5 and Plts >80 although will be difficult in
   liver pt
   Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia:  Patient intubated for airway
   protection.  Now breathing well on nasal cannula with evidence of new
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   - ceftriaxone/azithromycin for pneumonia, day [**1-17**]
   - consider broadening coverage if pt spikes fevers
   Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: Now stable on two subsequent CT scans.
   Neurosurgery is following.
   - continue dilantin for seizure prophylaxis
   - dilantin level in the AM
 needs to be followed up
   - Q4H neurochecks
   - repeat head CT in AM
   - will target INR < 1.5, platelets > 80, SBP < 160
   Anemia/? DIC:  Patient with low haptoglobin, small schistocytes,
   elevated d-dimer, concerning for DIC although this is difficult to
   assess in patient's with liver disease. Patient also with grossly
   guaiac positive stools with negative NG lavage.
   - Send for manual smear
   - Q8H hematocrits, platelets, coags
   - will treat with platelets, FFP, PRBCs as necessary, as above
   - goals hct > 21, platelets > 80, INR < 1.5
    Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative.  Does not
   need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection.
   - local wound care
    Peripheral Arterial Disease: Dopplerable pulses.  Healing ulcer on
   right great toe which does not appear infected.
   - local wound care
   - consider vascular consult

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and end-stage liver disease. He was admitted to the trauma service after falling down the stairs and suffering multiple fractures. He is now in the MICU for management of end-stage liver disease and altered mental status.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, cirrhosis of the liver, trauma, and intracranial hemorrhage. He is also at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, and anemia/DIC.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient may have primary neurologic processes related to his intracranial hemorrhage or hepatitic encephalopathy due to trauma, infection, or GI bleed. Blood and urine cultures are pending.
- NGT in place for Lactulose currently getting, titrate to 2-11 stools per day per liver recs
- Keep NPO and use NGT for all meds
- Start Rifaximin
- Obtain RUQ u/s this am but per OSH notes, has had persistent biliary tree duct dilatation, intra and extra hepatic
- Will obtain MRCP once able to lay still
- Blood and urine cultures pending
- Stool Cdiff pending

2. End-stage liver disease: The patient's liver disease is likely secondary to alcohol abuse. He is still drinking, and his baseline hepatic function is unclear. F/u with hepatology"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and end-stage liver disease. He was admitted to the trauma service after falling down the stairs and suffering multiple fractures. The patient is currently in the MICU for management of end-stage liver disease and altered mental status. He has been intubated for airway protection and is breathing well on a nasal cannula. The patient's current concerns include altered mental status, respiratory failure, cirrhosis of the liver, trauma, and intracranial hemorrhage. He has been started on lactulose and rifaximin for hepatitic encephalopathy and will have an RUQ ultrasound today. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy. He has a history of peripheral arterial disease and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This can occur due to the patient's history of alcohol abuse and end-stage liver disease. It is characterized by altered mental status and can be exacerbated by factors such as infection or gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring, as he is intubated for airway protection and has evidence of new infiltrate on chest X-ray. Weaning off the ventilator and managing any underlying infection will be crucial.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has abnormal coagulation parameters, including prolonged PT/INR and low"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and end-stage liver disease. He was admitted to the trauma service after falling down the stairs and suffering multiple fractures. The patient is currently in the MICU for management of end-stage liver disease and altered mental status. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute cirrhosis of the liver, trauma, and altered mental status. He has a large ecchymosis on his left shoulder and back. His lungs have upper airway expiratory rhonchi. He has a 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border and along the apex. His abdomen is distended, hypertympanic, but not tender to palpation. Both lower extremities show pitting edema up to the knees.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 140/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His weight is currently 90.2 kg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated liver enzymes, prolonged coagulation profile, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging studies reveal evidence of portal hypertension, intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, and diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
