","The patient's progress note indicates that they have a history of myocardial infarction, chronic renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management. 

The vital signs show stable temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and there are no significant abnormalities in fluid balance.

In terms of respiratory support, the patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, with an ABG indicating normal oxygenation and ventilation.

The physical examination findings are incomplete due to the lack of assessment in several areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic response, movement, tone, etc.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The potassium and magnesium levels are low, while the calcium level is within the normal range. Other lab values, such as glucose, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests, are also provided.

The assessment and plan include the patient's medical history of myocardial infarction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, and chest pain. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is mentioned but not specified in the provided information.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 46 y/o man with ESRD on HD, type I DM, CAD s/p recent NSTEMI
   admitted with hematemesis now with altered mental status and hypoxia.
   # Altered mental status: Patient with improvement in mental status
   after given narcan on the floor and narcan gtt in the CCU. Last dose of
   morphine 4 mg given yesterday morning and nothing else given last
   night, though given improvement, it makes sense that this represents
   narcotics respiratory suppression. Given his multitude of other
   problems (prior PEA arrest with ? anoxic brain injury, ESRD, h/o
   seizure disorder, and recent sleep deprivation), his altered mental
   status is likely multifactorial in etiology. He appears to have
   [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations at present which could be secondary to prior
   anoxic brain injury though he is clearly off of his baseline. Other
   consideration is hypertensive encephalopathy given BPs 200s/90s but BP
   has been elevated since admission. The patient's CO2 on ABG was
   elevated at 60 with ph 7.32 but patient has had elevated CO2 on ABGS
   for past year. Likely that elevation in Co2 is [**12-20**] altered mental
   status but certainly could represent an element of CO2 narcosis. He
   does have a modestly elevated serum bicarb on baseline chem 7s which
   could be a sign of compensation for resp acidosis.
   - appreciate neurology input, will await final recs
   - eeg today --> continue dilantin (iv for now)
   - watch final head CT read
   - serum tox added on to this AM's labs negative
   - continue narcan gtt for now and monitor respiratory status closely,
   wean off as tolerated
   - if apnea continues consider noninvasive ventilation versus intubation
   - treat hypertension to goal BP today 160 systolic --> IV hydral &
   lopressor for now
   - could consider LP though concern for meningitis low due to
   improvement from other interventions
   - consider MRI for ? PRESS, evidence of CVA
   # Hypertension: BPs elevated to 200s/100s on arrival to the ICU. BPs
   - hydralazine 10 mg IV q6h prn for now
   - add IV lopressor 10 mg IV q8h (to substitute for PO lopressor)
   - goal SBP 160s
   - HD later today
   - resume losartan and convert back to metoprolol PO when taking POs
   # Positive blood culture: Patient with one positive blood culture, gram
   positive cocci in clusters, from [**10-12**] (prior to CVL placement).
   Received one dose of vancomycin yesterday and will be dialyzed today.
   - check vanc level today with HD per protocol
   - follow speciation of gram positive cocci
   - continue vancomycin until speciated
   - check blood culture from CVL today and in AM
   # Hematemesis: Patient presented with hematemesis with reportedly
   positive NG lavage. Was planned for EGD today but given current
   unstable situation, will hold off and discuss with GI for later this
   week.
   - appreciate GI recs
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - maintain active T&S, new T&S ordered for AM of [**10-15**]
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct (next this PM)
   # Chest pain with recent NSTEMI: Patient now not reporting chest pain
   but not responding appropriately to questions. Has had negative CKs
   during this admission with slightly elevated troponin (near recent
   baseline).
   - ekg in the AM
   - continue to monitor symptoms
   - cardiac enzymes X 1 more set this PM
   - holding aspirin given GI bleeding
   - continue beta blockade as able (IV while not taking POs)
   # ESRD on HD: Renal team is following.
   - HD today in CCU
   - reinitiate sevelamer, nephrocaps when able to take POs
   - watch lytes closely
   # Type I DM: Continue lantus with sliding scale humalog. Continue four
   times daily fingersticks.
   - hold reglan for gastroparesis for now
   # Hiccups: No hiccups apparent currently. No further baclofen given ?
   of sedation and ? lowering seizure threshold.
   # h/o seizures: Patient has had seizures in the past. On dilantin but
   recently subtherapeutic.
   - EEG today as above
   - hold baclofen
   - Neurology following
   - resume dilantin when able to safely take POs
   # FEN: NPO for now until mental status improves, lyte management per HD
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], pneumoboots, no heparin given GI bleeding, will resume
   bowel meds when taking POs
   # ACCESS: L IJ CVL (placed [**10-13**] at [**Hospital1 54**]), R AV fistula
   # CODE: presumed full (documented in H&P)
   # COMM: With patient and sister [**Name (NI) 3472**] ([**Name2 (NI) 3472**] is in [**Name (NI) 2222**] per
   the patient's cousin), hence ICU consent not signed yet
   # DISP: ICU care for now until more alert, less apnea

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), type I diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who recently experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was admitted with hematemesis, now showing improvement in mental status after administration of narcan. 

The patient's current assessment includes:

1. Altered mental status: The patient has shown improvement in mental status after given narcan. This could be due to narcotics respiratory suppression. Other factors contributing to the altered mental status include prior PEA arrest with possible anoxic brain injury, ESRD, history of seizure disorder, and recent sleep deprivation.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated since admission. Treatment includes the administration of hydralazine and lopressor to achieve a goal systolic blood pressure of 160s.

3. Positive blood culture: The patient has one positive blood culture showing gram-positive cocci in clusters. This was obtained prior to central venous line (CVL) placement. The patient received one dose of vancomycin yesterday and will undergo dialysis today. Further evaluation of the blood culture and speciation of gram-positive cocci is needed.

4. Hematemesis: The patient presented with hematemesis and a positive nasogastric (NG) lavage. An esophagogastrodu"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 46 y/o man with ESRD on HD, type I DM, CAD s/p recent NSTEMI,
   and Hx of anoxic encephalopathy post PEA arrest admitted with chest
   pain, hypertension, and hematemesis now transferred from the floor with
   altered mental status and hypoxia associated with apnea.
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology at this point.  Patient with
   improvement in mental status after given narcan on the floor and narcan
   gtt in the CCU but unclear if this was coincidental as patient had no
   change when drip was d/c. Given his multitude of other problems (prior
   PEA arrest with anoxic brain injury, ESRD, h/o seizure disorder, and
   recent sleep deprivation), his altered mental status is likely
   multifactorial in etiology. He appears to have [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**]
   respirations at present which could be secondary to prior anoxic brain
   injury though he is clearly off of his baseline according to residents
   who have seen him in clinic recently (since NSTEMI and PEA arrest).
   Other consideration is hypertensive encephalopathy/PRES given BPs
   200s/90s but BP has been elevated since admission. The patient's CO2 on
   ABG was elevated at 60 with ph 7.32 but patient has had elevated CO2 on
   ABGS for past year. Likely that elevation in Co2 is [**12-20**] altered mental
   status but certainly could represent an element of CO2 narcosis.  MRI
   w/prelim read of abnormality in the white matter diffusely and
   calcifications in the L globe but negative for PRES, temporal lobe
   enhancement, or CVA.  Re-loading with Dilantin currently per neuron
   recommendation.  Neuro note mentions EEG findings but unclear whether
   these are current EEG or previous EEG results.  Final head CT read is
   NAD.  Serum tox screen negative.
   - f/u neurology recs
   - LP today
   - continue Dilantin load per neur rec, will check with neurology
   regarding when to check levels, what dose to use for maintenance.
   - serum tox added on to this AM's labs negative
   - if apnea continues consider noninvasive ventilation versus intubation
   - treat hypertension to goal BP today 160 systolic --> IV hydral &
   lopressor for now (did not require hydral o/n)
   .
   # Hypertension: BPs elevated to 200s/100s on arrival to the ICU. BPs
   - d/c hydralazine 10 mg IV q6h PRN (not used)
   - continue IV lopressor 10 mg IV q8h (to substitute for PO lopressor)
   - goal SBP 160s
   - HD later tomorrow
   - resume losartan and convert back to metoprolol PO when taking POs
   .
   # Positive blood culture: Patient with one positive blood culture, gram
   positive cocci in clusters, from [**10-12**] (prior to CVL placement).
   Received one dose of vancomycin yesterday and will be dialyzed today.
   Likely contaminate as no other BCx have come back positive, patient is
   afebrile.
   -          d/c vanco
   -          follow BCx
   .
   # Hematemesis: Patient presented with hematemesis with reportedly
   positive NG lavage. Was planned for EGD today but given current
   unstable situation, will hold off and discuss with GI for later this
   week.
   - appreciate GI recs
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - maintain active T&S, new T&S ordered for AM of [**10-15**]
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct (next this PM)
   .
   # Chest pain with recent NSTEMI: Patient now not reporting chest pain
   but not responding appropriately to questions. Has had negative CKs
   during this admission with slightly elevated troponin (near recent
   baseline).  CE w/mildly elevated troponins, but at baseline for
   patient, likely due to CKD.  EKG w/non-specific changes. Should
   continue to consider cardiac etiology as patient has had reported
   episodes of NSTEMI with change in mental status in past.
   - continue to monitor symptoms
   - holding aspirin given GI bleeding
   - continue beta blockade as able (IV while not taking POs)
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal team is following.
   - HD tomorrow in CCU
   - reinitiate sevelamer, nephrocaps when able to take POs
   - watch lytes closely
   .
   # Type I DM: Continue lantus with sliding scale humalog. Continue four
   times daily fingersticks.
   - hold reglan for gastroparesis for now

","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, considering his recent PEA arrest with possible anoxic brain injury, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), history of seizure disorder, and recent sleep deprivation. The elevated CO2 levels on ABG may indicate CO2 narcosis or compensation for respiratory acidosis.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures have been elevated since admission, ranging from 200s/90s. Treatment with hydralazine and lopressor has been initiated to bring down the blood pressure to goal levels.

3. Positive blood culture: The patient has a positive blood culture showing gram-positive cocci in clusters, which could indicate a bacterial infection. Vancomycin therapy has been started, and further monitoring of blood cultures and vancomycin levels is necessary.

4. Hematemesis: The patient presented with hematemesis and a positive nasogastric lavage. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was planned but has been postponed due to the unstable situation. The patient is currently on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

5. Recent NSTEMI: The patient had a recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Although the patient is not currently reporting chest pain, cardiac enzymes should be monitored"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, admitted with hypertension and gastrointestinal bleeding. He experienced altered mental status and a code blue due to hypertension and apnea. The patient has been on various medications, including hydralazine, lorazepam, dilantin, and pantoprazole. His review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for increased crying, agitation, and not following commands. The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 173/66 mmHg, heart rate of 86 bpm, respiratory rate of 48 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery with an ABG result of 7.43/53/119/31/9. Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance without acute distress, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and absent left dorsalis pedis pulse. Neurologic examination shows the patient not assessed, crying, and saying he is screaming. Lab results show elevated creatinine and BUN levels, as well as low hemoglobin and potassium levels. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, altered mental status, chest pain, and hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels indicate ongoing renal dysfunction, which may lead to further deterioration of renal function"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 46 y/o man with ESRD on HD, type I DM, CAD s/p recent NSTEMI,
   and Hx of anoxic encephalopathy post PEA arrest admitted with chest
   pain, hypertension, and hematemesis now transferred from the floor with
   altered mental status and hypoxia associated with apnea.
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology at this point, though much
   improved after starting dialysis today.  Serum tox negative, LP neg, no
   evidence of infection (no fever, elevated WBC, or localizing source),
   MRI unchanged from prior.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been secondary to seizure or to
   some toxic/metabolic process or medication related.  Patient
   medication regimen has been greatly simplified.  He did have some
   periods of [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations with occasional desats, but
   recovered spontaneously.  Likely related to a central process and has
   improved with patient
s mental status.
   - f/u neurology recs
   - continue Dilantin 100 mg QAM, 100 mg Qnoon, and 200 mg QHS.
   .
   # Hypertension: BPs elevated to 200s/100s on arrival to the ICU. BPs
   much improved now in goal range of 160-180
   - switch to PO regimen of metoprolol 50 mg TID and losartan 50 mg daily
   .
   # Positive blood culture: Patient with one positive blood culture, gram
   positive cocci in clusters, from [**10-12**] (prior to CVL placement).
   Received one dose of vancomycin yesterday and will be dialyzed today.
   Likely contaminate as no other BCx have come back positive, patient is
   afebrile.  Vanco stopped [**10-15**].
   -          follow BCx
   .
   # Hematemesis: Patient presented with hematemesis with reportedly
   positive NG lavage. Was planned for EGD but held due to AMS.  Hct is
   stable.
   - appreciate GI recs
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - maintain active T&S, new T&S ordered for AM of [**10-15**]
   .
   # Chest pain with recent NSTEMI: Patient not reporting chest pain
   currently.  Has had negative CKs during this admission with slightly
   elevated troponin (near recent baseline).  CE w/mildly elevated
   troponins, but at baseline for patient, likely due to CKD.  EKG
   w/non-specific changes. Should continue to consider cardiac etiology as
   patient has had reported episodes of NSTEMI with change in mental
   status in past.
   - continue to monitor symptoms
   - holding aspirin given GI bleeding
   - continue beta blockade as able (IV while not taking POs)
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal team is following.
   - HD today in CCU
   - reinitiate sevelamer, nephrocaps
   - watch lytes closely
   .
   # Type I DM: Continue lantus with sliding scale humalog. Continue four
   times daily fingersticks.
   - hold reglan for gastroparesis for now
   .
   # Hiccups: No hiccups apparent currently. No further baclofen given ?
   of sedation and ? lowering seizure threshold.
   .
   # h/o seizures: Patient has had seizures in the past. On dilantin but
   recently subtherapeutic and was reloaded on [**10-15**].
   - hold baclofen
   - Neurology following
   - Dilantin as above
    .
   # FEN: resume renal/diabetic diet.   lyte management per HD
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], pneumoboots, no heparin given GI bleeding, will resume
   bowel meds when taking POs
   .
   # ACCESS: L IJ CVL (placed [**10-13**] at [**Hospital1 54**]), R AV fistula
   .
   # CODE: presumed full (documented in H&P)
   .
   # COMM: With patient and sister [**Name (NI) 3472**] ([**Name2 (NI) 3472**] is in [**Name (NI) 2222**] per

The patient is a 46-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), type I diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD) with a recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and a history of anoxic encephalopathy post Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) arrest. The patient was admitted with chest pain, hypertension, and hematemesis. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37°C (98.6°F)
- Heart rate: 75 bpm (69-92 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 185/76 mmHg (104-185/40-99 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 51 breaths per minute (8-74 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula

The patient has been intermittently agitated and somnolent with poor responsiveness. Lumbar puncture was performed, revealing no white blood cells (WBC) or red blood cells (RBC), with slightly elevated protein and glucose levels. The Gram stain was negative. The patient was previously on vancomycin but it was stopped due to being afebrile and no further cultures turning positive.

The patient has been started back on phenytoin for seizure control, with a"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 46 y/o man with ESRD on HD, type I DM, CAD s/p recent NSTEMI,
   and Hx of anoxic encephalopathy post PEA arrest admitted with chest
   pain, hypertension, and hematemesis now transferred from the floor with
   altered mental status and hypoxia associated with apnea.
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology at this point.  Patient with
   improvement in mental status after given narcan on the floor and narcan
   gtt in the CCU but unclear if this was coincidental as patient had no
   change when drip was d/c. Given his multitude of other problems (prior
   PEA arrest with anoxic brain injury, ESRD, h/o seizure disorder, and
   recent sleep deprivation), his altered mental status is likely
   multifactorial in etiology. He appears to have [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**]
   respirations at present which could be secondary to prior anoxic brain
   injury though he is clearly off of his baseline according to residents
   who have seen him in clinic recently (since NSTEMI and PEA arrest).
   Other consideration is hypertensive encephalopathy/PRES given BPs
   200s/90s but BP has been elevated since admission. The patient's CO2 on
   ABG was elevated at 60 with ph 7.32 but patient has had elevated CO2 on
   ABGS for past year. Likely that elevation in Co2 is [**12-20**] altered mental
   status but certainly could represent an element of CO2 narcosis.  MRI
   w/prelim read of abnormality in the white matter diffusely and
   calcifications in the L globe but negative for PRES, temporal lobe
   enhancement, or CVA.  Re-loading with Dilantin currently per neuron
   recommendation.  Neuro note mentions EEG findings but unclear whether
   these are current EEG or previous EEG results.  Final head CT read is
   NAD.  Serum tox screen negative.
   - f/u neurology recs
   - LP today
   - continue Dilantin load per neur rec, will check with neurology
   regarding when to check levels, what dose to use for maintenance.
   - serum tox added on to this AM's labs negative
   - if apnea continues consider noninvasive ventilation versus intubation
   - treat hypertension to goal BP today 160 systolic --> IV hydral &
   lopressor for now (did not require hydral o/n)
   .
   # Hypertension: BPs elevated to 200s/100s on arrival to the ICU. BPs
   - d/c hydralazine 10 mg IV q6h PRN (not used)
   - continue IV lopressor 10 mg IV q8h (to substitute for PO lopressor)
   - goal SBP 160s
   - HD later tomorrow
   - resume losartan and convert back to metoprolol PO when taking POs
   .
   # Positive blood culture: Patient with one positive blood culture, gram
   positive cocci in clusters, from [**10-12**] (prior to CVL placement).
   Received one dose of vancomycin yesterday and will be dialyzed today.
   Likely contaminate as no other BCx have come back positive, patient is
   afebrile.
   -          d/c vanco
   -          follow BCx
   .
   # Hematemesis: Patient presented with hematemesis with reportedly
   positive NG lavage. Was planned for EGD today but given current
   unstable situation, will hold off and discuss with GI for later this
   week.
   - appreciate GI recs
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - maintain active T&S, new T&S ordered for AM of [**10-15**]
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct (next this PM)
   .
   # Chest pain with recent NSTEMI: Patient now not reporting chest pain
   but not responding appropriately to questions. Has had negative CKs
   during this admission with slightly elevated troponin (near recent
   baseline).  CE w/mildly elevated troponins, but at baseline for
   patient, likely due to CKD.  EKG w/non-specific changes. Should
   continue to consider cardiac etiology as patient has had reported
   episodes of NSTEMI with change in mental status in past.
   - continue to monitor symptoms
   - holding aspirin given GI bleeding
   - continue beta blockade as able (IV while not taking POs)
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal team is following.
   - HD tomorrow in CCU
   - reinitiate sevelamer, nephrocaps when able to take POs
   - watch lytes closely
   .
   # Type I DM: Continue lantus with sliding scale humalog. Continue four
   times daily fingersticks.
   - hold reglan for gastroparesis for now
   .
   # Hiccups: No hiccups apparent currently. No further baclofen given ?
   of sedation and ? lowering seizure threshold.
   .
   # h/o seizures: Patient has had seizures in the past. On dilantin but
   recently subtherapeutic.
   - EEG today as above
   - hold baclofen
   - Neurology following
   - Dilantin as above
    .
   # FEN: NPO for now until mental status improves, lyte management per HD
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], pneumoboots, no heparin given GI bleeding, will resume
   bowel meds when taking POs
   .
   # ACCESS: L IJ CVL (placed [**10-13**] at [**Hospital1 54**]), R AV fistula
   .
   # CODE: presumed full (documented in H&P)
   .
   # COMM: With patient and sister [**Name (NI) 3472**] ([**Name2 (NI) 3472**] is in [**Name (NI) 2222**] per
   the patient's cousin), hence ICU consent not signed yet
   .
   # DISP: ICU care for now until more alert, less apnea

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old man with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD) with a recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and a history of anoxic encephalopathy post-cardiac arrest. He presents with altered mental status, hypoxia, and apnea, and has multiple comorbidities that contribute to his current condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Encephalopathy/PRES: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated since admission, and there are concerns about hypertensive encephalopathy or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). However, MRI results are negative for PRES.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture showing gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a potential bacterial infection. He received one dose of vancomycin but will be dialyzed today. It is likely a contaminant as no other blood cultures have been positive, and the patient is afebrile.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient presented with hematemesis and reportedly positive nasogastric (NG) lavage. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was planned but has been postponed due to the patient's unstable condition.
4. Chest Pain and Recent NSTEMI: The patient had a recent NSTEMI"

","Summary:
The patient underwent a lumbar puncture and CSF culture. They were found to be agitated and poorly responsive afterward. The lumbar puncture results showed negative WBC and RBC, slightly elevated protein and glucose levels, and a negative Gram stain. MRI findings indicated diffuse white matter changes that could be associated with HIV disease, as well as calcifications in the left globe that could be related to cytomegalovirus (CMV). The patient is afebrile and no longer on vancomycin. Their healthcare team decided to start them back on the 100/100/200 dosing regimen of phenytoin, correcting their level which was initially measured at [**insert measurement**]. The patient has allergies to sevoflurane, PEA arrest, and unknown allergens. They are currently receiving pantoprazole, dilantin, and metoprolol. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for new symptoms mentioned below. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 75 bpm (69-92 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 104/40 mmHg to 185/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 51 breaths per minute (8-74 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 58.3 kg and their fluid balance shows a total input of 28"
