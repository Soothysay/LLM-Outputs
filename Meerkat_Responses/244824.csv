   24 Hour Events:
 PICC LINE - START [**2196-1-28**] 11:01 AM
   HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: The patient is an 86y/o F with a PMH of
   CAD s/p CABG 86F with CAD s/p CABG [**10/2189**] (SVG-OM, LIMA-LAD), AS s/p
   valvuloplasty [**11-3**], diastolic CHF, AF on coumadin, s/p R colectomy
   [**12-6**] admitted with generalized tonic clonic seizure now transferred to
   the CCU for management of AF w/ RVR and pulmonary edema. Her recent
   past medical history inculdes an admission [**11-3**] for a history of
   worsening DOE with AS with valve area of 0.56cm2. She underwent
   valvuloplasty with subsequent diameter of 0.98cm2. Her course was
   complicated by LGI bleed and on colonoscopy a precancerous 2cm cecal
   polyp was found. She was then admitted from 1/11-20/10 for right
   hemicolectomy. Low-grade T2N0M0 well or moderately
   differentiatedadenocarcinoma. Her hospital course ([**2195-12-7**]- [**2195-12-16**])
   was complicated by hypercarbia requiring intubation and fluid overload
   requiring diuresis. Subsequent to this she developed C.
   difficile colitis, for which she has been on PO vancomycin since;
   she continued to complain of abdominal pain, with fevers post op
   and had a CT in [**2195-12-28**], that revealed slight increased fat
   stranding in the region of the sigmoid colon at sites of diverticula,
   representing a mild case of uncomplicated diverticulitis.
   .
   The patient was admitted on [**1-26**] to Neurology service after tonic clonic
   seizure activity which resolved spontaneously. Her daughter and husband
   were visiting her and they noticed a self-limitted 5 minutes seizure,
   described as acute onset of LOC, followed by whole body stiffens and
   later shaking. She was brought to the [**Hospital1 54**] ED, and during her
   observation in the ED she another 30 seconds GTC seizure. To stop the
   cluster she received Ativan IV and later she was loaded with 1000mg of
   IV Keppra. No further seizures in the ED. She was admitted to the Neuro
   ICU for further management. She was initially treated with broad
   spectrum abx including vancomycin/cipro/bactrim and acyclovir for
   concern for meningitis/encephalitis. These were stopped after approx 24
   hours. LP was not pursued given elevated INR on coumadin. CTA negative
   for CVA. She had no further seizure activity. MRI head demonstrated a
   focal area with high signal intensity in the right superior parietal
   lobule.
   .
   On evening of [**1-28**] the patient triggered for altered mental status and
   lethargy following head MRI. O2 sat found to be 84% and HR 130s, SBPs
   in 80s. Lasix 10mg IV given with no improvement. ABG 7.32/65/89/35.
   MICU consult was called and an additional 30mg IV lasix given with
   metoprolol 5mg IV. AMS felt most likely secondary to ativan given for
   head MRI. Repeat ABG this am 7.35/63/72/36. Given continued tachypnea
   and hypoxia requiring 4-5L NC, the patient was transferred to the CCU
   for further managment. Temp spiked to 101 and cultures sent.

   LABS/STUDIES
   EKG: [**2196-1-26**] in afib with rate varying between 100-150, nl axis. LVH:
   biphasic T waves in I, aVL. No waves seen.
   .
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2196-1-27**] - The left atrium is dilated. There is
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity
   size is normal. There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
   obstruction. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
   Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-12-29**], a mild
   left ventricular outflow gradient is now detected.
   .
   CARDIAC CATH: [**2195-11-5**] - COMMENTS: 1) Coronary angiography in this
   right dominant system demonstrated two vessel disease. The LMCA was
   heavily calcified and had a 50-60% stenosis. The LAD was calcified and
   had a proximal 70% stenosis. The LCx was calcified and had a proximal
   50% stenosis. The RCA had mild lunen irregularities.
   2) Arterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA to be widely patent.
   The SVG-OM1 had and 80% stenosis mid graft with TIMI 3 flow into the
   distal vessel.
   3) Resting hemodynamics revealed elvated right and left sided filling
   pressures with an RVEDP of 24 and LVEDP of 35mmHg. There was moderate
   to severe pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 68mmHg.
   The cardiac index was preserved at 3.26 l/min/m2. There was normal
   systemic arterial pressure with a BP of 136/73, mean 97mmHg.
   4) There was severe aortic stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of
   56mmHg and a calculated [**Location (un) **] of 0.56cm2. Following the Valvuloplasty the
   calculated [**Location (un) **] improved to 0.98cm2.
   5) Successful Aortic ballon valvuloplasty with a 20mm Tyshak balloon.
   (see PTCA comments for details)
   6) Unsuccessful Preclose of right femoral arteriotomy site.
   7) Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with an 8
   French Angioseal.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Severe aortic stenosis with a calculated [**Location (un) **] 0.56cm2
   3. Diseased SVG to OMB for staged PCI.
   4. Successful aortic balloon valvuloplasty to [**Location (un) **] 0.98cm2 .
   5. Unsuccessful closure with a Pre-close device.
   6. Successful closure with an Angioseal device.
   .
   RADIOLOGY: CXR [**1-28**] - Unchanged cardiomegaly with increased opacity in
   the left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia versus atelectasis. There
   is a small left pleural effusion unchanged. Fractures of the sternal
   wires are known and unchanged with no migration evident. The prior
   noted interstitial edema has now improved. There is persistent
   prominence of the bilateral pulmonary vasculature.
   IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacification may represent atelectasis
   versus pneumonia. Recommend clinical correlation.
   .
   HEAD MRI [**2196-1-28**] - IMPRESSION: 1. Focal area with high signal intensity
   is demonstrated at the right superior parietal lobule, with no
   significant mass effect and may represent a chronic hemorrhagic area.
   2. Subcortical areas with high signal intensity are identified on T2
   and FLAIR sequences, likely consistent with chronic microvascular
   ischemic changes.
   3. Tortuosity of the basilar artery, consistent with dolichoectasia,
   previously described by CTA on [**2196-1-26**].
   .
   EEG [**2196-1-27**] - This is an abnormal routine EEG in the waking and sleeping
   states due to a mildly slow and disorganized background as well as
   focal mild right temporal slowing throughout the recording. This
   background is consistent with a mild encephalopathy with focal
   dysfunction in the right temporal region. There were no epileptiform
   features noted
   .
   CTA HEAD [**2196-1-26**] - 1. No acute infarction or hemorrhage.
   2. Severe atherosclerotic narrowing of the distal right vertebral
   artery and moderate-to-severe narrowing of both cavernous internal
   carotid arteries. Small focus of calcification in the Basilar A. close
   to ithe tip. Given the extent of disease in the dominant right
   vertebral artery, associated vertebrobasilar insufficiency cannot be
   excluded. Further evlauation with MRA Neck with Gado can be considered
   for temporal info regarding the direction of flow, if there is no
   contra-indication to MRI.
   3. Moderate microangiopathic ischemic white matter disease

   -Given AS pt very sensitive to fluid shifts, had been lying down for a
   long time at MRI and lasix was being held on floor to prevent cerebral
   hypoperfusion with subsequent flash.
   On arrival to ICU received IV lasix bolus 60mg IV and started on lasix
   drip.
   Continue lasix drip, titrating based on clinical appearance/respiratory
   status.

   elevated C02 of 63 on ABG, and low CO with CHF.
   Did have [**Doctor Last Name 11764**] on CTA and has new, subtle LUE/LLE weakness and no
   reflexes on LLE which is new per neuro consistent with lesion on right.
   This lesion is most likely vascular in nature, either a small infarct
   which converted to a bleed, versus less likely malignant ? metastatic
   colon cancer. Once medically stable neuro recommends MRI with
   gadolinium to asses lesion. If does not enhance, likely bleed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a significant medical history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CAD s/p CABG), atrial fibrillation (AFib) on coumadin, severe aortic stenosis post valvuloplasty (AS s/p valvuloplasty), chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), colon cancer post right hemicolectomy, chronic C. difficile colitis, and previous seizures. The patient presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and was admitted to the Neuro ICU for further management. She was initially treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and acyclovir for concern of meningitis or encephalitis. These were discontinued after 24 hours. Lumbar puncture was not performed due to elevated INR on coumadin. Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) was negative for cerebrovascular accident (CVA). An MRI of the head demonstrated a focal area with high signal intensity in the right superior parietal lobule, which may represent a chronic hemorrhagic area. Subcortical areas with high signal intensity were identified on T2 and FLAIR sequences, likely consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes. The patient also had tortuosity of the basilar artery, consistent with dolichoectasia. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed an abnormal routine EEG in"

   24 Hour Events:
 FEVER - 101.8
F - [**2196-1-29**] 10:00 PM
    Overnight events:
   Initially continued to be tachycardic in low 100s. Started on schedule
   of lopressor 15mg IV q4  with HR mostly in 90s in afib.
   AM CXR read as RLL collapse, stable Left pleural effusion, no PNA or
   CHF. Planned for CT chest ? etiology with DD lung collapse including
   aspiration, mucous plugging, pna, malignancy. Started to desat around
   5pm to mid 80s on 4% NC, improved on 40% shovel mask. ABG obtained at
   that time showed 7.42/51/51/34 from 7.35/63/72/36, more consistent with
   venous gas. Started on abx coverage for hospital acquired PNA with
   aspiration coverage with vanc/cefepime/flagyll. Continued to have low
   grade temp 99.8 then spiked temp around 9pm to 102, defervesced with
   tylenol and congested cough but unable to clear secretions for sputum
   cx. Continued to congestion on lung exam, although did not appear very
   uncomfortable, not using accessory muscles. 02 sat's improved on shovel

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures on [**2196-1-26**] who had MS
   change first noted following MRI. Pt was lying flat for some time
   during MRI following which she was noted to have MS change, and was
   subsequently febrile to 101 which altogether suggests an aspiration
   event. She subsequently had a CXR which showed RLL lung collapse which
   may have been secondary to mucous plugging following aspiration, vs [**12-29**]
   hospital acquired pneumonia, less likely malignancy and on CXR does not
   look like pneumothorax. Her Afib going into RVR appears to have been
   precipirated by missing some metoprolol doses while she was NPO with ?
   aspiration, and this could have  caused her to flash and at the same
   time her lasix was being held in order to allow for cerebral perfusion,
   but CXR was not consistent with acute pulm edema and her peripheral
   edema was more consistent with chronic CHF.
   .
   Afib: Pt in Afib with RVR on arrival. Had been NPO for some time on the
   floor, had been on p.o metoprolol on [**1-27**] am then changed to IV at 5-10
   Q4 on 3/3pm but didn't get any on [**1-28**] although written, ? [**12-29**] low SBPs.
   On arrival to floor received IV metoprolol 2.5 with improvement rate to
   80's from 128.
   Continue metoprolol IV 15mg Q4. Down titrate if HR allows, switch to
   p.o if pt becomes more alert, able to take p.o

   (SVG-OM, LIMA-LAD)
   -Given AS pt very sensitive to fluid shifts, had been lying down for a
   long time at MRI and lasix was being held on floor to prevent cerebral
   hypoperfusion with subsequent flash.
   On arrival to ICU received IV lasix bolus 60mg IV and started on lasix
   drip.
   Continue lasix drip, titrating based on clinical appearance/respiratory
   status.

   This lesion is most likely vascular in nature, either a small infarct

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and severe aortic stenosis (AS) who presented with new onset tonic-clonic seizures. She had been lying flat for some time during an MRI, which suggests an aspiration event. Her atrial fibrillation (Afib) was uncontrolled and she had missed some metoprolol doses while being NPO, which may have precipitated the seizure. She also had a chest X-ray showing right lower lobe lung collapse, stable left pleural effusion, no pneumonia or congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's respiratory distress could be due to aspiration pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. She had flash pulmonary edema, likely multifactorial in nature. She is on diuretics and digoxin, which will continue. The patient has severe AS, which is known to be critical but she is not a surgical candidate for aortic valve replacement (AVR). There are considerations for minimally invasive percutaneous valve replacement. The patient's mental status change is likely multifactorial and related to benzodiazepine pre-MRI, CO2 retention, and low cardiac output (CHF). She had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast and showed a new, subtle left upper and lower extremity weakness without reflexes on the left lower extremity. This lesion is most likely vascular in nature, either a small infarct which converted"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with decompensated Stage IV CHF admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis and superimposed sepsis, now intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure/airway protection. She has evidence of CHF with peripheral edema and crackles on lung exam. The patient continues to have a low-grade fever but no white count, swan numbers prior to DC arguing against current ongoing sepsis. No vegetation evidenced on TEE to suggest endocarditis. MRSA cultured from sputum, blood-vanc sensitive. Sparse growth proteus mirabilis from sputum sensitive to cefepime.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia, aspiration
2. Aortic stenosis
3. Seizure, without status epilepticus
4. Cardiogenic shock
5. Hypercarbic respiratory failure/airway protection
6. Sepsis (previously suspected but now less likely due to stable white blood cell count and swan numbers)
7. Endocarditis (no vegetation evidenced on TEE)
8. Renal failure (Cr stable at 1.0)
9. Metabolic alkalosis (ABG this morning showing)
10. Hypotension (holding lasix drip as was hypotensive to low 80s this am)
11. Hypokalemia (K of 2.9)
12. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff positive stool culture)
13. Hypothyroidism (Synthroid continued)
14. Elevated lactate (likely secondary to hypoperfusion)
15. Hypervolemic hyponatremia (resolved with Na 139)
16. Nasopharyngeal hydrocephalus and focal lesion in the left frontal bone (CT head showing extensive paranasal sinus disease,? NP hydrocephalus, small radiolucent focus in Left frontal bone)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of decompensated stage IV congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis with superimposed sepsis. She is currently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that require attention. These include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pneumonia, possibly aspiration-related, as indicated by crackles on lung examination and positive sputum cultures for MRSA and Proteus mirabilis.

2. Aortic stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, which may contribute to her heart failure symptoms.

3. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure episode, likely due to low potassium levels.

4. Coronaries: The patient has a chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery, and coronary artery disease is mentioned.

5. Rhythm: The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement and atrial fibrillation. She is currently in normal sinus rhythm but has frequent ectopy.

6. Renal function: The patient's renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure, who was admitted for inotropic-assisted diuresis and developed sepsis. She is currently intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and airway protection. The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, aortic stenosis, seizure, chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of aspiration pneumonia and is already receiving antibiotic therapy.
2. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which can lead to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and syncope.
3. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure episode, possibly due to low potassium levels.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has worsening renal function with elevated creatinine levels.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient is being treated for hypothyroidism with Synthroid.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with a chronic total occlusion in the proximal left anterior descending artery.
7. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's heart failure has led to cardiogenic shock, requiring inotropic support and diuretics.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has imbalances in potassium, sodium, and magnesium levels.

The patient's labs show worsening metabolic alkalosis, stable respiratory alkalosis, and an elevated lactate level likely secondary to hypoperfusion. She has a history of cardiomyopathy with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, and her ejection fraction (EF) is estimated at 55%. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is currently in sinus rhythm with frequent ectopy. She had an episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) overnight in the setting of low potassium levels. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease with a chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. She has allergies to penicillins, erythromycin base, ibuprofen, ampicillin, lactose, latex, and amiodarone. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F, blood pressure of 103/51 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is currently receiving multiple medications including furosemide, metoprolol, famotidine, and others. The patient has a history of dental problems and is recommended for oral surgery consultation. She is also recommended for tooth extraction due to poor dentition. The patient's recent tests and imaging show evidence of pneumonia, aspiration, aortic stenosis, and chronic total occlusion of the proximal LAD artery. The patient's discharge plan includes continued care in the CCU. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening CHF, sepsis, respiratory failure, pneumonia, and further cardiac events such as arrhythmias or VT."

    Overnight events:
   Initially continued to be tachycardic in low 100s. Started on schedule
   of lopressor 15mg IV q4  with HR mostly in 90s in afib.
   AM CXR read as RLL collapse, stable Left pleural effusion, no PNA or
   CHF. Planned for CT chest ? etiology with DD lung collapse including
   aspiration, mucous plugging, pna, malignancy. Started to desat around
   5pm to mid 80s on 4% NC, improved on 40% shovel mask. ABG obtained at
   that time showed 7.42/51/51/34 from 7.35/63/72/36, more consistent with
   venous gas. Started on abx coverage for hospital acquired PNA with
   aspiration coverage with vanc/cefepime/flagyll. Continued to have low
   grade temp 99.8 then spiked temp around 9pm to 102, defervesced with
   tylenol and congested cough but unable to clear secretions for sputum
   cx. Continued to congestion on lung exam, although did not appear very
   uncomfortable, not using accessory muscles. 02 sat's improved on shovel
   mask/suctioning, although intermittently desaturated, with multiple neb
   treatments, uptitration to 100% shovel mask by respiratory therapy with
   sat's in mid to low 90s. Repeat ABG was deferred given no contribution
   to management, management guided by clinical status. Initially held
   lasix drip but UOP started to drop off and BP's were in the one teens,
   although 02 sats at this point stable in the low 90s. Restarted lasix
   drip to run negative.

   .
   Afib: Pt in Afib with RVR on arrival. Had been NPO for some time on the
   floor, had been on p.o metoprolol on [**1-27**] am  then changed to IV at 5-10
   Q4 on 3/3pm but didn't get any on [**1-28**] although written, ? [**12-29**] low SBPs.
   On arrival to floor received IV metoprolol 2.5 with improvement rate to
   80's from 128.
   Uptitrated metoprolol to 15mg IV q4 (conversion 2.5:1 IV to p.o)
   -continue metoprolol IV.

   -am EKG.
   # Flash Pulmonary Edema: CAD s/p CABG  86F with CAD s/p CABG [**10/2189**]
   (SVG-OM, LIMA-LAD)
   -Given AS pt very sensitive to fluid shifts, had been lying down for a
   long time at MRI and lasix was being held on floor to prevent cerebral
   hypoperfusion with subsequent flash.
   On arrival to ICU received IV lasix bolus 60mg IV and started on lasix
   drip.
   Continue lasix drip, titrating based on clinical appearance/respiratory
   status.
   -On digoxin chronically, typically not preferred in setting of normal
   EF, will continue for now. Dig level 0.9 (range 0.9-2)
   -repeat ABG this pm
   -repeat CXR in am.
   .
   #AS:  AS s/p valvuloplasty [**11-3**].Severe AS on Echo [**2196-1-27**] with valve
   area not quantified but LVOT of 12 noted which was not noted on Echo of
   [**12-29**] but valve area of 0.8. EF stable at 60%.  AS known critical,
   unclear if worsened AS since [**Month (only) **] as valve area not quantified but known
   to be critical. Pt poor surgical candidate thus had not received AVR.
   -Consideration being given for minimally invasive percutaneous valve
   replacement.
   -f/u with ICU fellow/Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**]
   [**Name (STitle) 1658**] cautious diruesis in setting critical AS.

   #  MS Change: Likely multifactorial related to benzodiazepine pre MRI
   although only received 0.5mg, C02 retention [**12-29**] fatigue with mildly
   elevated C02 of 63 on ABG, and low CO with CHF.
   Did have [**Doctor Last Name 11764**] on CTA and has new, subtle LUE/LLE weakness and no
   reflexes on LLE which is new per neuro consistent with lesion on right.
   This lesion is most likely vascular in nature, either a small infarct
   which converted to a bleed, versus less likely malignant ? metastatic
   colon cancer. Once medically stable neuro recommends MRI with
   gadolinium to asses lesion. If does not enhance, likely bleed.
   -appreciate neuro recs

   -serial neuro exams.
   -keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
   -gentle diuresis
   -avoid benzos
   -follow resp status, serial ABGs.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation (AFib), severe aortic stenosis (AS) post valvuloplasty, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and colon adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes.

The patient presented with fever, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. She was initially found to have right lower lobe collapse with a stable left pleural effusion, but no signs of pneumonia or congestive heart failure. A CT chest is planned to determine the etiology of the lung collapse, including possibilities such as aspiration, mucus plugging, pneumonia, malignancy, or other causes.

The patient's oxygen saturation levels were in the mid-80s on room air and improved to the mid-90s on a non-rebreather mask. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 51, PaO2 of 73, and HCO3- of 34, which is more consistent with venous gas. The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia, including vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl.

The patient's temperature fluctuated between 99.8"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures  on [**2196-1-26**] who had MS
   change first noted following MRI, who subsequently flashed on the floor
   in the setting of holding lasix.
   .
   Afib: Pt in Afib with RVR on arrival. Had been NPO for some time on the
   floor, had been on p.o metoprolol on [**1-27**] am  then changed to IV at 5-10
   Q4 on 3/3pm but didn't get any on [**1-28**] although written, ? [**12-29**] low SBPs.
   On arrival to floor received IV metoprolol 2.5 with improvement rate to
   80's from 128.
   Uptitrated metoprolol to 15mg IV q4 (conversion 2.5:1 IV to p.o)
   -continue metoprolol IV.
   As becomes more alert, able to tolerate pills convert to p.o.
   -am EKG.
   # Flash Pulmonary Edema: CAD s/p CABG  86F with CAD s/p CABG [**10/2189**]
   (SVG-OM, LIMA-LAD)
   -Given AS pt very sensitive to fluid shifts, had been lying down for a
   long time at MRI and lasix was being held on floor to prevent cerebral
   hypoperfusion with subsequent flash.
   On arrival to ICU received IV lasix bolus 60mg IV and started on lasix
   drip.
   Continue lasix drip, titrating based on clinical appearance/respiratory
   status.
   -On digoxin chronically, typically not preferred in setting of normal
   EF, will continue for now. Dig level 0.9 (range 0.9-2)
   -repeat ABG this pm
   -repeat CXR in am.
   .
   #AS:  AS s/p valvuloplasty [**11-3**].Severe AS on Echo [**2196-1-27**] with valve
   area not quantified but LVOT of 12 noted which was not noted on Echo of
   [**12-29**] but valve area of 0.8. EF stable at 60%.  AS known critical,
   unclear if worsened AS since [**Month (only) **] as valve area not quantified but known
   to be critical. Pt poor surgical candidate thus had not received AVR.
   -Consideration being given for minimally invasive percutaneous valve
   replacement.
   -f/u with ICU fellow/Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**]
   [**Name (STitle) 1658**] cautious diruesis in setting critical AS.

   #  MS Change: Likely multifactorial related to benzodiazepine pre MRI
   although only received 0.5mg, C02 retention [**12-29**] fatigue with mildly
   elevated C02 of 63 on ABG, and low CO with CHF.
   Did have [**Doctor Last Name 11764**] on CTA and has new, subtle LUE/LLE weakness and no
   reflexes on LLE which is new per neuro consistent with lesion on right.
   This lesion is most likely vascular in nature, either a small infarct
   which converted to a bleed, versus less likely malignant ? metastatic
   colon cancer. Once medically stable neuro recommends MRI with
   gadolinium to asses lesion. If does not enhance, likely bleed.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and colon adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures on [2196-1-26] and had an MRI showing a change in mental status following the seizures. The patient is also experiencing flash pulmonary edema and has been diagnosed with severe AS, for which she underwent valvuloplasty but remains a poor surgical candidate for aortic valve replacement (AVR). She has chronic Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and has been on chronic suppression therapy with oral vancomycin. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, digoxin, and lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's flash pulmonary edema may worsen due to fluid overload or inadequate diuresis.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's pre-existing atrial fibrillation may continue to cause irregular heart rhythm and potential clot formation.
3. Severe Aortic Stenosis: The patient's severe AS may progress further, leading to decreased cardiac output and potential heart failure.
4. Colon Adenocarcinoma: The patient's underlying colon cancer may metastasize or cause additional complications.

   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures  on [**2196-1-26**] who had MS
   change first noted following MRI, who subsequently flashed on the floor
   in the setting of holding lasix.
   .
   Afib: Pt in Afib with RVR on arrival. Had been NPO for some time on the
   floor, had been on p.o metoprolol on [**1-27**] am  then changed to IV at 5-10
   Q4 on 3/3pm but didn't get any on [**1-28**] although written, ? [**12-29**] low SBPs.
   On arrival to floor received IV metoprolol 2.5 with improvement rate to
   80's from 128.
   Uptitrated metoprolol to 15mg IV q4 (conversion 2.5:1 IV to p.o)
   -continue metoprolol IV.

   -am EKG.
   # Flash Pulmonary Edema: CAD s/p CABG  86F with CAD s/p CABG [**10/2189**]
   (SVG-OM, LIMA-LAD)
   -Given AS pt very sensitive to fluid shifts, had been lying down for a
   long time at MRI and lasix was being held on floor to prevent cerebral
   hypoperfusion with subsequent flash.
   On arrival to ICU received IV lasix bolus 60mg IV and started on lasix
   drip.
   Continue lasix drip, titrating based on clinical appearance/respiratory
   status.
   -On digoxin chronically, typically not preferred in setting of normal
   EF, will continue for now. Dig level 0.9 (range 0.9-2)
   -repeat ABG this pm
   -repeat CXR in am.
   .
   #AS:  AS s/p valvuloplasty [**11-3**].Severe AS on Echo [**2196-1-27**] with valve
   area not quantified but LVOT of 12 noted which was not noted on Echo of
   [**12-29**] but valve area of 0.8. EF stable at 60%.  AS known critical,
   unclear if worsened AS since [**Month (only) **] as valve area not quantified but known
   to be critical. Pt poor surgical candidate thus had not received AVR.
   -Consideration being given for minimally invasive percutaneous valve
   replacement.

   although only received 0.5mg, C02 retention [**12-29**] fatigue with mildly
   elevated C02 of 63 on ABG, and low CO with CHF.
   Did have [**Doctor Last Name 11764**] on CTA and has new, subtle LUE/LLE weakness and no
   reflexes on LLE which is new per neuro consistent with lesion on right.
   This lesion is most likely vascular in nature, either a small infarct
   which converted to a bleed, versus less likely malignant ? metastatic
   colon cancer. Once medically stable neuro recommends MRI with
   gadolinium to asses lesion. If does not enhance, likely bleed.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation (Afib), severe aortic stenosis (AS) post valvuloplasty, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic Clostridium difficile (C. diff), admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures on [2196-1-26]. She had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subsequently flashed on the floor while being hypotensive. The patient is currently on multiple medications including metoprolol, digoxin, and lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash Pulmonary Edema: Due to CAD s/p CABG and severe AS, the patient is sensitive to fluid shifts. Flash pulmonary edema can occur due to rapid fluid administration or fluid overload.
2. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe AS which can lead to heart failure and sudden cardiac events if not managed properly.
3. Colonic Adenocarcinoma: The patient has a history of colonic adenocarcinoma, which may cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, or bowel obstruction.
4. Chronic C. diff: The patient has chronic C. diff infection, which can cause symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever.
5. Tonic-Clonic Seiz"

   pulmonary edema in the setting of having her diuretics held on
   admission.  She is currently on a lasix gtt.  Her respiratory status
   has improved greatly since transfer to the CCU.  ABG yesterday was
   stable with priors.
   - continue lasix drip, titrating as needed
   - consider repeat CXR today
   # Possibly Aspiration PNA: Pt noted to have a fever 2 nights ago.
   Afebrile overnight tonight without leukocytosis. Of note, however, MS
   change occurred in the setting of laying flat for an MRI and could
   represent an aspiration event.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation (Afib), severe aortic stenosis (AS), and colonic adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures on [2196-1-26], which occurred after a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient also had a change in mental status following the MRI, which could potentially be due to an aspiration event. 

The patient's respiratory status improved after being transferred to the critical care unit (CCU), and she is currently on a lasix drip to manage pulmonary edema. Her recent arterial blood gas (ABG) was stable with prior values. 

The patient is also being treated for possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA), and her white blood cell count and fever curves are being monitored. She is receiving vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole for now, but these antibiotics can be stopped if a chest X-ray does not show any new infiltrate.

The patient has been in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) upon arrival but has responded well to intravenous metoprolol and has now transitioned to oral metoprolol. Telemetry monitoring will continue to monitor her heart rhythm.

The patient's aortic stenosis is severe and has worsened since"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and also has severe aortic stenosis (AS). She presented with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures on 1/26 and was found to have multifactorial changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient's respiratory status has improved since transfer to the critical care unit (CCU). She has a history of chronic Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and is currently on suppression therapy with vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's history of severe AS and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) puts her at risk for pulmonary edema. She developed pulmonary edema when her diuretics were held on admission. She is currently on a lasix drip, which needs to be continued and titrated as needed.

2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient was in AFib with RVR upon arrival. She was given IV metoprolol to control her heart rate, and the dose was later increased to 15 mg IV q4. Metoprolol should be continued, and once the patient becomes more alert, she can be converted to oral medication.

3. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient experienced flash pulmonary edema due to lying down for a long time at the MRI and holding lasix. She received an IV lasix bolus of 60 mg and started on a lasix drip. This complication highlights the patient's sensitivity to fluid shifts.

4. Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has severe AS that has not been quantified since her valvuloplasty on 11/3. Her left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) was noted to be 12, which was not seen on the previous echo. The patient is a poor surgical candidate for aortic valve replacement (AVR) due to her critical AS. Minimally invasive percutaneous valve replacement is being considered. Frequent monitoring of her cardiac status is necessary.

5. MS Change: The patient likely has multifactorial changes in her mental status (MS) related to benzodiazepine use before the MRI, C02 retention, fatigue, and low cardiac output (CO) with CHF. These changes could be contributing to her disorientation and confusion.

6. Neurological Weakness: The patient has new, subtle left upper and lower extremity weakness and absent reflexes on the left lower extremity. This could be due to a vascular lesion, possibly a small infarct or bleed, or metastatic colon cancer. An MRI with gadolinium is recommended to assess the lesion. If it does not enhance, it is likely a bleed.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures  on [**2196-1-26**] who had MS
   change first noted following MRI, who subsequently flashed on the floor
   in the setting of holding lasix.
   # Pulmonary Edema: The patient has a history of severe AS and developed
   pulmonary edema in the setting of having her diuretics held on
   admission.  She is currently on a lasix gtt.  Her respiratory status
   has improved greatly since transfer to the CCU.  ABG yesterday was
   stable with priors.
   - continue lasix drip, titrating as needed
   - continue digoxin
   - consider repeat CXR today
   # Possibly Aspiration PNA: Pt noted to have a fever 2 nights ago.
   Afebrile overnight tonight without leukocytosis. Of note, however, MS
   change occurred in the setting of laying flat for an MRI and could
   represent an aspiration event.
   - continue vanc/cefepime/zosyn for now
   - trend WBC and fever curves
   - f/u micro data
   # Afib: Pt in Afib with RVR on arrival, in the setting of not receiving
   her metoprolol. Restarted on IV metoprolol on arrival to the CCU.  Now
   s/p transition to PO metprolol.
   - no episodes RVR overnight
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   # AS:  AS s/p valvuloplasty [**11-3**].Severe AS on Echo [**2196-1-27**].  AS known
   critical, unclear if worsened AS since [**Month (only) **] as valve area not quantified
   but known to be critical. Pt poor surgical candidate thus had not
   received AVR.
   - consideration being given for minimally invasive percutaneous valve
   replacement
   #  MS Change: Likely multifactorial related to benzodiazepine pre MRI
   although only received 0.5mg, C02 retention [**12-29**] fatigue with mildly
   elevated C02 of 63 on ABG, and low CO with CHF.   Did have [**Doctor Last Name 11764**] on
   CTA and has new, subtle LUE/LLE weakness and no reflexes on LLE which
   is new per neuro consistent with lesion on right. This lesion is most
   likely vascular in nature, either a small infarct which converted to a
   bleed, versus less likely malignant ? metastatic colon cancer. Once
   medically stable neuro recommends MRI with gadolinium to asses lesion.
   If does not enhance, likely bleed.  Also could be related to aspiration
   event.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She also has atrial fibrillation (Afib), severe aortic stenosis (AS), and colon adenocarcinoma. The patient was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures on [2196-1-26] after an MRI change was noted. She has been experiencing multiple medical complications since admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has severe AS and developed pulmonary edema when her diuretics were held. She is currently on a lasix drip and her respiratory status has improved since being transferred to the CCU. Further management includes continuing lasix, monitoring for any changes in respiratory status, and considering a repeat chest X-ray today.

2. Possible Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient had a fever two nights ago, which could indicate an aspiration event, especially considering she had an MS change while lying flat for an MRI. The patient is currently on antibiotics for pneumonia. Monitoring the WBC and fever curves, following up on microbiological data, and continuing the current antibiotic regimen are recommended.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (Afib): The patient was in Afib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) on arrival, possibly due to not receiving her metoprolol. She was restarted on IV metoprolol and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis post valvuloplasty, diastolic heart failure, and colon adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures on [2196-1-26], and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes were first noted following the seizure. The patient is also on chronic suppression therapy for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and has a history of diarrhea, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and flash pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient experienced new-onset tonic-clonic seizures, and there is a need for ongoing seizure prophylaxis.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may contribute to irregular heart rhythm and potential complications such as clot formation.
3. Severe Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which can lead to diastolic heart failure and flash pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of fluid balance and cautious diuresis are necessary.
4. C. difficile Infection: The patient is on chronic suppression therapy for C. difficile. It is important to monitor for any signs of recurrence or complications related to the infection.

   event, who subsequently went into afib and flashed on the floor in the
   setting of holding her metoprolol and  Lasix.
   # Pulmonary Edema: The patient has a history of severe AS and developed
   pulmonary edema in the setting of having her diuretics held on
   admission. Also noted to have RLL collapse on CXR Overall her
   respiratory status has improved greatly since transfer to the CCU
   initially requiring humidified face mask, now on 2L NC o/n. UOP has
   been guiding diuresis, goal had been set to diurese 500cc y,d with
   Lasix gtt uptitrated from 10- 20, running mostly even, over last few
   hours has now been negative ~200cc, now responding. Continues to need
   diuresis given respiratory exam, LE edema both of which improved and
   her renal function in tolerating diuresis. Unable to obtain sputum cx
   as pt cannot clear cough.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, and colonic adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures and MS change following an MRI, likely due to an aspiration event. She also has a history of chronic c.diff, pulmonary edema, possible aspiration pneumonia, and leg ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis and recent aspiration event, which increases her risk for developing aspiration pneumonia. She is currently being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating the possibility of hyperglycemia. However, there is no mention of diabetes or insulin use, so DKA is not confirmed.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is immobilized in the ICU, which increases her risk for developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as TEDS and out-of-bed ambulation are being taken.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient was initially on a ventilator and had an endotracheal tube inserted. This increases her risk for developing VAP. Antibiotic therapy and repeat chest X-rays are being used to monitor and treat this condition.
5. Atrial fibrillation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 80-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU due to aspiration pneumonia and sepsis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 99°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/55 to 145/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination shows mild anisocoria with right eye being more reactive, bilateral crackles in the lungs, and distal pulses that are 2+ on the lower extremities. Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented to person and place but disoriented to time. There is a new finding of left-sided weakness which has been stable. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 109 mg/dL, elevated creatinine at 1.2 mg/dL, and a troponin T level of 0.02. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has venous stasis ulcers with bandaging to mid-shin. This indicates poor circulation and compromised skin integrity, which can lead to further skin"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and colon adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures and MS change following an MRI. She had an aspiration event, developed pulmonary edema, and went into atrial fibrillation. She has a history of chronic C. diff and is currently on diuretics for diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a possible aspiration pneumonia due to her recent aspiration event and low-grade fever. She is currently being treated with antibiotics, but it is important to monitor her respiratory status and repeat chest X-ray.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, and she may be at risk for DKA. It is important to closely monitor her blood glucose levels and administer regular insulin as needed.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Due to her immobility in the ICU, the patient is at risk for developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as TEDS and out-of-bed ambulation should be continued.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): As the patient was on mechanical ventilation initially, she is at risk for developing VAP. Monitoring her respiratory status and repeating cultures are important.
5. Seizure: The patient had a"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic C.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures on [**2196-1-26**]. Patient had MS
   change first noted following MRI, likely having suffered an aspiration
   event, who subsequently went into Afib and flashed on the floor in the
   setting of holding her metoprolol and Lasix.
   # Volume overload: The patient has a history of severe AS and developed
   pulmonary edema in the setting of having her diuretics held on
   admission. Also noted to have RLL collapse on CXR. Overall her
   respiratory status has improved greatly since transfer to the CCU
   initially requiring humidified face mask, now on 2L NC o/n. UOP has
   been guiding diuresis, goal had been set to diurese 500cc. Initially
   required Lasix gtt for diuresis, but Lasix has now been transitioned to
   PO.
   -Wean 02 as tolerated (satting well on 2L)
   -lasix 60 mg PO daily
   -Continue atrovent nebs, with dextromorphan PRN cough
   -Goal net negative 500cc/day
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Possibly Aspiration PNA: Had fever to 101 on the evening of [**4-14**],
   but patient is now afebrile. Was pan cultured. UA showed pyuria. No
   positive culture data. Currently on vanc/cefepime/flagyl.
   -continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   -trend WBC and fever curves
   -f/u pending cultures
   # Afib: Pt in Afib with RVR on arrival, in the setting of not receiving
   her metoprolol. Restarted on IV metoprolol on arrival to the CCU.  Now
   s/p transition to PO metprolol.
   -continue PO metoprolol
   -continue to monitor on telemetry
   # AS:  AS s/p valvuloplasty [**11-3**].Severe AS on Echo [**2196-1-27**].  AS known
   critical, unclear if worsened AS since [**Month (only) **] as valve area not quantified
   but known to be critical. Pt poor surgical candidate thus had not
   received AVR.
   - consideration being given for minimally invasive percutaneous valve
   replacement once medically stable, although it is not clear that the
   patient will be a candidate for this.
   #  Altered mental status: Likely toxic/metabolic, although patient does
   have a focal lesion on head imaging.
   - ASA 81mg
   - f/u neuro recs
   - keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
   - avoid sedating meds
   - MRI when stable, per neuro recs
   # Seizure: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to focal lesion identified on MRI.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - further head imagingn per neuro recs
   # Hx Diarrhea: Hx C.diff on chronic suppression therapy with p.o
   vanc/flagyl with last cx at [**Hospital **] rehab on [**2196-1-15**] negative. At that
   time, antibiotics were continued. However diarrhea has stopped so abx
   stopped this hospitalization.
   - c.diff negative
   - continue to monitor
   # hx GI bleed: Hematocrit stable this morning
   - continue to trend hematocrit
   #Leg Ulcers: per wound care, ? if venous stasis vs. autoimmune
   - rheum consult following ICU stabilization
   #Dysphagia: Aspirated liquids and purees during speech and swallow
   evaluation.
   - tube feeds
   - speech and swallow to reevaluate later this week

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, and severe aortic stenosis who presented with new onset tonic-clonic seizures. The patient also has a history of chronic Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, colonic adenocarcinoma, and diastolic congestive heart failure.

The patient's current medical conditions include volume overload, possibly aspiration pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, altered mental status, and a focal lesion on head imaging. The patient has been experiencing dysphagia, leg ulcers, and a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

In terms of treatment, the patient is receiving tube feeds due to dysphagia, and her medications include metoprolol, Lasix, atrovent nebs, dextromethorphan, and ASA. She is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia and anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening of aortic stenosis, further seizures, development of pulmonary edema due to volume overload, and worsening of C. diff infection. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, cardiac function, and mental status. Additionally, the patient may require further"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, and colonic adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures and a change in mental status following an MRI, which revealed a possible aspiration event. She also has a history of chronic Clostridium difficile infection and was experiencing respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema in the setting of diuretic hold.

The patient's respiratory status has improved since being transferred to the CCU, where she required humidified face mask and is now on 2L NC oxygen. She is still requiring diuresis to manage her pulmonary edema and lower extremity edema. Her renal function is being monitored, and she is tolerating diuretic therapy. She continues to need diuretic support and will have a repeat chest X-ray today.

She is also being treated for possible aspiration pneumonia, with low-grade fever initially that has progressed to a temperature of 101°F overnight. She has been pan-cultured, and her urine analysis showed pyuria. She is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl, and consideration is being given to adding zosyn.

The patient was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response upon arrival but has been restarted on IV metoprolol and transitioned"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures and deteriorating mental status, aspiration
   pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and failure resulting in
   intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension requiring phenylephrine. Being
   transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting cardiologist.

   # Aortic Stenosis: Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU and appears very
   fluid overloaded on physical exam. Pt has not responded to IV lasix.
   - holding on further diuresis
   - continue to closely monitor volume status
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and
   digoxin.
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - coumadin was being held for ?supratherapeutic INR; INR subtherapeutic
   this AM; restart heparin gtt and coumadin
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - continue metoprolol as above
   - continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin and
   phenobarbitol.
   - continue phenytoin and Phenobarbital, adjusting per neuro recs
   - appreciate neuro recs

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 9565**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Had trach and PEG placed yesterday.
   Remains unreponsive.
   Continues with oliguric renal failure BUN 100 Cr 3.3.
   Mostly off pressors today.
   Medical Decision Making
   Prognosis terrible.
   Renal failure may be terminal event in near future.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff, and previous cardiac catheterization and angioplasty. The patient was admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures, subsequent flashing on the floor, and deterioration in mental status. The patient also has a history of aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure, hypotension requiring phenylephrine, and was previously intubated in the ICU due to respiratory acidosis and failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and appears very fluid overloaded on physical examination. She has not responded to IV lasix, and further diuresis is being held. Close monitoring of volume status is recommended.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has good control of heart rate on beta blockade and digoxin. Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID and digoxin 0.0625 mg daily should be continued. Heparin and coumadin should be restarted.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient is status post CABG. Metoprolol should be continued, along with aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has had seizures, loaded with dilant"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, and colonic adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures, deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure, and hypotension requiring phenylephrine. She is currently intubated in the ICU and appears to be fluid overloaded. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is already compromised due to aspiration pneumonia and intubation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if ventilatory support is not adequately managed.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and there is a risk of developing further acute renal failure due to inadequate fluid management.
3. Hypotension: The patient requires phenylephrine to maintain blood pressure, indicating potential cardiovascular instability. This may lead to complications such as organ hypoperfusion.
4. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and altered mental status, which could recur if antiepileptic medication levels are not appropriately maintained.
5. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, and fluid overload may exacerbate this condition, leading to hemodynamic compromise.
6. Infection: The patient has completed antibiotic courses for pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Monitoring for any signs of infection or fever is essential to prevent further"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures and deteriorating mental status, aspiration
   pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and failure resulting in
   intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension requiring phenylephrine. Being
   transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting cardiologist.
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU and appears very
   fluid overloaded on physical exam.
   - pt did not put out well to IV diuresis last night; will hold off on
   further diuresis or fluid at this time
   - continue to closely monitor volume status
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Per previous notes, pt has good control of HR on
   beta blockade and digoxin.
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - coumadin was being held for ?supratherapeutic INR; INR in therapeutic
   range this morning; can restart coumadin after trach
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - continue metoprolol as above
   - continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin and
   phenobarbitol.
   - continue phenytoin and phenobarbital
   - appreciate neuro recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, intubated with plans to trach pt on [**2-15**].
   - NPO p MN for trach
   - plan for trach placement tomorrow
   - will need FFP prior to trach [**12-29**] supratherapeutic INR
   - continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   .
   # Pressor Requirement: Etiology unclear.
   - need to investigate prior work-up
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Per previous notes, renal believes that this is
   ATN. Recommend to not diurese or give IVF's.
   - holding on further diuresis, as above
   - continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue synthroid 75 mcg daily
   .
   # Fevers: Per notes, pt completed vanc/cefepime 7 day course for
   pneumonia as well as 3 days course of abx for positive UA.
   - f/u cx data
   - follow fever curve
   - stool for c.diff

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures and deteriorating mental status, aspiration
   pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and failure resulting in
   intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension requiring phenylephrine. Being
   transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting cardiologist.
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU and appears very
   fluid overloaded on physical exam.
   - pt did not put out well to IV diuresis last night; will hold off on
   further diuresis or fluid at this time
   - continue to closely monitor volume status
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Per previous notes, pt has good control of HR on
   beta blockade and digoxin.
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - coumadin was being held for ?supratherapeutic INR; INR in therapeutic
   range this morning; can restart coumadin after trach
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - continue metoprolol as above
   - continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin and
   phenobarbitol.
   - continue phenytoin and phenobarbital
   - appreciate neuro recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, intubated with plans to trach pt on [**2-15**].
   - NPO p MN for trach
   - plan for trach placement tomorrow
   - will need FFP prior to trach [**12-29**] supratherapeutic INR
   - continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   .
   # Pressor Requirement: Etiology unclear.
   - need to investigate prior work-up
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Per previous notes, renal believes that this is
   ATN. Recommend to not diurese or give IVF's.
   - holding on further diuresis, as above
   - continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue synthroid 75 mcg daily
   .
   # Fevers: Per notes, pt completed vanc/cefepime 7 day course for
   pneumonia as well as 3 days course of abx for positive UA.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis post valvuloplasty, diastolic congestive heart failure, colonic adenocarcinoma, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures and subsequently flashed on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. The patient's course has been complicated by subclinical seizures, deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, acute renal failure, and hypotension requiring phenylephrine. She is being transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) at the request of the family and consulting cardiologist.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has known severe aortic stenosis that was previously treated with valvuloplasty. She is currently appearing very fluid overloaded on physical examination. Diuretics have been held off due to poor response, and further diuresis or fluid administration is being closely monitored.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has good control of her heart rate on beta-blocker (metoprolol) and digoxin. Metoprolol will be continued at 25 mg TID, digoxin at 0.0625 mg daily. Coumadin can be restarted after tracheost"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including renal failure, respiratory failure, pneumonia, aortic stenosis, and a history of seizures. The patient has undergone percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion. He is receiving various medications including phenylephrine, vecuronium, midazolam, famotidine, dilantin, metoprolol, fentanyl, and insulin sliding scale. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/56 to 150/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's renal function is impaired, and he has a knowledge deficit. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can be a complication due to his impaired swallowing and respiratory function.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support, indicating acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff, who was admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures. She had flash pulmonary edema when her lasix were held and underwent valvuloplasty in November 2011. The patient's condition has deteriorated, leading to respiratory acidosis, failure, intubation, acute renal failure, hypotension requiring phenylephrine, and altered mental status. She is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation and is being treated for various medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of respiratory parameters are essential to prevent further complications.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and it is believed to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of renal parameters and avoidance of further nephrotoxic agents are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Hypotension: The patient requires vasopressor support with phenylephrine to maintain blood pressure. Frequent monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and adjustments in the pressor regimen are required to prevent hypoperfusion and organ damage.
4. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and is on antiepileptic medications. Monitoring"

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient's severe aortic stenosis may lead to further deterioration in cardiac function, causing symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and syncope.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may result in an irregular heartbeat, which can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and CABG surgery puts her at risk for recurrent myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures and deteriorating mental status, aspiration
   pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and failure resulting in
   intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension requiring phenylephrine. Being
   transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting cardiologist.
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU and appears very
   fluid overloaded on physical exam. Pt has not responded to IV lasix.
   - holding on further diuresis
   - continue to closely monitor volume status
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and
   digoxin.
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - coumadin was being held for ?supratherapeutic INR; INR subtherapeutic
   this AM; restart heparin gtt and coumadin
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - continue metoprolol as above
   - continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin and
   phenobarbitol.
   - continue phenytoin and Phenobarbital, adjusting per neuro recs
   - appreciate neuro recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - trach in place
   - continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   .
   # Pressor Requirement: Able to wean down this morning.
   - will lower MAP goal to try to keep pt off of pressors
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Still worsening. Per previous notes, renal
   believes that this is ATN. Recommend to not diurese or give IVF's.
   - holding on further diuresis, as above
   - continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue synthroid 75 mcg daily
   .
   # Fevers: Per notes, pt completed vanc/cefepime 7 day course for
   pneumonia as well as 3 days course of abx for positive UA. Afebrile
   overnight.
   - f/u cx data
   - follow fever curve
   - stool for c.diff

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and colon adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures and deteriorating mental status. She has been experiencing subclinical seizures, aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure, hypotension requiring pressors, and respiratory acidosis leading to intubation. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and valvuloplasty for severe aortic stenosis. She is currently in the ICU with ongoing respiratory failure, altered mental status, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating severe respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and there is a risk of developing further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is deteriorating despite treatment, which may indicate the progression of underlying conditions such as colon adenocarcinoma or complications like sepsis.
4. Hypotension: The patient requires pressors to maintain blood pressure, indicating a risk of hypoperfusion and potential organ damage.
5. Seizures: The patient has a history"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/49 to 128/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 80%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and PS of 15 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium levels. The electrolyte imbalance may contribute to the patient's renal failure and other metabolic issues.

The patient's physical examination findings indicate the presence of atrial fibrillation, impaired peripheral pulses, and non-assessed neurologic status.

Based on the neurologist's recommendation, an EEG and lumbar puncture (LP) have been ordered to evaluate for potential infectious etiologies and watershed infarct. Additionally, the patient has been restarted on Coumadin at a low dose of 1 mg.

Considering the patient's complex medical condition, potential medical complications that can arise"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures and deteriorating mental status, aspiration
   pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and failure resulting in
   intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension requiring phenylephrine.
   Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting cardiologist.
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be
   severely fluid overloaded and oliguric. Does not respond well to lasix.
   - holding on further diuresis
   - continue to closely monitor volume status
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and
   digoxin. Coumadin was being held before for trach/PEG; restarted
   yesterday and INR went from 1.8 to 2.7.
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - stopping Coumadin at this time
   - will d/w neurology and rest of CCU team risks and benefits of
   Coumadin in this pt.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - continue metoprolol as above
   - continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin and
   phenobarbitol. Neuro not sure what is causing continued depressed
   mental status, states she is not having active seizures on EEG.
   - continue phenytoin and Phenobarbital, adjusting per neuro recs
   - appreciate neuro recs: recommending LP and MRI
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - trach in place
   - continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   .
   # Pressor Requirement: Etiology unclear.
   - will lower MAP goal to try to keep pt off of pressors
   - need to review what has been done to look for source of hypotension
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Still worsening. Per previous notes, renal
   believes that this is ATN. Recommend to not diurese or give IVF's.
   - holding on further diuresis, as above
   - continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue synthroid 75 mcg daily
   .
   # Fevers: Per notes, pt completed vanc/cefepime 7 day course for
   pneumonia as well as 3 days course of abx for positive UA. Afebrile
   overnight.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff, and previous CABG surgery. She was admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures and subsequently flashed on the floor. Her course has been complicated by subclinical seizures, deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure, and hypotension requiring pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and continues to be severely fluid overloaded and oliguric. She does not respond well to diuretics, so further diuresis is being held.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has good control of heart rate on beta blockade and digoxin. Coumadin was restarted, but INR increased to 2.7, so it is being stopped for now. The risks and benefits of continuing Coumadin need to be discussed with the neurology team.

3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient is status post CABG surgery. She should continue on metoprolol, aspirin, and atorvastatin as prescribed.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has had seizures, loaded with dilantin and ativan prior to admission. Despite a loading dose, she continued"

   continuous eeg placed
   - stopped coumadin today, as pt's INR went from 1.8 to 2.7 after
   getting 1 mg x 1 day yesterday
   - spoke with neuro: previous head bleed not an active issue and not
   likely causing pt's current symptoms; anticoagulation not likely a
   problem in the setting of this previous bleed; neuro does feel that
   there is a change in her exam (she lost her doll's eye reflex) and
   there is concern that there could be a pons lesion, therefore they are
   recommending MRI; they are also recommending LP to look for partially
   treated meningitis as possible cause for patient's AMS
   - per neuro recs, phenobarbital decreased to 45 mg [**Hospital1 **], gave 300 mg IV
   bolus of phenytoin and increased dose to 125 mg TID; ordered MRI; put
   in for daily dilantin level
   - spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**] and he felt we should try more diuresis; wrote

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures and deteriorating mental status, aspiration
   pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and failure resulting in
   intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension requiring phenylephrine.
   Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting cardiologist.
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be
   severely fluid overloaded and oliguric. Does not respond well to lasix.
   - attempt to diurese with Lasix 200 mg IV + Diuril 500 mg IV
   - monitor volume status
   - likely repeat valvuloplasty on Monday
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and
   digoxin. Coumadin was being held before for trach/PEG; restarted
   yesterday and INR went from 1.8 to 2.7.
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - holding Coumadin for possible procedure. INR currently therapeutic.
   Will need heparin gtt when subtherapeutic.
   - will d/w neurology and rest of CCU team risks and benefits of
   Coumadin in this pt
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - continue metoprolol as above
   - continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin and
   phenobarbitol. Neuro not sure what is causing continued depressed
   mental status, states she is not having active seizures on EEG.
   - continue phenytoin and Phenobarbital, adjusting per neuro recs: Will
   wean phenobarbital to 30 mg [**Hospital1 **] today
   - appreciate neuro recs: recommending LP and MRI
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - trach in place
   - continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   .
   # Pressor Requirement: Etiology unclear. Likely cardiogenic in setting
   of tight AS, but will need to consider sepsis if patient begins to
   spike fevers. Currently without fever or luekocytosis.
   - will lower MAP goal to 65 to try to keep pt off of pressors
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Still worsening. Per previous notes, renal
   believes that this is ATN. Recommend to not diurese or give IVF's.
   - holding on further diuresis, as above
   - continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue synthroid 75 mcg daily
   .
   # Fevers: Per notes, pt completed vanc/cefepime 7 day course for
   pneumonia as well as 3 days course of abx for positive UA. Afebrile
   overnight.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures and deteriorating mental status, aspiration
   pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and failure resulting in
   intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension requiring phenylephrine.
   Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting cardiologist.
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be
   severely fluid overloaded and oliguric. Does not respond well to lasix.
   - attempt to diurese with Lasix 200 mg IV + Diuril 500 mg IV
   - monitor volume status
   - likely repeat valvuloplasty on Monday
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and
   digoxin. Coumadin was being held before for trach/PEG; restarted
   yesterday and INR went from 1.8 to 2.7.
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - holding Coumadin for possible procedure. INR currently therapeutic.
   Will need heparin gtt when subtherapeutic.
   - will d/w neurology and rest of CCU team risks and benefits of
   Coumadin in this pt
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - continue metoprolol as above
   - continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin and
   phenobarbitol. Neuro not sure what is causing continued depressed
   mental status, states she is not having active seizures on EEG.
   - continue phenytoin and Phenobarbital, adjusting per neuro recs: Will
   wean phenobarbital to 30 mg [**Hospital1 **] today
   - appreciate neuro recs: recommending LP and MRI
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - trach in place
   - continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   .
   # Pressor Requirement: Etiology unclear. Likely cardiogenic in setting
   of tight AS, but will need to consider sepsis if patient begins to
   spike fevers. Currently without fever or luekocytosis.
   - will lower MAP goal to 65 to try to keep pt off of pressors
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine stable today. Per previous notes,
   renal believes that this is ATN. Recommend to not diurese or give
   IVF's.
   - will attempt diuresis with Lasix + metolozone, although this may not
   be successful
   - continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   .
   # Fevers: Per notes, pt completed vanc/cefepime 7 day course for
   pneumonia as well as 3 days course of abx for positive UA. Afebrile
   overnight.
   - f/u cx data
   - follow fever curve
   - stool for c.diff

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided physician resident progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation (Afib), severe aortic stenosis (AS) post valvuloplasty, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), colon adenocarcinoma, chronic Clostridium difficile (c.diff), and admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed:

1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and is scheduled for a repeat valvuloplasty on Monday. She continues to be severely fluid overloaded and oliguric, not responding well to Lasix. An attempt to diurese with Lasix and Diuril will be made, and her volume status will be closely monitored.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has good control of her heart rate on beta-blocker and digoxin. Coumadin was restarted yesterday, but her INR increased from 1.8 to 2.7. Coumadin will be held for a possible procedure, and heparin will be used when the INR is subtherapeutic.

3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient is post CABG. She will continue on metoprolol, aspirin, and atorvast"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EEG - At [**2196-2-17**] 11:30 AM
   continuous eeg placed
   - stopped coumadin today, as pt's INR went from 1.8 to 2.7 after
   getting 1 mg x 1 day yesterday
   - spoke with neuro: previous head bleed not an active issue and not
   likely causing pt's current symptoms; anticoagulation not likely a
   problem in the setting of this previous bleed; neuro does feel that
   there is a change in her exam (she lost her doll's eye reflex) and
   there is concern that there could be a pons lesion, therefore they are
   recommending MRI; they are also recommending LP to look for partially
   treated meningitis as possible cause for patient's AMS
   - per neuro recs, phenobarbital decreased to 45 mg [**Hospital1 **], gave 300 mg IV
   bolus of phenytoin and increased dose to 125 mg TID; ordered MRI; put
   in for daily dilantin level
   - spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**] and he felt we should try more diuresis; wrote
   for 120 mg IV lasix

   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures and deteriorating mental status, aspiration
   pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and failure resulting in
   intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension requiring phenylephrine.
   Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting cardiologist.
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be
   severely fluid overloaded and oliguric. Does not respond well to lasix.
   - holding on further diuresis
   - continue to closely monitor volume status
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and
   digoxin. Coumadin was being held before for trach/PEG; restarted
   yesterday and INR went from 1.8 to 2.7.
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - stopping Coumadin at this time
   - will d/w neurology and rest of CCU team risks and benefits of
   Coumadin in this pt.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - continue metoprolol as above
   - continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin and
   phenobarbitol. Neuro not sure what is causing continued depressed
   mental status, states she is not having active seizures on EEG.
   - continue phenytoin and Phenobarbital, adjusting per neuro recs
   - appreciate neuro recs: recommending LP and MRI
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - trach in place
   - continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   .
   # Pressor Requirement: Etiology unclear.
   - will lower MAP goal to try to keep pt off of pressors
   - need to review what has been done to look for source of hypotension
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Still worsening. Per previous notes, renal
   believes that this is ATN. Recommend to not diurese or give IVF's.
   - holding on further diuresis, as above
   - continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue synthroid 75 mcg daily
   .
   # Fevers: Per notes, pt completed vanc/cefepime 7 day course for
   pneumonia as well as 3 days course of abx for positive UA. Afebrile
   overnight.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p CABG, atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty, diastolic heart failure, colonic adenocarcinoma, chronic C. diff, admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. The patient's course has been complicated by subclinical seizures, deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, failure resulting in intubation, acute renal failure, hypotension requiring phenylephrine, and other medical conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and ongoing respiratory acidosis.
2. Acute renal failure, which is worsening and may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Seizures, both subclinical and tonic-clonic, indicating ongoing neurological issues that need to be addressed.
4. Hypotension requiring pressor support, suggesting possible cardiac dysfunction or other systemic issues.
5. Fluid overload and oliguria, indicating potential heart failure or kidney dysfunction.
6. Fever, which needs to be closely monitored for any signs of infection or sepsis.
7. Potential complications related to the tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation.

   plan for valvuloplasty on Monday.
   Pt received diuril 500mg X1, and lasix 200mg IV x1, with total UOP over
   24 hours of  373 cc, approx 15 cc/hr
   Seen by renal with assessment that she her kidney

   Her MRI was deferred to today, with phenobarb down titrated from 45mg
   [**Hospital1 **] to 30mg [**Hospital1 **]. Per neuro plan is to decrease dose by 15mg every 2
   days.
   LP being deferred until after MRI.
   Held heparin GTT y/d and held Coumadin as INR therapeutic then.
   -held Coumadin, did not start heparin gtt as INR was therapeutic; will

   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures and deteriorating mental status, aspiration
   pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and failure resulting in
   intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension requiring phenylephrine.
   Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting cardiologist.
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be
   severely fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive 28L Los. She does not
   respond well to lasix/diuril but is also not a candidate for HD. Given
   the extent of her volume overload, her organs are likely to be quite
   edematous, thus torsemide might be considered over lasix. Torsemide
   ([**Doctor Last Name 11979**]) can be given 10-20mg IV/day versus loading dose 20mg IV then drip
   5-20mg/hr.
   Metolazone only oral, thus not an option. Equivalence of torsemide to
   lasix ?
   - monitor volume status
   - likely repeat valvuloplasty on Monday
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and
   digoxin. Coumadin was being held before for trach/PEG; restarted
   yesterday and INR went from 1.8 to 2.7. Currently INR 1.9. will d/w
   neurology and rest of CCU team risks and benefits of Coumadin in this
   pt
   -Restart coumadin with heparin bridge. Valvuloplasty not until Monday.
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine stable today. Per previous notes,
   renal believes that this is ATN. Recommend to not diurese or give
   IVF's.
   - will attempt diuresis with Lasix + metolozone, although this may not
   be successful
   - continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin and
   phenobarbitol. Neuro not sure what is causing continued depressed
   mental status, states she is not having active seizures on EEG.
   - continue phenytoin and Phenobarbital, adjusting per neuro recs:
   Maintain at  phenobarbital at 30 mg [**Hospital1 **] today, decrease to 15mg [**Hospital1 **]
   tomorrow.
   - appreciate neuro recs: recommending LP and MRI
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - continue metoprolol as above
   - continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - trach in place
   - continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   .
   # Pressor Requirement: Etiology unclear. Likely cardiogenic in setting
   of tight AS, but will need to consider sepsis if patient begins to
   spike fevers. Currently without fever or luekocytosis.
   - MAP goal is 65 to try to keep pt off of pressors
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   .
   # Fevers: Afebrile x 5 days. Per notes, pt completed vanc/cefepime 7
   day course for pneumonia as well as 3 days course of abx for positive
   UA.
   - f/u cx data
   - follow fever curve
   - f/u stool for c.diff

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, and severe aortic stenosis. She was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures and subsequently flashed on the floor. The patient has been experiencing subclinical seizures and deteriorating mental status, leading to aspiration pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and failure requiring intubation. She also has acute renal failure, hypotension requiring phenylephrine, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has known severe aortic stenosis that was previously treated with valvuloplasty. However, she continues to be severely fluid overloaded and oliguric, with positive 28L Loss. This may indicate the need for further intervention or adjustment of diuretic therapy.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has good control of heart rate on beta-blocker and digoxin. Coumadin was previously held but restarted yesterday, resulting in an increased INR from 1.8 to 2.7. Currently, the INR is 1.9, and there is a plan to restart Coumadin with a heparin bridge.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, and renal failure is believed to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Diuresis with Las"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of aortic stenosis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, ineffective coping, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), impaired skin integrity, pneumonia (aspiration), aortic stenosis, and seizure without status epilepticus.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 109/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 368 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 200.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including diuresis with Diuril 500 mg IV and Lasix 20 mg IV, phenobarbital dose reduction, weaning of phenylephrine, holding Coumadin, and planning for valvuloplasty on Monday. The patient also has allergies to penicillins, erythromycin, Motrin (Ibuprofen), ampicillin, lactose, latex, and adaptic (topical).

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures and deteriorating mental status, aspiration
   pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and failure resulting in
   intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension requiring phenylephrine.
   Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting cardiologist.
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be
   severely fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive 28L Los. She does not
   respond well to lasix/diuril but is also not a candidate for HD.
   -start lasix gtt
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   -monitor volume status, UOP.
   - likely repeat valvuloplasty on Monday
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and
   digoxin. Coumadin was being held before for trach/PEG; restarted
   yesterday and INR went from 1.8 to 2.7. Currently INR 1.9. will d/w
   neurology and rest of CCU team risks and benefits of Coumadin in this
   pt
   -Restart coumadin with heparin bridge. Valvuloplasty not until Monday.
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine stable today. Per previous notes,
   renal believes that this is ATN
   - will attempt diuresis with Lasix  gtt+
   -appreciate renal recs.
   - continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin and
   phenobarbitol. Neuro not sure what is causing continued depressed
   mental status, states she is not having active seizures on EEG.
   - continue phenytoin and Phenobarbital, adjusting per neuro recs:
   Maintain at  phenobarbital at 30 mg [**Hospital1 **] today, decrease to 15mg [**Hospital1 **]
   tomorrow.
   - appreciate neuro recs: recommending LP and MRI
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - continue metoprolol as above
   - continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - trach in place
   - continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   .
   # Pressor Requirement: Etiology unclear. Likely cardiogenic in setting
   of tight AS, but will need to consider sepsis if patient begins to
   spike fevers. Currently without fever or luekocytosis.
   - MAP goal is 65 to try to keep pt off of pressors
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, colon adenocarcinoma, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures and subsequently flashed on the floor. Her course has been complicated by subclinical seizures, deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, acute renal failure, and hypotension requiring phenylephrine. She is currently intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure and remains severely fluid overloaded and oliguric. She does not respond well to diuretics but is not a candidate for hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which can lead to flash pulmonary edema and deteriorating cardiac function. She requires careful monitoring of fluid status and may require repeat valvuloplasty next week.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has good control of heart rate on beta-blocker and digoxin. However, her INR is elevated, and there are risks and benefits of restarting Coumadin, which should be discussed with the neurology and CCU team.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, and renal believes this is acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Diuretic therapy with Lasix should be"

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. The 24-hour events involve several medical interventions and consultations. The patient underwent an MRI of the head, which was unremarkable. Neurology recommended an LP (lumbar puncture) to investigate for paraneoplastic syndrome or carcinomatous meningitis. The patient did not respond to diuretics, so Lasix was started with a one-time dose of metolazone, resulting in a worsening creatinine level from 3.6 to 3.8 UOP 17 cc/hr by 7 pm. The Lasix drip was stopped.

The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, erythromycin base, Motrin (Ibuprofen), ampicillin, lactose, latex, and Adaptic (Topical). The patient is currently on several medications, including Heparin Sodium, Furosemide (Lasix), Dilantin, and Famotidine (Pepcid).

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/56 to 132/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a central venous pressure of 12 mmHg. The fluid balance shows an intake of 1"

   # Aortic Stenosis: Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be
   severely fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive 30L Los. She does not
   respond well to lasix/diuril but is also not a candidate for HD.
   -will try 2mg bumex to see if pt puts out urine to this
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -monitor volume status, UOP.
   -holding off on valvuloplasty at this point
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and
   digoxin. Coumadin was being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding
   coumading in case pt undergoes valvuloplasty. Now on heparin gtt while
   INR subtherapeutic.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - trend coags
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 3.7 today. Per previous notes, renal
   believes that this is ATN
   - will attempt diuresis with bumex, as above
   - appreciate renal recs.
   - continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin and
   phenobarbitol. Neuro not sure what is causing continued depressed
   mental status, states she is not having active seizures on EEG. MRI did
   not show any acute changes.
   - continue phenytoin and Phenobarbital, adjusting per neuro recs
   - Decrease phenobarbital to 15 mg [**Hospital1 **] today, decrease to further in 2
   days.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - continue metoprolol as above
   - continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - trach in place
   - continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   .
   # Pressor Requirement: Pt weaned off of pressors.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   .
   # Fevers: Afebrile for several days now. Per notes, pt completed
   vanc/cefepime 7 day course for pneumonia as well as 3 days course of
   abx for positive UA.

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and colon adenocarcinoma. She presented with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures, flash pulmonary edema, and deteriorating mental status. She was initially on the CCU service but is now intubated in the ICU.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and underwent valvuloplasty. She continues to be severely fluid overloaded and oliguric. She does not respond well to lasix/diuretics but is not a candidate for hemodialysis (HD). The plan is to try 2mg bumex to see if the patient produces urine. Her electrolytes should be monitored, and her volume status and urine output should be closely monitored.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has good control of heart rate on beta-blocker and digoxin. Coumadin was being held before for tracheostomy/PEG, and now it is being held in case the patient undergoes valvuloplasty. She is currently on heparin gtt while her INR is subtherapeutic. The plan is to continue heparin gtt, continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID, continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily, and trend coagulation"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 66-inch tall, 104.8 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of renal failure. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on heparin sodium infusion. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature at 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 83-99 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 80-132 mmHg, respiratory rate between 17-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with minimal response to painful stimuli. Physical examination reveals pitting edema in all four extremities, an irregular heartbeat with a late-peaking high-pitched crescendo/decrescendo murmur loudest at the right upper sternal border, ventilated breath sounds, obesity with BS present, and a PEG tube in place. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels (3.6-3.8 mg/dL), decreased albumin level (2.7 g/dL), elevated white blood cell count (7.4 K/uL), and other abnormalities in electrolyte levels and liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Renal failure: The patient already has acute renal failure, which may worsen if proper management and care are not provided.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure, possibly due"

   valvuloplasty in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be
   severely fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not
   respond well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.

   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin boluses and
   phenobarbitol taper. Neuro not sure what is causing continued depressed
   mental status, states she is not having active seizures on EEG. MRI did
   not show any acute changes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, and severe aortic stenosis, who was admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures. She had flash pulmonary edema and was initially on the CCU service. She is now intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has chronic conditions including colon adenocarcinoma, chronic Clostridium difficile infection, and hypothyroidism. She is severely fluid overloaded and oliguric, with a positive 30L loss. She does not respond well to diuretics but is not a candidate for hemodialysis. The patient's mental status has been deteriorating, and she had subclinical seizures. An MRI did not show any acute changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which can lead to heart failure and other complications such as arrhythmias, syncope, and even sudden cardiac death if not managed properly.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 3.8. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or other causes. Monitoring fluid status and attempting diuresis with bumex/metolazone are part of the management plan.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been declining despite treatment for seizures and medication adjustments. The cause of this altered mental status is uncertain, and further evaluation by the neurology team is recommended.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation due to respiratory failure resulting from aspiration pneumonia. Tracheostomy was performed, and the patient is currently on mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and weaning off the ventilator when appropriate will be important.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgery. Ongoing management of her cardiac status, including antiplatelet therapy and statin medication, is essential to prevent further complications.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient is on Synthroid for hypothyroidism. Regular monitoring of thyroid function and adjusting the dosage accordingly are necessary.
7. Fevers: The patient had fevers in the past, and it is important to follow-up on chest x-ray data, fever curve, and stool for Clostridium difficile infection.
8. Pressor Requirement: The patient previously required pressors, but she has been weaned off of them.
9. DVT and VAP Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis should also be implemented."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis post valvuloplasty, diastolic congestive heart failure, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic Clostridium difficile infection, admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures, and deteriorating mental status. The patient's course has been complicated by subclinical seizures, aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure, hypotension requiring phenylephrine, and respiratory acidosis. The patient has been intubated and transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and is at risk for further deterioration of cardiac function, leading to heart failure or arrhythmias.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has good control of heart rate on beta-blocker and digoxin. However, there is a risk of thromboembolic events due to atrial fibrillation.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's poor mental status could be attributed to various factors, including seizures, medication side effects, or underlying neurological conditions. Continuous monitoring is necessary to assess any changes and adjust medication"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures and deteriorating mental status, aspiration
   pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and failure resulting in
   intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension requiring phenylephrine.
   Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting cardiologist.
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be
   severely fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive 30L Los. She does not
   respond well to lasix/diuril but is also not a candidate for HD.
   -will try 2mg bumex to see if pt puts out urine to this
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -monitor volume status, UOP.
   -holding off on valvuloplasty at this point
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and
   digoxin. Coumadin was being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding
   coumading in case pt undergoes valvuloplasty. Now on heparin gtt while
   INR subtherapeutic.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - trend coags
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 3.7 today. Per previous notes, renal
   believes that this is ATN
   - will attempt diuresis with bumex, as above
   - appreciate renal recs.
   - continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin and
   phenobarbitol. Neuro not sure what is causing continued depressed
   mental status, states she is not having active seizures on EEG. MRI did
   not show any acute changes.
   - continue phenytoin and Phenobarbital, adjusting per neuro recs
   - Decrease phenobarbital to 15 mg [**Hospital1 **] today, decrease to further in 2
   days.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - continue metoprolol as above
   - continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - trach in place
   - continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   .
   # Pressor Requirement: Pt weaned off of pressors.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   .
   # Fevers: Afebrile for several days now. Per notes, pt completed
   vanc/cefepime 7 day course for pneumonia as well as 3 days course of
   abx for positive UA.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c. difficile, and previous CABG surgery. She was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures and later flashed on the floor. The patient's course has been complicated by subclinical seizures, deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, acute renal failure, hypotension requiring vasopressor support, and severe fluid overload.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory acidosis and failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or further deterioration in lung function.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 3.7, indicating renal impairment. There is a risk of worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.

3. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and continues to have subclinical seizures despite being on antiepileptic medications. There is a risk of further seizure activity or status epilepticus.

4. Aortic stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and underwent valvuloplasty in the past. There is a risk of worsening aortic stenosis or"

The patient is a 66-inch, 103.5 kg male who was admitted to the ICU due to acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), impaired skin integrity, aortic stenosis, and a seizure. The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, erythromycin base, Motrin (ibuprofen), ampicillin, lactose, latex, and adaptic (topical non-adherent bandage). The patient is currently on multiple medications, including heparin sodium, famotidine (Pepcid), and dilantin.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
- Heart rate: 95 bpm (91-108 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 96/50 mmHg (67-138/70-96 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 5 breaths per minute (0-27 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 95%
- Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Other lab values are within normal range.

   valvuloplasty in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be
   severely fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not
   respond well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.
   -will try PO bumex and metolazone to try to get some diuresis

   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin boluses and
   phenobarbitol taper. Neuro not sure what is causing continued depressed
   mental status, states she is not having active seizures on EEG. MRI did
   not show any acute changes.
   - continue phenytoin; need to readdress dosing with neuro
   - stopping phenobarbital

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), severe aortic stenosis, post-valvuloplasty, atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic Clostridium difficile infection, admitted for new onset tonic-clonic seizures, and deteriorating mental status. She has been complicated by subclinical seizures, aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure (ATN), hypotension requiring phenylephrine, and respiratory acidosis leading to intubation.

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and was previously on the CCU service. She continues to be severely fluid overloaded and oliguric, with a positive 30L loss. Diuretics such as lasix/diuril/bumex will be tried to achieve some diuresis.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has good control of heart rate on beta-blocker and digoxin. Coumadin was being held before for tracheostomy/PEG tube. Now, it is being held in case the patient undergoes valvuloplasty. Heparin gtt will continue, along with metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID, and digoxin 0.0625 mg daily.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is 3.8. Renal failure is believed to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Diuretics with bumex/metolazone will be attempted to promote diuresis. Fluid status should be closely monitored.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has had seizures, loaded with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental status. Despite loading dose, continued subclinical seizures on EEG. Medication regimen has been changed, currently on phenytoin boluses and phenobarbital taper. Neurological input is needed to readdress dosing of phenytoin.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient is post-CABG. Metoprolol will continue, along with aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient is now tracheostomized. Albuterol/atrovent will be given PRN.
7. Pressor Requirement: The patient has been weaned off pressors.
8. Hypothyroidism: Synthroid 75 mcg daily will continue.
9. Fevers: The patient's fever has subsided. Follow-up chest x-ray data and stool for Clostridium difficile infection should be monitored.
10. ICU Care: The patient is receiving Nutren 2.0 (Full) at 35 mL/hour for"

   [**2196-2-21**]
   Neuro recs:
    -phenytoin 300 mg IV bolus now
    -phenytoin 125 mg PO TID
    -check EEG in a.m.
    -phenytoin and free phenytoin tonight
    -do not wean phenobarb tonight (give one more dose tonight)
   -ordered metolazone + bumetanide. Patient did not diurese.
   -gave 1-time dose of phenobarbital in p.m. per neuro recs (had d/c'ed
   on rounds, but neuro felt this was too abrupt). Per neuro, patient will
   not need further doses of phenobarb.
   -1 a.m., noted to be hypoxemic 7.30/42/64 on FiO2 50%. Ventillation
   mode changed to AC and FiO2 increased to 100% with gas subsequently
   7.35/35/249. CXR unchanged.
   -weaned FiO2
   However,  per Neurology this a.m.:
   -          Do not stop Phenobarbital precipitously
 may result in
   seizure.
   -          Per Neurology, unlikely AEDs causing mental status changes,
   therefore need to proceed with LP to ensure no
   carcinomatosis/paraneoplastic syndrome.

   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin boluses and
   phenobarbitol taper. Neuro not sure what is causing continued depressed
   mental status, states she is not having active seizures on EEG. MRI did
   not show any acute changes.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis post valvuloplasty, diastolic congestive heart failure, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic Clostridium difficile infection, admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures, and subsequently flashing on the floor. The patient's condition has been complicated by subclinical seizures, deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and failure resulting in intubation. The patient also has acute renal failure, altered mental status, coronary artery disease, respiratory failure, pressor requirement, hypothyroidism, and fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis that was previously treated with valvuloplasty. Due to the patient's severe fluid overload and oliguria, there is a risk of further deterioration in cardiac function and potential complications related to aortic stenosis.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 3.8, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) as suggested by the renal team. Diuretic therapy with bumex and metolazone will be attempted to manage fluid overload and oliguria. Close monitoring of fluid status is essential to prevent further renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures (now none for a week on EEG) and deteriorating
   mental status, aspiration pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and
   failure resulting in intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension requiring
   phenylephrine. Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting
   cardiologist.
   # Coma, seizures, Goals of Care
   Comatose with some brainstem reflexes. No seizures for some time. No
   evidence of cortical function. BUN 123 and patient has been
   intermittently hypotensive. Therefore differential includes (also
   possible multifactorial) uremia, anoxic brain injury and
   carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy. Not likely related to
   presently low levels of AEDs. Given this state, we need to aggressively
   treat reversible causes, if present, then determine whether further
   cardiac interventions are warranted This will require some further
   investigations and discussion with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**], Neurology, the family.
   - Attending and family keen to stop AEDs, so will need to check with
   them prior to giving phenobarbital
   - LP today for cytology
   - Continue phenytoin
   # Aortic Stenosis
   Treatment of this is deferred pending decision about the above.
   Valvuloplasty will need to be repeated (if this is compatible with
   goals of care). Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty
   in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in her
   hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her lasix
   were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be severely
   fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not respond
   well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.
   - Continue bumex and metolazone with goal of net negative 1.5L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Monitor volume status, UOP.
   - Holding off on valvuloplasty at this point
   # Respiratory Failure and Intubation
   - Preserve for now given mental status and edema
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and digoxin. Coumadin was
   being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding coumading in case pt
   undergoes valvuloplasty. Now on heparin gtt while INR subtherapeutic.
   - Stop heparin this a.m. for LP this afternoon
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - Continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - Trend coags
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 3.8 today. Per previous notes, is ATN
   - Will attempt diuresis with bumex/metolazone, as above
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   - Continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - Continue metoprolol as above
   - Continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - Trach in place
   - Continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   # Pressor Requirement: Pt weaned off of pressors.
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   # Fevers: Afebrile for several days now. Per notes, pt completed
   vanc/cefepime 7 day course for pneumonia as well as 3 days course of
   abx for positive UA.

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic Clostridium difficile infection, and previous valvuloplasty. She was admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures and subsequently flashed on the floor. She also has deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and failure resulting in intubation. She has acute renal failure, and her creatinine level is 3.8. She is on pressor support and requires aggressive treatment for her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Uremia: The patient's elevated BUN level and intermittent hypotension may indicate uremia, which is a potential cause of her coma.
2. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's prolonged hypoxia and low oxygen saturation may have caused an anoxic brain injury, contributing to her mental status changes.
3. Carcinomatosis/Paraneoplastic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of colon adenocarcinoma, there is a possibility of carcinomatosis or paraneoplastic syndrome causing her encephalopathy.
4. Aortic Stenosis: The patient's severe aortic stenosis may require further intervention, such as valvuloplasty, but this decision depends on her overall condition and goals of care.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures and deteriorating mental status, aspiration
   pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and failure resulting in
   intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension requiring phenylephrine.
   Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting cardiologist.
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in
   her hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her
   lasix were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be
   severely fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not
   respond well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.
   -will try PO bumex and metolazone to try to get some diuresis
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -monitor volume status, UOP.
   -holding off on valvuloplasty at this point
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and
   digoxin. Coumadin was being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding
   coumading in case pt undergoes valvuloplasty. Now on heparin gtt while
   INR subtherapeutic.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - trend coags
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 3.8 today. Per previous notes, renal
   believes that this is ATN
   - will attempt diuresis with bumex/metolazone, as above
   - appreciate renal recs.
   - continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Per prior notes, pt has had seizures, loaded
   with dilantin and ativan PRN prior to admission with poor mental
   status. Despite loading dose continued to have sub clinical seziures on
   EEG. Medication regimen changed, currently on phenytoin boluses and
   phenobarbitol taper. Neuro not sure what is causing continued depressed
   mental status, states she is not having active seizures on EEG. MRI did
   not show any acute changes.
   - continue phenytoin; need to readdress dosing with neuro
   - stopping phenobarbital
   - appreciate neuro input
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - continue metoprolol as above
   - continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - trach in place
   - continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   .
   # Pressor Requirement: Pt weaned off of pressors.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   .
   # Fevers: Afebrile for several days now. Per notes, pt completed
   vanc/cefepime 7 day course for pneumonia as well as 3 days course of
   abx for positive UA.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis post-valvuloplasty, diastolic congestive heart failure, colon adenocarcinoma, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures and subsequently flashed on the floor. She has been experiencing subclinical seizures and deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure, hypotension requiring phenylephrine, and respiratory acidosis and failure resulting in intubation. The patient is severely fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She is not responding well to Lasix/diuril/bumex but is not a candidate for hemodialysis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient's severe aortic stenosis may lead to further complications such as syncope, chest pain, palpitations, and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates acute renal failure, which can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately. This may require dialysis or renal transplantation in the future.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to several factors including seizures, medication side effects, or underlying conditions such as dementia."

","The patient's chief complaint is critical AS, which stands for aortic stenosis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. 

24-hour events include the administration of phenytoin for seizure management, checking EEG in the morning, and adjusting diuretics due to the patient's inability to diurese. The patient's FiO2 was increased to 100% after experiencing hypoxemia, and the ventilation mode was changed to assist-control. 

The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, erythromycin base, Motrin (ibuprofen), ampicillin, lactose, latex, and adaptic (topical). 

The patient's medical history includes renal failure, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, aortic stenosis, and a seizure without status epilepticus. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/50 to 138/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 5 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen of 50%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal the presence of yeast in the urine and sputum.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures (now none for a week on EEG) and deteriorating
   mental status, aspiration pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and
   failure resulting in intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension requiring
   phenylephrine. Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting
   cardiologist.
   # Coma, seizures, Goals of Care
   Comatose with some brainstem reflexes. No seizures for some time. No
   evidence of cortical function. BUN 123 and patient has been
   intermittently hypotensive. Therefore differential includes (also
   possible multifactorial) uremia, anoxic brain injury and
   carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy. Not likely related to
   presently low levels of AEDs. Given this state, we need to aggressively
   treat reversible causes, if present, then determine whether further
   cardiac interventions are warranted This will require some further
   investigations and discussion with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**], Neurology, the family.
   - Attending and family keen to stop AEDs, so will need to check with
   them prior to giving phenobarbital
   - LP today for cytology
   - Continue phenytoin
   # Aortic Stenosis
   Treatment of this is deferred pending decision about the above.
   Valvuloplasty will need to be repeated (if this is compatible with
   goals of care). Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty
   in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in her
   hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her lasix
   were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be severely
   fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not respond
   well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.
   - Continue bumex and metolazone with goal of net negative 1.5L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Monitor volume status, UOP.
   - Holding off on valvuloplasty at this point
   # Respiratory Failure and Intubation
   - Preserve for now given mental status and edema
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and digoxin. Coumadin was
   being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding coumading in case pt
   undergoes valvuloplasty. Now on heparin gtt while INR subtherapeutic.
   - Stop heparin this a.m. for LP this afternoon
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - Continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - Trend coags
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 3.8 today. Per previous notes, is ATN
   - Will attempt diuresis with bumex/metolazone, as above
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   - Continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - Continue metoprolol as above
   - Continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - Trach in place
   - Continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   # Pressor Requirement: Pt weaned off of pressors.
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   # Fevers: Afebrile for several days now. Per notes, pt completed
   vanc/cefepime 7 day course for pneumonia as well as 3 days course of
   abx for positive UA.
   - f/u cx data
   - follow fever curve

   Medical Decision Making
   Will continue to taper phenobarbital in an effort to reverse metabolic
   encephalopathy.
   Family meeting to discuss options is scheduled for Wednesday.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, and colon adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures and subsequent deteriorating mental status. The patient has been complicated by aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure, hypotension requiring phenylephrine, and respiratory acidosis leading to intubation. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coma, seizures: The patient is comatose with some brainstem reflexes. No seizures for some time. No evidence of cortical function. BUN 123 and patient has been intermittently hypotensive. Differential includes uremia, anoxic brain injury, and carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy. Aggressive treatment of reversible causes is necessary.
2. Aortic Stenosis: Treatment of this is deferred pending decision about the above. Valvuloplasty will need to be repeated (if compatible with goals of care).
3. Respiratory Failure and Intubation: Intubation will be preserved for now given mental status and edema.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has good control of HR on beta blockade and digoxin. Coumadin was being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding coumadin in case pt undergoes valvuloplasty.
5. Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 3.8 today. Will"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**] talked to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12004**] by telephone - appears that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**]
   is still not keen to give phenobarbital - not ordered.  However states,
   Will continue to taper phenobarbital in an effort to reverse metabolic
   encephalopathy.
   Family meeting to discuss options is scheduled for Wednesday.
   - Neurology consider most likely cause of coma is uremia, hypoxia,
   sedating meds, less likely carcinomatosis/paraneoplastic (we would also
   add hypoxic injury, which is not always obvious by MRI)
   - Family want to wait until Wednesday to make further decisions.
   - Three admission in afternoon, so deferred LP to a.m. - restarted
   heparin - hold again in a.m. and post-calls will do LP.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis post-valvuloplasty, diastolic congestive heart failure, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic Clostridium difficile infection, and multiple other medical conditions. The patient was admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures and subsequently flashed on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. The patient's course has been complicated by subclinical seizures (now none for a week on EEG), deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and failure resulting in intubation, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, aortic stenosis, and seizure without status epilepticus.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 85 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 107/51 to 130/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on the tracheostomy tube, and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 indicating comatose state. The patient is intubated and ventilated, with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 123 mg/dL, creatinine at 3.8 mg/dL, potassium at 4.8 mEq/L, sodium at 125 mEq/L, chloride at 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate at 25.5 mmol/L, glucose at 137 mg/dL, and leukocyte count with a slight elevation. Other lab values include a platelet count of 381 K/uL, white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.0, hematocrit (Hct) of 24.7, prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT)/international normalized ratio (INR) of 13.7/56.7/1.2, and various electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications include acute renal failure, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, aortic stenosis, seizure without status epilepticus, hypothyroidism, fevers, and coronary artery disease. The patient is currently being managed with aggressive treatment for reversible causes, including the consideration of phenobarbital administration, lumbar punct"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures (now none for a week on EEG) and deteriorating
   mental status, aspiration pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and
   failure resulting in intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension required
   phenylephrine. Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting
   cardiologist.
   # Coma, seizures, Goals of Care
   Comatose with some brainstem reflexes. No seizures for some time. No
   evidence of cortical function. BUN 123 and patient has been
   intermittently hypotensive. Therefore differential includes (also
   possible multifactorial) uremia, anoxic brain injury and
   carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy (although very unlikely).
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12011**] has discussed issue of Phenobarbital with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12004**]
   (neurology) and  decision made to not restart phenobarbital.
   - No need for LP given carcinomatosis is an extremely unlikely cause of
   coma and metabolic toxicities (many different sources) seem more
   likely.
   - Family wanst to wait until Wednesday to make further decisions.
   # Acidemia
    ABG noted pH 7.27. Anion gap was 15.  Lactate was not elevated at 1.0
   making metabolic acidosis from renal failure or uremia more likely.  Pt
   not a candidate for HD.
   -          increase ventilation rate for respiratory compensation of
   metabolic acidosis
   -          will hold off on bicarb/fluids
   # Aortic Stenosis
   Treatment of this is deferred pending decision about the above.
   Valvuloplasty will need to be repeated (if this is compatible with
   goals of care). Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty
   in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in her
   hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her lasix
   were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be severely
   fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not respond
   well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.
   - Continue bumex and metolazone with goal of net negative 1.5L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Monitor volume status, UOP.
   - Holding off on valvuloplasty at this point
   # Respiratory Failure and Intubation
   - Preserve for now given mental status and edema
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and digoxin. Coumadin was
   being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding coumading in case pt
   undergoes valvuloplasty. Now on heparin gtt while INR subtherapeutic.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old individual with a critical aortic stenosis who underwent a failed repair. Following the surgery, the patient experienced an intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage, seizure, and subsequent deterioration in mental status. The patient's condition has been critical, requiring transfer to the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU).

24-hour events:
During the past 24 hours, there have been some notable changes and interventions. The patient's respiratory support has been adjusted, with an increase in the ventilator rate and improvement in acidosis. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy tube with continuous mechanical ventilation. Oxygen delivery is being provided through the tracheostomy tube, and the FiO2 has been set at 50%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 224. The RSBI (respiratory system compliance index) is 64, and the PIP (peak inspiratory pressure) is 24 cmH2O, with a plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/50 to 132/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%"

   EEG:
   BACKGROUND: Is diffusely slow and disorganized consisting of mixed
   theta and delta frequencies and occasional periods of diffuse global
   suppression of the background. There were rare bursts of generalized
   slowing and rare generalized sharps occurring in isolation. There were
   no electrographic seizures and there were no periodic discharges.
   HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed secondary to history of
   intracranial hemorrhage.
   INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed secondary to
   the portable nature of this study.
   SLEEP: No normal sleep morphology was seen on this recording.
   CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed an irregularly irregular rhythm with occasional
   wide complex ectopic beats.
   IMPRESSION: This is a severely abnormal extended routine EEG due to a
   diffusely slow and disorganized background consisting of mixed theta
   and
   delta frequencies marked by occasional generalized bursts of slowing,
   rare generalized sharps occurring in isolation and occasional brief
   suppressive bursts of the background. There were no periodic discharges
   and there were no electrographic seizures. Overall, this background is
   suggestive of a severe encephalopathy. Amongst the most common causes
   of encephalopathy are medications, infection, metabolic derangements,
   and anoxia.
   INTERPRETED BY: [**Last Name (LF) 8861**],[**First Name3 (LF) **] L.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures (now none for a week on EEG) and deteriorating
   mental status, aspiration pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and
   failure resulting in intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension required
   phenylephrine. Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting
   cardiologist.
   # Coma, seizures, Goals of Care
   Comatose with some brainstem reflexes. No seizures for some time. No
   evidence of cortical function. BUN 123 and patient has been
   intermittently hypotensive. Therefore differential includes (also
   possible multifactorial) uremia, anoxic brain injury and
   carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy (although very unlikely).
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12011**] has discussed issue of Phenobarbital with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12004**]
   (neurology) and  decision made to not restart phenobarbital.
   - No need for LP given carcinomatosis is an extremely unlikely cause of
   coma and metabolic toxicities (many different sources) seem more
   likely.
   - Family wanst to wait until Wednesday to make further decisions.
   # Acidemia
    ABG noted pH 7.27. Anion gap was 15.  Lactate was not elevated at 1.0
   making metabolic acidosis from renal failure or uremia more likely.  Pt
   not a candidate for HD.
   -          increase ventilation rate for respiratory compensation of
   metabolic acidosis
   -          will hold off on bicarb/fluids
   # Aortic Stenosis
   Treatment of this is deferred pending decision about the above.
   Valvuloplasty will need to be repeated (if this is compatible with
   goals of care). Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty
   in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in her
   hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her lasix
   were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be severely
   fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not respond
   well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.
   - Continue bumex and metolazone with goal of net negative 1.5L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Monitor volume status, UOP.
   - Holding off on valvuloplasty at this point
   # Respiratory Failure and Intubation
   - Preserve for now given mental status and edema
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and digoxin. Coumadin was
   being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding coumading in case pt
   undergoes valvuloplasty. Now on heparin gtt while INR subtherapeutic.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - Continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - Trend coags
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 3.8 today. Per previous notes, is ATN
   - Will attempt diuresis with bumex/metolazone, as above
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   - Continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - Continue metoprolol as above
   - Continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - Trach in place
   - Continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   # Pressor Requirement: Pt weaned off of pressors.
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   # Fevers: Afebrile for several days now. Per notes, pt completed
   vanc/cefepime 7 day course for pneumonia as well as 3 days course of
   abx for positive UA.
   - f/u cx data
   - follow fever curve

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, colon adenocarcinoma, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures and subsequently flashed on the floor. The patient's course has been complicated by subclinical seizures, deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and failure resulting in intubation. She also has acute renal failure, coronary artery disease, respiratory failure, hypotension, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Uremic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated BUN level and history of renal failure may contribute to this condition, leading to cognitive impairment and coma.
2. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's history of cardiac issues and hypotension may have resulted in decreased blood flow to the brain, causing damage.
3. Carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy: Although less likely, the patient's colon adenocarcinoma may be associated with encephalopathy due to carcinoatosis or paraneoplastic syndrome.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.27 and anion gap of 15, suggesting metabolic acidosis. This could be caused by renal failure or uremia.
5. Seizures: The patient's initial presentation included tonic-clonic seizures, and there is a risk of recurrent seizures due to her underlying conditions.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and failure require close monitoring, and intubation may be necessary to support her respiratory function.
7. Aortic stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which may require valvuloplasty. However, treatment decisions are pending consideration of the patient's overall goals of care.
8. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level of 3.8 indicates renal impairment, and diuretic therapy is being used to manage fluid overload.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

   Imaging: CXR portable [**2-22**]:
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2196-2-16**].
   The tracheostomy is at the midline with its tip being 4.5 cm above the
   carina.
   The left internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. There is
   no
   change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is interval
   improvement in
   pulmonary edema. The left pleural effusion is present as well as left
   retrocardiac atelectasis. The right lateral chest was not included in
   the
   field of view preventing evaluation of the right pleural effusion.
   Broken sternal wires are unchanged. The gastrostomy is projecting over
   the
   stomach.
   Microbiology: Yeast in urine and sputum. No other significant findings.
   Electrrphysiology:
   ECG:
   EEG:
   BACKGROUND: Is diffusely slow and disorganized consisting of mixed
   theta and delta frequencies and occasional periods of diffuse global
   suppression of the background. There were rare bursts of generalized
   slowing and rare generalized sharps occurring in isolation. There were
   no electrographic seizures and there were no periodic discharges.
   HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed secondary to history of
   intracranial hemorrhage.
   INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed secondary to
   the portable nature of this study.
   SLEEP: No normal sleep morphology was seen on this recording.
   CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed an irregularly irregular rhythm with occasional
   wide complex ectopic beats.
   IMPRESSION: This is a severely abnormal extended routine EEG due to a
   diffusely slow and disorganized background consisting of mixed theta
   and
   delta frequencies marked by occasional generalized bursts of slowing,
   rare generalized sharps occurring in isolation and occasional brief
   suppressive bursts of the background. There were no periodic discharges
   and there were no electrographic seizures. Overall, this background is
   suggestive of a severe encephalopathy. Amongst the most common causes
   of encephalopathy are medications, infection, metabolic derangements,
   and anoxia.
   INTERPRETED BY: [**Last Name (LF) 8861**],[**First Name3 (LF) **] L.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures (now none for a week on EEG) and deteriorating
   mental status, aspiration pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and
   failure resulting in intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension required
   phenylephrine. Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting
   cardiologist.
   # Coma, seizures, Goals of Care
   Comatose with some brainstem reflexes. No seizures for some time. No
   evidence of cortical function. BUN 124 and patient has been
   intermittently hypotensive. Therefore differential includes (also
   possible multifactorial) uremia, anoxic brain injury and
   carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy (although very unlikely).
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12011**] has discussed issue of Phenobarbital with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12004**]
   (neurology) and  decision made to not restart phenobarbital.
   - No need for LP given carcinomatosis is an extremely unlikely cause of
   coma and metabolic toxicities (many different sources) seem more
   likely.
   - Will consider stopping AEDs, given possible contribution to mental
   status
   # Acidemia
   ABG slightly improved today - 7.30/41/112/18/-5. Lactate was not
   elevated at 1.0 making metabolic acidosis from renal failure or uremia
   more likely.  Pt not a candidate for HD.
   -          increase ventilation rate for respiratory compensation of
   metabolic acidosis
   -          will hold off on bicarb/fluids
   # Aortic Stenosis
   Treatment of this is deferred pending decision about the above.
   Valvuloplasty will need to be repeated (if this is compatible with
   goals of care). Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty
   in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in her
   hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her lasix
   were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be severely
   fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not respond
   well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.
   - Continue bumex and metolazone with goal of net negative 1.5L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Monitor volume status, UOP.
   - Holding off on valvuloplasty at this point
   # Respiratory Failure and Intubation
   - Preserve for now given mental status and edema
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and digoxin. Coumadin was
   being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding coumading in case pt
   undergoes valvuloplasty. Now on heparin gtt while INR subtherapeutic.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - Continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - Trend coags
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 3.8 today. Per previous notes, is ATN
   - Will attempt diuresis with bumex/metolazone, as above
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   - Continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - Continue metoprolol as above
   - Continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - Trach in place
   - Continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   # Pressor Requirement: Pt weaned off of pressors.
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   # Fevers: Afebrile for several days now. Per notes, pt completed
   vanc/cefepime 7 day course for pneumonia as well as 3 days course of
   abx for positive UA.
   - f/u cx data
   - follow fever curve
   - f/u stool for c.diff

   TITLE:  CCU Attending Cardiology Progress Note
   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10366**] today and I agree with
   the plan.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Smiled and opened eyes to husband
s voice.  Off Phenobarbital and
   Dilantin is subtherapeutic (3.3).
   Is increasing her ventilatory requirements on higher degrees of FIO2.
   Still fluid overloaded.
   Medical Decision Making
   Given the finding of her responsiveness to her husband, will temporize
   with supportive care for the next day and reassess supportive measures
   in one day.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p CABG, atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, and colon adenocarcinoma. The patient was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures, subsequent intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage, and deteriorating mental status. The patient's condition has continued to deteriorate despite being transferred to the CCU.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/50 to 132/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and an irregular heart rhythm of atrial fibrillation. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, presence of a tracheostomy, poor air entry at the lung bases, pitting edema in all four extremities, and a comatose state with some brainstem reflexes present. The patient has not had any seizures for some time.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal the presence of yeast in the urine and sputum, left pleural effusion, left retrocardiac atelectasis, and broken sternal wires"

   Imaging: CXR portable [**2-22**]:
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2196-2-16**].
   The tracheostomy is at the midline with its tip being 4.5 cm above the
   carina.
   The left internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. There is
   no
   change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is interval
   improvement in
   pulmonary edema. The left pleural effusion is present as well as left
   retrocardiac atelectasis. The right lateral chest was not included in
   the
   field of view preventing evaluation of the right pleural effusion.
   Broken sternal wires are unchanged. The gastrostomy is projecting over
   the
   stomach.
   Microbiology: Yeast in urine and sputum. No other significant findings.
   Electrrphysiology:
   ECG:
   EEG:
   BACKGROUND: Is diffusely slow and disorganized consisting of mixed
   theta and delta frequencies and occasional periods of diffuse global
   suppression of the background. There were rare bursts of generalized
   slowing and rare generalized sharps occurring in isolation. There were
   no electrographic seizures and there were no periodic discharges.
   HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed secondary to history of
   intracranial hemorrhage.
   INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed secondary to
   the portable nature of this study.
   SLEEP: No normal sleep morphology was seen on this recording.
   CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed an irregularly irregular rhythm with occasional
   wide complex ectopic beats.
   IMPRESSION: This is a severely abnormal extended routine EEG due to a
   diffusely slow and disorganized background consisting of mixed theta
   and
   delta frequencies marked by occasional generalized bursts of slowing,
   rare generalized sharps occurring in isolation and occasional brief
   suppressive bursts of the background. There were no periodic discharges
   and there were no electrographic seizures. Overall, this background is
   suggestive of a severe encephalopathy. Amongst the most common causes
   of encephalopathy are medications, infection, metabolic derangements,
   and anoxia.
   INTERPRETED BY: [**Last Name (LF) 8861**],[**First Name3 (LF) **] L.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures (now none for a week on EEG) and deteriorating
   mental status, aspiration pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and
   failure resulting in intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension required
   phenylephrine. Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting
   cardiologist.
   # Coma, seizures, Goals of Care
   Comatose with some brainstem reflexes. No seizures for some time. No
   evidence of cortical function. BUN 124 and patient has been
   intermittently hypotensive. Therefore differential includes (also
   possible multifactorial) uremia, anoxic brain injury and
   carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy (although very unlikely).
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12011**] has discussed issue of Phenobarbital with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12004**]
   (neurology) and  decision made to not restart phenobarbital.
   - No need for LP given carcinomatosis is an extremely unlikely cause of
   coma and metabolic toxicities (many different sources) seem more
   likely.
   - Will consider stopping AEDs, given possible contribution to mental
   status
   # Acidemia
   ABG slightly improved today - 7.30/41/112/18/-5. Lactate was not
   elevated at 1.0 making metabolic acidosis from renal failure or uremia
   more likely.  Pt not a candidate for HD.
   -          increase ventilation rate for respiratory compensation of
   metabolic acidosis
   -          will hold off on bicarb/fluids
   # Aortic Stenosis
   Treatment of this is deferred pending decision about the above.
   Valvuloplasty will need to be repeated (if this is compatible with
   goals of care). Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty
   in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in her
   hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her lasix
   were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be severely
   fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not respond
   well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.
   - Continue bumex and metolazone with goal of net negative 1.5L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Monitor volume status, UOP.
   - Holding off on valvuloplasty at this point
   # Respiratory Failure and Intubation
   - Preserve for now given mental status and edema
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and digoxin. Coumadin was
   being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding coumading in case pt
   undergoes valvuloplasty. Now on heparin gtt while INR subtherapeutic.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - Continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - Trend coags
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 3.8 today. Per previous notes, is ATN
   - Will attempt diuresis with bumex/metolazone, as above
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   - Continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - Continue metoprolol as above
   - Continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - Trach in place
   - Continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   # Pressor Requirement: Pt weaned off of pressors.
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   # Fevers: Afebrile for several days now. Per notes, pt completed
   vanc/cefepime 7 day course for pneumonia as well as 3 days course of
   abx for positive UA.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, and colon adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures and subsequently developed intracranial hemorrhage. The patient's condition has deteriorated, leading to intubation and transfer to the cardiac care unit (CCU). 

The patient's current condition includes coma, seizures, respiratory acidosis, acute renal failure, and hypotension. She is also critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including respiratory failure, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and cardiovascular instability. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of mental status, worsening of respiratory failure, progression of renal failure, and potential cardiovascular events such as arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia. 

Given the patient's complex medical history and current critical condition, it is crucial to closely monitor her vital signs, neurologic status, fluid balance, and laboratory parameters. Appropriate interventions should be implemented to manage her acute complications and optimize her overall care."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

1. Acute renal failure: The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function.

2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a low respiratory rate set and a high tidal volume. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is also low, suggesting inadequate oxygenation.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has sores, possibly due to prolonged bed rest or pressure ulcers.

4. Aortic stenosis: The patient has a history of critical aortic stenosis, which may contribute to their current condition.

5. Seizure: The patient has experienced a seizure, although no status epilepticus is mentioned.

It is important to note that the patient's allergies, medications, and family meetings regarding code status are also documented in the progress note."

 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures (now none for a week on EEG) and deteriorating
   mental status, aspiration pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and
   failure resulting in intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension required
   phenylephrine. Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting
   cardiologist.
   # Coma, seizures, Goals of Care
   Comatose with some brainstem reflexes. No seizures for some time. No
   evidence of cortical function. BUN 124 and patient has been
   intermittently hypotensive. Therefore differential includes (also
   possible multifactorial) uremia, anoxic brain injury and
   carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy (although very unlikely).
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12011**] has discussed issue of Phenobarbital with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12004**]
   (neurology) and  decision made to not restart phenobarbital.
   - No need for LP given carcinomatosis is an extremely unlikely cause of
   coma and metabolic toxicities (many different sources) seem more
   likely.
   - Will continue phenytoin for now given not contributing to mental
   status at such low concentration
   - Will d/w with family re transition to DNR/DNI today\
   - Will discuss with family re using oxygen and morphine PRN dyspnea
   - Will discuss discontinuing labs
   - No escalation of care
   # Acidemia
   ABG slightly improved today - 7.30/41/112/18/-5. Lactate was not
   elevated at 1.0 making metabolic acidosis from renal failure or uremia
   more likely.  Pt not a candidate for HD.
   -No further interventions
   # Aortic Stenosis
   Treatment of this is deferred pending decision about the above.
   Valvuloplasty will need to be repeated (if this is compatible with
   goals of care). Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty
   in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in her

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, colon adenocarcinoma, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has been admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures and has since experienced subclinical seizures, deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, acute respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and a seizure without status epilepticus.

The patient's current condition includes being comatose with some brainstem reflexes, no seizures for some time, no evidence of cortical function, BUN of 124, intermittent hypotension, and a differential diagnosis that includes uremia, anoxic brain injury, and carcinomatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy.

Regarding medical complications, the patient has:
1. Acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 3.8. The attending physician plans to attempt diuresis with bumex/metolazone and continue monitoring fluid status.
2. Respiratory failure with the patient intubated in the ICU. The attending physician decides to preserve intubation for now due to the patient's mental status and edema.
3. Aortic stenosis, which is severe and requires valvuloplasty. However, this treatment is deferred pending the decision about the patient's"

   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures (now none for a week on EEG) and deteriorating
   mental status, aspiration pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and
   failure resulting in intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension required
   phenylephrine. Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting
   cardiologist.
   # Coma, seizures, Goals of Care
   Comatose with some brainstem reflexes. No seizures for some time. No
   evidence of cortical function. BUN 124 and patient has been
   intermittently hypotensive. Therefore differential includes (also
   possible multifactorial) uremia, anoxic brain injury and
   carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy (although very unlikely).
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12011**] has discussed issue of Phenobarbital with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12004**]
   (neurology) and  decision made to not restart phenobarbital.
   - No need for LP given carcinomatosis is an extremely unlikely cause of
   coma and metabolic toxicities (many different sources) seem more
   likely.
   - Will continue phenytoin for now given not contributing to mental
   status at such low concentration
   - Will d/w with family re transition to DNR/DNI today\
   - Will discuss with family re using oxygen and morphine PRN dyspnea
   - Will discuss discontinuing labs
   - No escalation of care
   # Acidemia
   ABG slightly improved today - 7.30/41/112/18/-5. Lactate was not
   elevated at 1.0 making metabolic acidosis from renal failure or uremia
   more likely.  Pt not a candidate for HD.
   -No further interventions
   # Aortic Stenosis
   Treatment of this is deferred pending decision about the above.
   Valvuloplasty will need to be repeated (if this is compatible with
   goals of care). Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and severe aortic stenosis. She has been admitted multiple times and has undergone cardiac catheterization and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient is currently in the ICU due to new onset tonic-clonic seizures, deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and hypotension. The patient's family has requested full code status, but the attending physician believes that comfort measures only should be initiated if the patient experiences cardiac arrest. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by a creatinine level of 3.8. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or other causes. The patient's oliguria and fluid overload contribute to this complication.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated in the ICU due to respiratory acidosis and failure. The patient's positive fluid balance of 30L and lack of response to diuretics make respiratory failure a significant concern.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to pressure ulcers and infection. The patient's immobility and decreased sensation make this complication likely.

4. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, and the attending physician has"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 AORTIC STENOSIS
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures (now none for a week on EEG) and deteriorating
   mental status, aspiration pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and
   failure resulting in intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension required
   phenylephrine. Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting
   cardiologist.
   # Coma, seizures, Goals of Care
   Comatose with some brainstem reflexes. No seizures for some time. No
   evidence of cortical function. BUN 124 and patient has been
   intermittently hypotensive. Therefore differential includes (also
   possible multifactorial) uremia, anoxic brain injury and
   carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy (although very unlikely).
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12011**] has discussed issue of Phenobarbital with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12004**]
   (neurology) and  decision made to not restart phenobarbital.
   - No need for LP given carcinomatosis is an extremely unlikely cause of
   coma and metabolic toxicities (many different sources) seem more
   likely.
   - Will continue phenytoin for now given not contributing to mental
   status at such low concentration
   - DNR/DNI focus on comfort
   - Will discontinue labs
   - No escalation of care
   # Acidemia
   ABG slightly improved today - 7.30/41/112/18/-5. Lactate was not
   elevated at 1.0 making metabolic acidosis from renal failure or uremia
   more likely.  Pt not a candidate for HD.
   -No further interventions
   # Aortic Stenosis
   Treatment of this is deferred pending decision about the above.
   Valvuloplasty will need to be repeated (if this is compatible with
   goals of care). Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty
   in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in her
   hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her lasix
   were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be severely
   fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not respond
   well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.
   - Continue bumex and metolazone
   - No further escalations
   # Respiratory Failure and Intubation
   - Preserve for now given mental status and edema
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and digoxin. Coumadin was
   being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding coumading in case pt
   undergoes valvuloplasty.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - Continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - DC labs
   - DC IV heparin given inconsistent with goals of care
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 3.8 today. Per previous notes, is ATN
   - Will attempt diuresis with bumex/metolazone, as above
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   - Continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - Continue metoprolol as above
   - Continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - Trach in place
   - Continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   # Pressor Requirement: Pt weaned off of pressors.
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   # Fevers: Afebrile for several days now. Per notes, pt completed
   vanc/cefepime 7 day course for pneumonia as well as 3 days course of
   abx for positive UA.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation (Afib), severe aortic stenosis (AS), colon adenocarcinoma, chronic Clostridium difficile (c.diff), and other comorbidities. The patient presented with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures, aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure (ARF), hypotension requiring phenylephrine, and deteriorating mental status. She was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for further management.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Coma: The patient is comatose with some brainstem reflexes. There have been no seizures for some time, and no evidence of cortical function. The differential diagnosis includes uremia, anoxic brain injury, and carcinomatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy.

2. Acidemia: The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) has improved slightly, with a pH of 7.30, indicating a mild metabolic acidosis. Lactate levels were not elevated, suggesting that renal failure or uremia is more likely than lactic acidosis.

3. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which was previously treated with valvuloplasty. Further intervention is pending a decision regarding the patient's overall care"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, colon adenocarcinoma, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures and subsequently developed subclinical seizures, deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient has been comatose with some brainstem reflexes, no seizures for a while, no evidence of cortical function, and a BUN of 124. She has been intermittently hypotensive, requiring phenylephrine. The differential diagnosis for her coma includes uremia, anoxic brain injury, and carcinomatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 3.8. She is oliguric and severely fluid overloaded, but not a candidate for hemodialysis (HD). The plan is to attempt diuresis with bumex/metolazone.

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 AORTIC STENOSIS
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures (now none for a week on EEG) and deteriorating
   mental status, aspiration pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and
   failure resulting in intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension required
   phenylephrine. Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting
   cardiologist.
   # Coma, seizures, Goals of Care
   Comatose with some brainstem reflexes. No seizures for some time. No
   evidence of cortical function. BUN 124 and patient has been
   intermittently hypotensive. Therefore differential includes (also
   possible multifactorial) uremia, anoxic brain injury and
   carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy (although very unlikely).
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12011**] has discussed issue of Phenobarbital with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12004**]
   (neurology) and  decision made to not restart phenobarbital.
   - No need for LP given carcinomatosis is an extremely unlikely cause of
   coma and metabolic toxicities (many different sources) seem more
   likely.
   - Will continue phenytoin for now given not contributing to mental
   status at such low concentration
   - DNR/DNI focus on comfort
   - Will discuss with family re using oxygen and morphine PRN dyspnea
   - Will discuss discontinuing labs
   - No escalation of care
   # Acidemia
   ABG slightly improved today - 7.30/41/112/18/-5. Lactate was not
   elevated at 1.0 making metabolic acidosis from renal failure or uremia
   more likely.  Pt not a candidate for HD.
   -No further interventions
   # Aortic Stenosis
   Treatment of this is deferred pending decision about the above.
   Valvuloplasty will need to be repeated (if this is compatible with
   goals of care). Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty
   in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in her
   hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her lasix
   were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be severely
   fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not respond
   well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.
   - Continue bumex and metolazone with goal of net negative 1.5L today
   - No further escalations
   # Respiratory Failure and Intubation
   - Preserve for now given mental status and edema
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and digoxin. Coumadin was
   being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding coumading in case pt
   undergoes valvuloplasty. Now on heparin gtt while INR subtherapeutic.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - Continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - DC labs
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 3.8 today. Per previous notes, is ATN
   - Will attempt diuresis with bumex/metolazone, as above
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   - Continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - Continue metoprolol as above
   - Continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - Trach in place
   - Continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   # Pressor Requirement: Pt weaned off of pressors.
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   # Fevers: Afebrile for several days now. Per notes, pt completed
   vanc/cefepime 7 day course for pneumonia as well as 3 days course of
   abx for positive UA.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, and colon adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures and subsequently developed subclinical seizures, deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and failure resulting in intubation. She also has acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and is currently comatose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 3.8, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to multiple factors including dehydration, hypotension, or use of nephrotoxic medications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory acidosis and failure. She has a tracheostomy in place.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to pressure ulcers and infections.
4. Aortic stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and may require repeat valvuloplasty. However, the decision will be based on the patient's current condition and goals of care.
5. Seizures: The patient has experienced seizures, both tonic-clonic and subclinical, which need to be managed with appropriate antiepileptic medication.
6. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory"

The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, erythromycin, Motrin (ibuprofen), ampicillin, lactose, latex, and Adaptic (topical). The patient received various infusions and medications, including Famotidine, Dilantin, and others.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: The patient has impaired skin integrity, renal failure, respiratory failure (not ARDS), aortic stenosis, and a seizure.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/54 to 121/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set volume of 400 mL, respiratory support, and an FiO2 of 50%. The patient's weight has increased from 80.1 kg at admission to 109 kg currently.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 22 mmHg, with a total fluid input of 1,619 mL, including 505 mL of TDF, 845 mL of TF, and 614 mL of IVF. Total fluid output is 367 mL, including 92 mL of blood products. Urine output is also 367 mL, with an NG output of 367 mL.

Laboratory results indicate elevated potassium levels of 387 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin at 7.6 g/dL, elevated creatinine at 3.8 mg/dL, and decreased sodium levels at 129 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, increased total bilirubin, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal arterial blood gas results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate potential renal failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and decreased tidal volume may suggest respiratory failure.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has pressure ulcers or sores, indicating impaired skin integrity.
4. Aortic stenosis: The patient's medical history includes aortic stenosis, which can lead to complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure, which can have various causes and may recur if not properly managed.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, laboratory values, and respiratory support to prevent further deterioration and manage potential complications."

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 AORTIC STENOSIS
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures (now none for a week on EEG) and deteriorating
   mental status, aspiration pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and
   failure resulting in intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension required
   phenylephrine. Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting
   cardiologist.
   # Coma, seizures, Goals of Care
   Comatose with some brainstem reflexes. No seizures for some time. No
   evidence of cortical function. BUN 124 and patient has been
   intermittently hypotensive. Therefore differential includes (also
   possible multifactorial) uremia, anoxic brain injury and
   carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy (although very unlikely).
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12011**] has discussed issue of Phenobarbital with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12004**]
   (neurology) and  decision made to not restart phenobarbital.
   - No need for LP given carcinomatosis is an extremely unlikely cause of
   coma and metabolic toxicities (many different sources) seem more
   likely.
   - Will continue phenytoin for now given not contributing to mental
   status at such low concentration
   - DNR/DNI focus on comfort
   - Will discontinue labs
   - No escalation of care
   # Acidemia
   ABG slightly improved today - 7.30/41/112/18/-5. Lactate was not
   elevated at 1.0 making metabolic acidosis from renal failure or uremia
   more likely.  Pt not a candidate for HD.
   -No further interventions
   # Aortic Stenosis
   Treatment of this is deferred pending decision about the above.
   Valvuloplasty will need to be repeated (if this is compatible with
   goals of care). Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty
   in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in her
   hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her lasix
   were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be severely
   fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not respond
   well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.
   - Continue bumex and metolazone
   - No further escalations
   # Respiratory Failure and Intubation
   - Preserve for now given mental status and edema
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and digoxin. Coumadin was
   being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding coumading in case pt
   undergoes valvuloplasty.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - Continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - DC labs
   - DC IV heparin given inconsistent with goals of care
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 3.8 today. Per previous notes, is ATN
   - Will attempt diuresis with bumex/metolazone, as above
   - Appreciate renal recs.
   - Continue to monitor fluid status otherwise
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - Continue metoprolol as above
   - Continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - Trach in place
   - Continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   # Pressor Requirement: Pt weaned off of pressors.
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   # Fevers: Afebrile for several days now. Per notes, pt completed
   vanc/cefepime 7 day course for pneumonia as well as 3 days course of
   abx for positive UA.
   - Tylenol PRN fever

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic Clostridium difficile infection, and previous valvuloplasty. She was admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures and subsequently flashed on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. The course has been complicated by subclinical seizures, deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, acute respiratory failure resulting in intubation, acute renal failure, hypotension requiring phenylephrine, and impaired skin integrity.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 3.8, indicating acute renal failure. The cause is likely multifactorial, including sepsis, hypotension, and possible medication-related nephrotoxicity.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory failure. She has undergone tracheostomy placement and is on assisted ventilation with a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 74.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity with non-healing sores, likely due to immobility, poor nutrition, and compromised circulation.
4. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which requires further management and consideration for repeat valvular"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 AORTIC STENOSIS
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures (now none for a week on EEG) and deteriorating
   mental status, aspiration pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and
   failure resulting in intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension required
   phenylephrine. Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting
   cardiologist.
   # Coma, seizures, Goals of Care
   Comatose with some brainstem reflexes. No seizures for some time. No
   evidence of cortical function. BUN 124 and patient has been
   intermittently hypotensive. Therefore differential includes (also
   possible multifactorial) uremia, anoxic brain injury and
   carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy (although very unlikely).
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12011**] has discussed issue of Phenobarbital with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12004**]
   (neurology) and  decision made to not restart phenobarbital.
   - No need for LP given carcinomatosis is an extremely unlikely cause of
   coma and metabolic toxicities (many different sources) seem more
   likely.
   - Will continue phenytoin for now given not contributing to mental
   status at such low concentration
   - DNR/DNI focus on comfort
   - Will discontinue labs
   - No escalation of care
   # Acidemia
   ABG slightly improved today - 7.30/41/112/18/-5. Lactate was not
   elevated at 1.0 making metabolic acidosis from renal failure or uremia
   more likely.  Pt not a candidate for HD.
   -No further interventions
   # Aortic Stenosis
   Treatment of this is deferred pending decision about the above.
   Valvuloplasty will need to be repeated (if this is compatible with
   goals of care). Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty
   in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in her
   hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her lasix
   were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be severely
   fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not respond
   well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.
   - Continue bumex and metolazone
   - No further escalations
   # Respiratory Failure and Intubation
   - Preserve for now given mental status and edema
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and digoxin. Coumadin was
   being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding coumading in case pt
   undergoes valvuloplasty.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - Continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - DC labs
   - DC IV heparin given inconsistent with goals of care
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 3.8 today. Per previous notes, is ATN
   - No new interventions
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - Continue metoprolol as above
   - Continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - Trach in place
   - Continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   # Pressor Requirement: Pt weaned off of pressors.
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   # Fevers: Afebrile for several days now. Per notes, pt completed
   vanc/cefepime 7 day course for pneumonia as well as 3 days course of
   abx for positive UA.
   - Tylenol PRN fever

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p CABG, atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty, diastolic heart failure, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff, and now presents with acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, seizure, and coma. The patient's mental status has been deteriorating, and she is intubated in the ICU. She is severely fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not respond well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, indicated by a creatinine level of 3.8. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and uremia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and is intubated. There is a concern for respiratory acidosis and failure. Tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation support may be required.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has marked upper and lower extremity edema, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers and skin breakdown.
4. Seizure: The patient had a new onset tonic-clonic seizure, and there is a possibility of recurrent seizures due to the underlying conditions.
5. Aortic Stenosis"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 AORTIC STENOSIS
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures (now none for a week on EEG) and deteriorating
   mental status, aspiration pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and
   failure resulting in intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension required
   phenylephrine. Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting
   cardiologist.
   # Coma, seizures, Goals of Care
   Comatose with some brainstem reflexes. No seizures for some time. No
   evidence of cortical function. BUN 124 and patient has been
   intermittently hypotensive. Therefore differential includes (also
   possible multifactorial) uremia, anoxic brain injury and
   carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy (although very unlikely).
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12011**] has discussed issue of Phenobarbital with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12004**]
   (neurology) and  decision made to not restart phenobarbital.
   - No need for LP given carcinomatosis is an extremely unlikely cause of
   coma and metabolic toxicities (many different sources) seem more
   likely.
   - Will continue phenytoin for now given not contributing to mental
   status at such low concentration
   - DNR/DNI focus on comfort
   - Will discontinue labs
   - No escalation of care
   # Acidemia
   ABG slightly improved today - 7.30/41/112/18/-5. Lactate was not
   elevated at 1.0 making metabolic acidosis from renal failure or uremia
   more likely.  Pt not a candidate for HD.
   -No further interventions
   # Aortic Stenosis
   Treatment of this is deferred pending decision about the above.
   Valvuloplasty will need to be repeated (if this is compatible with
   goals of care). Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty
   in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in her
   hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her lasix
   were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be severely
   fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not respond
   well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.
   - Continue bumex and metolazone
   - No further escalations
   # Respiratory Failure and Intubation
   - Preserve for now given mental status and edema
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and digoxin. Coumadin was
   being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding coumading in case pt
   undergoes valvuloplasty.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - Continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - DC labs
   - DC IV heparin given inconsistent with goals of care
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 3.8 today. Per previous notes, is ATN
   - No new interventions
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - Continue metoprolol as above
   - Continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - Trach in place
   - Continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   # Pressor Requirement: Pt weaned off of pressors.
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   # Fevers: Afebrile for several days now. Per notes, pt completed
   vanc/cefepime 7 day course for pneumonia as well as 3 days course of
   abx for positive UA.
   - Tylenol PRN fever

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly woman with multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, colon adenocarcinoma, and chronic c.difficile. She was admitted with new onset tonic-clonic seizures and subsequently flashed on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Her course has been complicated by subclinical seizures, deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and failure resulting in intubation. She also has acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and a history of seizures.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 112/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on supplemental oxygen. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 124 mg/dL, creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dL, and potassium level of 4.7 mEq/L. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.30, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 41 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 18 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination findings include marked upper and lower"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 AORTIC STENOSIS
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   86 y/o female with hx CAD s/p CABG, Afib, with severe AS s/p
   valvuloplasty, diastolic CHF, colon adenocarcinoma, chronic c.diff,
   admitted with new onset tonic clonic seizures, who subsequently flashed
   on the floor in the setting of holding lasix. Course complicated by
   subclinical seizures (now none for a week on EEG) and deteriorating
   mental status, aspiration pneumonia, now w/respiratory acidosis and
   failure resulting in intubation ([**2-7**]), ARF, hypotension required
   phenylephrine. Transferred to CCU at request of family and consulting
   cardiologist.
   # Coma, seizures, Goals of Care
   Comatose with some brainstem reflexes. No seizures for some time. No
   evidence of cortical function. BUN 124 and patient has been
   intermittently hypotensive. Therefore differential includes (also
   possible multifactorial) uremia, anoxic brain injury and
   carcinoatosis/paraneoplastic encephalopathy (although very unlikely).
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12011**] has discussed issue of Phenobarbital with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12004**]
   (neurology) and  decision made to not restart phenobarbital.
   - No need for LP given carcinomatosis is an extremely unlikely cause of
   coma and metabolic toxicities (many different sources) seem more
   likely.
   - Will continue phenytoin for now given not contributing to mental
   status at such low concentration
   - DNR/DNI focus on comfort
   - Will discontinue labs
   - No escalation of care
   # Acidemia
   ABG slightly improved today - 7.30/41/112/18/-5. Lactate was not
   elevated at 1.0 making metabolic acidosis from renal failure or uremia
   more likely.  Pt not a candidate for HD.
   -No further interventions
   # Aortic Stenosis
   Treatment of this is deferred pending decision about the above.
   Valvuloplasty will need to be repeated (if this is compatible with
   goals of care). Pt with known severe aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty
   in [**11-3**]. She was initially on the CCU service early in her
   hospitalization in the setting of flash pulmonary edema when her lasix
   were held. Now, she is intubated in the ICU. Continues to be severely
   fluid overloaded and oliguric, positive ~30L Los. She does not respond
   well to lasix/diuril/bumex but is also not a candidate for HD.
   - Continue bumex and metolazone
   - No further escalations
   # Respiratory Failure and Intubation
   - Preserve for now given mental status and edema
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Pt has good control of HR on beta blockade and digoxin. Coumadin was
   being held before for trach/PEG. Now, holding coumading in case pt
   undergoes valvuloplasty.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mg TID
   - Continue digoxin 0.0625 mg daily
   - DC labs
   - DC IV heparin given inconsistent with goals of care
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 3.8 today. Per previous notes, is ATN
   - No new interventions
   # Coronary Artery Disease: Pt is s/p CABG [**97**]/[**2188**].
   - Continue metoprolol as above
   - Continue aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily
   # Respiratory Failure: Now, s/p trach.
   - Trach in place
   - Continue albuterol/atrovent PRN
   # Pressor Requirement: Pt weaned off of pressors.
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue Synthroid 75 mcg daily
   # Fevers: Afebrile for several days now. Per notes, pt completed
   vanc/cefepime 7 day course for pneumonia as well as 3 days course of
   abx for positive UA.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, colon adenocarcinoma, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. She was admitted with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures and deteriorating mental status. The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure and has acute renal failure. She is also experiencing impaired skin integrity and has a history of atrial fibrillation. The patient's condition has been complicated by aspiration pneumonia, hypotension, and fluid overload. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and the focus is on comfort care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a potential complication of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 3.8, indicating acute renal failure. This can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infection.
4. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which can lead to syncope, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
5. Colon Adenocarcinoma: The patient's underlying colon adenocarcinoma may contribute to her"

The course has been complicated by subclinical seizures, deteriorating mental status, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and failure requiring intubation. The patient also has acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, aortic stenosis, and seizure disorder.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 3.8. The patient is oliguric and fluid overloaded, making them not a candidate for hemodialysis (HD). No further interventions are planned.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. They are currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The plan is to preserve the current ventilatory support given the patient's mental status and edema.

3. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and is scheduled for repeat valvuloplasty. However, the treatment of this condition is"
