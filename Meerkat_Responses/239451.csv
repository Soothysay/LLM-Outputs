   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had several episodes of hypoglycemia in the morning and had no
   IV access.   NPH stopped. Unable to get PICC.  Right IJ placed.
   ABG showed persistently elevated but improving PCO2 during the day.
   Mental status improved to AxOx3 and patient was weaned to nasal
   canula.  She used O2 overnight.
   She was evaluated by neurology who felt she had either myoclonus or
   partial seizure secondary to hypercarbia.  They did not feel her
   presentation was consistent with a neuromuscular disease.  They
   recommended EEG, MRI and TSH.
   A CT head showed no hemorrhage or edema and moerately severe chronic
   microvascular infarct.
   Her S Tox and UTox were negative.
   Febrile to 100.6, patient cultured.  UA was positive, so started on
   cipro for presumed UTI.

   This discrepancy between the size of the heart silhouette and the

   This finding should be correlated clinically. The visualized osseous

   respiratory failure and altered mental status.
   .
   #Delta MS/hypercapnic respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant, but
   markedly improved with Bipap and now back to normal mental status.  She
   likely has underlying pulmonary disease; it may be that the addition of
   nasal cannula oxygen on [**9-8**] decreased her hypoxic drive leading to
   hypercapnic respiratory failure.   She also has an infection (UTI)
   which may contribute.  I suspect she has undiagnosed obstructive sleep
   apnea as well.  Her serum/urine tox: negative for narcotics/benzos.
   Reglan has been associated with altered mental status, I question
   whether this may have contributed.   Neurology felt she is unlikely to
   have an underlying neuromuscular disorder.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM). She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with hypercarbic respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient had several episodes of hypoglycemia and lacked IV access. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed persistently elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels during the day, but they were improving. The patient's mental status improved, and she was weaned to a nasal cannula while receiving supplemental oxygen.

Neurology evaluation suggested that the patient's altered mental status could be due to myoclonus or a partial seizure secondary to hypercarbia. They recommended an electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head revealed no hemorrhage or edema but showed a moderately severe chronic microvascular infarct.

The patient was febrile with a temperature of 100.6°F and was started on ciprofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection (UTI). The urine analysis was positive. The patient's allergies include Diovan (valsartan), drowsiness/fatigue; Mavik (trandolapril), cough; and Norvasc (amlodipine besylate), nausea/vomiting. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [2193-9-10] at 12:03 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate (HR) of 64 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 132/56 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99% on nasal cannula with supplemental oxygen. The patient is on bilateral positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.4 g/dL, glucose of 147 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 137 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 4.7 mEq/L, and magnesium (Mg++) of 2.1 mg/dL. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.30, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 82 mmHg, oxygen saturation (PaO2) of 357, and respiratory rate (RR) of 11 breaths per minute. Chest X-ray findings indicate bilateral opacification in the lower lungs, most likely consistent with bilateral pleural effusion and associated basal atelectasis. The heart silhouette is enlarged, and there is bilateral mild prominence of the interstitium. A CT scan of the head shows no hemorrhage or edema but reveals a moderately severe chronic microvascular infarct.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which improved with the use of BiPAP.
2. Infection: The patient has a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with ciprofloxacin. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status was altered, and further investigations are needed to determine the underlying cause, including an EEG, MRI, and TSH test.
4. Chronic microvascular infarct: The CT scan of the head revealed a moderately severe chronic microvascular infarct. This may contribute to the patient's altered mental status and neurological symptoms.
5. Pleural effusion: The chest X-ray indicates the presence of bilateral pleural effusion. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, involving multiple medical complications. Close monitoring and appropriate management are essential to optimize her health outcomes."

   FINDINGS: Compared to [**9-7**], there is bilateral opacification in the

   lungs, most likely consistent with bilateral effusion and associated
   basilar
   atelectasis bilaterally. The heart silhouette is enlarged as also noted
   on
   the previous scan, and there is bilateral mild prominence of the
   interstitium.
   This discrepancy between the size of the heart silhouette and the
   interstitial
   markings might raise the question of cardiomyopathy or pericardial
   effusion.
   This finding should be correlated clinically. The visualized osseous
   and soft
   tissue structures are unchanged compared to the previous scan.

   atelectasis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM). She was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient has had several episodes of hypoglycemia and required placement of a right internal jugular catheter. She has been on BiPAP support, weaned to a nasal cannula, and using supplemental oxygen. The patient's ABG showed persistently elevated but improving PCO2 throughout the day. Neurology evaluated the patient and suspected either myoclonus or a partial seizure secondary to hypercarbia. They recommended an EEG, MRI, and TSH. A CT head showed no hemorrhage or edema but revealed a moderately severe chronic microvascular infarct. The patient's S Tox and U Tox were negative, and she was febrile with a temperature of 100.6. Urine analysis was positive, so she was started on ciprofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection (UTI). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which indicates impaired oxygenation due to elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. This could be a result of her underlying pulmonary disease and may require further intervention such as mechanical ventilation.
2. Seizure Activity: The patient experienced shaking episodes, which were evaluated by"

   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had several episodes of hypoglycemia in the morning and had no
   IV access.   NPH stopped. Unable to get PICC.  Right IJ placed.
   ABG showed persistently elevated but improving PCO2 during the day.
   Mental status improved to AxOx3 and patient was weaned to nasal
   canula.  She used O2 overnight.
   She was evaluated by neurology who felt she had either myoclonus or
   partial seizure secondary to hypercarbia.  They did not feel her
   presentation was consistent with a neuromuscular disease.  They
   recommended EEG, MRI and TSH.
   A CT head showed no hemorrhage or edema and moerately severe chronic
   microvascular infarct.
   Her S Tox and UTox were negative.
   Febrile to 100.6, patient cultured.  UA was positive, so started on
   cipro for presumed UTI.

The patient is a 72-year-old female admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient experienced several episodes of hypoglycemia in the morning and did not have IV access. NPH was stopped, and a PICC line was unsuccessful, so a right IJ was placed. The ABG showed persistently elevated but improving PCO2 throughout the day. The patient's mental status improved to alert and oriented to person, place, and time (AxOx3), and she was weaned to a nasal cannula, using O2 overnight.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes, admitted for nausea and vomiting.
- She is now experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely chronic in nature.
- The patient's symptoms suggest neuromuscular weakness, and her abdominal distention may also be limiting her respiratory status.
- She has improved today, but further investigations are recommended, including an EEG, MRI, serial ABGs, and a sleep study.
- The patient has a history of chronic constipation and gastroparesis due to her longstanding diabetes.
- Her abdominal distention is being addressed with an aggressive bowel regimen.
- The patient has hypertension and will restart her antihypertensive medications.
- Her diabetes management involves holding insulin for now and restarting a diabetic diet and insulin sliding scale.
- The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and will restart her home medications.
- She is being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) with ciprofloxacin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hypercarbic respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further deterioration of neuromuscular weakness, exacerbation of CHF, and potential antibiotic-associated side effects from ciprofloxacin."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes admitted for nausea and vomiting, now presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's symptoms are suggestive of neuromuscular weakness, and abdominal distention is likely limiting her respiratory status. The patient's blood cultures were obtained, and she was started on ciprofloxacin due to a positive urine analysis. Her condition has improved with mental status improvement and improved Pco2 levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure may have an unclear etiology, possibly related to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and/or obesity hypoventilation. Further evaluations such as EEG, MRI, serial ABGs, and a sleep study are recommended.
2. Abdominal distention: The patient's abdominal distention may be caused by chronic constipation, nausea/vomiting, and gastroparesis due to her longstanding diabetes. An outpatient gastric emptying study is planned, and an aggressive bowel regimen is suggested.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension requires restarting antihypertensive medications.
4. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes management should involve restarting a diabetic diet and insulin sliding scale. Holding insulin for now is advised as the patient was hypoglycemic yesterday.
5. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's CHF should be managed by restarting home medications including lasix."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM) who was transferred to the MICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure and altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with an upper urinary tract infection (UTI) and is currently on ciprofloxacin. The patient's serum and urine toxicology screens were negative for narcotics and benzodiazepines. She is suspected to have underlying pulmonary disease, possibly obstructive sleep apnea. The patient's abdominal distension is most likely due to gastroparesis. She has a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with previous left superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenting and angioplasty. Her blood pressure remains high despite being on atenolol, and her diabetes is being managed with a diabetic diet and insulin sliding scale (HISS). The patient's CHF status is unknown, with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) that may be decreased. The patient's cardiac echo showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), but overall left ventricular systolic function is normal. There is no evidence of mitral or aortic regurgitation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypercapnic respiratory failure, which has improved with the use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)"

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes who was admitted for nausea and vomiting. She is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to neuromuscular weakness and abdominal distention limiting her respiratory status. The patient also has chronic constipation and may have gastroparesis. Her blood pressure is high, and she has diabetes, congestive heart failure, and a urinary tract infection. The patient has been receiving treatment with various medications, including insulin, antihypertensives, diuretics, antibiotics, and proton pump inhibitors. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP 7 and has a goal SpO2 low 90s. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 176/70 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological status is attentive and follows simple commands, but movement and tone assessments were not performed. The patient's laboratory results show elevated glucose levels and slightly abnormal kidney function. Potential complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and poor glycemic control."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes admitted for nausea and vomiting. She is now experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to neuromuscular weakness and abdominal distention limiting her respiratory status. The patient also has hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and a urinary tract infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbia may be exacerbated by supplemental oxygen provided on the floor. It is important to monitor her oxygen levels and consider using an autoset device instead of CPAP.
2. Abdominal distention: The patient's abdominal distention could be due to chronic constipation, nausea/vomiting, and gastroparesis caused by longstanding diabetes. An outpatient gastric emptying study is planned.
3. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be managed with antihypertensives.
4. Diabetes: The patient's blood sugar levels are elevated, so regular insulin sliding scale should be continued, and NPH should be added once fingersticks consistently show higher levels.
5. Congestive heart failure: The patient's CHF medications should be restarted, including Lasix.
6. Urinary tract infection: The patient is receiving Cipro for the UTI.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be necessary for a more comprehensive analysis."
