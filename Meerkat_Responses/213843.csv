   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 year old female with HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia who presents
   with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap around territory.
   S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.
   -Continue ASA, plavix, statin
   -Hold BB until more hemodynamically stable
   -f/u AM ECG
   -Trend CEZ until peak
   - Transfuse for low Hct in setting of coronary disease, 2u pRBC
   - post-transfusion Hct f/u
   .
   # PUMP: Currently in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, on 1
   inotrope now (not on pressors). Clearly volume overloaded on exam and
   cxr and by cath values. Elevated PA diastolic.
   - Continue IABP for now but will try to wean
   - Continue milrinone for now but will try to wean (priority, wean IABP
   first due to patient with PAD)
   - Monitor CI/CO via PA
   - Will attempt to remove fluid via CRRT but if uop improves will try
   lasix
   - TTE f/u
   - Heparin gtt for IABP and through visualization of apical akinesis on
   TTE
   - f/u AM CXR
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath
   lab. Temp pacer in but now mostly native complexes.
   -Continue temp pacer for now but consider removal in am; plan: decrease
   level to 60, monitor, and without need, then can remove
   -ECG f/u
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**].
   Likely from poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now
   with muddy brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and
   anuria immediately post cath. Also received 320cc of contrast today so
   will likely worsen over next 24-48hrs.
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
   - Hyperkalemia resolved
 [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - Finish PO NAC course for post-cath protection
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver.
   -Trend
   .
   # IDDM: Initially high BS on admission.
   -d/c insulin gtt
   -start glargine 15U qhs and ISS
   -will likely need to uptitrate once start tube feeds
   .
   # HTN: Hold home hypertensive regimen until more HD stable.
   -Plan to start with metoprolol first
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Atorvastatin 80mg

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, who presented with acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. She underwent balloon myocardial sympatholysis (BMS) to the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's current condition includes:

1. Coronaries: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory. She is to continue ASA, Plavix, and statin therapy, hold beta-blockers until more hemodynamically stable, follow up with an ECG, trend creatine kinase (CK) levels until peak, and consider transfusion for low hematocrit in the setting of coronary disease.

2. Pump: The patient is in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, on one inotrope now (not on pressors), clearly volume overloaded on exam and chest X-ray (CXR), and elevated pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. She will continue intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for now but will attempt to wean it off. She will also continue milrinone for now but will try to wean it off, prioritize weaning off IABP first due to patient with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hyperlipidemia. She presented with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The patient's current condition is critical, as indicated by the need for invasive ventilation and various lines such as IABP line, PA catheter, dialysis catheter, and arterial line. She is experiencing cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, requiring two pressors/inotropes. The patient is also volume overloaded, as shown on examination and chest X-ray, with elevated pulmonary artery diastolic pressure.

Renal failure has been identified, likely due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure and contrast-induced nephropathy from the recent catheterization. The patient has hyperkalemia and anuria, along with muddy brown casts in urine analysis.

Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are noted, likely due to ""shock liver."" Strict glycemic control is being maintained with insulin gtt. Antihypertensive medications have been held until further stabilization.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 57 year old female with HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia who presents
   with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap around territory.
   S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.
   -Continue ASA, plavix, statin
   -Hold BB until more HD stable
   -ECG in am
   -Integrillin to finish 18 hour drip
   -Trend CEZ until peak
   .
   # PUMP: Currently in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, on 2
   pressors/inotropes. Clearly volume overloaded on exam and cxr. Elevated
   PA diastolic.
   - Continue IABP for now
   - Continue dopamine and milrinone for now but will try to wean
   - Monitor CI/CO via PA
   - Will attempt to remove fluid via CRRT but if uop improves will try
   lasix
   - TTE in am
   - Heparin gtt until lack of apical akinesis shown on TTE
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath
   lab. Temp pacer in but now mostly native complexes.
   -Continue temp pacer for now but consider removal in am
   -ECG in am
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**].
   Likely from poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now
   with muddy brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and
   anuria immediately post cath. Also received 320cc of contrast today so
   will likely worsen over next 24-48hrs.
   - Renal c/s for CVVH
   - Treat hyperkalemia with calcium, insulin, D50, and bicarb
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - Finish PO NAC course of 2 more doses
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver.
   -Trend
   .
   # IDDM: Initially high BS on admission.
   -Strict control with Insulin gtt
   .
   # HTN: Hold home hypertensive regimen until more HD stable.
   -Plan to start with metoprolol first
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Atorvastatin 80mg

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with cardiogenic shock. The patient has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is experiencing multiple complications. These include cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and hyperkalemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is already experiencing cardiogenic shock, which is a serious condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This can lead to organ damage and failure if not properly managed.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, indicated by the presence of muddy brown casts on urine analysis, hyperkalemia, and anuria immediately post-catheterization. This is likely due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure and the recent administration of contrast during catheterization. If left untreated, acute renal failure can progress to chronic renal failure.

3. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient"

   24 Hour Events:
   -TTE:  EF 50-55%
   The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the mid
   to distal septum, distal inferior wall, and possibly apex (not well
   visualized) . Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
   (LVEF 50-55%). The remaining left ventricular segments contract
   normally. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. **The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
   underestimated.** There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular dysfunction consistent with CAD.
   Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Small circumferential pericardial
   effusion.

   # Hypotension/Volume Status:  TTE yesterday showed improved LV function
   with EF 50-55%, swan numbers consistent with volume depletion.  Renal
   recommended continuing to remove fluid with CVVH as MAP tolerates, as
   patient likely intravascularly volume deplete but total body fluid
   overloaded and needs to slowly re-equilibrate.
   -Run CVVH even for now
   -Monitor swan numbers throughout the day to determine volume status
   -Decrease PEEP to help relieve hypotension
   -Titrate down Milrinone until off, as this will likely help increase BP
   and patient

   # PUMP: Currently in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, on 1
   inotrope now (not on pressors). Clearly volume overloaded on exam and

   - Wean and d/c Milrinone as above
   - Wean IABP as above
   - Monitor CI/CO via PA
   - CVVH even for now, readdress today based on swan numbers
   - Continue Heparin gtt for poor visualization of apex on TTE, possible
   apical akinesis

   # CORONARIES: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap around territory.
   S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient has been in the ICU and has undergone several interventions including CVVH, pacemaker placement, and IABP. She is currently experiencing hypotension, renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and poor glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential hypotension. This could be due to cardiogenic shock and fluid overload.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has signs of acute renal failure, as indicated by muddy brown casts on urine analysis, hyperkalemia, and anuria. This may be a result of poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure and recent contrast exposure.
3. Elevated Liver Function Tests: The patient's liver function tests are markedly elevated, suggesting a possible ""shock liver."" It is important to monitor and trend these levels.
4. Poor Glycemic Control: The patient initially had high blood sugar levels on admission. It is necessary to uptitrate insulin and continue with ISS to manage blood glucose levels effectively.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient had an acute inferior STEMI in the distal LAD wrap-around territory. Continued monitoring and management of coronary disease are crucial.
6. Arrhythmia: The patient experienced an episode of sinus"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon-mounted stent (BMS) placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD).

Current Assessment:

The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, on one inotrope, and clearly volume overloaded on examination and chest X-ray. She has elevated pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. She also has an episode of sinus arrest, but is currently in normal sinus rhythm with temporary pacing.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is experiencing poor cardiac output and is in cardiogenic shock. This can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs, including the brain, kidneys, and heart itself.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely started with acute renal failure before admission to the hospital. It may be due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Her urine analysis shows muddy brown casts, indicating acute tubular necrosis. Hyperkalemia and anuria were also observed.

3. Elevated Liver Enzymes: The patient has markedly elevated liver enzymes, which may be indicative of shock liver.

4. Hyperglycemia: Initially high blood sugar levels were observed, suggesting uncontrolled diabetes.

   .
   # PUMP: Currently in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, on
   dopamine gtt.  Clearly volume overloaded on exam and cxr and by cath
   values. Elevated PA diastolic.
   - Off IABP at this time [**1-31**] development of compartment sx in LLE.
   - Continue dopamine.
   - Monitor CI/CO via PA
   - CVVHD for volume removal.
   - TTE f/u
   - Heparin gtt for IABP and through visualization of apical akinesis on
   TTE
   - f/u AM CXR
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath
   lab. Temp pacer in but now mostly native complexes.
   -Continue temp pacer for now but consider removal in am; plan: decrease
   level to 60, monitor, and without need, then can remove
   -ECG f/u
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**].
   Likely from poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now
   with muddy brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and
   anuria immediately post cath. Also received 320cc of contrast today so
   will likely worsen over next 24-48hrs.
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
   - Hyperkalemia resolved

   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - Finish PO NAC course for post-cath protection
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver.
   -Trend
   .
   # IDDM: Initially high BS on admission.
   -d/c insulin gtt
   -start glargine 15U qhs and ISS
   -will likely need to uptitrate once start tube feeds

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, requiring inotropic support with dopamine.
2. Volume overload as evidenced by physical examination findings, chest X-ray, and catheterization lab values.
3. Elevated pulmonary artery diastolic pressure.
4. Compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE), which necessitated fasciotomy.
5. Acute renal failure with muddy brown casts on urine analysis, hyperkalemia, and anuria.
6. Elevated liver enzymes, likely due to shock liver.
7. Initial high blood sugar levels, indicating uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.
8. Hypertension requiring hold of home hypertensive regimen until more hemodynamically stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening cardiogenic shock and cardiac output.
2. Development of further complications related to acute renal failure, such as fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.
3. Progression of compartment syndrome in the LLE.
4. Continued elevation of liver enzymes"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia presenting with acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
- She underwent balloon stenting to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery.
- The patient developed compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity and had a fasciotomy.
- She also experienced an episode of sinus arrest and is currently on dopamine for cardiogenic shock.
- The patient has acute renal failure, likely from poor forward flow due to cardiogenic failure, and has developed rhabdomyolysis with markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK).
- Other medical complications include elevated liver function tests, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia.
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow.
- She has been on heparin, midazolam, fentanyl, dopamine, pantoprazole, and calcium gluconate infusions.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 110/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased hematocrit, creatinine, and potassium levels.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia presenting with an acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and subsequent complications. 

The patient has undergone several interventions, including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stents to the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD), continuous aspirin and Plavix, and statin therapy.

The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, receiving dopamine and levophed infusions, and is on mechanical ventilation. She has evidence of volume overload as seen on examination and chest X-ray. The patient also has acute renal failure with muddy brown casts, hyperkalemia, and anuria. She developed rhabdomyolysis with significantly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. 

The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), likely due to shock liver. She has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and is being managed with insulin gtt and glargine. Her hypertension is being held until she is more hemodynamically stable. She is also on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening cardiogenic shock, acute kidney injury, persistent rhabdomyolysis, hepatic dysfunction, hyperglycemia, electroly"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), cardiogenic shock, and subsequent complications. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, acute renal failure, elevated liver enzymes, hyperkalemia, and anemia. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O.

The patient is also receiving multiple vasopressors and inotropes for hemodynamic support, including dopamine at 16 mcg/kg/min, as well as vasopressin and norepinephrine. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is low at 7 mmHg, and there is evidence of fluid overload with an increased pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PAD) of 24 mmHg. The patient's urine output is very low at 5 mL in the past 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI (heart attack) and cardiogenic shock. She underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of bare-metal stents in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The patient has multiple medical complications and ongoing issues. These include:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, as indicated by the need for dopamine infusion. She is volume overloaded, as shown by physical examination, chest X-ray, and catheterization values.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely started with acute renal failure before presentation, possibly due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. This is supported by muddy brown casts on urine analysis, hyperkalemia, and anuria immediately post catheterization. The recent contrast administration may worsen renal function over the next 24-48 hours.

3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient had elevated potassium levels (6.8), which has since resolved. Other electrolyte imbalances may be present, and caution should be taken to avoid nephrotoxic agents.

4. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has markedly elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), indicating a ""shock liver."" Trending of liver function tests is planned"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). 

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is experiencing several medical complications. These include cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, acute renal failure with muddy brown casts, rhabdomyolysis, compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE), elevated liver enzymes, hyperkalemia, and hyperglycemia.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 110/35 mmHg and tachycardia with a heart rate of 103 beats per minute. She is on multiple medications including dopamine, levophed, heparin, calcium gluconate, insulin, and midazolam.

The patient's respiratory support consists of mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and subsequent cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon-mounted stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Coronaries: The patient had an acute inferior STEMI in the distal LAD territory. She received a PCI with BMS placement in the LMCA and LAD. The plan is to continue ASA, Plavix, and statin therapy. Beta-blockers will be held until the patient is more hemodynamically stable, and follow-up ECG is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia presenting with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon-mounted stent (BMS) to the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management of her condition.

The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure with muddy brown casts, hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE). She also has an infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae.

The patient is receiving various treatments including dopamine and levophed infusions for hemodynamic support, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for renal failure, CVVH for volume removal, heparin drip for anticoagulation, and prophylactic antibiotics for infection prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation was cardiogenic shock due to an acute inferior STEMI. This condition is characterized by poor cardiac output and hypotension. The patient is currently being managed with dopamine and levophed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 37.5°C, heart rate is 103 bpm, blood pressure is 110/35 mmHg, respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on supplemental oxygen.
- Hemodynamics: The patient is in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, requiring dopamine and levophed infusions. There is evidence of volume overload on examination and chest X-ray, as well as elevated pulmonary artery diastolic pressure.
- Renal function: The patient has acute renal failure likely due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. There are muddy brown casts on urine analysis, hyperkalemia, and anuria post-cardiac catheterization.
- Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has developed rhabdomyolysis with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels.
- Liver function tests: The patient has markedly elevated liver enzymes, suggestive of shock liver.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and subsequent cardiogenic shock. She underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. 

She continues to be in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, requiring dopamine and levophed infusions. She is volume overloaded, as indicated by examination and chest X-ray findings, as well as elevated pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. 

She experienced an episode of sinus arrest but is currently in normal sinus rhythm. She has acute renal failure likely secondary to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure, resulting in muddy brown casts on urine analysis. She also developed rhabdomyolysis, with an elevated creatine kinase level. 

The patient developed compartment syndrome in her left lower extremity, necessitating a fasciotomy and wound vacuum-assisted closure. 

Her liver enzymes are markedly elevated, likely due to shock liver. She is currently on insulin for glycemic control. 

The patient has several other medical conditions, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's ongoing poor cardiac output and reliance on vasopressors indicate ongoing cardiogenic shock. This condition can lead to inadequate tissue perf"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and subsequent cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to LMCA and LAD. The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, requiring dopamine and levophed infusions. She has evidence of volume overload on examination and chest X-ray. She also has acute renal failure with muddy brown casts, hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity.

Potential Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, which can lead to further deterioration in cardiac function and potentially result in death.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, characterized by anuria, hyperkalemia, and muddy brown casts. This condition may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has rhabdomyolysis, as indicated by elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). If not treated promptly, it can lead to kidney damage and other complications.
4. Compartment Syndrome: The patient has compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity, which requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent tissue necrosis and potential limb loss.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a medical history of type I diabetes mellitus, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), chronic renal failure, and is currently in the ICU. The patient is experiencing hypotension, requiring dopamine and norepinephrine infusions to maintain blood pressure. The patient's cardiac function is compromised, as indicated by a TTE with an ejection fraction of 45% and hypokinesis of the distal septum and anterior wall. The patient is also on a ventilator, with PEEP decreased to 5 cmH2O and FiO2 set at 40%. The patient's respiratory support is being provided through an endotracheal tube. 

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) at 95,000, troponin-T at 7.99, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 4308 IU/L, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. Other lab abnormalities include elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 12.8 K/uL, elevated blood glucose level at 200 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) with values of 1050 and 2142, respectively. The patient's electrolytes show a low potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L and a low magnesium level of 1.9 mg/dL.

The patient has received various treatments, including insulin, dopamine,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of cardiogenic shock secondary to acute myocardial infarction. The patient's condition has been worsening, as indicated by downtrending cardiac enzymes (CKs) and hypotension that did not respond to milrinone. The patient received aggressive fluid resuscitation with 3.5 liters of intravenous fluids, resulting in improved pressures but subsequent desaturation requiring increased ventilator FiO2. 

The patient's hemodynamic parameters are unstable, with low blood pressure, decreased central venous pressure (CVP), and elevated pulmonary artery pressures (PAP). The mixed venous oxygen saturation is also low at 50-62%. The patient has received multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a significant drop in hematocrit from 33.0 to 23.4 and then 25.6. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hb), and elevated lactate levels. Kidney function tests reveal elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure. Liver function tests show elevated liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances are present, including hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. 

The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, acute myocardial infarction, chronic renal failure, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including heparin sodium, fentanyl, midazolam (versed), calcium gluconate (CRRT), dopamine, insulin, norepinephrine, and potassium chloride (CRRT). The patient is also on pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 110 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 96/42 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% on supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated in assist-control mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased pulses in both radial and dorsalis pedis arteries, and the neurologic examination is incomplete due to the patient's sedation and intubation. 

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening cardiogenic shock, acute kidney injury, sepsis, and further deterioration in organ function. Close monitoring and"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.
- The patient presented with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and experienced cardiogenic/distributive/hypovolemic shock.
- The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD).
- The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output.
- Inotropic support with dopamine and norepinephrine was initiated, and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was considered but not used due to the development of compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE).
- Fasciotomy was performed on the LLE, and wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) was applied.
- The patient developed acute renal failure, likely secondary to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. This was complicated by rhabdomyolysis, as indicated by elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels.
- Hyperkalemia was resolved with the use of potassium-binding resins and hemodialysis.
- The patient also experienced elevated liver enzymes and coagulation abnormalities, consistent with shock liver and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- Other complications include hypot"

   24 Hour Events:
   - downtrending CKs [**Numeric Identifier 8941**] --> [**Numeric Identifier 8956**] --> [**Numeric Identifier 8957**]
   - Trial of milrinone but patient's pressures would not tolerate.
   - continued to be hypotensive, began to push fluids aggressively.
   Patient received 3.5 L of IVF and displayed improved pressures and
   decreased pressor requirement.  However, patient's pressures again
   dropped soon after fluid boluses finished and patient began to
   desaturate, requiring increased vent FiO2 = 40% to maintain good
   saturation.
   - Hct dropped from 33.0 before fluids --> 23.4 --> rechecked as 25.6.
   Patient was transfused 2u pRBC.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. 

The patient's current condition is complicated by cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure with muddy brown casts and hyperkalemia, compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE), rhabdomyolysis, elevated liver function tests, and a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). 

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 96/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her blood glucose levels have been fluctuating. Other lab abnormalities include elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), liver enzymes, and creatine kinase (CK) levels, as well as low potassium and magnesium levels. 

The patient has been receiving dopamine and norepinephrine infusions to support her blood pressure. She underwent"

   1.7-1.9 with PA diastolic 20-24), on dopamine + levophed gtt.  Clearly
   volume overloaded on exam and cxr and by cath values. Elevated PA
   diastolic.  Currently, off IABP at this time [**1-31**] development of
   compartment sx in LLE.
   - will run CVVH slightly higher (goal +500 cc today)
   - will check hemodynamic profile q4 hours today
   - Continue dopamine + levophed and wean if possible.
   - Monitor CI/CO via PA.
   - last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 on heparin gtt for prophylaxis
   - f/u AM CXR

   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus
   arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.
   - NSR; continue monitoring on tele
   - ECG f/u

   # Acute renal failure: Likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**].
   Likely from poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now
   with muddy brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and
   anuria immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to
   [**Numeric Identifier **].  Now downtrending and hyper-K resolved.
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - given increase IVF, need to watch for hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis ( can give bicarb in D5W if need)

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and subsequent cardiogenic shock. The patient has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is experiencing multiple medical complications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 105 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 105/41 to 174/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia with occasional episodes of sinus arrest.

The patient's hemodynamic profile shows a cardiac output (CO) of 4.1 L/min, cardiac index (CI) of 2.2 L/min/m2, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) ranging from 50% to 62%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 7,885 mL with an output of 3,414 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 4,471 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), lactate, liver enzymes (AST and ALT), creatine kinase ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.2°F (37.9°C), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 113/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen, and a CVP of 14 mmHg. She is on several medications including midazolam, insulin, vasopressin, norepinephrine, fentanyl, and heparin.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronaries: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD. Continue ASA, Plavix.
2. Pump: Was in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output. Currently off IABP. Goal CVP >12, monitor CI/CO via PA, IVF bolus as needed, transfuse as needed to maintain HCT, continue NE + Vasopressin and wean if possible.
3. Anemia: Largest component is likely blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution from large volume IV repletion. Receiving 2"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and acute kidney injury. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease.

Upon admission, the patient was found to have a blood pressure of 87/33 mmHg, heart rate of 93 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

Initial laboratory results showed elevated blood glucose levels (159 mg/dL), elevated lactate levels (1.7 mmol/L), and signs of acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 23 mL/min/1.73m2. The patient also had elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 1050/2142), elevated cardiac enzymes (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 118/7.99), and elevated white blood cell count (18.9 K/uL).

The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) for empiric coverage. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells due to a hematocrit of 26%. The patient's cortisol levels were within normal range, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and distal left anterior descending artery. The patient has been in the intensive care unit (ICU) since admission.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient initially presented with poor cardiac output and required inotropic support with dopamine and norepinephrine. She also required intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support but developed compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE) due to the IABP and subsequently underwent fasciotomy and wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC).

2. Acute renal failure: The patient likely had pre-existing renal failure before presentation, which was complicated by hypoperfusion due to cardiogenic shock. This resulted in muddy brown casts in the urine analysis and hyperkalemia. She is currently undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with citrate anticoagulation.

3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), indicating rhabdomyolysis. This may be secondary to the compartment syndrome in the LLE. Her CK levels are trending down.

4. Infection: The patient has"

   # Acute renal failure: Likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**].
   Likely from poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now
   with muddy brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and
   anuria immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to
   [**Numeric Identifier **].  Now downtrending, though bumped yesterday and hyper-K
   resolved.   CK down again today.
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
   - if UOP continues to improve, now that CK is continuing to come down
   can consider trial off CVVH
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - given increase IVF, need to watch for hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis ( can give bicarb in D5W if need)

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to LMCA and LAD. The patient's current condition is complicated by cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated liver function tests, fever, compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity, and infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's initial presentation was cardiogenic shock, which required inotropic support and fluid management. Continuous monitoring of hemodynamics is necessary to optimize cardiac output and maintain adequate blood pressure.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with muddy brown casts on urine analysis. This indicates acute tubular necrosis, likely secondary to hypoperfusion from cardiogenic shock. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been initiated, and careful fluid management is required to avoid hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is likely due to dilutional effects from large volume IV repletion and possible consumption in the setting of an open leg wound. Heparin has been discontinued, and platelet transfusion is planned.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, primarily from blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. She presents with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She has been sedated and unable to provide her medical history. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions, and her labs indicate possible infection, anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, and elevated liver enzymes. She also has a fever and leukocytosis, compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity, and is on various medications including vasopressors, insulin, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient initially presented with cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, likely due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. This is further complicated by rhabdomyolysis and muddy brown casts on urine analysis.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to dilution from large volumes of PRBC transfusion, consumption related to an open leg wound, or HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia).
4. Infection: The patient has an elevated WBC count and fever, suggesting a possible infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of"

She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to LMCA and LAD. The patient experienced cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output and was on dopamine and levophed infusions. She also had a leg wound with open fasciotomy, resulting in anemia and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 105/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's physical examination showed right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, and warm skin without rash.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated troponin T, elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), elevated BUN and creatinine levels, hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia. The urinalysis showed muddy brown casts, and the urine output has been low.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory.
   S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically
   stable
   - Continue ASA, plavix.
   .
   # PUMP: Was in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9
   with PA diastolic 20-24), on dopamine + levophed gtt.  Clearly volume
   overloaded on exam and cxr and by cath values, however chronically
   behaving like intravascularly depleted. Elevated PA diastolic.
   Currently, off IABP at this time [**1-31**] development of compartment sx in
   LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for fluid resus.
   - will check hemodynamic profile q4 hours today
   - Continue to wean levo today.
   - Monitor CI/CO via PA.
   - IVF/blood bolus as needed to maintain BP, transfuse as needed to
   maintain hct >30.
   - last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 held heparin given open leg wound,
   persistent inability to maintain volume and HCT and thrombocytopenia.
   If hct stable and given negative HIT ab, will restart heparin gtt after
   observation for 24hrs.
   - f/u AM CXR
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus
   arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.
   - NSR; continue monitoring on tele
   - ECG f/u
   .
   #Anemia
 largest component is likely blood loss from open fasciotomy,
   contributory factors include dilution from large volume IV repletion.
   Transfuse RBC prn with hct goal of 30.   Heparin d/c
d in part to slow
   blood loss
   -  Will continue to monitor
   -  DIC labs were (-)
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 Plt count currently 86 from [**Age over 90 **] yesterday.  There
   is obvious concern for HIT given this is day 4 of heparin.  However
   dilutional with large volumes of PRBC and NS given recently.  There may
   be appropriate consumption given open leg wound.
   -  HIT ab were negative
   -  will transfuse plt on prn schedule.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**].
   Likely from poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now
   with muddy brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and
   anuria immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to
   [**Numeric Identifier **].  Now downtrending, though bumped yesterday and hyper-K
   resolved.   CK down again today.
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
   - if UOP continues to improve, now that CK is continuing to come down
   can consider trial off CVVH
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - given increase IVF, need to watch for hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis ( can give bicarb in D5W if need)
   .
   # fever/leukocytosis: patient has a markedly elevated WBC. Need to
   follow fever curve, has obvious source of fever (leg), but still need
   to consider other source of infection.
   - resend blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx and c.diff, cx CVVH line
   - if patient tolerates trial off of CVVH will favor removing line with
   low threshold for replacement than leaving this line in
   - on cefepime/vanco/flagyl
   - f/u ID c/s, appreciate input.
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-31**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   -    followed by Vsurg
  wound VAC
 input appreciated
   -    serial pulses, CK
   -    on vanc/cefepime/flagyl for coverage of infection.
   -   CK trending down
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver and rhabdo.
   -  trending
   .
   # IDDM
 on insulin gtt
   .
   # HTN: Hold home hypertensive regimen until more HD stable.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia
 Holding statin in setting of rhabdomyolysis /
   transaminitis.
   .
   # FEN: NPO, Nutrition C/S for TF recs.  NGT in appropriate position on
   CXR.
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   - DVT ppx with HSC
   - pain management IV fentanyl
   - bowel regimen

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD), and was also on beta-blockers which were held until more hemodynamically stable.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for multiple medical complications. These include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac output is still poor, and she is receiving dopamine and levophed infusions. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is elevated, indicating volume overload, but she is being monitored closely for any signs of hypovolemia. The plan is to continue weaning off levophed and maintain CVP above 12.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient has anuria and is showing muddy brown casts on urine analysis, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Her creatinine levels are elevated, and she is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The plan is to continue CVVH and monitor for improvement in urine output. If the patient's urine output improves and her creatinine levels start to trend down, a trial off CVVH may be considered.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient is currently in the ICU due to multiple complications including acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fever, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient initially presented with cardiogenic shock, which is a severe complication of a heart attack. It occurs when the heart fails to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The patient's poor cardiac output and elevated pulmonary artery diastolic pressure indicate ongoing issues with cardiac function.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, as evidenced by muddy brown casts in urine analysis and hyperkalemia. This may be due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure or the use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is significantly low, which could be caused by dilutional effects from large volume IV repletion, consumption due to an open leg wound, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - More hypoxic on ABG - changed vent setting PEEP to 12, FiO2 to 60
   - RT did deep suction and mini lavage, gotten mucous plug, repeat ABG
   and I/O check
   - Metabolic acidosis is likely a combination of hypercholeremic
   metabolic acidosis from volume repletion and fasciotomy.
   - elevate vancomycin trough, held vanc for today, recheck in AM.
   - restarted CVVH given metabolic acidosis, resolving.
   - followed Vascular rec for wound vac maintenance
   - ID was consulted - if increase WBC then scan her leg (CT), if
   oxygenation is worse consider re-scan and tapping the pleural effusion,
   follow stool c. diff., no need for coverage sinus findings.
   - restarted heparin gtt for cardiac apex dyskinesis
   - Large BM - pending c. diff, pm hct was stable at 27.2
   - resutured and cultured from her HD line
   - falling hct from 31->24.8, transfused 2 units of RBC.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and was subsequently admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to LMCA and LAD territories. 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient initially had poor cardiac output, and she required dopamine and levophed infusions. Currently, off IABP, she is showing signs of volume overload on examination and chest X-ray. The goal CVP is >12 for fluid resuscitation.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient likely developed acute renal failure before presentation, possibly due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. She now has muddy brown casts on urine analysis, hyperkalemia, and anuria post-catheterization. Rhabdomyolysis with elevated CK levels was also observed but is now downtrending. CVVH was unsuccessful initially but was restarted due to the need for renal support.

3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is primarily due to blood loss from the open fasciotomy, with contributory factors including dilution from large-volume IV repletion. The target hematocrit (Hct) goal is 30%. RBC transfusion is planned as needed.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/38 to 141/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient is receiving several medications including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, calcium gluconate (CRRT), and insulin. Additionally, the patient is on a ventilator with settings of Vt (set) at 500 mL, RR (set) at 18 breaths per minute, PEEP at 12 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and other parameters within normal limits.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of WBC, Hct, and Plt, as well as increased TCO2 and Glucose. Other lab parameters, such as Cr, PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, and D-dimer, are also abnormal. The patient's blood gases indicate respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net intake of 3,130 mL and output of 1,356 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,774 mL"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - More hypoxic on ABG - changed vent setting PEEP to 12, FiO2 to 60
   - RT did deep suction and mini lavage, gotten mucous plug, repeat ABG
   and I/O check
   - Metabolic acidosis is likely a combination of hypercholeremic
   metabolic acidosis from volume repletion and fasciotomy.
   - elevate vancomycin trough, held vanc for today, recheck in AM.
   - restarted CVVH given metabolic acidosis, resolving.
   - followed Vascular rec for wound vac maintenance
   - ID was consulted - if increase WBC then scan her leg (CT), if
   oxygenation is worse consider re-scan and tapping the pleural effusion,
   follow stool c. diff., no need for coverage sinus findings.
   - restarted heparin gtt for cardiac apex dyskinesis
   - Large BM - pending c. diff, pm hct was stable at 27.2
   - resutured and cultured from her HD line
   - falling hct from 31->24.8, transfused 2 units of RBC.

   with muddy brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and
   anuria immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to
   [**Numeric Identifier **].  Now downtrending, though bumped yesterday and hyper-K
   resolved.   CK down again.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications, including acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fever with leukocytosis, compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity, elevated liver enzymes, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely started with acute renal failure before admission due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. This has been complicated by muddy brown casts on urine analysis and hyperkalemia. The patient requires continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to anuria and elevated creatinine levels.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is around low 100s. There are several possible causes for thrombocytopenia in this patient, including dilutional effects from large volume IV repletion, consumption related to the open leg wound, and possible HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). Monitoring DIC labs and transfusing platelets as needed is recommended.

3. Anemia: The patient has significant anemia likely due to blood loss from the fasciotomy procedure and dil"

   - Metabolic acidosis is likely a combination of hypercholeremic
   metabolic acidosis from volume repletion and fasciotomy.
   - elevate vancomycin trough, held vanc for today, recheck in AM.
   - restarted CVVH given metabolic acidosis, resolving.
   - followed Vascular rec for wound vac maintenance

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and distal left anterior descending artery. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has signs of acute renal failure, including muddy brown casts on urine analysis, hyperkalemia, and anuria. This could be due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure and rhabdomyolysis.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) indicating rhabdomyolysis, which may be secondary to her acute STEMI and subsequent cardiogenic shock.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has a markedly elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an infection. Fever curve should be monitored, and other sources of infection need to be considered.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, possibly due to dilutional effects from large volume IV repletion and consumption secondary to open leg wound.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely caused by blood loss from the open fasciotomy and dilution from large volume IV repletion.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory.
   S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically
   stable
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   .
   # PUMP: Was in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9
   with PA diastolic 20-24), on dopamine + levophed gtt.  Clearly volume
   overloaded on exam and cxr and by cath values, however chronically
   behaving like intravascularly depleted. Elevated PA diastolic.
   Currently, off IABP at this time [**1-31**] development of compartment sx in
   LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for fluid resus.
   - will check hemodynamic profile q4 hours today
   - Continue to wean levophed today.
   - IVF/blood bolus as needed to maintain BP, transfuse as needed to
   maintain hct >30.
   - last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 restarted heparin gtt yesterday,
   hct drop noted this AM, transfused 2 units, consider stop heparin this
   AM
 f/u with renal prior to this as on CVVH.
   - f/u AM CXR
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus
   arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.
   - NSR; continue monitoring on tele
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**].
   Likely from poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now
   with muddy brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and
   anuria immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to
   [**Numeric Identifier **].  Now downtrending, though bumped yesterday and hyper-K
   resolved.   CK down again.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - resolving hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis ( can give bicarb in D5W
   if need)  - on CVVH.
   - f/u UOP, given elevated CVP, normal SVR will run I/O even to slightly
   negative.
   .
   # leukocytosis: patient has a markedly elevated WBC. Need to follow
   fever curve, has obvious source of fever (leg), but still need to
   consider other source of infection.  CT of abd was negative, CT of
   sinus showed collection
 low suspicion (see ID note in OMR).  Patient
   had a good BM yesterday, however, appears to have ileus with bile
   draining from suction tube.
   - resend blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx and c.diff, cx CVVH line
   - if patient come off CVVH will favor removing line with low threshold
   for replacement than leaving this line in
   - on cefepime/vanco/flagyl
   - f/u ID c/s, appreciate input.
   - f/u abd, cxr to eval for bile drain cause (tube placement/ r/o
   obstruction)
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-31**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   -    followed by Vsurg
  wound VAC
 input appreciated
   -    serial pulses, CK
   -    on vanc/cefepime/flagyl for coverage of infection.
   .
   #Anemia
 largest component is likely blood loss from open fasciotomy,
   contributory factors include dilution from large volume IV repletion.
   Transfuse RBC prn with hct goal of 30.  Heparin was held and then
   restarted, however, hct did drop and she received additional RBC.
   Initial DIC labs were negative.
   -  Will continue to monitor
   -  f/u DIC labs, RBC morphology, consider other source of blood loss
   - transfuse as needed to goal
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 Plt count around low 100
s.  HIT ab was negative.
   However dilutional with large volumes of PRBC and NS given recently.
   There may be appropriate consumption given open leg wound.
   - will transfuse plt on prn schedule.
   - monitor DIC labs.
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver and rhabdo.
   -  trending
   .
   # IDDM
 on insulin gtt
   .
   # HTN: Hold home hypertensive regimen until more HD stable.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia
 Holding statin in setting of rhabdomyolysis /
   transaminitis.
   .
   # FEN: NPO, Nutrition C/S for TF recs.  NGT in appropriate position on
   CXR.
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   - DVT ppx with HSC
   - pain management IV fentanyl
   - bowel regimen

   Disposition:
","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. She experienced cardiogenic shock and was placed on dopamine and norepinephrine. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver function tests, and compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity. The patient is on CVVH due to acute renal failure and has undergone fasciotomy and wound vacuum-assisted closure for compartment syndrome. She is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and cardiovascular drugs.

Potential medical complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the presence of muddy brown casts in urine analysis, hyperkalemia, anuria, and elevated creatinine levels. This may lead to further deterioration of renal function or the need for chronic dialysis.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. This could be due to the presence of a wound infection or another source of infection within the body.
3. Anemia: The patient's red blood cell count is low, leading to anemia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient was initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output but has improved to a cardiac index of 3.2. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with decreased PEEP and has a stable blood pressure on levophed infusion.

The patient experienced an episode of sinus arrest in the cath lab but is currently in normal sinus rhythm with some tachycardia. She has a history of ileus, which may be related to opiate use, and her bowel sounds have returned. Her nasogastric tube was found to be in the duodenum on abdominal X-ray, likely accounting for her biliary output. The patient had a good bowel movement post-enema on 10/29.

The patient developed compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity, likely due to intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) use, and underwent fasciotomy. She also has rhabdomyolysis with markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, acute renal failure with muddy brown casts, hyperkalemia, and anuria post-catheterization. The patient required continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to unsuccessful trial off CVVH. Her leukocytosis is improving, and she has a positive culture for Klebsiella pneumoniae. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

The patient has anemia likely due to blood loss from open fasciotomy and dilutional effects from large volume IV repletion. She received packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions. Her thrombocytopenia is likely due to dilutional effects and consumption related to her open leg wound. She is being monitored closely for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and receiving platelet transfusions as needed.

The patient's liver function tests are markedly elevated, likely due to shock liver and rhabdomyolysis. She is receiving insulin for her diabetes and holding statin therapy due to rhabdomyolysis and transaminitis. Her blood glucose levels are being closely monitored.

The patient is on prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), senna and colace for bowel regimen, and pain management with IV fentanyl. She has a code status of full code and will be dispositioned to the CCU for now."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent balloon angioplasty with stent placement to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. She was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin.

The patient experienced poor cardiac output with a cardiac index of 1.7-1.9, which has improved to 3.2 after levophed infusion. Her pulmonary artery diastolic pressure and central venous pressure are elevated. Intravenous fluids and blood transfusions have been given as needed to maintain blood pressure. The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm but had an episode of sinus arrest.

The patient is also diagnosed with anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely due to blood loss from an open fasciotomy and dilution from large volume IV repletion. She has received a total of 16 units of packed red blood cells, 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma, and 1 unit of platelets. Her hemoglobin concentration continues to drop, and she will be transfused again this evening if necessary.

The patient's ileus may be related to opioid use, and her nasogastric tube was found in the proximal duodenum on CT abdomen/pelvis. The patient had a good bowel"

   # PUMP: Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI
   1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.2 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA
   diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.
   Reached goal CVP >12 for fluid resuscitated.
   - will check hemodynamic profile q12 hours today
   - continue to wean levophed today.
   - IVF/blood bolus as needed to maintain BP
   - last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 back on heparin gtt.  Patient had
   appropriate post transfusion increase in Hct s/p 2u pRBC but shows Hct
   drop again this AM.  No obvious source of bleeding other than wound VAC
   output.  Will transfuse again this PM if Hct continues to drop with
   goal Hct > 30.

   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus
   arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.
   - NSR; continue monitoring on tele

   # ileus
 Could be [**1-31**] opiate use.  NGT found to be in duodenum on KUB,
   likely accounting for patient
s biliary output.  Patient had a good BM
   s/p enema on [**10-29**].
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - suppository for BM
   - recheck KUB this PM after pulling back NGT
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**].
   Likely from poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now
   with muddy brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and
   anuria immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to
   [**Numeric Identifier **].  Now downtrending, though bumped yesterday and hyper-K
   resolved.   CK down again.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory.
   S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   .
   # PUMP: Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI
   1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.2 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA
   diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.
   Reached goal CVP >12 for fluid resuscitated.
   - will check hemodynamic profile q8 hours today
   - continue to wean levophed today if tolerated.
   - IVF/blood bolus as needed to maintain BP
   - last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt
   but stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.
   - f/u AM CXR
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus
   arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.
   - NSR; continue monitoring on tele
   .
   # anemia/thrombocytopenia
 largest component is likely blood loss from
   open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution from large
   volume IV repletion.  Transfuse RBC prn with hct goal of 30.  Heparin
   was held and then restarted and then held again on repeat Hct drop.
   S/p transfusion of 16u pRBC, 1u FFP, 1u platelets thus far.
   - Could be [**1-31**] chronic DIC given acute Hct drop s/p transfusion of 1u
   FFP.  D-dimer elevated to 2458 (806 on [**10-30**]).  Haptoglobin 79 (120 on
   [**10-30**]).  Fibrinogen 576 (766 on [**10-30**]).  PT/INR nearly identical to
   yesterday
s AM labs even despite 1u FFP transfusion.  Accelerated
   platelet drop (108
 90).  Red blood cell morphology pending.
   - Hold addl FFP transfusion as it may worsen DIC picture.
   - Will continue to monitor
   - f/u RBC morphology, consider other source of blood loss
   - Will transfuse again this PM if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct >
   30.
   - consult heme-onc regarding the anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - f/u on lipase
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 Plt count now below 100.  HIT ab was negative.
   However dilutional with large volumes of PRBC and NS given recently.
   There may be appropriate consumption given open leg wound +/- chronic
   DIC.
   - will transfuse plt on prn schedule.
   - monitor DIC labs.
   .
   # ileus
 Could be [**1-31**] opiate use.  NGT found to be in prox duodenum on
   CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks.  Patient had a good BM s/p enema on [**10-29**].
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - suppository for BM
   - recheck KUB this PM after pulling back NGT again
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**].
   Likely from poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now
   with muddy brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and
   anuria immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to
   [**Numeric Identifier **].  Now downtrending, though bumped yesterday and hyper-K
   resolved.   CK down again.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
   - resolving hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis ( can give bicarb in D5W
   if need)  - on CVVH.
   - f/u UOP, given elevated CVP, normal SVR will run I/O even to slightly
   negative.
   .
   # leukocytosis: patient has a markedly elevated WBC, but now improving
   (29.6
 24.8
 20.7).  CT of abd was negative, CT of sinus showed
   collection
 low suspicion (see ID note in OMR).  Patient currently
   being treated for Klebsiella PNA (culture positive on [**10-26**]).  Per ID
   recs, this could be explained by inflammatory response [**1-31**] necrosis of
   leg tissue + Klebsiella PNA.  No empiric fungal treatment warranted at
   this time.
   - f/u cultures
   - resend C Diff as prior sample was improperly labeled and rejected by

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock, and underwent balloon angioplasty with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and the left anterior descending artery. The patient was initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, but has improved with the use of levophed. She has an elevated PA diastolic/CVP, and is off intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to development of compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity. Her current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin (held due to increased CPK levels), and insulin for IDDM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient has experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin and platelet count. This could be due to blood loss from open fasciotomy, dilution from large volume IV repletion, and possibly consumption as indicated by elevated D-dimer levels. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the anemia/thrombocytopenia, including ruling out chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is below 100, which may be due to dilutional effects from PRBC and NS administration, as well as possible consumption"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty and stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Acute renal failure with muddy brown casts on urine analysis, indicating rhabdomyolysis.
- Anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely due to blood loss from open fasciotomy, dilution from large volume IV repletion, and possible consumption in chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- Ileus, possibly due to opiate use. The nasogastric tube (NGT) is placed in the proximal duodenum, and the patient had a good bowel movement (BM) after an enema on [**10-29**].
- Compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE), for which the inferior aortic balloon pump (IABP) was removed, and the patient underwent fasciotomy. Wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) has been initiated.
- Elevated liver function tests (LFTs), likely due to shock liver and rhabdomyolysis.
- Hyperkalemia and anuria post catheterization, requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
- Leukocytosis, which is improving, with an elevated white blood cell count. Klebsiella pneumonia (KPN) infection has been identified, and the patient is being treated accordingly.
- Hypothermia, for which the patient is being rewarmed.
- Hypertension, for which the patient's home antihypertensive regimen is being held until she is more hemodynamically stable.

The patient's medical team is closely monitoring her condition and providing appropriate interventions. The patient's family has been informed about her progress, and the medical team is in regular communication with them. The patient is currently in the CCU (Cardiac Care Unit) for ongoing care."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 9081**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Continues critically ill.    Unable to wean off levophed.  Still
   oliguric on CVVH.  Required 2 more units of PRBC yesterday.
   Unresponsive now day 14 after complicated course in cath lab.  Films
   reviewed.
   Physical Examination
   still extensive drain from fasciotomy site in [**Hospital **]
   Medical Decision Making
   Wean off sedation.
   Heme consult to review thrombocytopenia, elevated INR and fluctuating
   fibrinogen levels.
   Agree with plans to hold heparin.
   Prognosis poor.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 322**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2185-11-1**] 11:15 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the distal left anterior descending artery (LAD) territory. The patient is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to cardiogenic shock following an acute STEMI.

The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications throughout her stay. These include:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient likely started with acute renal failure before presentation to the hospital. It is believed to be caused by poor forward flow resulting from initial cardiogenic failure. The patient now shows muddy brown casts on urine analysis, indicating rhabdomyolysis. Hyperkalemia has been resolved, and the patient required continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to anuria.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly. Although dilution from large volume IV repletion is a factor, there may also be appropriate consumption of platelets due to the open leg wound and potential chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient has received platelet transfusions and is being monitored for further decline in platelet count.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased, leading to anemia."

   # anemia/thrombocytopenia
 largest component is likely blood loss from
   open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution from large
   volume IV repletion.  Transfuse RBC prn with hct goal of 30.  Heparin
   was held and then restarted and then held again on repeat Hct drop.
   S/p transfusion of 18u pRBC, 1u FFP, 2u platelets thus far.
   - likely [**1-31**] chronic DIC given acute Hct drop s/p transfusion of 1u
   FFP.  D-dimer elevated to 2458 (806 on [**10-30**]).  Haptoglobin 79 (120 on
   [**10-30**]).  Fibrinogen 576 (766 on [**10-30**]).  PT/INR nearly identical to
   yesterday
s AM labs even despite 1u FFP transfusion.  Accelerated
   platelet drop (108
 90).  Red blood cell morphology pending.
   - Hold addl FFP,plt transfusion as it may worsen DIC picture.
   - consider cryo if fibrinogen falls below 100, a/c?  discuss a/c, cryo,
   ffp with heme
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - Will continue to monitor
   - f/u RBC morphology, consider other source of blood loss
   - Transfuse prn again this PM if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct >
   30.
   - consult heme-onc regarding the anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - f/u on lipase
   .
   Hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis without respiratory
   compensation-
   Likely due to overzealous NaCl/non bicarb fluid recusitation
   - will discuss with HD fellow as to how to get her more bicarb
   .
   # CORONARIES: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory.
   S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   .
   # PUMP: Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI
   1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.2 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA
   diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.
   Reached goal CVP >12 for fluid resuscitated.
   - will check hemodynamic profile q8 hours today
   - continue to wean levophed today if tolerated.
   - IVF/blood bolus as needed to maintain BP
   - last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt
   but stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.
   - f/u AM CXR
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus
   arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.
   - NSR; continue monitoring on tele
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 Plt count now below 100.  HIT ab was negative.
   However dilutional with large volumes of PRBC and NS given recently.
   There may be appropriate consumption given open leg wound +/- chronic
   DIC.
   - will transfuse plt on prn schedule for less than 10,000.
   - monitor DIC labs.
   .
   # ileus
 Could be [**1-31**] opiate use.  NGT found to be in prox duodenum on
   CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks.  Patient had a good BM s/p enema on [**10-29**].
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - suppository for BM
   - recheck KUB this PM after pulling back NGT again
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**].
   Likely from poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now
   with muddy brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and
   anuria immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to
   [**Numeric Identifier **].  Now downtrending, though bumped yesterday and hyper-K
   resolved.   CK down again.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
   - resolving hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis ( can give bicarb in D5W
   if need)  - on CVVH.
   - f/u UOP, given elevated CVP, normal SVR will run I/O even to slightly
   negative.

   # Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around
   territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more
   hemodynamically stable. Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor
   cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.2 this AM on levophed
   gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of
   compartment sx in LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for [**Year (4 digits) **] resuscitated.

   # GI: ileus
 Could be [**1-31**] opiate use.  NGT found to be in prox
   duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks.  Patient had a good BM s/p
   enema on [**10-29**].  not able to tolerate tube feeds, set for 60 only
   tolerate 30.
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - suppository for BM
   - recheck KUB this PM after pulling back NGT again
   .
   # Renal: : ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   Now downtrending, though bumped yesterday and hyper-K resolved.   CK
   down again.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient required
   CVVH.  Hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis without
   respiratory compensation-  Likely due to overzealous NaCl/non bicarb
   [**Numeric Identifier **] recusitation
   - will discuss with HD fellow as to how to get her more bicarb
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
   - resolving hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis ( can give bicarb in D5W
   if need)  - on CVVH.
   - f/u UOP, given elevated CVP, normal SVR will run I/O even to slightly
   negative.
   - retabulate I/O to be sure of the source of the input fluids.
   .
   #ID:  patient has a markedly elevated WBC, but now improving (29.6
   24.8
 20.7).  CT of abd was negative, CT of sinus showed collection
   low suspicion (see ID note in OMR).  Patient currently being treated
   for Klebsiella PNA (culture positive on [**10-26**]).  Per ID recs, this
   could be explained by inflammatory response [**1-31**] necrosis of leg tissue
   + Klebsiella PNA.  No empiric fungal treatment warranted at this time.
   - f/u cultures
   - C Diff negative
   - on cefepime (since [**10-26**], currently D7), vanc (since [**10-26**], currently
   D7), flagyl (since [**10-28**], currently D5)
   - f/u ID c/s, appreciate input
   - follow up on vanco level.
   # Heme: anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to blood
   loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution from
   large volume IV repletion.  Transfuse RBC prn with hct goal of 30.
   Heparin was held and then restarted and then held again on repeat Hct
   drop.  S/p transfusion of 18u pRBC, 1u FFP, 2u platelets thus far.  Plt
   count now below 100.  HIT ab was negative.  However dilutional with
   large volumes of PRBC and NS given recently.  There may be appropriate
   consumption given open leg wound +/- chronic DIC.
   - likely [**1-31**] chronic DIC given acute Hct drop s/p transfusion of 1u
   FFP.  D-dimer elevated to 2458 (806 on [**10-30**]).  Haptoglobin 79 (120 on
   [**10-30**]).  Fibrinogen 576 (766 on [**10-30**]).  PT/INR nearly identical to
   yesterday
s AM labs even despite 1u FFP transfusion.  Accelerated
   platelet drop (108
 90).  Red blood cell morphology pending.
   - Hold addl FFP,plt transfusion as it may worsen DIC picture, would
   give FFP if necessary
   - f/u RBC morphology, consider other source of blood loss
   - Transfuse prn again this PM if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct >
   30.
   - consult heme-onc regarding the anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - monitor DIC labs.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, presenting with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient was initially on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support but developed compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity, leading to fasciotomy and removal of IABP. She is currently on CVVH due to acute kidney injury with muddy brown casts and rhabdomyolysis. The patient's white blood cell count is markedly elevated, likely due to an inflammatory response and necrosis of leg tissue, and she is being treated for Klebsiella pneumonia. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are present, likely due to blood loss from the open fasciotomy and dilutional effects from large volume IV repletion. The patient has elevated liver function tests and is being monitored for potential chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has a tracheostomy and is weaning off sedation. The patient's mental status remains unchanged.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Neurological Complications: The patient's minimal response and lack of improvement raise concerns for potential neurological complications. Consideration should be given to an EEG and evoke potential, along with a neurology consult to assess the patient"

   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: stable, but on fentynl and versed, minimal response, not
   improved.  Longterm outlook is not very good.
   - consider EEG, evoke potential, neurology consult
   - wean sedation and watch for mental status improvement
   .
   # Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around
   territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more
   hemodynamically stable. Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor
   cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.2 this AM on levophed
   gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of
   compartment sx in LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for [**Year (4 digits) **] resuscitated.
   in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off
   temp pacer at this time.  last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient
   had been on heparin gtt but stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - will check hemodynamic profile q8 hours today
   - weaned off levophed
   - f/u AM CXR
   - NSR; continue monitoring on tele
   - CVVH to -150 I/O
   - CK daily
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status is hindering the process
   of weaning.
   - pressure support trial
   - consider getting a trach
   -
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Could be [**1-31**] opiate use.  NGT found to be in prox
   duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks.  Patient had a good BM s/p
   enema on [**10-29**].  not able to tolerate tube feeds, set for 60 only
   tolerate 30.
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - suppository for BM
   - recheck KUB this PM after pulling back NGT again
   .
   # Renal: : ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   Now downtrending, though bumped yesterday and hyper-K resolved.   CK
   down again.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient required
   CVVH.  Hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis without
   respiratory compensation-  Likely due to overzealous NaCl/non bicarb
   [**Numeric Identifier **] recusitation
   - will discuss with HD fellow as to how to get her more bicarb
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
   - resolving hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis ( can give bicarb in D5W
   if need)  - on CVVH.
   - f/u UOP, given elevated CVP, normal SVR will run I/O even to slightly
   negative.
   - retabulate I/O to be sure of the source of the input fluids.
   .
   #ID:  patient has a markedly elevated WBC, but now improving (29.6
   24.8
 20.7).  CT of abd was negative, CT of sinus showed collection
   low suspicion (see ID note in OMR).  Patient currently being treated
   for Klebsiella PNA (culture positive on [**10-26**]).  Per ID recs, this
   could be explained by inflammatory response [**1-31**] necrosis of leg tissue
   + Klebsiella PNA.  No empiric fungal treatment warranted at this time.
   - f/u cultures
   - C Diff negative
   - on cefepime (since [**10-26**], currently D7), vanc (since [**10-26**], currently
   D7), flagyl (since [**10-28**], currently D5)
   - f/u ID c/s, appreciate input
   - follow up on vanco level.
   # Heme: anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to blood
   loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution from
   large volume IV repletion.  Transfuse RBC prn with hct goal of 30.
   Heparin was held and then restarted and then held again on repeat Hct
   drop.  S/p transfusion of 18u pRBC, 1u FFP, 2u platelets thus far.  Plt
   count now below 100.  HIT ab was negative.  However dilutional with
   large volumes of PRBC and NS given recently.  There may be appropriate
   consumption given open leg wound +/- chronic DIC.
   - likely [**1-31**] chronic DIC given acute Hct drop s/p transfusion of 1u
   FFP.  D-dimer elevated to 2458 (806 on [**10-30**]).  Haptoglobin 79 (120 on
   [**10-30**]).  Fibrinogen 576 (766 on [**10-30**]).  PT/INR nearly identical to
   yesterday
s AM labs even despite 1u FFP transfusion.  Accelerated
   platelet drop (108
 90).  Red blood cell morphology pending.
   - Hold addl FFP,plt transfusion as it may worsen DIC picture, would
   give FFP if necessary
   - f/u RBC morphology, consider other source of blood loss
   - Transfuse prn again this PM if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct >
   30.
   - consult heme-onc regarding the anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - monitor DIC labs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient was initially in cardiogenic shock but has improved to a cardiac index of 3.2. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 107 beats per minute, blood pressure of 109/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a high tidal volume (Vt) set at 500 mL and is being weaned off vasoactive medications such as versed and levophed. She has received blood transfusions and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) but continues to have a drop in hematocrit (Hct) and platelet count, suggesting possible ongoing bleeding or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, along with muddy brown casts in the urine. She also has rhabdomyolysis with elevated creatine kinase ("

She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient is currently in the ICU for ongoing management and support.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 107 beats per minute, blood pressure of 109/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory values show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.3 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 26.3 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 64 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Her kidney function is impaired with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 20.7 mL/min and a serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. She also has hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L and an elevated D-dimer level of 2458 ng/mL.

The patient's medical complications include cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, ileus, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE), and elevated liver enzymes. She has been treated with multiple medications including antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, metronidazole), anticoagulants (heparin), antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel), and insulin.

The patient's care plan includes continued hemodynamic monitoring, weaning off vasopressors if tolerated, aggressive bowel regimen for ileus, transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as needed to maintain hemoglobin and platelet counts above certain thresholds, and consultation with hematology-oncology for further evaluation of anemia and thrombocytopenia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening cardiogenic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and Clostridium difficile infection."

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left main coronary artery (LAD) and developed cardiogenic shock. The patient required mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). She also developed rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury (AKI), and sepsis with Klebsiella pneumonia. Additionally, she had an ileus, elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing instability suggest a high risk for recurrent or persistent cardiogenic shock.
2. AKI: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and need for CRRT indicate significant kidney dysfunction, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels indicate muscle breakdown, which can lead to further kidney damage and complications such as compartment syndrome.
4. Sepsis: The patient's positive culture for Klebsiella pneumonia and the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria suggest an increased risk for sepsis-related complications.
5. DIC: The patient's low platelet count, elevated D-dimer"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Improving with weaning of midaz and fentanyl.  Patient was
   grimacing to suction and pain, withdrawing slightly with her left
   hand.  However her sedation had to be re-started given her disynchrony
   with the vent
   - consider EEG, evoke potential, neurology consult
   - wean sedation and watch for mental status improvement
   .
   # Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around
   territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more
   hemodynamically stable. Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor
   cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.2 this AM on levophed
   gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of
   compartment sx in LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for [**Year (4 digits) **] resuscitated.
   in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off
   temp pacer at this time.  last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient
   had been on heparin gtt but stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - will check hemodynamic profile q8 hours today
   - weaned off levophed
   - f/u AM CXR
   - NSR; continue monitoring on tele
   - CVVH to -150 I/O
   - CK daily
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status is hindering the process
   of weaning.
   - pressure support trial
   - consider getting a trach
   -
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Could be [**1-31**] opiate use.  NGT found to be in prox
   duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks.  Patient had a good BM s/p
   enema on [**10-29**].  not able to tolerate tube feeds, set for 60 only
   tolerate 30.
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - suppository for BM
   - recheck KUB this PM after pulling back NGT again
   .
   # Renal: : ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   Now downtrending, though bumped yesterday and hyper-K resolved.   CK
   down again.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient required
   CVVH.  Hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis without
   respiratory compensation-  Likely due to overzealous NaCl/non bicarb
   [**Numeric Identifier **] recusitation
   - will discuss with HD fellow as to how to get her more bicarb
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
   - resolving hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis ( can give bicarb in D5W
   if need)  - on CVVH.
   - f/u UOP, given elevated CVP, normal SVR will run I/O even to slightly
   negative.
   - retabulate I/O to be sure of the source of the input fluids.
   .
   #ID:  patient has a markedly elevated WBC, but now improving (29.6
   24.8
 20.7).  CT of abd was negative, CT of sinus showed collection
   low suspicion (see ID note in OMR).  Patient currently being treated
   for Klebsiella PNA (culture positive on [**10-26**]).  Per ID recs, this
   could be explained by inflammatory response [**1-31**] necrosis of leg tissue
   + Klebsiella PNA.  No empiric fungal treatment warranted at this time.
   - f/u cultures
   - C Diff negative
   - on cefepime (since [**10-26**], currently D7), vanc (since [**10-26**], currently
   D7), flagyl (since [**10-28**], currently D5)
   - f/u ID c/s, appreciate input
   - follow up on vanco level.
   # Heme: anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to blood
   loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution from
   large volume IV repletion.  Transfuse RBC prn with hct goal of 30.
   Heparin was held and then restarted and then held again on repeat Hct
   drop.  S/p transfusion of 18u pRBC, 1u FFP, 2u platelets thus far.  Plt
   count now below 100.  HIT ab was negative.  However dilutional with
   large volumes of PRBC and NS given recently.  There may be appropriate
   consumption given open leg wound +/- chronic DIC.
   - likely [**1-31**] chronic DIC given acute Hct drop s/p transfusion of 1u
   FFP.  D-dimer elevated to 2458 (806 on [**10-30**]).  Haptoglobin 79 (120 on
   [**10-30**]).  Fibrinogen 576 (766 on [**10-30**]).  PT/INR nearly identical to
   yesterday
s AM labs even despite 1u FFP transfusion.  Accelerated
   platelet drop (108
 90).  Red blood cell morphology pending.
   - Hold addl FFP,plt transfusion as it may worsen DIC picture, would
   give FFP if necessary
   - f/u RBC morphology, consider other source of blood loss
   - Transfuse prn again this PM if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct >
   30.
   - consult heme-onc regarding the anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - monitor DIC labs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and the left anterior descending artery. The patient required hemodynamic support with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and was later switched to veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO). She also developed rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury (AKI), leading to the initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

The patient's neurological status has improved with sedation weaning, but she still shows some signs of agitation and discoordination. There are concerns about her mental status improvement and potential seizure activity. An EEG and electroencephalogram (EEG) are recommended for further evaluation.

The patient's respiratory status remains challenging due to multi-system involvement. There is ongoing discussion about tracheostomy placement and pressure support trials. Her gastrointestinal (GI) function is compromised, resulting in an ileus. Aggressive bowel regimen and suppositories are being used to promote bowel movement. Nutritional support is planned.

Renal function is still compromised, and the patient requires ongoing CVVH. There is a concern for hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and additional bicarbonate may be necessary. The patient's"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia presenting with acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and subsequent multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient has had several medical complications including neurologic issues, cardiovascular issues, respiratory distress, gastrointestinal ileus, renal failure, infectious disease, anemia and thrombocytopenia, compartment syndrome, and elevated liver function tests.

Neurologic issues: The patient was initially sedated and intubated due to respiratory failure. She was responding poorly to pain and had disynchronous ventilation. Sedation was increased, and an EEG and evoke potential were considered.

Cardiovascular issues: The patient had an acute inferior STEMI in the distal LAD territory. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery and the LAD. Initially, she was in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output but improved over time. She had elevated pulmonary artery diastolic pressure and central venous pressure. The patient was off intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to the development of compartment syndrome in her left lower extremity. Her cardiac output improved, and she was weaned off levophed.

Respiratory distress: The patient had difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. She did well for 5 hours on CPAP but required reintubation. A tracheostomy was considered.

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia presenting with acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and subsequent multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to LMCA and LAD and was initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output. The patient's condition has improved to some extent, but she continues to experience various complications.

1. Neurological Complications: The patient is intubated and sedated due to respiratory distress. There is evidence of improved mental status with weaning of midazolam and fentanyl. However, she grimaces to suction and pain, and there is a concern for potential neurological injury or seizures. An EEG and evoke potential should be considered, and neurology consultation is warranted.

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient had an acute inferior STEMI, which led to cardiogenic shock. She received PCI to LMCA and LAD but remains in shock. There are elevated PA diastolic and CVP pressures, and the patient had an episode of sinus arrest. She is off the temperature pacemaker at this time. The last TTE shows apical dyskinesis. The patient's cardiovascular status requires close monitoring, and ASA, Plavix, and no statin should be continued. Levophed should be titrated based on blood pressure and CVP. CVVH should be maintained at -50/hr or"

   - Per GI consult IV PPI started
   - VSS, NG lavage clear, no acute bleeding
   - Given latest unpublished data which is not supportive of prior
   evidence for negative interaction between plavix and PPI, I felt that
   the benefits outweighed the risks in this case
   - consider giving vit K

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to LMCA and LAD and was initially in cardiogenic shock but now shows improvement in cardiac output.

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications during her ICU stay. These include:

1. Neurological: The patient has been sedated due to agitation and discoordination with the ventilator. There are concerns about potential seizures or encephalopathy, so an EEG and evaluation for potential causes such as liver failure or medication effects are recommended. Weaning of sedation should be done cautiously and monitoring for mental status improvement is advised.

2. Cardiovascular: The patient had an acute inferior STEMI in the distal LAD territory. She was initially in cardiogenic shock but has shown improvement. Elevated PA diastolic/CVP levels indicate poor forward flow. The patient was on IABP but developed compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE), leading to its removal. A fasciotomy was performed, and wound VAC therapy has been initiated.

3. Respiratory: The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, making it difficult to wean off mechanical ventilation. CPAP trials have been attempted but unsuccessful. Tracheostomy is being considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Improving with weaning of midaz and fentanyl and lactulose.
   Patient was grimacing to suction and pain, withdrawing slightly with
   her left hand.  However her sedation had to be re-started given her
   disynchrony with the vent
   - consider EEG, evoke potential, neurology consult
   - wean sedation and watch for mental status improvement
   - continue lactulose
   .
   # Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around
   territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more
   hemodynamically stable. Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor
   cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.2 this AM on levophed
   gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of
   compartment sx in LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for [**Year (4 digits) **] resuscitated.
   in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off
   temp pacer at this time.  last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient
   had been on heparin gtt but stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - will check hemodynamic profile q8 hours today
   - f/u AM CXR
   - NSR; continue monitoring on tele
   - CVVH to -50/hr or better, diuresis with pressors if need
   - CK daily, d/c swan ganz
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status is hindering the process
   of weaning.  Did very well for 5 hours on CPAP, however tired out and
   required rest on the vent.  Continue sedation holidays, CPAP trials.
   - pressure support trial
   - consider getting a trach
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Resolved yesterday with Lactulose.  NGT found to be in
   prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks.  Patient had a good BM s/p
   enema on [**10-29**].  not able to tolerate tube feeds, set for 60 only
   tolerate 30.   had melenotic bm, put on PPI.
   - continue IV PPI
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - suppository for BM
   - recheck KUB this PM after pulling back NGT again
   Melana
 suspect Oozing in the setting of DIC, ?[**1-31**] gastritis or stress
   ulcer in the setting of vented patient only on H2
   - Per GI consult IV PPI started
   - VSS, NG lavage clear, no acute bleeding
   - Given latest unpublished data which is not supportive of prior
   evidence for negative interaction between plavix and PPI, I felt that
   the benefits outweighed the risks in this case
   - consider giving vit K
   .
   # Renal: : ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   Now downtrending, though bumped yesterday and hyper-K resolved.   CK
   down again.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient required
   CVVH.  Hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis without
   respiratory compensation-  Likely due to overzealous NaCl/non bicarb
   [**Numeric Identifier **] recusitation
   - Bicarb has improved greatly with new [**Numeric Identifier **] cocktail
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
   - resolving hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis ( can give bicarb in D5W
   if need)  - on CVVH.
   - f/u UOP, given elevated CVP, normal SVR will run I/O even to slightly
   negative.
   - retabulate I/O to be sure of the source of the input fluids.
   .
   #ID:  patient has a markedly elevated WBC, but now improving (29.6
   24.8
 20.7).  CT of abd was negative, CT of sinus showed collection
   low suspicion (see ID note in OMR).  Patient currently being treated
   for Klebsiella PNA (culture positive on [**10-26**]).  Per ID recs, this
   could be explained by inflammatory response [**1-31**] necrosis of leg tissue
   + Klebsiella PNA.  No empiric fungal treatment warranted at this time.
   - f/u cultures, vanco lvl
   - C Diff negative
   - on cefepime (since [**10-26**], currently D7), vanc (since [**10-26**], currently
   D7), flagyl (since [**10-28**], currently D5)
   - id signed off

   # Heme: anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to blood
   loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution from
   large volume IV repletion.  Transfuse RBC prn with hct goal of 30.
   Heparin was held and then restarted and then held again on repeat Hct
   drop.  S/p transfusion of 18u pRBC, 1u FFP, 2u platelets thus far.  Plt
   count now below 100.  HIT ab was negative.  However dilutional with
   large volumes of PRBC and NS given recently.  There may be appropriate
   consumption given open leg wound +/- chronic DIC.  likely [**1-31**] chronic
   DIC/hepatic insufficiency given acute Hct drop s/p transfusion of 1u
   FFP.  D-dimer elevated to 2458 (806 on [**10-30**]).  Haptoglobin 79 (120 on
   [**10-30**]).  Fibrinogen 576 (766 on [**10-30**]).  PT/INR nearly identical to
   yesterday
s AM labs even despite 1u FFP transfusion.  Accelerated
   platelet drop (108
 90).  Red blood cell morphology pending.
   - Hold addl FFP,plt transfusion as it may worsen DIC picture, would
   give FFP if necessary, and cryo as needed, vit K
   - f/u RBC morphology, consider other source of blood loss
   - Transfuse prn again this PM if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct >
   30.
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - monitor DIC labs.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. 

The patient has several ongoing medical complications and conditions, including respiratory distress, gastrointestinal ileus, renal failure, infectious disease (Klebsiella pneumonia), anemia, thrombocytopenia, compartment syndrome, elevated liver function tests, and hyperglycemia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 119 beats per minute, blood pressure of 119/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus tachycardia on ECG. 

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated creatine kinase levels. 

The patient's medical team is managing her with various medications, including antibiotics for Klebsiella pneumonia, antiplatelet agents (aspirin and clopidogrel), anticoagulant (heparin), sedatives (midazolam and fentanyl), vasopressors (norepinephrine), and insulin for glycemic control. 

The patient's current plan includes weaning off sedation, continuing lactulose for bowel regimen, maintaining fluid balance, monitoring renal function, treating Klebsiella pneumonia, and addressing the ongoing complications such as respiratory distress, gastrointestinal ileus, and compartment syndrome. 

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, with multiple organ dysfunctions and ongoing medical challenges. Close monitoring and multidisciplinary care will be crucial for her recovery."

   # Neuro: Spontaneous opened eyes and moved hands with lactulose despite
   fentanyl @100 and.  Patient was grimacing to suction and pain.  However
   her sedation had to be re-started given her disynchrony with the vent
   - consider EEG, evoke potential, neurology consult
   - wean sedation and watch for mental status improvement
   - continue lactulose titrate to 4 BM/day
   .
   # Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around
   territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more
   hemodynamically stable. Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor
   cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed
   gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of
   compartment sx in LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for [**Year (4 digits) **] resuscitated.
   in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off
   temp pacer at this time.  last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient
   had been on heparin gtt but stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off
   pressors and tolerated -2L yesterday.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - will check hemodynamic profile q8 hours today
   - f/u AM CXR
   - NSR; continue monitoring on tele
   - CVVH negative I/O as tolerated, diuresis with pressors if need
   - CK daily
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status is hindering the process
   of weaning.  Tolerated short course of pressure support, however tired
   out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure support
   trials.
   - pressure support trial
   - consider getting a trach
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having large BMs with Lactulose.  NGT found
   to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per GI.
   Had melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.
   - continue IV PPI
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - lactulose for BM
   .
   Melena/bloody BM
 suspect Oozing in the setting of DIC, ?[**1-31**] gastritis
   or stress ulcer in the setting of vented patient only on H2, patient
   had
explosive
 BM o/n which was not frankly bloody.  Hepatic
   dysfunction contributing to this picture.
   - Per GI consult IV PPI started, hold TF for now
   - VSS, NG lavage clear, no acute bleeding
   - IV protonix does NOT interfere with plavix
   - Giving vit K, FFP
   - f/u on INR
   - BM regimen
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - Bicarb has improved greatly with new [**Numeric Identifier **] cocktail
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
 monitor lytes (Ca, phos)
   - resolving hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (can give bicarb in D5W
   if need)  - on CVVH.
   - f/u UOP, given elevated CVP, normal SVR will continue to run
   negative.
   .
   #ID:  patient had a markedly elevated WBC, but now improving (34->29.6
 24.8
 14.8).  CT of abd was negative, CT of sinus showed collection
 low suspicion (see ID note in OMR).  Patient currently being treated
   for Klebsiella PNA (culture positive on [**10-26**]).  Per ID recs, this
   could be explained by inflammatory response [**1-31**] necrosis of leg tissue
   + Klebsiella PNA.  No empiric fungal treatment warranted at this time.
   C Diff negative
   - f/u cultures, vanco lvl
   - on cefepime (since [**10-26**], currently D9), vanc (since [**10-26**], currently
   D9), flagyl (since [**10-28**], currently D7) of presumed 14day course
   - id signed off

   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative

   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.   Hold addl FFP,plt transfusion as it may worsen DIC
   picture, would give FFP if necessary, and cryo as needed, vit K
   - Transfuse prn again this PM if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct >

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LAD) and experienced a wrap-around territory. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatic dysfunction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Key assessments and plans include:
- Neurological: The patient is sedated and showing signs of mental status changes. An EEG and neurology consult are recommended to evaluate for potential seizures or other neurological complications.
- Cardiovascular: The patient had an acute inferior STEMI and is currently on aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin. However, due to increased CPK levels, statin therapy is withheld. Close monitoring of hemodynamic profile is advised.
- Respiratory: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has been on non-invasive ventilation support. Tracheostomy placement is considered for long-term ventilatory support.
- Gastrointestinal: The patient has an ileus and is producing large bowel movements with lactulose. Melena/bloody BMs have been observed, which may be due to oozing in the setting of DIC or stress ulcers. IV pantopraz"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). She was initially in cardiogenic shock but has shown improvement with Levophed infusion. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) was elevated, and she had an episode of sinus arrest during the catheterization lab procedure.

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by multi-system organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and she requires mechanical ventilation with pressure support. Tracheostomy is being considered due to the difficulty in weaning her off the ventilator. The patient also has ileus with large bowel movements despite lactulose therapy. The nasogastric tube (NGT) was found to be in the proximal duodenum on a recent CT abdomen/pelvis.

Renal function is compromised, as indicated by acute renal failure (ARF) with muddy brown casts on urine analysis. The patient had hyperkalemia and anuria immediately post-catheterization but is now showing signs of improvement with increased urine output. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) is being continued"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**11-3**]
   - got approx. [**12-31**] unit pRBC (accidentally, as this came down from blood
   bank instead of FFP), then 1u FFP
   - started on lactulose q2h + rifaximin
   - per IP, she will need to go to OR for trach/PEG given her anatomy; we
   should consult thoracics for this once coagulopathy improved, being on
   plavix should be ok as long as patient doesn't have other bleeding
   diatheses
   - per GI, holding tube feeds for now, continue current management (no

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and subsequent development of multiple complications. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. Post-procedure, she experienced a complication involving compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity, which required fasciotomy and wound VAC placement.

The patient also has ongoing respiratory distress, ileus, renal failure, infection (Klebsiella pneumonia), coagulopathy (chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation), anemia and thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver function tests. She has received multiple blood transfusions, including packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate. Her current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, lactulose, rifaximin, pantoprazole, midazolam, fentanyl, calcium gluconate, insulin, famotidine, and albumin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, persistent respiratory distress leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia or tracheostomy, worsening coagulopathy resulting in bleeding or thrombotic events, infection due to prolonged immobilization and invasive"

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient's initial cardiac output was poor, but has since improved to CI 3.1. She is currently off IABP due to the development of compartment syndrome in her left lower extremity and has undergone fasciotomy. 

The patient's respiratory status remains challenging, with ongoing difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. She continues to require pressure support and sedation. A tracheostomy is being considered. 

Gastrointestinal issues include ileus and melena/bloody bowel movements. The patient is receiving IV proton pump inhibitors and a bowel regimen. 

Renal function is compromised with acute renal failure (ARF), likely secondary to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. There are muddy brown casts on urine analysis, and the patient has hyperkalemia and anuria. She is on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) with improving urine output. 

Infectious disease concerns include a Klebsiella pneumonia infection, for which the patient is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Spontaneous opened eyes and moved hands with lactulose despite
   fentanyl @100 and.  Patient was grimacing to suction and pain.  However
   her sedation had to be re-started given her disynchrony with the vent.
   Appears to be more responsive after weaning off sedation.
   - watch for mental status improvement
   - continue lactulose titrate to 4 BM/day
   .
   # Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around
   territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more
   hemodynamically stable. Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor
   cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed
   gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of
   compartment sx in LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for [**Year (4 digits) **] resuscitated.
   in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off
   temp pacer at this time.  last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient
   had been on heparin gtt but stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off
   pressors and tolerated -2L yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial
   fibrillation, converted back to sinus without BB.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - will check hemodynamic profile q8 hours today
   - f/u AM CXR
   - CVVH negative I/O as tolerated, diuresis with pressors if need
   - CK daily
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status is hindering the process
   of weaning.  Tolerated short course of pressure support, however tired
   out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure support
   trials.
   - pressure support trial
   - s/p trach continue try to wean.
   - take off more [**Last Name (Titles) **] as tolerated to facilitate extubation.
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having large BMs with Lactulose.  NGT found
   to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per GI.
   Had melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.
   - continue IV PPI
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   Melena/bloody BM
 suspect Oozing in the setting of DIC, ?[**1-31**] gastritis
   or stress ulcer in the setting of vented patient only on H2, patient
   had
explosive
 BM o/n which was not frankly bloody.  Hepatic
   dysfunction contributing to this picture.
   - Per GI consult IV PPI started, hold TF for now
   - VSS, NG lavage clear, no acute bleeding
   - IV protonix does NOT interfere with plavix
   - Giving vit K, FFP, f/u on INR
   - BM regimen
   - get TPN for nutriention, PICC placement.
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
 monitor lytes (Ca, phos), CVVH line needs
   to be changed.
   - f/u UOP, given elevated CVP, normal SVR will continue to run
   negative.
   .
   #ID:  patient had a markedly elevated WBC, but now improving (34->29.6
 24.8
 14.8).  CT of abd was negative, CT of sinus showed collection
 low suspicion (see ID note in OMR).  Patient currently being treated
   for Klebsiella PNA (culture positive on [**10-26**]).  Per ID recs, this
   could be explained by inflammatory response [**1-31**] necrosis of leg tissue
   + Klebsiella PNA.  No empiric fungal treatment warranted at this time.
   C Diff negative
   - f/u cultures, vanco lvl
   - on cefepime (since [**10-26**], currently D10), vanc (since [**10-26**],
   currently D10), flagyl (since [**10-28**], currently D8) of presumed 14day
   course
   - id signed off
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] chronic DIC/hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.   Hold addl FFP,plt transfusion as it may worsen DIC
   picture, would give FFP if necessary, and cryo as needed, vit K
   - Transfuse prn again this PM if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct >

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI, resulting in cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to LMCA and LAD territories. The patient was initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output but has improved to a cardiac index (CI) of 3.1 this morning on levophed infusion. She has elevated PA diastolic/CVP, off IABP due to development of compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE), and reached goal CVP >12 for resuscitation. The patient had a recent episode of atrial fibrillation, converted back to sinus rhythm without beta-blocker use.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She is on decreased sedation, opens her eyes spontaneously, and is nonresponsive to verbal/tactile stimuli. She has bronchial breath sounds throughout and a tense, mildly distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds. Her extremities are cool, weak, and thready with palpable pulses bilaterally.

The patient's laboratory values show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.0 K/uL and a left shift. Her renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 105 mg/dL and serum creatinine (Cr) of 3.1 mg/dL. The patient also has hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6.8 mEq/L and anuria immediately post-catheterization. She has rhabdomyolysis with a creatine kinase (CK) level of 906 U/L, which is now downtrending. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) of 13.6 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 29.4 seconds. Her liver enzymes are markedly elevated, and she has hypoalbuminemia with an albumin level of 2.2 g/dL. The patient is anemic with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 105 K/uL.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 124/48 mmHg (72/38 mmHg), a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PAD) is 21 mmHg, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) is 15 mmHg. Her urine output is"

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and subsequent cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). She was initially in cardiogenic shock but has improved to a cardiac index (CI) of 3.1 on levophed infusion. The patient's blood pressure remains low, and she has elevated pulmonary artery (PA) diastolic and central venous pressure (CVP). The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with bronchial breath sounds throughout and an RSBI deferred due to hemodynamic instability. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate renal failure with muddy brown casts, elevated creatinine kinase (CK), hyperkalemia, and anuria. She has been on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) with negative fluid balance. The patient's white blood cell count was initially elevated but is now improving. She has been treated for Klebsiella pneumonia with cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole. Her coagulation profile shows signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with a low platelet count, prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), and decreased fibrinogen levels. The patient has been transfused with packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. 

The patient's gastrointestinal (GI) status is complicated by ileus and melena/bloody bowel movements. She has been given intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and her GI consult has been followed. The patient's hepatic function is also impaired, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. 

The patient's compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE) has been managed with fasciotomy and wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC). She has been on insulin gtt for her diabetes mellitus. 

Prophylactic measures include anticoagulation with heparin, pain management with IV fentanyl, and a bowel regimen to promote regular bowel movements. The patient's code status is full code, and her current disposition is in the intensive care unit (ICU)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to LMCA and LAD and was initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output. The patient's condition improved, but she developed compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE), leading to fasciotomy and wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC). She also experienced respiratory distress, ileus, renal failure with muddy brown casts, elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient has been on various medications including aspirin, Plavix, heparin, antibiotics, insulin, and supportive care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Complications: The patient's sedation had to be restarted due to disynchrony with the ventilator. There is a need to consider an EEG and evoked potential tests, as well as consult neurology for mental status improvement.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient initially presented with cardiogenic shock and had an episode of sinus arrest. She had a markedly elevated PA diastolic/CVP and was off the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to development of compartment syndrome. The patient's cardiac output is still being monitored, and she continues"

 14.8).  CT of abd was negative, CT of sinus showed collection
 low suspicion (see ID note in OMR).  Patient currently being treated
   for Klebsiella PNA (culture positive on [**10-26**]).  Per ID recs, this
   could be explained by inflammatory response [**1-31**] necrosis of leg tissue
   + Klebsiella PNA.  No empiric fungal treatment warranted at this time.

   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.

","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Neurological complications: The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and sedation, which increases the risk of delirium or cognitive dysfunction upon extubation. Monitoring for mental status improvement and ensuring appropriate weaning off sedation is important.

2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient had an acute inferior STEMI and is on multiple cardiac medications including ASA, Plavix, and statins. It is crucial to continue monitoring the patient's hemodynamic profile, cardiac enzymes, and adjusting medications as necessary.

3. Respiratory complications: The patient is still experiencing respiratory distress and requires ongoing pressure support and trials of extubation. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and continued efforts to wean off ventilatory support are necessary.

4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has developed ileus and melena/bloody BM, indicating possible stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding. Continued monitoring of bowel activity, maintaining an appropriate bowel regimen, and ensuring adequate pain management are important. The use of IV PPI may also be beneficial.

5. Renal complications: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with muddy brown casts, indicating rhabdomyolysis. Monitoring urine output, electrolytes, and renal function tests is crucial. CVVH may be required to manage fluid balance and electrolyte disturbances.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues, including respiratory distress, ileus, acute kidney injury (ARF), rhabdomyolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation, indicating potential respiratory complications.
2. Ileus: The patient is showing signs of bowel dysfunction, including large bowel movements with lactulose and melenotic/frankly bloody stools. This could indicate an ileus or stress-related mucosal disease.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to anuria and hyperkalemia. CVVH has been initiated but with limited success. Continuous monitoring of urine output and electrolytes is necessary.
4. Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) indicate muscle breakdown, likely secondary to severe illness or immobilization. Close monitoring of CK levels is required.
5. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient exhibits signs of co"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and required percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient had multiple complications including respiratory distress, gastrointestinal ileus, renal failure, infection (Klebsiella pneumonia), hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, compartment syndrome, and elevated liver enzymes. She is currently in the ICU and receiving various treatments including mechanical ventilation, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may continue if she is unable to wean off mechanical ventilation or if there are further episodes of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Gastrointestinal Ileus: The patient's ileus may persist if there are ongoing issues with bowel motility or if she develops any complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen if there is ongoing hypoperfusion to the kidneys or if she develops further complications such as acute tubular necrosis or urosepsis.
4. Infection: The patient's infection (Klebsiella pneumonia) may progress if appropriate antibiotics are not administered or if"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.
- She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock, for which she underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the LMCA and LAD.
- The patient required hemodialysis due to acute renal failure, likely secondary to cardiogenic shock.
- She developed ileus and had bloody stools, which were initially attributed to stress ulcers but later found to be caused by an infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae.
- The patient also experienced compartment syndrome in her left lower extremity and underwent fasciotomy and wound VAC placement.
- Her coagulation profile was abnormal, likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or hepatic insufficiency, and she required multiple blood product transfusions.
- The patient's liver enzymes were elevated, likely due to rhabdomyolysis and shock liver.
- She had an elevated white blood cell count, which initially suggested an infection but was later determined to be caused by inflammation and tissue necrosis.
- The patient's platelet count was low, likely due to dilution from large volume IV repletion and blood loss from the open fasciotomy.
- She was on mechanical ventilation and required tracheostomy placement.
- The patient's condition improved gradually, with weaning off sedation,"

   # Neuro: Spontaneous opened eyes and moved hands with lactulose despite
   fentanyl @100 and.  Patient was grimacing to suction and pain.  However
   her sedation had to be re-started given her disynchrony with the vent.
   Appears to be more responsive after weaning off sedation.
   - watch for mental status improvement
   - continue lactulose titrate to 4 BM/day
   - continue to wean sedation (on fentanyl and versed) as tolerated
   (patient gets agitated and hrt increases)
   .
   # Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around
   territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more
   hemodynamically stable. Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor
   cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed
   gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of
   compartment sx in LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for [**Telephone/Fax (3) **] resuscitated.
   in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off
   temp pacer at this time.  last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient
   had been on heparin gtt but stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off
   pressors and tolerated -2L yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial
   fibrillation, converted back to sinus without BB.   Since, she had
   additional episodes of afib that is rate controlled and she converts
   back to sinus on her own.  While in AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, BB no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - f/u AM CXR
   - CVVH negative I/O as tolerated, diuresis with pressors if need; net
   goal -2L today
   - CK daily

   - may consider amiodarone if Afib persists
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status is hindering the process
   of weaning.  Tolerated short course of pressure support, however tired
   out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure support
   trials.
   -tolerated 10 hours of  pressure support trial
   - s/p trach continue try to wean.
   - take off more [**Last Name (Titles) **] as tolerated to facilitate extubation.

 Patient now having large BMs with Lactulose.  NGT found
   to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per GI.
   Had melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.  suspect Oozing in
   the setting of DIC, ?[**1-31**] gastritis or stress ulcer in the setting of
   vented patient only on H2, patient had
explosive
 BM o/n which was not
   frankly bloody.  Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture.
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - VSS, NG lavage clear, no acute bleeding
   - Giving vit K, FFP, f/u on INR
   - BM regimen, cont lactulose
   - PICC placement failed, no viable line for TPN
   - started tube feeds at 10cc/hr
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous myocardial infarction. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. She experienced cardiogenic shock initially but has now improved to a cardiac index of 3.1. She remains on phenylephrine to maintain blood pressure. 

The patient has had multiple complications including atrial fibrillation, which converted back to sinus rhythm spontaneously. She also developed a Klebsiella pneumonia infection, which is being treated with appropriate antibiotics. The patient has been on CVVH for renal failure, which showed muddy brown casts and hyperkalemia. Her renal function is improving, and she has had a successful trial off CVVH. 

She has an ileus with large bowel movements and was found to have a proximal duodenal NG tube placement on CT abdomen/pelvis. She is being weaned off sedation, and her tracheostomy tube is being weaned as well. 

Her coagulopathy is likely due to chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hepatic insufficiency. She received a transfusion of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets, and her platelet count is now increasing. 

The patient has developed compartment syndrome"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Spontaneous opened eyes and moved hands with lactulose despite
   fentanyl @100 and.  Patient was grimacing to suction and pain.  However
   her sedation had to be re-started given her disynchrony with the vent.
   Appears to be more responsive after weaning off sedation.
   - watch for mental status improvement
   - continue lactulose titrate to 4 BM/day
   - continue to wean sedation
   .
   # Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around
   territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more
   hemodynamically stable. Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor
   cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed
   gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of
   compartment sx in LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for [**Telephone/Fax (3) **] resuscitated.
   in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off
   temp pacer at this time.  last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient
   had been on heparin gtt but stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off
   pressors and tolerated -2L yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial
   fibrillation, converted back to sinus without BB.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, BB no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - f/u AM CXR
   - CVVH negative I/O as tolerated, diuresis with pressors if need
   - CK daily
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status is hindering the process
   of weaning.  Tolerated short course of pressure support, however tired
   out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure support
   trials.
   -tolerated 10 hours of  pressure support trial
   - s/p trach continue try to wean.
   - take off more [**Last Name (Titles) **] as tolerated to facilitate extubation.
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having large BMs with Lactulose.  NGT found
   to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per GI.
   Had melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.
   - IV PPI changed to 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - cont lactulose
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   Melena/bloody BM
 suspect Oozing in the setting of DIC, ?[**1-31**] gastritis
   or stress ulcer in the setting of vented patient only on H2, patient
   had
explosive
 BM o/n which was not frankly bloody.  Hepatic
   dysfunction contributing to this picture.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO BID
   - VSS, NG lavage clear, no acute bleeding
   - IV protonix does NOT interfere with plavix
   - Giving vit K, FFP, f/u on INR
   - BM regimen
   - PICC placement failed, no viable line for TPN
   - started tube feeds at 10cc/hr
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - f/u Renal recs re: CVVH
 monitor lytes (Ca, phos), CVVH line needs
   to be changed.
   - f/u UOP, given elevated CVP, normal SVR will continue to run
   negative.
   - patient to get tunneled CVVH line on Monday
   .
   # ID:  patient had a markedly elevated WBC, but now improving (34->29.6
 24.8
 14.8).  CT of abd was negative, CT of sinus showed collection
 low suspicion (see ID note in OMR).  Patient currently being treated
   for Klebsiella PNA (culture positive on [**10-26**]).  Per ID recs, this
   could be explained by inflammatory response [**1-31**] necrosis of leg tissue
   + Klebsiella PNA.  No empiric fungal treatment warranted at this time.
   C Diff negative.  Bumped to 27 o/n, down to 24 this AM.  Patient with
   multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, which both need
   resiting, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX, Glucan, Galactomanan, C.
   Diff, vanco lvl
   - will consider adding meropenem +/- cipro for Pseudomonas cx if
   cultures come back pos or if patient decompensates
   - on cefepime (since [**10-26**], currently D10), vanc (since [**10-26**],
   currently D10), flagyl (since [**10-28**], currently D8) of presumed 14day
   course
   - obtain IR-guided PICC tomorrow when she gets tunneled cath, pull
   triple-lumen at that time
   - ID signed off
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] chronic DIC/hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - H+H relatively stable, plts are rising
   - Transfuse prn again this PM if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct >
   30.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR continues to rise or bleeding continues, goal
   INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - monitor DIC labs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. She is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological: The patient is experiencing disynchrony with the ventilator and grimacing to suction and pain. This indicates the need for continuous monitoring of her mental status and sedation levels.

2. Cardiovascular: The patient had an acute inferior STEMI and was treated with PCI. She also experienced cardiogenic shock initially but has improved. She is currently on levophed for hemodynamic support. There are concerns about elevated PA diastolic/CVP and the development of atrial fibrillation. Close monitoring of cardiac function and hemodynamics is necessary.

3. Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been tolerating short periods of pressure support but tires out quickly. There is a need for continued weaning off sedation and monitoring of respiratory function.

4. Gastrointestinal: The patient has ileus and has been experiencing large bowel movements with lactulose. There is a concern for potential bleeding due to melena and bloody bowel movements. She is being monitored for any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and is receiving"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and was found to have cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. She is currently in the ICU for ongoing management.

Medical Complications:
1. Neurological: The patient's mental status is being hindered by the need for sedation. There is a plan to wean sedation as tolerated and monitor for mental status improvement.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient had an acute inferior STEMI and was treated with PCI. She initially had poor cardiac output but has improved to a cardiac index of 3.1. There is a concern for elevated PA diastolic/CVP and the development of compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity. The patient is on multiple pressors and has been weaned off the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).
3. Respiratory: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress due to acute respiratory failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. There is a plan to continue sedation holidays and pressure support trials.
4. Gastrointestinal: The patient has developed ileus, with large bowel movements and melenotic/frankly bloody stool. She is being treated with lactulose, and there is a plan to wean sedation as tolerated."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stenting of the left main coronary artery and the left anterior descending artery. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management of her critical condition.

Medical Complications:

1. Neurological: The patient's mental status is still impaired due to the need for sedation. There is a need to monitor for any improvement in mental status. Sedation should be weaned as tolerated, but agitation and increased heart rate may hinder this process.

2. Cardiovascular: The patient had an acute inferior STEMI in the distal left anterior descending artery territory. She was initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output but has now improved. The patient's PA diastolic pressure and CVP are elevated. She is off the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to the development of compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity. The patient's blood pressure is relatively stable, but she had an episode of sinus arrest in the cath lab. She is currently off the temporary pacemaker.

3. Respiratory Distress: The patient continues to have difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. She requires increasing courses of pressure support, and sedation holidays are being attempted. The patient is tolerating"

","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous acute inferior STEMI. She presented with cardiogenic shock and was found to have acute kidney injury (ARF) likely secondary to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. The patient also has rhabdomyolysis with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, which have since downtrended.

The patient has multiple comorbidities and complications, including hepatic dysfunction, respiratory distress, gastrointestinal ileus, renal failure, infection (Klebsiella pneumonia), and thrombocytopenia. She underwent several interventions such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), femoral-femoral bypass, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), tracheostomy, and placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter.

The patient's current vital signs are within normal limits, but she requires ongoing support with mechanical ventilation and hemodynamic monitoring. Her laboratory values show abnormalities in liver function tests, coagulation profile, electrolytes, and renal function. She is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and supportive care.

The patient's medical team is concerned about potential complications such as sepsis, multiorgan failure, bleeding, deep vein thrombosis, and further deterioration of her renal and hepatic functions."

   # Neuro: Progressive improvement is hindered by need to have sedation
   restarted regularly [**1-31**] dysynchrony with her vent
   - watch for mental status improvement
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   .
   # Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around
   territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more
   hemodynamically stable. Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor
   cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed
   gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of
   compartment sx in LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for [**Month/Day (2) **] resuscitated.
   in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off
   temp pacer at this time.  last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient
   had been on heparin gtt but stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off
   pressors and tolerated -2L yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial
   fibrillation, converted back to sinus without BB.   Since, she had
   additional episodes of afib that is rate controlled and she converts
   back to sinus on her own.  While in AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, BB no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - f/u AM CXR, CK
   - hold CVVH and watch for uop.
   - continue pressure support on neo(phenylephedrine)
   - may consider amiodarone if Afib persists (respond to dilt gtt rate
   control)
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status is hindering the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support trials.
   - s/p trach on mask.
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR.
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having large BMs with Lactulose.  NGT found
   to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per GI.
   Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had melenotic/frankly
   bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Giving vit K, FFP, f/u on INR
   - BM regimen, cont lactulose
   - started tube feeds at 10cc/hr-attempting to increase
   - f/u on PEG placement
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - f/u Renal recs re: hold CVVH
 monitor lytes (Ca, phos), discuss
   better CVVH line with renal.
   - monitor urine output (BUN, Cr climbing)
   .
   # ID:  patient had a markedly elevated WBC, but now improving (34->29.6
 24.8
 14.8).  CT of abd was negative, CT of sinus showed collection
 low suspicion (see ID note in OMR).  Patient currently being treated
   for Klebsiella PNA (culture positive on [**10-26**]).  Per ID recs, this
   could be explained by inflammatory response [**1-31**] necrosis of leg tissue
   + Klebsiella PNA.  No empiric fungal treatment warranted at this time.
   C Diff negative.  Bumped to 27 o/n, down to 24 this AM.  Patient with
   multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, which both need
   resiting, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX, Glucan, Galactomanan, C.
   Diff, vanco lvl
   - will consider adding meropenem +/- cipro for Pseudomonas cx if
   cultures come back pos or if patient decompensates
   - d/c Cefepime, continue diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for
   speciation.
   - wbc climbing
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - Transfuse prn if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct > 30.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR rise or bleeding continues, goal INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and subsequent cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to LMCA and LAD. She was initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output but has improved to a cardiac index of 3.1 on levophed gtt. She has been on invasive ventilation and has been weaned down to tracheostomy mask. CVVH was stopped due to renal recommendations but may be restarted if urine output does not improve. The patient was on multiple pressors but is now only on phenylephrine. She was on insulin gtt but has been discontinued.

Physical examination shows the patient is intubated, opens eyes spontaneously, and is nonresponsive to verbal/tactile stimuli. Her temperature is 37.6°C, heart rate is 118 bpm, blood pressure is 107/42 mmHg, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient has cool, weak, thready pulses bilaterally.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, elevated D-dimer, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are significantly elevated, indicating rhabdomyolysis. Imaging studies show"

She presented with an acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and was subsequently intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). 

The patient has experienced several complications during her ICU stay, including respiratory distress, ileus, acute renal failure (ARF), hepatic dysfunction, rhabdomyolysis, and thrombocytopenia. These conditions have required interventions such as tracheostomy, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), IABP (intra-aortic balloon pump), fasciotomy, and transfusions of blood products. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 107/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, creatinine, lactate, and D-dimer levels. The patient's platelet count is below 100,000/mm3, but increasing after transfusions.

   # Neuro: Limited progression [**1-31**] fentanyl gtt.
   - watch for mental status improvement
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - d/c fentanyl gtt, switch to IV boluses for pain
   - follow off lactulose, low threshold to restart
   .
   # Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around
   territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more
   hemodynamically stable. Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor
   cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed
   gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of
   compartment sx in LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for [**Month/Day (2) **] resuscitated.
   in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off
   temp pacer at this time.  last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient
   had been on heparin gtt but stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off
   pressors and tolerated -2L yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial
   fibrillation, converted back to sinus without BB.   Since, she had
   additional episodes of afib that is rate controlled and she converts
   back to sinus on her own.  While in AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, BB no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - f/u AM CXR, CK
   - restart CVVH and [**1-31**] poor uop.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)
   - may consider amiodarone if Afib persists (respond to dilt gtt rate
   control)
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status is hindering the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support trials.
   - s/p trach on mask.
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR.
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having large BMs with Lactulose.  NGT found
   to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per GI.
   Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had melenotic/frankly
   bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.  Off lactulose had roughly 230cc of
   stool yesterday.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Giving vit K, FFP, f/u on INR
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - on tube feeds, tolerating advanced diet
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   -          per Renal recs, holding CVVH for now to see if patient has
   good UOP.  Will restart today as patient cannot tolerate being off
   CVVH.
   -          Hyperkalemia discussed with renal, who asked us not to give
   kayexalate and will remove in HD
   .
   # ID:  WBC trending down despite smoldering fever this AM.  Patient
   with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral skin
   break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX,
   - Glucan (-), Galactomanan- low intermediate, C. Diff (-)
   - will consider adding restarting abx meropenem +/- cipro for
   Pseudomonas cx if cultures come back pos or if patient decompensates
   - continue diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for speciation.
   - wbc falling
   - culture if spike
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - Transfuse prn if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR rise or bleeding continues, goal INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and subsequent cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Neurological: The patient has limited mental status progression and is on fentanyl gtt for pain. The plan is to watch for mental status improvement, continue fentanyl patch for pain, discontinue fentanyl gtt, switch to IV boluses for pain, and follow off lactulose with a low threshold to restart.

2. Cardiovascular: The patient had an acute inferior STEMI in the distal left anterior descending artery territory. She underwent PCI to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient initially had poor cardiac output but has improved to a cardiac index of 3.1 on levophed gtt. Elevated pulmonary artery diastolic pressure and central venous pressure were observed. The patient was off intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to development of compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE). The patient's last transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows apical dyskinesis. The patient was on heparin gtt but stopped due to bleeding concerns. She is off beta-blockers (BB) due"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient experienced cardiogenic shock initially but has since improved. She had an episode of atrial fibrillation that was rate-controlled and converted back to sinus rhythm on its own. The patient also had respiratory distress and required pressure support and tracheostomy placement. She had an ileus with large bowel movements, bloody stools, and was found to have a proximal duodenal obstruction on CT abdomen/pelvis. Hepatic dysfunction was noted, and she was given intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy. The patient's renal function was affected, with acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis, which required continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). She also had a central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection, and multiple fungal cultures were obtained. The patient underwent fasciotomy and wound VAC placement for compartment syndrome. Her liver enzymes were elevated, but now they are within normal limits. She has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are being managed with blood product transfusions and factor repletion. Insulin therapy was initiated for IDDM, and the patient's hypertension and hyperlipidemia are being managed accordingly. The patient's current condition"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and subsequent complications. The patient has undergone various interventions including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement, tracheostomy, and fasciotomy.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

- Neurologic: Limited mental status improvement, sedation with fentanyl, and monitoring for mental status improvement.
- Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD territory, post-PCI with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery and LAD, improved cardiac output but still on vasopressor support, elevated PA diastolic/CVP, and apical dyskinesis on TTE.
- Respiratory: Respiratory distress due to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), requiring pressure support and weaning trials.
- Gastrointestinal: ileus with large bowel movements, proximal duodenal placement of NG tube, and hepatic dysfunction contributing to the picture. Melenotic/frankly bloody stools were initially observed, prompting the use of IV PPI and subsequent transition to oral PPI.
- Renal: Acute renal failure (ARF) likely secondary to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure, now improving with CVVH and good urine"

   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - d/c fentanyl gtt, switch to IV boluses for pain
   - follow off lactulose, low threshold to restart
   .
   # Cardiovascular: Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around
   territory. S/P BMS to LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more
   hemodynamically stable. Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor
   cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9), now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed
   gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of
   compartment sx in LLE.  Reached goal CVP >12 for [**Month/Day (2) **] resuscitated.
   in NSR/sinus tach but had an episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off
   temp pacer at this time.  last TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient
   had been on heparin gtt but stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off
   pressors and tolerated -2L yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial
   fibrillation, converted back to sinus without BB.   Since, she had
   additional episodes of afib that is rate controlled and she converts
   back to sinus on her own.  While in AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, BB no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - f/u AM CXR, CK
   - restart CVVH and [**1-31**] poor uop
 I/O -1L.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)
   - may consider amiodarone if Afib persists (respond to dilt gtt rate
   control)
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status is hindering the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support trials.
   - s/p trach mask
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR.
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having large BMs with Lactulose.  NGT found
   to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per GI.
   Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had melenotic/frankly
   bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.  Off lactulose had roughly 230cc of
   stool yesterday.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Giving vit K, FFP, f/u on INR
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - on tube feeds, tolerating advanced diet
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - per Renal recs, holding CVVH for now to see if patient has good UOP.
   Will restart today as patient cannot tolerate being off CVVH.
   - Hyperkalemia discussed with renal, who asked us not to give
   kayexalate and will remove in HD
   .
   # ID:  WBC trending down despite smoldering fever this AM.  Patient
   with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral skin
   break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX,
   - Glucan (-), Galactomanan- low intermediate, C. Diff (-)
   - will consider adding restarting abx meropenem +/- cipro for
   Pseudomonas cx if cultures come back pos or if patient decompensates
   - continue diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for speciation.
   - wbc falling
   - culture if spike
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - Transfuse prn if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR rise or bleeding continues, goal INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - renal to discuss epo

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent balloon angioplasty and stenting of the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient experienced multiple complications including respiratory distress, ileus, acute renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, rhabdomyolysis, and thrombocytopenia.

Respiratory Distress: The patient's tracheostomy tube was suctioned and blood-tinged sputum was obtained. She is currently on pressure support ventilation and is tolerating it well. The plan is to continue sedation holidays and pressure support trials.

GI: The patient developed ileus and had large bowel movements with lactulose. An NG tube was placed and found to be in the proximal duodenum. The patient was started on IV proton pump inhibitor due to melena and frank bloody stools. She is now on oral pantoprazole. The plan is to hold lactulose, start tube feeds, and monitor for any further gastrointestinal issues.

Renal: The patient has acute renal failure likely secondary to poor renal perfusion from initial cardiogenic failure. She is producing muddy brown casts on urinalysis and has hyperkalemia. The patient required continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) but had to be held due to poor urine output. The plan is to restart CVV"

","The patient is a 62-inch, 80.9 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. Upon admission, the patient had an increased respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, and crackles in the right lung. The patient also had elevated white blood cell count and elevated lactate levels, indicating possible infection or sepsis.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's blood pressure is low, with a systolic blood pressure of 96 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure of 41 mmHg. The patient's heart rate is elevated at 116 beats per minute, and the patient has a fever with a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of C-reactive protein, leukocyte count, lactate, and D-dimer, which are indicative of an inflammatory response and possible systemic inflammation or sepsis. The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including metronidazole, flucon"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU for various medical complications. The patient has a history of ineffective coping, type I diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleed, shock, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, cardiacogenic shock, renal failure, and pain control. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.8°C, blood pressure ranging from 104/37 to 138/62 mmHg, heart rate between 96-134 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is receiving multiple medications and treatments, including insulin, metoprolol, pantoprazole, phenylephrine, and dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated temperature and abnormal white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and there is evidence of fluid in the lungs based on the ABG results. This could suggest respiratory distress or the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and the presence of cardiac issues such as atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction indicate the possibility of cardiogenic shock.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function, which"

   - waking up overnight with less fentanyl
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - d/c fentanyl gtt, switch to IV boluses for pain
   - doing well off lactulose
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached

 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off pressors and tolerated -2L
   yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial fibrillation, converted back to
   sinus without BB.   Since, she had additional episodes of afib that is
   rate controlled and she converts back to sinus on her own.  While in
   AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, BB no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - f/u AM CXR, CK
   - restart CVVH and [**1-31**] poor uop
 I/O -1L.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)
   - Echo to evaluate cardiac function or wall motion abnormalities as a
   source for her persistent pressor need
   .
   #Afib/Aflutter: Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] seems to go in and out of Atrial Fibrillation
   on a nightly basis.  On [**11-11**] she was noted to be in flutter briefly at
   a rate of 140.  She broke with carotid massage, and 5mg of IV
   metoprolol.
   - Rate control with Metoprolol now increased to 25mg q6h
   -          Consider A/C if she continues to flip in and out as it is
   impossible to gage how long she has been in AFIB/AFLUTTER
   -          Consider Rhythym control with Amiodarone
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status have hindering the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support trials.
   - She does well on trach mask throughout the day and routinely retains
   CO2 towards the end of the evening
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  NGT
   found to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per
   GI. Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had
   melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.  Off lactulose had
   roughly 230cc of stool yesterday.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - INR nearly normal, no need for FFP, vitamin K
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - on tube feeds, tolerating advanced diet
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - per Renal recs, holding CVVH for now to see if patient has good UOP.
   Will restart today as patient cannot tolerate being off CVVH.
   - Hyperkalemia discussed with renal, who asked us not to give
   kayexalate and will remove in HD
   .
   # ID:  WBC trending down despite smoldering fever this AM.  Patient
   with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral skin
   break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX,
   - Glucan (-), Galactomanan- low intermediate, C. Diff (-)
   - will consider adding restarting abx meropenem +/- cipro for
   Pseudomonas cx if cultures come back pos or if patient decompensates
   - continue diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for speciation.
   - wbc falling
   - culture if spike
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). She initially required intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support and was later switched to veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO).

The patient experienced several complications, including atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response, which was initially rate-controlled with metoprolol and later converted back to sinus rhythm. She also had an episode of atrial flutter with a rate of 140 beats per minute, which resolved spontaneously. The patient's respiratory distress has hindered weaning from mechanical ventilation, and she continues to require pressure support. She is tolerating advanced diet and has been weaned off lactulose.

The patient's renal function deteriorated, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI), likely secondary to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. She developed muddy brown casts on urine analysis and hyperkalemia up to 6.8. The patient required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to anuria and hyperkalemia, but her urine output has improved recently.

The patient's gastrointestinal (GI)"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). She was initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output but has improved to a cardiac index of 3.1 this morning on levophed infusion. The patient's PA diastolic pressure is elevated, and she is off intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to the development of compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE). 

The patient's recent events include being in atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response, which was converted back to sinus rhythm without the use of beta-blockers (BB). She has had additional episodes of AFib that are rate-controlled and convert back to sinus rhythm on their own. The patient's respiratory distress is hindering the process of weaning from mechanical ventilation. She is tolerating tracheostomy mask trials and retaining carbon dioxide towards the end of the evening. 

The patient's gastrointestinal (GI) status shows improvement with regular bowel movements off lactulose. She had melenotic/furiously bloody bowel movement (BM) on [11-2], and she was put on intravenous proton"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and subsequent cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Neurologically, the patient is showing limited progression but requires opiates for pain management.
- The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and atrial flutter, which have been rate-controlled and converted back to sinus rhythm spontaneously.
- Respiratory distress is ongoing, and the patient is still dependent on the tracheostomy tube with pressure support.
- Gastrointestinal issues include ileus, but the patient has now started having regular bowel movements and is tolerating advanced diet.
- Renal function is compromised, with acute renal failure (ARF) likely due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. The patient has muddy brown casts on urine analysis and hyperkalemia. Rhabdomyolysis with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels is also present.
- Infection concerns include possible wound infection with elevated fevers and elevated white blood cell count (WBC).
- Coagulopathy is present, likely due to hepatic"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Limited progression [**1-31**] need for opiates.  Patch reduced from
   100mg to 50mg.
   - waking up overnight with less fentanyl
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - d/c fentanyl gtt, switch to IV boluses for pain
   - doing well off lactulose
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for [**Month/Day (2) **] resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last
   TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off pressors and tolerated -2L
   yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial fibrillation, converted back to
   sinus without BB.   Since, she had additional episodes of afib that is
   rate controlled and she converts back to sinus on her own.  While in
   AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, BB no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - f/u AM CXR, CK
   - f/u Echo this AM
   - restarted CVVH [**1-31**] poor uop
 I/O even for now.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)
   - Echo to evaluate cardiac function or wall motion abnormalities as a
   source for her persistent pressor need
   .
   # Afib/Aflutter: Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] seems to go in and out of Atrial Fibrillation
   on a nightly basis.  On [**11-11**] she was noted to be in flutter briefly at
   a rate of 140.  She broke with carotid massage, and 5mg of IV
   metoprolol.
   - Rate control with Metoprolol now increased to 25mg q6h will wean down
   with amiodarone on board
   - start amiodarone load for rhythm control
   - holding AC at this time given bleeding issue
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status have hindered the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support and trach mask trials.
   - She does well on trach mask throughout the day and routinely retains
   CO2 towards the end of the evening
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   - this AM on CPAP ABG revealed metabolic acidosis without respiratory
   compensation
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  NGT
   found to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per
   GI. Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had
   melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.  Off lactulose had
   roughly 230cc of stool yesterday.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - INR nearly normal, no need for FFP, vitamin K
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - on tube feeds, tolerating advanced diet
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - per Renal recs, holding CVVH for now to see if patient has good UOP.
   Will restart today as patient cannot tolerate being off CVVH.
   - Hyperkalemia discussed with renal, who asked us not to give
   kayexalate and will remove in HD
   .
   # ID:  WBC elevated with elevated fevers and likely wound infection.
   Patient with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral
   skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX,
   - Glucan (-), Galactomanan- low intermediate, C. Diff (-)
   -  Restarting Vanc and adding Zosyn to cover her likely leg infection
   - continue diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for speciation.
   - wbc falling
   - culture if spikes
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - Transfuse prn if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR rise or bleeding continues, goal INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - renal to discuss epo

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient initially required hemodynamic support with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and vasopressors but has since been weaned off these therapies. She continues to have episodes of atrial fibrillation that are rate-controlled and self-convert to sinus rhythm.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, tolerating increased periods on pressure support and tracheostomy mask. However, she remains dependent on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. Her gastrointestinal function is returning, with regular bowel movements and tolerance of advanced diet. Renal function remains impaired, with anuria and oliguria, but urine output has improved with CVVH.

The patient's infection workup is ongoing, with elevated white blood cell count and fevers, suggesting a possible wound infection. Cultures have been obtained, and she is being treated empirically with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Her coagulopathy has resolved with factor repletion, and she is no longer bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued dependence on mechanical ventilation: The patient's respiratory status has improved but she still requires CPAP"

   .
   # Neuro: Limited progression [**1-31**] need for opiates.  Patch reduced from
   100mg to 50mg.
   - waking up overnight with less fentanyl
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - d/c fentanyl gtt, switch to IV boluses for pain
   - doing well off lactulose
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for [**Month/Day (2) **] resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last
   TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off pressors and tolerated -2L
   yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial fibrillation, converted back to
   sinus without BB.   Since, she had additional episodes of afib that is
   rate controlled and she converts back to sinus on her own.  While in
   AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, BB no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - f/u AM CXR, CK
   - f/u Echo this AM
   - restarted CVVH [**1-31**] poor uop
 I/O even for now.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)
   - Echo to evaluate cardiac function or wall motion abnormalities as a
   source for her persistent pressor need
   .
   # Afib/Aflutter: Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] seems to go in and out of Atrial Fibrillation
   on a nightly basis.  On [**11-11**] she was noted to be in flutter briefly at
   a rate of 140.  She broke with carotid massage, and 5mg of IV
   metoprolol.
   - discontinue metoprolol as in the setting of shock her BP will not
   tolerate
   - continue amiodarone load for rhythm control
   - holding AC at this time given bleeding issue
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status have hindered the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support and trach mask trials.
   - She does well on trach mask throughout the day and routinely retains
   CO2 towards the end of the evening
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   - this AM on CPAP ABG revealed metabolic acidosis without respiratory
   compensation
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  NGT
   found to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per
   GI. Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had
   melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.  Off lactulose had
   roughly 230cc of stool yesterday.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - INR nearly normal, no need for FFP, vitamin K
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - on tube feeds, tolerating advanced diet
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - per Renal recs, holding CVVH for now to see if patient has good UOP.
   Will restart today as patient cannot tolerate being off CVVH.
   - Hyperkalemia discussed with renal, who asked us not to give
   kayexalate and will remove in HD
   .
   # ID:  WBC elevated with elevated fevers and likely wound infection.
   Patient with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral
   skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX,
   - Glucan (-), Galactomanan- low intermediate, C. Diff (-)
   -  Restarting Vanc and adding Zosyn to cover her likely leg infection
   - continue diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for speciation.
   - wbc falling
   - culture if spikes
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - Transfuse prn if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR rise or bleeding continues, goal INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - renal to discuss epo

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting in the left main coronary artery and the left anterior descending artery. Post-PCI, the patient required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support due to persistent hypotension and poor cardiac output.

Since admission, the patient has experienced several complications. Neurologically, the patient has had limited progression in consciousness and requires opiates for pain management. The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation that converted back to sinus rhythm on its own and is currently being rate-controlled. 

Respiratory distress has hindered the weaning process, and the patient continues to require pressure support and is being evaluated for extubation. The patient also has evidence of ileus, which has resolved with the discontinuation of lactulose and initiation of bowel regimen. The patient is now tolerating advanced diet and tube feeds.

Renally, the patient has acute kidney injury with muddy brown casts and hyperkalemia, which is being managed with CVVH and close monitoring of electrolytes. The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to hepatic insufficiency, as indicated by improvement in coagulation parameters with factor repletion.

Infectiously, the patient has an elevated white blood cell count, fevers, and likely wound infection. Cult"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and subsequent cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient was initially on heparin, but it was discontinued due to concerns of bleeding. She also experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter, which were successfully converted back to sinus rhythm.

The patient's respiratory status has been complicated by respiratory distress, and she has been on increasing levels of pressure support and CPAP. There have been efforts to wean her off the ventilator, but she remains dependent on it. A tracheostomy was performed, and she tolerates advanced diet through the tracheostomy tube. However, she continues to have difficulty with weaning from mechanical ventilation.

The patient's gastrointestinal (GI) function was initially compromised, leading to ileus. She has now started having regular bowel movements and has been taken off lactulose. An upper gastrointestinal (GI) tube was placed, and tube feeds have been initiated. She also experienced melena and bloody stools, prompting the initiation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, which has been transitioned to oral medication.

Renal function has been impaired, likely due to poor renal perfusion secondary to cardiogenic shock. The patient developed acute"

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to LMCA and LAD. She required intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, but developed compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE), leading to fasciotomy and wound VAC placement. She also had ileus, respiratory distress, renal failure, wound infection, hepatic dysfunction, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and rhabdomyolysis.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute inferior STEMI: The patient experienced an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction, which required immediate intervention.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac output was poor initially, resulting in cardiogenic shock.
3. Compartment syndrome: The patient developed compartment syndrome in the LLE, necessitating fasciotomy and wound management.
4. Ileus: The patient had an ileus, which improved with bowel regimen changes.
5. Respiratory distress: The patient experienced respiratory distress, likely due to her critical condition and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
6. Renal failure: The patient had acute kidney injury, possibly due to poor renal perfusion and rhabdomyolysis.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Limited progression [**1-31**] need for opiates.  Patch reduced from
   100mg to 50mg.
   - waking up overnight with less fentanyl
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - doing well off lactulose, d/c rifaximen
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for [**Month/Day (2) **] resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last
   TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off pressors and tolerated -2L
   yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial fibrillation, converted back to
   sinus without BB.   Since, she had additional episodes of afib that is
   rate controlled and she converts back to sinus on her own.  While in
   AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, BB no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - restarted CVVH [**1-31**] poor uop
 I/O even for now.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)
   - Echo to evaluate cardiac function or wall motion abnormalities as a
   source for her persistent pressor need
   .
   # Afib/Aflutter: Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] seems to go in and out of Atrial Fibrillation
   on a nightly basis.  On [**11-11**] she was noted to be in flutter briefly at
   a rate of 140.  She broke with carotid massage, and 5mg of IV
   metoprolol.
   - discontinue metoprolol as in the setting of shock her BP will not
   tolerate
   - continue amiodarone load for rhythm control
   - holding AC at this time given bleeding issue
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status have hindered the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support and trach mask trials.
   - She does well on trach mask throughout the day and routinely retains
   CO2 towards the end of the evening
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   - this AM on CPAP ABG revealed metabolic acidosis without respiratory
   compensation
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  NGT
   found to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per
   GI. Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had
   melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.  Off lactulose had
   roughly 230cc of stool yesterday.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - INR nearly normal, no need for FFP, vitamin K
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - on tube feeds, tolerating advanced diet
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - per Renal recs, holding CVVH for now to see if patient has good UOP.
   Will restart today as patient cannot tolerate being off CVVH.
   - Hyperkalemia discussed with renal, who asked us not to give
   kayexalate and will remove in HD
   .
   # ID:  WBC elevated with elevated fevers and likely wound infection.
   Patient with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral
   skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX,
   - Glucan (-), Galactomanan- low intermediate, C. Diff (-)
   -  Restarting Vanc and adding Zosyn to cover her likely leg infection
   - continue diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for speciation.
   - wbc falling, culture if spikes
   - d/c a-line today if cuff is okay, need to get new a-line if require
   repeat abgs.
   - f/u stool cx.
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - Transfuse prn if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR rise or bleeding continues, goal INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and subsequent complications. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and is currently experiencing multiple medical issues.

Summary of Information:
- The patient had an acute inferior STEMI in the distal LAD territory and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the LMCA and LAD. She initially experienced poor cardiac output but has shown improvement.
- The patient developed cardiogenic shock and required pressors for hemodynamic support. She was also on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support but developed compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE), leading to fasciotomy and wound VAC placement.
- The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation (AFib) on a nightly basis and has had brief episodes of flutter. She was treated with metoprolol initially but now requires amiodarone for rhythm control.
- The patient had respiratory distress and has been on pressure support and tracheostomy with mask trials. She is tolerating advanced diet but still requires CPAP.
- The patient developed ileus and had bloody stools, which were initially treated with IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI). She is now on oral PPI and has had regular bowel movements.
- The patient has acute renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. She has had multiple complications including atrial fibrillation, respiratory distress, ileus, acute renal failure, wound infection, rhabdomyolysis, hepatic dysfunction, and compartment syndrome. She is currently in the ICU receiving various medications and treatments for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient initially presented with cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition where the heart fails to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. It can lead to organ damage and failure if not managed properly.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has had episodes of AFib, which is an abnormal heart rhythm characterized by rapid and irregular beating. It can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.

3. Respiratory Distress: The patient has experienced difficulty breathing and has required assistance with ventilation. This can be due to lung problems or fluid accumulation in the lungs.

4. Ileus: The patient had an ileus, which is a temporary cessation of bowel motility. It can cause bloating, abdominal pain, and constipation. If not managed appropriately, it may lead to complications such"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and required mechanical ventilation. She underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery and the left anterior descending artery. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, which has been rate-controlled and converted back to sinus rhythm spontaneously.

The patient's current condition includes limited neurologic progression, persistent need for opiates, and a reduced dose of the fentanyl patch. She is weaned off lactulose and tolerating advanced diet with tube feeds. The patient's respiratory distress is still ongoing, and she is being supported with pressure support and tracheostomy mask trials. Her gastrointestinal condition involves ileus, and she has regular bowel movements off lactulose. She is being monitored for hepatic dysfunction and has bloody stools, for which she was put on IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and is now on oral PPI.

The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. She has muddy brown casts on urine analysis, hyperkalemia, and anuria post catheterization. She is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) but will be held for now to see if she has good urine output. The patient's infection control measures include fungal cultures, bacterial cultures"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Limited progression [**1-31**] need for opiates.  Patch reduced from
   100mg to 50mg.
   - waking up overnight with less fentanyl
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - doing well off lactulose, rifaximin
   .
   # ID:  WBC elevated with elevated fevers and likely wound infection.
   Patient with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral
   skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX,
   - Glucan (-), Galactomanan- low intermediate, C. Diff (-)
   - Restarting Vanc and adding Zosyn to cover her likely leg infection
   - continue diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for speciation.
   - wbc falling, culture if spikes
   - d/c a-line today if cuff is okay, need to get new a-line if require
   repeat abgs.
   - f/u stool cx, consider MRI for osteo if continued spikes/increase in
   WBC
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   - per Renal recs, stopped CVVH.  Pt will likely need HD at this point
   in time.  Will likely start HD Wednesday or Thursday this week.
   - Hyperkalemia discussed with renal, who asked us not to give
   kayexalate and will remove in HD
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for [**Numeric Identifier **] resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last
   TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off pressors and tolerated -2L
   yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial fibrillation, converted back to
   sinus without BB.   Since, she had additional episodes of afib that is
   rate controlled and she converts back to sinus on her own.  While in
   AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)
   - likely etiology for continued pressor requirement at this time is
   distributive shock
   .
   # Afib/Aflutter: Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] seems to go in and out of Atrial Fibrillation
   on a nightly basis.  On [**11-11**] she was noted to be in flutter briefly at
   a rate of 140.  She broke with carotid massage, and 5mg of IV
   metoprolol.
   - discontinue metoprolol as in the setting of shock her BP will not
   tolerate
   - continue amiodarone load for rhythm control
   - holding AC at this time given bleeding issue
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status have hindered the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support and trach mask trials.
   - She does well on trach mask throughout the day and routinely retains
   CO2 towards the end of the evening
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   - this AM on CPAP ABG revealed metabolic acidosis without respiratory
   compensation
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - Transfuse prn if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR rise or bleeding continues, goal INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - renal rec

   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  NGT
   found to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per
   GI. Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. 

The patient has been in the ICU since admission and has experienced several complications. She developed a wound infection at the site of her leg wound, which was treated with antibiotics. She also developed acute renal failure (ARF), likely due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure, and is now dependent on dialysis. 

The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation and flutter but has been successfully converted back to sinus rhythm. She continues to require pressor support due to distributive shock. 

She has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are likely due to blood loss from an open fasciotomy and dilutional effects from large volume IV repletion. Her coagulopathy is improving with factor repletion. 

The patient has ileus, but now has regular bowel movements and has been taken off lactulose. She has hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. 

She developed compartment syndrome in her left lower extremity, which required fasciotomy and wound vacuum-assisted closure. 

Her liver function tests were markedly elevated but have now normalized.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Limited progression [**1-31**] need for opiates.  Patch reduced from
   100mg to 50mg.
   - waking up overnight with less fentanyl
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - doing well off lactulose, d/c rifaximen
   .
   # ID:  WBC elevated with elevated fevers and likely wound infection.
   Patient with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral
   skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX,
   - Glucan (-), Galactomanan- low intermediate, C. Diff (-)
   - Restarting Vanc and adding Zosyn to cover her likely leg infection
   - continue diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for speciation.
   - wbc falling, culture if spikes
   - d/c a-line today if cuff is okay, need to get new a-line if require
   repeat abgs.
   - f/u stool cx, consider MRI for osteo.
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   required CVVH.  Urine output now improving, 310cc yesterday with -2L on
   CVVH
   - per Renal recs, holding CVVH for now to see if patient has good UOP.
   Will restart today as patient cannot tolerate being off CVVH.
   - Hyperkalemia discussed with renal, who asked us not to give
   kayexalate and will remove in HD
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for [**Numeric Identifier **] resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last
   TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off pressors and tolerated -2L
   yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial fibrillation, converted back to
   sinus without BB.   Since, she had additional episodes of afib that is
   rate controlled and she converts back to sinus on her own.  While in
   AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)
   - Echo to evaluate cardiac function or wall motion abnormalities as a
   source for her persistent pressor need
   .
   # Afib/Aflutter: Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] seems to go in and out of Atrial Fibrillation
   on a nightly basis.  On [**11-11**] she was noted to be in flutter briefly at
   a rate of 140.  She broke with carotid massage, and 5mg of IV
   metoprolol.
   - discontinue metoprolol as in the setting of shock her BP will not
   tolerate
   - continue amiodarone load for rhythm control
   - holding AC at this time given bleeding issue
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status have hindered the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support and trach mask trials.
   - She does well on trach mask throughout the day and routinely retains
   CO2 towards the end of the evening
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   - this AM on CPAP ABG revealed metabolic acidosis without respiratory
   compensation
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - Transfuse prn if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR rise or bleeding continues, goal INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - renal rec

   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  NGT
   found to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per
   GI. Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had
   melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.  Off lactulose had
   roughly 230cc of stool yesterday.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - INR nearly normal, no need for FFP, vitamin K
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - on tube feeds, tolerating advanced diet

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient has been in the ICU since then and has developed several complications.

The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. She also has fevers and a wound infection at the site of her leg wound, which is being treated with antibiotics. The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to acute kidney injury (AKI) caused by poor renal perfusion during cardiogenic shock. She has muddy brown casts in her urine, suggesting tubular injury. The patient required continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for renal support.

The patient's cardiac function is compromised, with an episode of atrial fibrillation and flutter. She is currently on amiodarone for rhythm control, and her blood pressure is being supported with phenylephrine. An echocardiogram shows apical dyskinesis.

The patient has thrombocytopenia and anemia, which are likely due to blood loss from the open fasciotomy and dilutional effects from large volume IV repletion. She received a transfusion of packed red blood"

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery (LAD) and developed cardiogenic shock. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation, as well as vasopressor support.

The patient has been diagnosed with various medical complications, including:
1. Neurological issues: The patient is experiencing limited neurologic progression and requires opiates for pain management. There is a patch reduction from 100mg to 50mg.
2. Acute inferior STEMI: The patient had an acute inferior STEMI in the distal LAD territory. She underwent PCI with stenting of the LAD and was initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output. The patient's PA diastolic/CVP is elevated, and she has apical dyskinesis on TTE.
3. Atrial fibrillation/flutter: The patient experiences episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter, which are rate-controlled and convert back to sinus rhythm on their own. She has had additional episodes of afib that drop her pressure.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient has had difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. She tolerates increasing courses of pressure support and does well on tracheostomy mask trials.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and required intubation. She has multiple comorbidities and complications including wound infection, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, respiratory distress, anemia, thrombocytopenia, ileus, compartment syndrome, elevated liver enzymes, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires ongoing supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound infection: The patient has an open fasciotomy wound and positive cultures for Klebsiella and yeast. There is a concern for a wound infection, and antibiotics have been started.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has muddy brown casts on urinalysis and anuria post catheterization. She requires dialysis, and her renal function needs close monitoring.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has had multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation, which needs to be rate-controlled and converted back to sinus rhythm.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient is having difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation due to her underlying condition and requires continued pressure support.
5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has early anemia and thrombocytopenia likely due to blood loss and dilutional effects. Blood product transfusions have been given, and ongoing monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Limited progression [**1-31**] need for opiates.  Patch reduced from
   100mg to 50mg.
   - waking up overnight with less fentanyl
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - doing well off lactulose, rifaximin
   - speech & swallow consult for Passy-Muir trial
   .
   # ID:  WBC elevated with elevated fevers and likely wound infection.
   Patient with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral
   skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX,
   - Glucan (-), Galactomanan- low intermediate, C. Diff (-)
   - Restarting Vanc and adding Zosyn to cover her likely leg infection
   - continue diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for speciation.
   - wbc falling, culture if spikes
   - consider a-line for repeat ABG and HD(?).
   - f/u stool cx, consider MRI for osteo if continued spikes/increase in
   WBC
   - rec ID reconsult.
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   - give 500 ml bolus to assess effect on blood pressure
   - per Renal recs, stopped CVVH.  Pt will likely need HD at this point
   in time.  Will likely start HD [**11-16**] or [**11-17**]  this week.
   - Hyperkalemia discussed with renal, who asked us not to give
   kayexalate and will remove in HD
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for [**Month/Year (2) **] resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last
   TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off pressors and tolerated -2L
   yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial fibrillation, converted back to
   sinus without BB.   Since, she had additional episodes of afib that is
   rate controlled and she converts back to sinus on her own.  While in
   AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)
   - likely etiology for continued pressor requirement at this time is
   distributive shock
   .
   # Afib/Aflutter: Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] seems to go in and out of Atrial Fibrillation
   on a nightly basis.  On [**11-11**] she was noted to be in flutter briefly at
   a rate of 140.  She broke with carotid massage, and 5mg of IV
   metoprolol.
   - discontinue metoprolol as in the setting of shock her BP will not
   tolerate
   - continue amiodarone load for rhythm control
   - holding AC at this time given bleeding issue
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status have hindered the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support and trach mask trials.
   - She does well on trach mask throughout the day and routinely retains
   CO2 towards the end of the evening
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   - this AM on CPAP ABG revealed metabolic acidosis without respiratory
   compensation
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - Transfuse prn if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR rise or bleeding continues, goal INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.

   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  NGT
   found to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per
   GI. Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had
   melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.  Off lactulose had
   roughly 230cc of stool yesterday.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - INR nearly normal, no need for FFP, vitamin K
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - on tube feeds, tolerating advanced diet

   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-31**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   - followed by Vsurg
  wound VAC

   # IDDM
 insulin gtt, [**Last Name (un) **]-stim is negative for adrenal insufficiency.
   NPH [**Hospital1 **] was started yesterday to try to transition patient to SQ

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous inferior STEMI. She presented with acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to LMCA and LAD. She has multiple comorbidities including renal failure, respiratory distress, hepatic dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia. She also has an ileus and compartment syndrome in her left lower extremity. The patient's current condition is complicated by a fever, positive sputum cultures for Klebsiella and yeast, and a suspected wound infection. She is currently on various medications including insulin, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and anticoagulants. The patient is still in critical condition and requires ongoing management and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and positive sputum cultures indicate a possible infection. The presence of multiple potential sources for infection (tracheal secretions, leg wound, Foley catheter) increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Wound infection: The patient's leg wound is at high risk for infection due to the open nature of the wound and the presence of foreign material. This could lead to localized infection or systemic infection if the infection spreads.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Weaning"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been in the ICU for several weeks, experiencing multiple complications including wound infection, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and rhabdomyolysis. She also has atrial fibrillation and is being managed with various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound infection: The patient has elevated white blood cell count, fevers, and positive cultures for Klebsiella and yeast in the sputum, suggesting a possible wound infection. This requires prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics.

2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, as indicated by the elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels. She is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) but may require hemodialysis (HD) in the future.

3. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating hepatic dysfunction. This could be due to shock liver or rhabdomyolysis. Monitoring liver function and appropriate management is necessary.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, likely due to dilutional effects from large volume IV repletion and ongoing blood loss. Close monitoring"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Events: Temp to 101.6
   Physical Examination
   Awake and alert. Does not appear in distress. Left leg fasciotomy site
   not fluctuant or draining and mildly tender.  No signs of deep
   infection.
   Medical Decision Making
   Major concerns are persistent fever and hypotension requiring
   pressors.  There is not clear evidence of sepsis and she does not
   appear toxic.  Suspect some part of picture is possibly due to
   decreased intravascular volume given insensible losses over 25 days in
   hospital and increased GI losses.  Also agree may have increased third
   spacing that may respond to albumin. For now will increase [**Year (4 digits) **]
   replacement and review with infectious disease consult for further
   recommendations.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous myocardial infarction (MI). She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient has been in the ICU for 25 days with multiple comorbidities and complications.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/41 mmHg to 126/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.5, elevated creatinine levels, hyperkalemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Blood cultures have grown Klebsiella and yeast in the sputum, indicating a possible infection. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by muddy brown casts and anuria.

The patient has experienced several complications, including rhabdomyolysis, hepatic dysfunction, ileus, compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity, and thrombocytopenia. She has received multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate.

The patient's current medications include insulin, fentanyl,"

   # Neuro: Some decrease in cooperativity today compared to prior.
   - waking up overnight with less fentanyl
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - restart lactulose as bowel movement frequency has decreased
   - hold rifaximin
   - failed Passy-Muir trial, will retry later in hospitalization
   .
   # ID:  WBC elevated with elevated fevers and likely wound infection.
   Patient with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral
   skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.

   - consider a-line for repeat ABG and HD(?).
   - rec ID reconsult. - consider CT of abd later.
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   - give 500 ml bolus to assess effect on blood pressure
   - per Renal recs, stopped CVVH.  Pt will likely need HD at this point
   in time.  No acute need for dialysis at this time.
   - Hyperkalemia discussed with renal, who asked us not to give
   kayexalate and will remove in HD
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status have hindered the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support and trach mask trials.
   - She does well on trach mask throughout the day and routinely retains
   CO2 towards the end of the evening
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   - this AM on CPAP ABG revealed metabolic acidosis without respiratory
   compensation
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus

   sinus without BB.   Since, she had additional episodes of afib that is
   rate controlled and she converts back to sinus on her own.  While in
   AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)

The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has developed multiple complications.

1. Neurological: The patient's neurologic status has decreased compared to previous days, indicating potential neurological complications or worsening of the initial condition.

2. Infection: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count with fevers, suggesting a possible wound infection. There are multiple potential sources of infection including the tracheal secretions, leg wound, and central venous catheter.

3. Renal: The patient is likely experiencing acute renal failure (ARF), which could be due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. There are muddy brown casts on urine analysis, indicating tubular damage. The patient has hyperkalemia and anuria immediately post-catheterization, and rhabdomyolysis with a high creatine kinase level. The patient is currently dialysis-dependent.

4. Respiratory: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and is on pressure support and tracheal mask trials. She tolerates CO2 retention at the end of the evening, indicating possible respiratory muscle weakness or difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation.

   # Neuro: Some decrease in cooperativity today compared to prior.
   - waking up overnight with less fentanyl
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - restart lactulose as bowel movement frequency has decreased
   - hold rifaximin
   - failed Passy-Muir trial, will retry later in hospitalization
   .
   # ID:  WBC elevated with elevated fevers and likely wound infection.
   Patient with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral
   skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX,

   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   - give 500 ml bolus to assess effect on blood pressure
   - per Renal recs, stopped CVVH.  Pt will likely need HD at this point
   in time.  No acute need for dialysis at this time.
   - Hyperkalemia discussed with renal, who asked us not to give
   kayexalate and will remove in HD

   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support and trach mask trials.
   - She does well on trach mask throughout the day and routinely retains
   CO2 towards the end of the evening
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   - this AM on CPAP ABG revealed metabolic acidosis without respiratory
   compensation
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative

   AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)
   - likely etiology for continued pressor requirement at this time is
   distributive shock

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her condition.

24-hour events include switching to insulin sensitivity syndrome (ISS) for glucose management, discontinuation of NPH insulin, initiation of Lantus insulin at bedtime, and adjustment of IV fluids and antibiotics.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/30-128/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheal mask ventilation. The patient is in sinus tachycardia.

Physical examination reveals general unresponsiveness, limited cardiovascular examination due to mechanical ventilation, tense and mildly distended abdomen, cool extremities with weak and thready pulses, and hypoactive bowel sounds. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, acute kidney injury with muddy brown casts, hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis, and metabolic acidosis.

Assessment and Plan:
- Neurological: Decreased cooperativity, continued sedation holidays, fentanyl patch for pain management, and restart lactulose due to decreased bowel movement frequency.
- Infectious Disease: Elevated WBC count, fevers, and likely wound infection. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotic therapy has been adjusted.
- Renal: Acute kidney injury likely secondary to cardiogenic shock and poor forward flow. Anuria and hyperkalemia were noted, and the patient required dialysis support.
- Respiratory Distress: Non-rebreather mask therapy has been initiated, and pressure support has been continued.
- Hematology/Oncology: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia due to blood loss from open fasciotomy and dilutional effects. Transfusions have been given, and coagulopathy is improving.
- Gastrointestinal: Ileus, melenotic/frankly bloody bowel movements, and hepatic dysfunction. Lactulose has been held, and IV proton pump inhibitor has been initiated.
- Compartment Syndrome: Likely developed due to intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) use. IABP has been removed, and lower extremity fasciotomy was performed.
- Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin regimen has been adjusted.
- Elevated Liver Enzymes: Likely due to shock liver and rhabdomyolysis.
- Acute Inferior STEMI: Patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. Beta-blocker therapy has been withheld until the patient is more hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Wound Infection: Elevated WBC count, fevers, and local signs of infection suggest a possible wound infection. Appropriate cultures have been obtained, and antibiotic therapy has been adjusted.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's renal function has been compromised, as indicated"

   # Neuro: Limited progression [**1-31**] need for opiates.  Patch reduced from
   100mg to 50mg.
   - waking up overnight with less fentanyl
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - doing well off lactulose, rifaximin
   - speech & swallow consult for Passy-Muir trial
   .
   # ID:  WBC elevated with elevated fevers and likely wound infection.
   Patient with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral
   skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX,
   - Glucan (-), Galactomanan- low intermediate, C. Diff (-)
   - Restarting Vanc and adding Zosyn to cover her likely leg infection
   - continue diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for speciation.
   - wbc falling, culture if spikes
   - consider a-line for repeat ABG and HD(?).
   - f/u stool cx, consider MRI for osteo if continued spikes/increase in
   WBC
   - rec ID reconsult.

   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   - give 500 ml bolus to assess effect on blood pressure
   - per Renal recs, stopped CVVH.  Pt will likely need HD at this point
   in time.  Will likely start HD [**11-16**] or [**11-17**]  this week.
   - Hyperkalemia discussed with renal, who asked us not to give

 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off pressors and tolerated -2L
   yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial fibrillation, converted back to
   sinus without BB.   Since, she had additional episodes of afib that is
   rate controlled and she converts back to sinus on her own.  While in
   AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)
   - likely etiology for continued pressor requirement at this time is
   distributive shock

   # Afib/Aflutter: Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] seems to go in and out of Atrial Fibrillation
   on a nightly basis.  On [**11-11**] she was noted to be in flutter briefly at
   a rate of 140.  She broke with carotid massage, and 5mg of IV
   metoprolol.
   - discontinue metoprolol as in the setting of shock her BP will not
   tolerate
   - continue amiodarone load for rhythm control
   - holding AC at this time given bleeding issue
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status have hindered the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support and trach mask trials.
   - She does well on trach mask throughout the day and routinely retains
   CO2 towards the end of the evening
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   - this AM on CPAP ABG revealed metabolic acidosis without respiratory
   compensation

   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery.

The patient has been experiencing multiple complications since admission. Neurologically, she has limited progression and requires opiates for pain management. She is also at risk for developing a wound infection due to her elevated white blood cell count and elevated fevers.

Renally, she has acute renal failure (ARF) likely secondary to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. This has resulted in hyperkalemia and anuria. She has undergone continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) but is now dependent on hemodialysis (HD).

Cardiologically, the patient had an acute inferior STEMI in the distal left anterior descending artery territory. She initially required inotropic support with levophed and later developed a temporary pacemaker for sinus arrest. She also experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation, which were converted back to sinus rhythm.

Respiratorily, the patient had respiratory distress and has been on pressure support and tracheostomy trials. She is currently tolerating CPAP well.

Hematologically, the patient developed early anemia and thrombocytopenia, which were likely due to"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.
- She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock.
- The patient is intubated and on decreased sedation, with limited neurological progression.
- She has multiple potential sources of infection, including a wound infection, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure, and is dialysis-dependent.
- She has respiratory distress and is on pressure support with tracheostomy mask trials.
- There is early anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely due to blood loss from surgery and dilutional effects.
- The patient has an ileus but is tolerating advanced diet now.
- She developed compartment syndrome in the lower extremities and underwent fasciotomy.
- The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, possibly due to rhabdomyolysis and shock liver.
- She experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter, which have been rate-controlled and converted back to sinus rhythm.
- The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but medications are being held until she is more hemodynamically stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Wound infection: The patient has multiple potential sources of"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Limited progression [**1-31**] need for opiates.  Patch reduced from
   100mg to 50mg.
   - waking up overnight with less fentanyl
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - doing well off lactulose, rifaximin
   - speech & swallow consult for Passy-Muir trial
   .
   # ID:  WBC elevated with elevated fevers and likely wound infection.
   Patient with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral
   skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX,
   - Glucan (-), Galactomanan- low intermediate, C. Diff (-)
   - Restarting Vanc and adding Zosyn to cover her likely leg infection
   - continue diflucan for yeast in sputum waiting for speciation.
   - wbc falling, culture if spikes
   - consider a-line for repeat ABG and HD(?).
   - f/u stool cx, consider MRI for osteo if continued spikes/increase in
   WBC
   - rec ID reconsult.
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   - give 500 ml bolus to assess effect on blood pressure
   - per Renal recs, stopped CVVH.  Pt will likely need HD at this point
   in time.  Will likely start HD [**11-16**] or [**11-17**]  this week.
   - Hyperkalemia discussed with renal, who asked us not to give
   kayexalate and will remove in HD
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for [**Month/Year (2) **] resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last
   TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off pressors and tolerated -2L
   yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial fibrillation, converted back to
   sinus without BB.   Since, she had additional episodes of afib that is
   rate controlled and she converts back to sinus on her own.  While in
   AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)
   - likely etiology for continued pressor requirement at this time is
   distributive shock
   .
   # Afib/Aflutter: Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] seems to go in and out of Atrial Fibrillation
   on a nightly basis.  On [**11-11**] she was noted to be in flutter briefly at
   a rate of 140.  She broke with carotid massage, and 5mg of IV
   metoprolol.
   - discontinue metoprolol as in the setting of shock her BP will not
   tolerate
   - continue amiodarone load for rhythm control
   - holding AC at this time given bleeding issue
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status have hindered the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support and trach mask trials.
   - She does well on trach mask throughout the day and routinely retains
   CO2 towards the end of the evening
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   - this AM on CPAP ABG revealed metabolic acidosis without respiratory
   compensation
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - Transfuse prn if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfuse FFP if INR rise or bleeding continues, goal INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - renal rec

   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  NGT
   found to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per
   GI. Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had
   melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.  Off lactulose had
   roughly 230cc of stool yesterday.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - INR nearly normal, no need for FFP, vitamin K
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - on tube feeds, tolerating advanced diet
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-31**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   - followed by Vsurg
  wound VAC
 input appreciated
   - At this time, no set surgery date for LLE.
   - serial pulses, CK (lowest)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver and rhabdo.
   -  Now WNL
   .
   # IDDM
 insulin gtt, [**Last Name (un) **]-stim is negative for adrenal insufficiency.
   NPH [**Hospital1 **] was started yesterday to try to transition patient to SQ
   insulin.  In setting of labile insulin requirement, will consult
   [**Last Name (un) 294**].
   .
   # HTN: Hold home hypertensive regimen until more HD stable.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Afebrile and hemodynamics improved. No clear source of infection except
   now possible pulmonary infiltrate. Continue course of antibiotics.
   Renal function not recovering. Plan for hemodialysis.
   Respiratory and cardiac status remain stable on current therapy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She has multiple comorbidities including anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, respiratory distress, and hepatic dysfunction. The patient underwent several interventions including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement, fasciotomy, and venous-assisted closure (VAC) of a wound. She also received various medications and treatments for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and fevers, suggesting a possible infection. She has multiple potential sources for infection, including a tracheostomy, central venous catheters, and a wound that has been opened and treated with VAC.

2. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding concerns, including the development of compartment syndrome due to bleeding in the lower extremity. Her coagulation profile is abnormal, with prolonged clotting times and low platelet count.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). She is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to her unstable hemodynamics.

4. Respiratory Distress: The patient continues to experience respiratory distress, necessitating prolonged"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She has been in the ICU for several days and has developed multiple complications including wound infection, renal failure, respiratory distress, anemia, thrombocytopenia, ileus, compartment syndrome, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound infection: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, fevers, and likely wound infection due to multiple nidi including a triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral skin breakdown, tracheal secretions, and leg wound.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure likely secondary to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. She also has muddy brown casts on urine analysis, hyperkalemia, and anuria immediately post cath. She requires dialysis.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. She is tolerating pressure support but fatigues easily and requires sedation holidays.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has early anemia and thrombocytopenia due to blood loss from an open fasciotomy and dilution from large volume IV repletion. She has received transfusions of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets.

- Blood pressure: 113/45 mmHg (with a normal range of 58-121/30-70 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 15-23 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on tracheal mask

The patient's lab results show the following abnormalities:
- White blood cell count: 13.5 K/uL (with a normal range of 4-11 K/uL)
- Hematocrit: 21.6% (with a normal range of 36-46%)
- Platelet count: 62 K/uL (with a normal range of 150-450 K/uL)

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple conditions, including acute respiratory distress, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, ileus, compartment syndrome, and atrial fibrillation. She has undergone various interventions such as tracheostomy, central venous catheter placement, dialysis catheter placement, fasciotomy, and wound vacuum-assisted closure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, and there is a concern for wound infection due to the presence of an open leg wound and other potential sources of infection.
2. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, and she has been on anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Very Sedated, arousable, looks tired today.
   - VBG PCO2 is 47, pH is 7.19.  No compensation, ? if tired with 24
   hours of trach mask
   - waking up overnight with less fentanyl
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - restart lactulose as bowel movement frequency has decreased
   - hold rifaximin
   - failed Passy-Muir trial, will retry later in hospitalization
   .
   # ID:  WBC elevated with elevated fevers and likely wound infection.
   Patient with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral
   skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.  Today Afebrile without leukocytosis.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX,
   - Glucan (-), Galactomanan- low intermediate, C. Diff (-)
   - continue Vanc and adding Zosyn, d/c diflucan [**1-31**] interaction with
   plavix and
   - wbc falling, culture if spikes
   - consider a-line for repeat ABG and HD(?).
   - rec ID reconsult. - consider CT of abd later.
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   - give 500 ml bolus to assess effect on blood pressure
   - per Renal recs, stopped CVVH.  Pt will likely need HD at this point
   in time.  No acute need for dialysis at this time.
   - Starting HD [**11-18**], will treat metabolic acidosis via HD
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status have hindered the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support and trach mask trials.
   - She tolerated 24 hours of trach mask, however tired out this am, not
   compensating, asked respiratory to put on CPAP
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - Transfuse prn if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct > 25.
   - will transfuse 2u pRBC for Hct 21.6 this AM
   - Transfuse FFP if INR rise or bleeding continues, goal INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.
   - renal rec
 on epo
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  NGT
   found to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per
   GI. Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had
   melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.  Off lactulose had
   roughly 230cc of stool yesterday.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - INR nearly normal, no need for FFP, vitamin K
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - restart lactulose
   - on tube feeds, tolerating advanced diet
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-31**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   - followed by Vsurg
  wound VAC
 input appreciated. Will be barrier
   to d/c, will pin down plan as per vascular.
   - At this time, no set surgery date for LLE.
   - serial pulses, CK (lowest)
   .
   # IDDM
 insulin gtt, [**Last Name (un) **]-stim is negative for adrenal insufficiency.
   - d/c
d NPH [**Hospital1 **] and transitioned to lantus and ISS to uptitrate.
   - consult regarding TSH
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver and rhabdo.
   -  Now WNL
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for [**Hospital1 **] resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last
   TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off pressors and tolerated -2L
   yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial fibrillation, converted back to
   sinus without BB.   Since, she had additional episodes of afib that is
   rate controlled and she converts back to sinus on her own.  While in
   AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)
   - likely etiology for continued pressor requirement at this time is
   distributive shock
   .
   # Afib/Aflutter: Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] seems to go in and out of Atrial Fibrillation
   on a nightly basis.  On [**11-11**] she was noted to be in flutter briefly at
   a rate of 140.  She broke with carotid massage, and 5mg of IV
   metoprolol.
   - discontinue metoprolol as in the setting of shock her BP will not
   tolerate
   - continue amiodarone load for rhythm control
   - holding AC at this time given bleeding issue
   .
   # HTN: Hold home hypertensive regimen until more HD stable.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia
 Holding statin in setting of rhabdomyolysis /
   transaminitis pending CPK<1000.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Physical Examination
   Less arousable; Wound remains clean appearing; Minimal drainage.
   Medical Decision Making
   Worsening acidemia, declining mentation probably secondary to renal
   failure.
   Decreased Hct without obvious bleeding source/
   Dialysis today
   Transfuse 2 units PRBCs.
   Continue antibiotics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient was initially in cardiogenic shock but has improved since then. She has been on mechanical ventilation and has developed multiple complications including renal failure, sepsis, and respiratory distress syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient initially presented with cardiogenic shock, which can be a life-threatening condition characterized by poor cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has developed AKI, likely secondary to hypoperfusion and subsequent acute tubular necrosis. This is indicated by an elevated serum creatinine level and decreased urine output.

3. Sepsis: The patient has had elevated white blood cell count and fevers, suggesting an infectious process. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and further investigations are ongoing to identify the source of infection.

4. Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS): The patient has required prolonged mechanical ventilation and has developed RDS, characterized by poor oxygenation and ventilation. This may be due to acute lung injury or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

5. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient has elevated liver enzymes"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient had multiple complications including respiratory distress, renal failure, coagulopathy, hepatic dysfunction, and compartment syndrome. She was treated with various interventions such as tracheostomy, hemodialysis, fasciotomy, and wound vacuum therapy. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs and organ function. She remains in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound infection: The patient has an open leg wound with a wound vacuum therapy in place. There is a possibility of wound infection due to the presence of elevated white blood cell count and fevers.
2. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and is showing signs of hepatic dysfunction. This could be attributed to rhabdomyolysis, poor perfusion, or direct liver injury.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypoperfusion and rhabdomyolysis. She is currently on hemodialysis and will require ongoing renal support.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a bleeding diathesis with low platelet count and prolonged clotting"

   # Neuro: Very Sedated, arousable, looks tired today.
   - VBG PCO2 is 47, pH is 7.19.  No compensation, ? if tired with 24
   hours of trach mask
   - waking up overnight with less fentanyl
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - restart lactulose as bowel movement frequency has decreased
   - hold rifaximin
   - failed Passy-Muir trial, will retry later in hospitalization
   .
   # ID:  WBC elevated with elevated fevers and likely wound infection.
   Patient with multiple nidi, including triple lumen, CVVH line, sacral
   skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being open and foley
   catheter.  Today Afebrile without leukocytosis.
   - f/u fungal cultures, bcx, sputum cx, UCX,
   - Glucan (-), Galactomanan- low intermediate, C. Diff (-)
   - continue Vanc and adding Zosyn, d/c diflucan [**1-31**] interaction with
   plavix and
   - wbc falling, culture if spikes
   - consider a-line for repeat ABG and HD(?).
   - rec ID reconsult. - consider CT of abd later.
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   - give 500 ml bolus to assess effect on blood pressure
   - per Renal recs, stopped CVVH.  Pt will likely need HD at this point
   in time.  No acute need for dialysis at this time.
   - Starting HD [**11-18**], will treat metabolic acidosis via HD
   .
   # respiratory distress:  MS [**First Name (Titles) 43**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status have hindered the process
   of weaning.  Tolerating increasing courses of pressure support, however
   tired out and required A/C.  Continue sedation holidays, pressure
   support and trach mask trials.
   - She tolerated 24 hours of trach mask, however tired out this am, not
   compensating, asked respiratory to put on CPAP
   - monitor [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy is likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - Transfuse prn if Hct continues to drop with goal Hct > 25.
   - will transfuse 2u pRBC for Hct 21.6 this AM
   - Transfuse FFP if INR rise or bleeding continues, goal INR < 1.5
   - appreciate and follow - heme-onc regarding the
   anemia/thrombocytopenia.

   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  NGT
   found to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per
   GI. Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had
   melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.  Off lactulose had
   roughly 230cc of stool yesterday.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - INR nearly normal, no need for FFP, vitamin K
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - restart lactulose
   - on tube feeds, tolerating advanced diet
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-31**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   - followed by Vsurg
  wound VAC
 input appreciated. Will be barrier
   to d/c, will pin down plan as per vascular.
   - At this time, no set surgery date for LLE.
   - serial pulses, CK (lowest)

   # IDDM
 insulin gtt, [**Last Name (un) **]-stim is negative for adrenal insufficiency.
   - d/c
d NPH [**Hospital1 **] and transitioned to lantus and ISS to uptitrate.
   - consult regarding TSH
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver and rhabdo.
   -  Now WNL
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for [**Hospital1 **] resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last

 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Off pressors and tolerated -2L
   yesterday.  s/p an episode of atrial fibrillation, converted back to
   sinus without BB.   Since, she had additional episodes of afib that is
   rate controlled and she converts back to sinus on her own.  While in
   AFib, she drops her pressure.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   - continue pressure support on neo (phenylephrine)
   - likely etiology for continued pressor requirement at this time is
   distributive shock
   .
   # Afib/Aflutter: Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] seems to go in and out of Atrial Fibrillation
   on a nightly basis.  On [**11-11**] she was noted to be in flutter briefly at
   a rate of 140.  She broke with carotid massage, and 5mg of IV
   metoprolol.
   - discontinue metoprolol as in the setting of shock her BP will not
   tolerate
   - continue amiodarone load for rhythm control
   - holding AC at this time given bleeding issue

She has multiple complications including respiratory distress, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, anemia, thrombocytopenia, ileus, compartment syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 133/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on the tracheostomy tube. She is sedated but arousable, looking tired today.

The patient's renal function is compromised, indicated by muddy brown casts on urine analysis, hyperkalemia, and anuria. She is dialysis-dependent and has received a blood transfusion. Her platelet count is below 100 but increasing after receiving platelet transfusion.

Her respiratory status is complicated by MS [First Name (Titles) 43] status, which has hindered the process of weaning off mechanical ventilation.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She has been in the ICU for several days, experiencing multiple medical complications.

Neurological assessment shows that the patient is very sedated and arousable, with possible uremia contributing to this state. The patient also has a VBG indicating a PCO2 of 47 and pH of 7.19, suggesting respiratory acidosis without compensation.

Infection is suspected as the patient has elevated fevers and leukocytosis, along with multiple potential sources of infection including a triple lumen catheter, CVVH line, sacral skin breakdown, tracheal secretions, leg wound, and Foley catheter. Fungal cultures, blood cultures, sputum culture, and urinalysis are pending.

Renal function is impaired with acute renal failure likely starting before presentation. The patient has muddy brown casts on urine analysis and hyperkalemia up to 6.8. Rhabdomyolysis with a high level of creatine kinase (CK) has occurred, but CK levels are now downtrending. The patient was initially on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) but is now dependent on hemodialysis (HD).

Respiratory distress is present, and the patient is tolerating the tracheostomy mask for increasing amounts of time. The patient continues to require"

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the LMCA and LAD. She remains in the ICU for ongoing management.

Neurological assessment reveals the patient to be very sedated, arousable, and tired. Uremia is likely playing a role in her sedation. Her VBG shows a PCO2 of 47 and pH of 7.19, indicating respiratory acidosis without compensation. She is on fentanyl for pain management and lactulose for constipation. The passy-muir trial was unsuccessful, and she will be retried later in the hospitalization.

Infectious disease assessment indicates an elevated WBC count with elevated fevers and a likely wound infection. The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including triple-lumen catheter, CVVH line, sacral skin breakdown, tracheal secretions, and leg wound. Fungal cultures, blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine cultures have been obtained. Glucan and Galactomanan tests are negative, and C. Diff is negative.

   .
   # Neuro: Lethargic, arousable, looks tired today.  Uremia may
   contribute.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.
   - failed Passy-Muir trial, will retry later in hospitalization
   .
   # ID:  WBC has now completely resolved, fevers are low grade at best
   off tylenol. Early fevers [**1-31**] multiple nidi, including triple lumen,
   CVVH line, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.  Currently residual low grade fevers likely
   [**1-31**] chronic inflammation in leg.
   - All cx data negative
   - continue Vanc and  Zosyn, and plan to define course after closure
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   - Started HD [**11-19**] has now tolerated off pressors x 2
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Now tolerating trach mask for increasing
   amounts of time, continue trach mask training
   - trach mask as tolerated
   - monitor fluid status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative

   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - transfused 1u yesterday and 1 unit the day before with appropriate
   Hct increase
   - continue to monitor Hct

   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  NGT
   found to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per
   GI. Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had
   melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and required hemodialysis due to acute renal failure. The patient underwent femoral-popliteal bypass surgery and had complications including rhabdomyolysis, compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity, ileus, and hepatic dysfunction. She has been on mechanical ventilation and has had multiple line placements. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, BUN, potassium, and liver enzymes. She also has thrombocytopenia and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation and weaning difficulties due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other respiratory complications.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Infection such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) due to invasive procedures and prolonged hospital stay.
4. Renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury (AKI) due to pre-existing renal disease, sepsis, or nephrotoxic medications.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy or worsening liver function due to hepatic dysfunction and medication-induced hepatotoxicity.
6. Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy and plate"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous acute inferior STEMI, currently admitted to the ICU for cardiogenic shock. The patient's condition is summarized as follows:

- Neurological: The patient is very sedated, arousable, and appears tired. Uremia may be contributing to the sedation.
- Infectious Disease (ID): The patient has an elevated white blood cell count with fevers and a suspected wound infection. Multiple potential infection sites include a triple lumen catheter, CVVH line, sacral skin breakdown, tracheal secretions, leg wound, and Foley catheter. Recent cultures and sensitivities have been obtained, and antibiotic therapy has been adjusted accordingly.
- Renal: Acute renal failure (ARF) is likely present, possibly due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. The patient now exhibits muddy brown casts on urine analysis, hyperkalemia, and anuria post catheterization. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) has been initiated due to the patient's dependence on dialysis.
- Respiratory: The patient is now tolerating a tracheostomy mask for increasing amounts of time. Continued trials with the tracheostomy mask and close monitoring of fluid status and respiratory rate are recommended.
- Hematology: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia"

   # Neuro: Lethargic, arousable, looks tired today.  Uremia may
   contribute.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.
   - failed Passy-Muir trial, will retry later in hospitalization
   .
   # ID:  WBC has now completely resolved, fevers are low grade at best
   off tylenol. Early fevers [**1-31**] multiple nidi, including triple lumen,
   CVVH line, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.  Currently residual low grade fevers likely
   [**1-31**] chronic inflammation in leg.
   - All cx data negative

   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Neurological: The patient's lethargy and tiredness could be due to uremia, hepatic encephalopathy, or toxic metabolic encephalopathy. The ongoing assessment of the patient's mental status and neurological function is crucial.

2. Infectious Disease: The patient had multiple sites of infection including a leg wound, Foley catheter, CVVH line, tracheal secretions, and triple lumen line. The low-grade fevers suggest ongoing inflammation, and the negative cultures indicate no bacterial growth. However, the patient remains on Vanc and Zosyn, suggesting a concern for ongoing infection.

3. Renal: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) likely caused by poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. The presence of muddy brown casts in the urine analysis confirms acute tubular necrosis. The patient's hyperkalemia and anuria immediately post-catheterization suggest significant renal impairment. The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to the lack of response to intermittent hemodialysis (HD).

4. Respiratory: The patient experienced respiratory distress and required tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. The patient is now tolerating the tracheostomy mask for increasing amounts of time, indicating improvement in respiratory status. However, close monitoring of fluid status and respiratory rate is essential.

   # Neuro: Lethargic, arousable, looks tired today.  Uremia may
   contribute.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.
- She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock.
- The patient has been through multiple medical complications, including renal failure, respiratory distress, hepatic dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia.
- She underwent fasciotomy and wound VAC placement for compartment syndrome in her lower extremities.
- The patient's condition has improved over time, with resolution of hypernatremia, resolution of fever, and improvement in cardiac output.
- She is currently off pressors and tolerating tracheostomy mask for increasing amounts of time.
- The patient's renal function is still impaired, requiring dialysis support.
- Her coagulopathy has improved with factor repletion.
- The patient is tolerating advanced diet and has regular bowel movements.
- She is on tube feeds and has been weaned off lactulose.
- The patient's elevated liver enzymes and alkaline phosphatase are being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: The patient had a myocardial infarction affecting the inferior wall of the heart. This could lead to complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias if not managed appropriately.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient initially experienced poor cardiac output, indicating cardiogenic shock. This condition can be life-threatening"

   .
   # Neuro: Improved this AM on HD.  Consistent with uremia as source for
   prior neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.
   - failed Passy-Muir trial, will retry later in hospitalization
   .
   # ID:  WBC has now completely resolved, fevers are low grade at best
   off tylenol. Early fevers [**1-31**] multiple nidi, including triple lumen,
   CVVH line, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.  Currently residual low grade fevers likely
   [**1-31**] chronic inflammation in leg.
   - All cx data negative
   - continue Vanc and  Zosyn, and plan to define course after closure
   today per ID recs.
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   -          Started HD [**11-19**] has now tolerated off pressors x 2
   -          Continue HD, establish schedule per Renal recs.
   -          Obtain tunneled dialysis catheter line (IR-guided) per Renal
   recs.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Now tolerating trach mask for increasing
   amounts of time, continue trach mask training
   - trach mask as tolerated
 tolerating since [**11-19**] at 11AM
   - monitor fluid status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy was likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - transfused 2u last weekende with appropriate Hct increase
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - renal rec
 on epo, with Iron/Vit C
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  NGT
   found to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per
   GI. Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had
   melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - pulled out NGT, plan for PEG in OR today
   .
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-31**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   - per Vsurg: to OR for closure at 11AM today
   - serial pulses
   .
   # IDDM
 insulin gtt, [**Last Name (un) **]-stim is negative for adrenal insufficiency.
   - d/c
d NPH [**Hospital1 **] and transitioned to lantus and ISS to uptitrate.
   - appreciate continued follow up by [**Last Name (un) 294**]
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT elevation
 Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] has had a rising alkaline
   phosphatase with a positive GGT and a relatively low AST/ALT.
     Patient is classic picture of choledocolithiasis, it is very
   difficult to assess pain in her RUQ but appears unlikely, so
   cholecystitis is unikely.
   - RUQ u/s after interventions today
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver and rhabdo.
   -          Now WNL
   -          Following alk phos, ggt pending
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for fluid resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last

 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Doing well off pressors.  Converted to
   sinus with amiodarone and  BB.   Currently in and out of sinus tach,
   responsive to beta-blockers.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home hypertensive regimen until more HD stable.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous inferior STEMI. She presented with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock, for which she underwent balloon myocardial sympatholysis (BMS) to the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's current condition includes:
1. Neurological: The patient has improved neurologic status on hemodialysis (HD), suggesting uremia as a source of prior neurologic depression. Metabolic encephalopathy is expected to improve with leg closure and increased HD clearance.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient's white blood cell count has resolved, and fevers are low-grade. Previous sites of infection included triple lumen catheter, CVVH line, sacral skin breakdown, tracheal secretions, and leg wound. All cultures have been negative.
3. Renal: The patient likely had acute renal failure (ARF) before presentation, possibly due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. She now shows muddy brown casts on urine analysis, hyperkalemia, and anuria post catheterization. Rhabdomyolysis with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels has occurred but is now downtrending. The patient is dependent on dialysis, with two sessions of hemodialysis (HD) tolerated off pressors. A tunneled dialysis catheter line"

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery and the left anterior descending artery. The patient was initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output but has since improved. 

The patient's medical conditions include acute renal failure likely secondary to cardiogenic shock, respiratory distress requiring tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation, anemia and thrombocytopenia likely due to blood loss from an open fasciotomy, ileus with improvement after discontinuation of lactulose, and compartment syndrome in the lower extremities requiring fasciotomy. 

The patient is also diagnosed with hypernatremia, elevated liver enzymes, and cholestatic liver function tests suggestive of choledocholithiasis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/39 mmHg (94/37 mmHg), respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

   # Neuro: Improved this AM on HD.  Consistent with uremia as source for
   prior neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.

   # ID:  WBC has now completely resolved, fevers are low grade at best
   off tylenol. Early fevers [**1-31**] multiple nidi, including triple lumen,
   CVVH line, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.  Currently residual low grade fevers likely
   [**1-31**] chronic inflammation in leg.

   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria

   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   -          Started HD [**11-19**] has now tolerated off pressors x 2

   # Respiratory distress:  Now tolerating trach mask for increasing

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). 

The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications since admission. Neurologically, she has shown improvement with hemodialysis (HD), suggesting uremia as the source for prior neurologic depression. She is currently off lactulose and rifaximin, and hepatic encephalopathy is not contributing to her condition. 

Infectiously, the patient initially had fevers and leukocytosis, which have now resolved. All cultures have been negative, and she is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The source of infection is likely chronic inflammation in her leg wound. 

Renally, the patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) with muddy brown casts, hyperkalemia, and anuria. She required dialysis and is now dialysis-dependent. 

Respiratorily, the patient initially had respiratory distress but is now tolerating a tracheostomy mask for increasing amounts of time.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently in the ICU and has experienced several medical events. The patient underwent an attempted percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedure, but it failed. Closure of the access site also failed, and debridement was attempted. The patient was then returned to the floor sedated and on pressors.

The patient has no known drug allergies and has received antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is currently receiving phenylephrine infusion and pantoprazole (Protonix).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 150/127 mmHg to 154/127 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen through a tracheostomy tube.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,774 mL including 279 mL of intravenous fluids, and an output of 2,918 mL including 586 mL of blood products. The patient's weight has decreased from 92 kg at admission to 86.9 kg currently.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a tidal volume of 515 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's respiratory system compliance is within normal range (RSBI: 84), and the arterial blood gas (ABG) values are pending.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 303 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) at 9.9 g/dL, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 105 mg/dL, elevated creatinine (Cr) at 4.3, decreased platelet count (Plt) at 191 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.4 mmol/L.

The patient's other lab values include elevated D-dimer at 2458 ng/mL, decreased albumin at 2.1 g/dL, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient has a history of recent abdominal surgery and complications, including the failed PEG procedure. The patient's current condition indicates the need for further evaluation and management in the ICU. Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and infection related to the central lines or surgical site.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further clinical assessment and evaluation are necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

   # Neuro: Improved this AM on HD.  Consistent with uremia as source for
   prior neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.
   - failed Passy-Muir trial, will retry later in hospitalization
   .
   # ID:  WBC has now completely resolved, fevers are low grade at best
   off tylenol. Early fevers [**1-31**] multiple nidi, including triple lumen,
   CVVH line, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.  Currently residual low grade fevers likely
   [**1-31**] chronic inflammation in leg.
   - Tissue debridement cultures showed yeast -?[**Female First Name (un) 444**], most likely
   colonization given recent full course of diflucan, will discuss
   With ID
   - continue Vanc and  Zosyn, and plan to define course after closure
   today per ID recs.
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   -          Started HD [**11-19**] has now tolerated off pressors x 2
   -          Tunneled dialysis catheter today
   -          Continue HD, establish schedule per Renal recs.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Placed on vent yesterday with sedation for
   procedure.  Will wean as tolerated had been tolerating trach mask for
   increasing amounts of time, continue trach mask training
   - pressure support for now, trach mask as she wakes up
   - trach mask as tolerated
 tolerating since [**11-19**] at 11AM
   - monitor fluid status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy was likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - transfused 2u last weekende with appropriate Hct increase
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - renal rec

   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  Patient
   had pulled NGT on her own, OR PEG failed, plan for laporoscopic today.
   Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had melenotic/frankly
   bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.
   - Plan for Laproscopic PEG today
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-31**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   - per Vsurg: went to OR, debrided way too big to close, plastics
   planning to help on wednesday
   - serial pulses

   - d/c
d NPH [**Hospital1 **] and transitioned to lantus and ISS to uptitrate.
   - appreciate continued follow up by [**Last Name (un) 294**]
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT elevation
 Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] has had a rising alkaline
   phosphatase with a positive GGT and a relatively low AST/ALT.
     RUQ U/s is not suspicious for gallstone or acalculous cholecystitis.
   Alk Phos had fallen yesterday,  still pending today, may represent
   passage of an old stone.
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver and rhabdo.
   -          Now WNL
   -          Following alk phos,
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for fluid resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last
   TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Doing well off pressors.  Converted to
   sinus with amiodarone and  BB.   Currently in and out of sinus tach,
   responsive to beta-blockers.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home hypertensive regimen until more HD stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous acute inferior STEMI, presenting with cardiogenic shock. She has undergone multiple procedures including failed PEG placement, closure, and debridement, as well as laparoscopic G-tube planned for Tuesday. The patient is currently sedated on pressors and has a history of renal failure, respiratory distress, anemia, thrombocytopenia, ileus, compartment syndrome, and hepatic dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has had multiple lines and catheters, which increase the risk of infection. The presence of low-grade fevers and yeast colonization suggests a possible infection.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic dysfunction and previous episodes of neurologic depression, which may indicate hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and muddy brown casts on urine analysis. This may require ongoing dialysis support.
4. Respiratory Distress: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress, and weaning may be challenging given her underlying conditions.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can lead to bleeding complications.
6. Compartment Syndrome: The patient has developed compartment syndrome in her left lower extremity, requiring"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Improved this AM on HD.  Consistent with uremia as source for
   prior neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.
   - failed Passy-Muir trial, will retry later in hospitalization
   .
   # ID:  WBC has now completely resolved, fevers are low grade at best
   off tylenol. Early fevers [**1-31**] multiple nidi, including triple lumen,
   CVVH line, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.  Currently residual low grade fevers likely
   [**1-31**] chronic inflammation in leg.
   - Tissue debridement cultures showed yeast -?[**Female First Name (un) 444**], most likely
   colonization given recent full course of diflucan, will discuss
   With ID
   - continue Vanc and  Zosyn, and plan to define course after closure
   today per ID recs.
   - starting mica 100 qd
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   - Started HD [**11-19**] has now tolerated off pressors x 2
   - Tunneled dialysis catheter today
   - Continue HD, establish schedule per Renal recs.
   - IR guided tunnel cath and doboff tube.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Placed on vent yesterday with sedation for
   procedure.  Will wean as tolerated had been tolerating trach mask for
   increasing amounts of time, continue trach mask training
   - pressure support for now, trach mask as she wakes up
   - trach mask as tolerated
 tolerating since [**11-19**] at 11AM
   - monitor fluid status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy was likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - transfused 2u last weekende with appropriate Hct increase
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - renal rec
 on epo, with Iron/Vit C
   .
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  Patient
   had pulled NGT on her own, OR PEG failed, plan for laporoscopic today.
   Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had melenotic/frankly
   bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - IR guided doboff.
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-31**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   - per Vsurg: went to OR, debrided way too big to close, plastics
   planning to help on wednesday
   - serial pulses
   .
   # IDDM
 insulin gtt, [**Last Name (un) **]-stim is negative for adrenal insufficiency.
   - d/c
d NPH [**Hospital1 **] and transitioned to lantus and ISS to uptitrate.
   - appreciate continued follow up by [**Last Name (un) 294**]
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT elevation
 Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] has had a rising alkaline
   phosphatase with a positive GGT and a relatively low AST/ALT.
     RUQ U/s is not suspicious for gallstone or acalculous cholecystitis.
   Alk Phos had fallen yesterday,  still pending today, may represent
   passage of an old stone.
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver and rhabdo.
   -          Now WNL
   -          Following alk phos,
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for fluid resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last
   TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Doing well off pressors.  Converted to
   sinus with amiodarone and  BB.   Currently in and out of sinus tach,
   responsive to beta-blockers.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, no statin due to increased CPK levels.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home hypertensive regimen until more HD stable.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia
 Holding statin in setting of rhabdomyolysis /
   transaminitis/acute illness.
   .
   # FEN: Pt pulled NG, restart feeds once PEG is placed.
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   - DVT ppx if HCT stable
 SQ heparin
   - pain management IV fentanyl
   - bowel regimen (senna + colace), lactulose

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient has experienced multiple complications including renal failure, respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation, gastrointestinal ileus, compartment syndrome in the lower left extremity, hepatic dysfunction, and cholestatic liver function test elevation. She has also had a failed percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and an attempted laparoscopic gastrostomy tube placement planned for Tuesday. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), phenylephrine, pantoprazole (Protonix), and insulin gtt.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient initially presented with cardiogenic shock due to an acute inferior STEMI. It is crucial to closely monitor her hemodynamic status and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and muddy brown casts on urine analysis. She requires ongoing renal support, and a tunneled dialysis catheter has been placed. Close monitoring of electrolyte imbalances and fluid balance is necessary.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient required mechanical ventilation"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Reviewed events over past 24 hours.
   Medical Decision Making
   Treatment goals:
   1. Continue dialysis. Tunnel catheter today.
   2. Await vascular and plastics input re leg wound closure
   3. Yeast wound culture. Apreciate ID input. Clinical course does not
   appear consistent with systemic infection.
   4. Continue current cardiac medications.  Goal approximately even
   volume status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, presenting with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to the need for mechanical ventilation and initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

The patient has experienced multiple complications, including failed PEG placement, wound debridement failure, and development of hepatic encephalopathy. She also developed rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury (AKI), requiring dialysis. There were episodes of hypotension and shock, necessitating the use of vasopressors. The patient had an ileus and required nasogastric tube placement, but later pulled it out. She was started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and had a central line infection, which was treated with antibiotics. The patient developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), for which she was placed on anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), liver enzymes, and troponin levels. Her electrolytes are imbalanced, with hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia. The patient has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy, which required blood product transfusions. Her coagulation profile improved with factor repletion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound infection: The patient had a yeast infection in the wound, which was identified through tissue debridement cultures. This indicates a risk of developing a wound infection, especially considering the previous failed attempts at closure.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient exhibited signs of hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms. Close monitoring of her hepatic function and electrolyte balance is necessary.
3. AKI: The patient developed AKI, likely due to rhabdomyolysis and cardiogenic shock. This condition requires ongoing dialysis management and careful fluid balance.
4. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock, she is at risk for further cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or recurrent myocardial ischemia.
5. Thrombotic events: The patient has experienced DVT and PE, indicating a predisposition to thrombotic events. Anticoagulation therapy should be continued to prevent further thrombosis.
6. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient had an ileus and required bowel rest. There is a risk of developing further gastrointestinal complications, such as Clostridium difficile infection or stress ulcers."

   .
   # Neuro: Improved this AM on HD.  Consistent with uremia as source for
   prior neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.
   - failed Passy-Muir trial, will retry later in hospitalization
   .
   # ID:  WBC has now completely resolved, fevers are low grade at best
   off tylenol. Early fevers [**1-31**] multiple nidi, including triple lumen,
   CVVH line, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.  Currently residual low grade fevers likely
   [**1-31**] chronic inflammation in leg.
   - All cx data negative
   - continue Vanc and  Zosyn, and plan to define course after closure
   today per ID recs.
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   -          Started HD [**11-19**] has now tolerated off pressors x 2
   -          Continue HD, establish schedule per Renal recs.
   -          Obtain tunneled dialysis catheter line (IR-guided) per Renal
   recs.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Now tolerating trach mask for increasing
   amounts of time, continue trach mask training
   - trach mask as tolerated
 tolerating since [**11-19**] at 11AM
   - monitor fluid status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy was likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.
   - transfused 2u last weekende with appropriate Hct increase
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - renal rec
 on epo, with Iron/Vit C
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  NGT
   found to be in prox duodenum on CT abd/pel s/p 2 pullbacks. TF held per
   GI. Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had
   melenotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - pulled out NGT, plan for PEG in OR today
   .
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-31**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   - per Vsurg: to OR for closure at 11AM today
   - serial pulses
   .
   # IDDM
 insulin gtt, [**Last Name (un) **]-stim is negative for adrenal insufficiency.
   - d/c
d NPH [**Hospital1 **] and transitioned to lantus and ISS to uptitrate.
   - appreciate continued follow up by [**Last Name (un) 294**]
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT elevation
 Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] has had a rising alkaline
   phosphatase with a positive GGT and a relatively low AST/ALT.
     Patient is classic picture of choledocolithiasis, it is very
   difficult to assess pain in her RUQ but appears unlikely, so
   cholecystitis is unikely.
   - RUQ u/s after interventions today
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver and rhabdo.
   -          Now WNL
   -          Following alk phos, ggt pending
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic

Summary of information:
- The patient had a successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery and the left anterior descending artery.
- The patient experienced cardiogenic shock, which required the use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, but later developed compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity and underwent fasciotomy.
- The patient developed acute renal failure (ARF), likely secondary to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure, and now requires dialysis.
- The patient also developed rhabdomyolysis, as indicated by elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels.
- There were concerns for hepatic dysfunction, hepatic encephalopathy, and possible choledocholithiasis.
- The patient had an ileus, bloody stools, and required placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.
- The patient's coagulopathy improved with factor repletion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous acute inferior STEMI. She presented with cardiogenic shock and was found to have muddy brown casts in her urine, indicating acute kidney injury likely due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. The patient also had rhabdomyolysis, as evidenced by elevated levels of creatine kinase. She was placed on continuous venovenous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) initially but required hemodialysis (HD) after the failure of CVVH. The patient has been on a tunneled dialysis catheter and has tolerated off pressors. She is now on maintenance HD. The patient's neurologic depression has improved with increased HD clearance. She has had multiple fevers, and tissue debridement cultures showed yeast growth, which is concerning for true infection. The patient is currently on Vancomycin and Zosyn, and the course of treatment will be defined after closure today per ID recommendations. The patient's respiratory distress required intubation and mechanical ventilation. She has been weaned off sedation and is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials with a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to blood loss from an open fasciotomy and dilution from large volume IV repletion. She received a transfusion of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen"

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous inferior STEMI. She presented with cardiogenic shock and was found to have acute renal failure (ARF) with muddy brown casts, hyperkalemia, and anuria. She also had rhabdomyolysis with a high creatine kinase level, which is now downtrending. The patient was initially placed on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and later transitioned to intermittent hemodialysis (HD). A tunneled dialysis catheter was placed today.

The patient's respiratory distress was managed with mechanical ventilation, and she is currently on pressure support. Tracheostomy mask trials will continue, and fluid status and RR will be monitored. The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely due to blood loss from the open fasciotomy and dilutional effects. Heparin was maintained off, and transfusions were given as needed.

The patient had hepatic dysfunction, ileus, compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity (LLE), and a history of inferior STEMI treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Her elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are now within normal limits. The patient is on insulin for diabetes management.

Other findings include cholestatic LFT elevation, elevated lipase levels, and an episode of sinus arrest, which resolved with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent inferior STEMI. She presented with cardiogenic shock and required advanced cardiac life support. The patient underwent several procedures, including placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), tracheostomy, femoral arterial line, central venous catheter, and femoral dialysis catheter. She also had a fasciotomy of the left lower extremity due to compartment syndrome and placement of a wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC). 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient likely developed ARF before admission, possibly due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. This is further complicated by muddy brown casts on urine analysis and hyperkalemia. The patient is currently on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) and has been tolerating it well off pressors. A tunneled dialysis catheter was placed today.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient showed signs of hepatic encephalopathy, which improved with lactulose and reduction of fentanyl patch. However, she is currently off lactulose and rifaximin, as hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.
3. Infection: The patient had multiple sources of infection, including a yeast infection in the tissue debridement cultures from"

   # Neuro: Improved this AM on HD.  Consistent with uremia as source for
   prior neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.
   - failed Passy-Muir trial, will retry later in hospitalization

   # ID:  WBC has now completely resolved, fevers are low grade at best
   off tylenol. Early fevers [**1-31**] multiple nidi, including triple lumen,
   CVVH line, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.  Currently residual low grade fevers likely

   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   - Started HD [**11-19**] now tolerating off pressors

   # Respiratory distress:  Placed on vent monday with sedation for
   procedure.  Will wean as tolerated had been tolerating trach mask for
   increasing amounts of time, continue trach mask training
   - pressure support for now, trach mask as she wakes up
   - monitor fluid status and RR, continue trach mask trials
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative

   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock.
- She has undergone several interventions including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD), as well as a fasciotomy of the left lower extremity due to compartment syndrome.
- The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by acute renal failure (ARF) with muddy brown casts on urine analysis and hyperkalemia.
- She also experienced rhabdomyolysis, which has since improved.
- The patient required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress and has been weaned off pressors.
- She developed ileus initially but is now passing bowel movements spontaneously.
- There is evidence of cholestatic liver function test abnormalities, possibly related to gallstone disease.
- The patient has been on dialysis and has had tunneled dialysis catheter placement.
- She has been receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and other supportive treatments.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Infection: Given the presence of low-grade fevers and a yeast infection identified in tissue debridement cultures, there is a risk of further infections, especially"

   # Neuro: Improved this AM on HD.  Consistent with uremia as source for
   prior neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.
   -Passed Passy-Muir trial, making some recognizable phonation; continue
   as tolerated

   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She has undergone several interventions including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), femoral artery balloon angioplasty, and fasciotomy of the left lower extremity.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation, renal failure necessitating hemodialysis, hepatic dysfunction with elevated liver enzymes, gastrointestinal ileus, and compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity. She also has an open surgical wound with suspected fungal infection and is being treated with micafungin and rifampin.

The patient's medical team is planning for a tracheostomy, laparoscopic exploration for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and potential transfer to a rehabilitation facility. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She may also develop respiratory infections due to the tracheostomy.

2. Renal complications: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function. Dialysis dependence may persist, and there could be complications related to the dialysis catheter.

3. Hepatic complications: The patient has hepatic dysfunction with elevated liver enzymes. There is a"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with an admission diagnosis of sepsis secondary to acute cholangitis. The patient was initially treated with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn), and micafungin. Due to lack of improvement, the antibiotics were changed to vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and continued mica pending sensitivities, with a likely 4-week course of mica or diflucan. The patient has been placed on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode and is receiving supplemental oxygen through a tracheostomy mask. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.6 C (100.5 F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 81/30 mmHg to 131/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 92 kg at admission to 86.9 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,235 mL and output of 749 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,486 mL. The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube at 40 mL/hour.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 234 K/uL, hyponatremia with sodium levels ranging from 103 mEq/L to 138 mEq/L, hyperglycemia with glucose levels up to 192 mg/dL, elevated creatinine levels from 1.6 mg/dL to 2.1 mg/dL, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) are elevated, as well as D-dimer levels. Other lab results show abnormalities in electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and cardiac markers.

Physical examination findings include the patient's unresponsiveness to stimuli and decreased movement. Peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments were not performed.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis secondary to acute cholangitis. Despite changes in antibiotics, the patient has not shown improvement. This suggests a high risk of ongoing infection and sepsis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, indicating difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the patient's condition deteriorates.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating between low and high readings. This may indicate inadequate perfusion and a risk of organ damage.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are significantly low, which can lead to various neurological complications such as seizures"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient required hemodialysis due to acute renal failure, which was likely caused by poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. She also experienced respiratory distress and was placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient had ileus and was managed with nasogastric tube decompression and later underwent laparoscopic percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She developed compartment syndrome in her left lower extremity and underwent fasciotomy. Wound care and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy were initiated. The patient had elevated liver enzymes and alkaline phosphatase, which resolved with time. She was also diagnosed with cholestatic liver function test elevation and is being monitored for potential gallstone disease. The patient's blood glucose levels were managed with insulin therapy, and she is now on long-acting insulin (Lantus) and intermediate-acting insulin (NPH). Her lipid profile is currently on hold due to rhabdomyolysis. The patient's feeding tube was pulled, and she will be restarted on enteral nutrition once a dophoff tube is placed. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (D"

   # Neuro: Improved this AM on HD.  Consistent with uremia as source for
   prior neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.
   -Passed Passy-Muir trial, making some recognizable phonation; continue
   as tolerated
   .
   # ID:  WBC has now completely resolved, fevers are low grade at best
   off tylenol. Early fevers [**1-31**] multiple nidi, including triple lumen,
   CVVH line, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.  Currently residual low grade fevers likely
   [**1-31**] chronic inflammation in leg.   After ABX stopped, afebrile so far.
   - Tissue debridement cultures showed yeast -?[**Female First Name (un) 444**] hearty growth

   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   - Started HD [**11-19**] now tolerating off pressors
   - Tunneled dialysis catheter in place, will give blood with HD,
   - HD today.
   - IR guided tunnel cath

   # Respiratory distress:  Placed on vent monday with sedation for
   procedure.  Will wean as tolerated had been tolerating trach mask for
   increasing amounts of time, continue trach mask training
   - pressure support for now, trach mask as she wakes up
   - monitor fluid status and RR, continue trach mask with Passy-Muir
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative

   leg.
   - had HCT drop to unit given in xfusion, inappropriate response to unit
   after.
   - Vitamin K given for rising INR, transfuse one unit today
   - transfused 2u last weekend with appropriate Hct increase
   - continue to monitor Hct

   # Neuro: Improved this AM on HD.  Consistent with uremia as source for
   prior neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.
   -Passed Passy-Muir trial, making some recognizable phonation; continue
   as tolerated
   .
   # ID:  WBC has now completely resolved, fevers are low grade at best
   off tylenol. Early fevers [**1-31**] multiple nidi, including triple lumen,
   CVVH line, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.  Currently residual low grade fevers likely
   [**1-31**] chronic inflammation in leg.   After ABX stopped, afebrile so far.
   - Tissue debridement cultures showed yeast -?[**Female First Name (un) 444**] hearty growth
   after full course of diflucan is concerning for true infection
       - will treat with 3-4 weeks of mica or diflucan pending
   sensitivities
   - D/C Vanc and  Zosyn, if she spikes and decompensates ID recs were to
   start VANC, [**Last Name (un) **], CIPRO
   - (started [**11-22**]) mica 100 qd- await sensitivities of 4 week course
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent.
   - Started HD [**11-19**] now tolerating off pressors
   - Tunneled dialysis catheter in place, will give blood with HD,
   - HD schedule
   - IR guided tunnel cath
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Placed on vent monday with sedation for
   procedure.  Will wean as tolerated had been tolerating trach mask for
   increasing amounts of time, continue trach mask training
   - pressure support for now, trach mask as she wakes up
   - monitor fluid status and RR, continue trach mask with Passy-Muir
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative
   x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy was likely [**1-31**] /hepatic
   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.   She appears to be losing significant RBC
s through her
   leg.
   - had HCT drop to unit given in xfusion, inappropriate response to unit
   after.
   - Vitamin K given for rising INR, transfuse one unit today
   - transfused 2u last weekend with appropriate Hct increase
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - renal rec
 on epo, with Iron/Vit C
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  Patient
   had pulled NGT on her own, OR PEG failed, plan for laporoscopic today.
   Hepatic dysfunction contributing to this picture. Had melanotic/frankly
   bloody bm [**11-2**], put on IV PPI.
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   - IR guided doboff- post pyloric
   - Speech and swallow following with dobhoff
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-31**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy.  Wound VAC placed.
   - per Vsurg: went to OR, debrided way too big to close, plastics would
   like to heal by secondary intention
   - serial pulses
   - Vascular and Plastics to have conversation re: follow-up and wound
   care.  ACE pressure dressing appears to have stemmed blood loss
   somewhat.
   - f/u Vascular recs re: outpatient follow-up, would like to try wound
   vac today
   .
   # IDDM
 insulin gtt, [**Last Name (un) **]-stim is negative for adrenal insufficiency.
   - d/c
d NPH [**Hospital1 **] and transitioned to lantus and ISS to uptitrate.
   - appreciate continued follow up by [**Last Name (LF) 294**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] try 8 units of lantus
   today
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT elevation
 Ms [**Known lastname 9276**] has had a rising alkaline
   phosphatase with a positive GGT and a relatively low AST/ALT.
     RUQ U/s is not suspicious for gallstone or acalculous cholecystitis.
   Alk Phos is falling, may represent passage of an old stone.
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver and rhabdo.
   Significantly downtrended since hospitalization.
   -          Now WNL
   .
   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic
   / CVP.  Off IABP s/p development of compartment sx in LLE.  Reached
   goal CVP >12 for fluid resuscitated.  in NSR/sinus tach but had an
   episode of sinus arrest in cath lab. Off temp pacer at this time.  last
   TTE shows apical dyskinesis
 patient had been on heparin gtt but
   stopped [**1-31**] bleeding concerns.  Doing well off pressors.  Converted to
   sinus with amiodarone and  BB.   Currently in and out of sinus tach,
   responsive to beta-blockers.
   - Continue ASA, plavix.
   - Now starting statin.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home hypertensive regimen until more HD stable.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia
 Holding statin in setting of rhabdomyolysis /
   transaminitis/acute illness.
   .
   # FEN: Pt pulled NG, restart feeds once dobhoff is placed, would
   appreciate bridle ring.
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   - DVT ppx if HCT stable
 SQ heparin
   - pain management IV fentanyl
   - bowel regimen (senna + colace), lactulose

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, presenting with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery.

The patient's current condition is stable with improved cardiac output, but she continues to have renal failure and requires dialysis. She also has a wound infection in the leg that is being treated with antibiotics. Her liver enzymes are elevated due to rhabdomyolysis and possible hepatic dysfunction. She has an ileus and is being managed with a bowel regimen. She also has compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity, which has been treated with fasciotomy and wound debridement.

The patient is on multiple medications including insulin, beta-blockers, statins, aspirin, and Plavix. She is scheduled for a laparoscopic procedure to address her gastrointestinal issues.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, worsening of liver dysfunction, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and potential infections at the wound site. Close monitoring and appropriate management are essential to prevent these complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and subsequent multi-organ dysfunction. She has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various interventions including cardiac catheterization, fasciotomy, dialysis, tracheostomy, and placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation, renal failure necessitating dialysis, hepatic dysfunction, ileus, and compartment syndrome. She is also on multiple medications for various conditions, including anticoagulation, antibiotics, insulin, and cardiac support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to multi-organ dysfunction and prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
2. Bleeding: Due to the patient's history of anticoagulation therapy and the recent cessation of heparin, there is a risk of bleeding complications, particularly if platelet counts remain low.
3. Cardiac complications: Despite the initial management of STEMI and placement of a bare-metal stent in the LMCA and LAD, there is a possibility of recurrent cardiac events such as myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She has been admitted to the ICU and has developed several medical complications.

1. Neurological: The patient initially had neurologic depression possibly due to uremia, which improved after hemodialysis (HD). She also had hepatic encephalopathy, but this has resolved now that she is off lactulose and rifaximin.

2. Infectious Disease: The patient had fevers, and cultures from tissue debridement showed yeast growth. She has been treated with a full course of fluconazole (Diflucan) and is now being treated with micafungin (Mica) pending sensitivities.

3. Renal: The patient developed acute renal failure (ARF), likely due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. She has muddy brown casts on urine analysis, hyperkalemia, and anuria post catheterization. She is now on hemodialysis (HD) and has a tunneled dialysis catheter in place.

4. Respiratory Distress: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. She is currently weaning off the ventilator and is tolerating tracheostomy mask.

5. Hematology: The patient had early anemia and thrombocyt"

   # Neuro: Improved this AM on HD.  Consistent with uremia as source for
   prior neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.
   -Passed Passy-Muir trial, making some recognizable phonation; continue

   - monitor fluid status and RR, continue trach mask with Passy-Muir
   - patient had witnessed aspiration [**11-24**], CXR did not show any
   immediate signs of infiltrate.  Follow clinically.
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient was initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output but has improved to maintain a cardiac index of 3.1. She has had several medical complications including renal failure, respiratory distress requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, hepatic dysfunction, gastrointestinal ileus, compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity, and a wound infection in the left leg.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Neuro: Improved neurologic status consistent with uremia. Hepatic encephalopathy is not contributing to her mental status changes.
2. ID: WBC has resolved, but low-grade fevers persist, likely due to chronic inflammation in the leg wound. The patient has a yeast infection in the wound, and treatment with fluconazole is recommended.
3. Renal: ARF likely started before presentation and is now complicated by rhabdomyolysis. The patient is dialysis-dependent and requires hemodialysis.
4. Respiratory: Placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. Weaning will be attempted as tolerated.

   # Neuro: Improved this AM on HD.  Consistent with uremia as source for
   prior neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.
   -Passed Passy-Muir trial, making some recognizable phonation; continue
   as tolerated

   # ID:  WBC has now completely resolved, fevers are low grade at best
   off tylenol. Early fevers [**1-31**] multiple nidi, including triple lumen,
   CVVH line, sacral skin break down, tracheal secretions, leg wound being
   open and foley catheter.  Currently residual low grade fevers likely
   [**1-31**] chronic inflammation in leg.   After ABX stopped, afebrile so far.
   - Tissue debridement cultures showed yeast -?[**Female First Name (un) 444**] hearty growth

   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  Plt count now below 100 however increasing.  HIT ab was negative

   insufficiency given improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor
   repletion.   She appears to be losing significant RBC
s through her
   leg.
   - had HCT drop to unit given in xfusion, inappropriate response to unit
   after.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia presenting with an acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and subsequent multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

Key findings and concerns:
- Neurological: The patient has shown improvement in her neurological status, with a decrease in delirium and improved mental status. This could be attributed to improved hemodynamics and clearance of uremic toxins.
- Infectious Disease (ID): The patient's WBC count has resolved, indicating a resolution of the initial infection. However, she is now experiencing low-grade fevers, which are likely due to chronic inflammation in the leg wound. Cultures from tissue debridement have shown yeast growth, suggesting a possible fungal infection. Treatment with antifungal agents such as micafungin or fluconazole is recommended.
- Renal: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) likely secondary to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. She is now dialysis-dependent and requires hemodialysis (HD) to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
- Respiratory: The patient was placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. Weaning from the ventilator will be attempted as tolerated.
- Hematological: The patient has early anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely due to blood loss from the open fasciotomy and dilution"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the LMCA and LAD and was placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The patient developed rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury (AKI), leading to dialysis dependence. She also had a leg wound that was infected with yeast, for which she received antifungal treatment. The patient's respiratory status improved after tracheostomy and ventilation. She had episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's coagulopathy improved with factor repletion, but she continued to have anemia and thrombocytopenia. She required multiple blood transfusions and was placed on erythropoietin and iron supplementation. The patient's liver function tests showed cholestatic pattern, and she had elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Her condition has been stable since hospitalization.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of STEMI and cardiogenic shock, there is a potential risk of further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or recurrent myocardial infarction.
2. Renal Complications: The patient has developed AKI, and the long-term prognosis depends on the recovery of"

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a previous acute inferior STEMI. She presented with cardiogenic shock and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing multiple complications including fever, respiratory distress, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, ileus, compartment syndrome, and an infected leg wound.

Medical Complications:

   # Neuro: Improved this AM.  Consistent with uremia as source for prior
   neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.

   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent. Tunnelled HD line placed by IR.
   - Started HD [**11-19**] now tolerating off pressors
   - Tunneled dialysis catheter in place, will give blood with HD
   - HD schedule

   # Respiratory distress:  Pt desat yesterday with 40cc frank blood with
   suctioning. Pt was bronched by Thoracics and found to have small lesion
 treated with iced saline lavage. No further blood with suctioning.
   - pressure support for now, trach mask as she wakes up
   - monitor fluid status and RR, continue trach mask
   - no signs of aspiration on CXR
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She was initially managed with IABP and eventually underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the LMCA and LAD. The patient had multiple complications including sepsis, acute renal failure, respiratory distress, ileus, compartment syndrome, and rhabdomyolysis. She also had an episode of sinus arrest and required temporary pacing. The patient's current condition includes fever, hypotension, and anemia. She is currently receiving hemodialysis, tracheostomy, and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury. She is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive blood cultures suggest a possible infection. This could lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that can cause organ dysfunction.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate acute renal failure. This condition can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as well as the accumulation of waste products in the body.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's"

   # Neuro: Improved this AM.  Consistent with uremia as source for prior
   neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Events ove night noted and reviewed on CCU team rounds:
   Temperature elevation, worsening leg wound, unsuccessful feeding tube
   placement, respiratory tract bleeding with bronchoscopic lavage.
   Medical Decision Making
   Main issue continues to be leg wound now with deterioration and likely
   source of recurrent fever. Will follow recommendations from vascular
   and plastic surgery consults, but concerned that leg viability much
   less likely now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient was initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output but has improved to maintain an adequate cardiac index. She experienced complications including renal failure, respiratory distress, hepatic dysfunction, ileus, compartment syndrome in the lower extremity, and a non-healing wound in the leg with signs of infection.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Neurological: The patient's neurological depression is likely due to uremia. Hepatic encephalopathy is not contributing to her symptoms, and she is expected to improve with leg closure and increased hemodialysis clearance.
2. Infectious Disease (ID): The patient has fevers, and multiple potential sources of infection have been identified, including the triple lumen catheter, CVVH line, sacral skin breakdown, tracheal secretions, and leg wound. Cultures have been sent for blood, urine, and sputum. She is being treated with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and fluconazole. The yeast from tissue debridement culture is sensitive to fluconazole, so extended treatment with fluconazole will be continued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent an emergent coronary intervention with balloon angioplasty and stenting of the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient was initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output but has improved to a cardiac index of 3.1 on levophed infusion. She has been weaned off vasopressors and is currently stable. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney disease, hepatic dysfunction, and respiratory distress requiring invasive ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with muddy brown casts on urine analysis, hyperkalemia, and anuria. She is dependent on dialysis and has a history of pre-existing chronic kidney disease.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has altered mental status with neurologic depression, which is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. She has been treated with lactulose and rifaximin but remains off these medications due to improvement in mental status.

3. Infection: The patient has had multiple sources of infection including triple lumen catheter, CVVH line, sacral skin breakdown, tracheal secretions, and leg wound. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal agents.

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous acute inferior STEMI, who presented with cardiogenic shock. The patient has multiple medical complications including neurologic depression, hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, respiratory distress, anemia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal ileus, compartment syndrome, and elevated liver function tests. The patient underwent various interventions including tracheostomy, central venous catheter placement, hemodialysis, fasciotomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement. She was also on multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, insulin, and cardiac support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurologic depression: The patient had improved neurologic status, possibly due to improved renal function and clearance of toxic substances.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient had signs of hepatic dysfunction, but hepatic encephalopathy was not contributing to her condition.
3. Renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure likely caused by poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. This led to anuria, hyperkalemia, and rhabdomyolysis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous acute inferior STEMI. She presented with cardiogenic shock and was initially in critical condition. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to LMCA and LAD and received a bare-metal stent (BMS). The patient has multiple medical complications including neurologic depression possibly due to uremia, hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, respiratory distress, anemia, thrombocytopenia, ileus, compartment syndrome in the lower extremity, and infection. She also has elevated liver function tests, which have since improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurologic Depression: The patient's neurologic depression could be attributed to uremia. It is essential to monitor her mental status and consider appropriate interventions to improve cerebral perfusion and manage any underlying causes of uremia.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic dysfunction may contribute to hepatic encephalopathy. Close monitoring of liver function tests and management of hepatic failure is necessary. Lactulose and rifaximin could be considered for treatment, but caution should be taken due to the patient's ileus and risk of aspiration.

3. Renal Failure: The patient appears to have acute renal failure (ARF) likely secondary to cardiogenic shock and subsequent muddy brown casts in her urine analysis. Hyperkalemia and an"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient has multiple medical complications including hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, respiratory distress, anemia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal ileus, compartment syndrome, and elevated liver function tests. She is currently receiving various treatments including antibiotics, dialysis, vasopressors, blood transfusions, and medications for her conditions. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 113/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. Her fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1963 mL since midnight. The patient is expected to be transferred to the cardiac rehabilitation unit once stabilized in the critical care unit.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with a yeast infection in the tissue debridement culture, which is sensitive to fluconazole. She has been prescribed extended treatment with fluconazole. There are also multiple potential sources of infection including the tracheal secretions, leg wound, and central venous catheter.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous acute inferior STEMI. She presented with cardiogenic shock and was found to have multiple comorbidities including renal failure, respiratory distress, hepatic dysfunction, and gastrointestinal ileus. The patient underwent several interventions such as tracheostomy, femoral-femoral bypass, coronary stenting, fasciotomy, and placement of a tunneled hemodialysis catheter. She also received blood transfusions and was started on renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a yeast infection in the tissue debridement culture, which is sensitive to fluconazole. She should continue receiving extended treatment with fluconazole. There are also multiple potential sources of infection including the triple lumen catheter, CVVH line, sacral skin breakdown, tracheal secretions, and leg wound.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) likely due to poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. She is now dependent on dialysis and has developed rhabdomyolysis. Monitoring of fluid status, electrolyte levels, and urine output is crucial.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient experienced desaturation with blood on suctioning, indicating a possible lung issue. She has a small lesion treated with iced saline lavage and is currently on a trache"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Neuro: Improved this AM.  Consistent with uremia as source for prior
   neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.
   .
   # ID:  WBC stable, afebrile for several days.
   - Tissue debridement cultures showed yeast
[**Female First Name (un) **] sensitive to
   Fluconazole
 continue Fluconazole for extended treatment, at least 3
   weeks.
   - needs all necrotic tissue to be debrided
   - f/u BCx, UCx, sputum Cx (looking like known Klebsiella colonization)
   .
   # Renal:  ARF likely started before presentation to [**Hospital1 1**]. Likely from
   poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. Now with muddy
   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent. Tunnelled HD line placed by IR.
   - Started HD [**11-19**] now tolerating off pressors
   - Tunneled dialysis catheter in place, will give blood with HD
   - HD schedule (Tu,Th,Sat)
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Pt desat [**11-25**] with 40cc frank blood with
   suctioning. Pt was bronched by Thoracics and found to have small lesion
 treated with iced saline lavage. No further blood with suctioning.
   - monitor fluid status and RR, continue trach mask
   - no signs of aspiration on CXR
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus
   far.  HIT ab was negative x1 2^nd is pending.  Her coagulopathy was
   likely [**1-31**] /hepatic insufficiency given improvement of coags and
   plts/HCT with factor repletion.   She appears to be losing significant
   RBC
s through her leg. HCT 24.1 today.
   - had HCT drop to unit given in xfusion, inappropriate response to unit
   after.
   - transfuse one unit today with HD
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - renal rec
 on epo, with Iron/Vit C
   .
   # GI: ileus
 Patient now having regular BMs off of lactulose.  Patient
   had pulled NGT on her own, OR PEG failed. Hepatic dysfunction
   contributing to this picture. Had melanotic/frankly bloody bm [**11-2**], put
   on IV PPI.  Had ?aspiration event [**11-24**], Dobhoff was pulled [**11-26**]
   (coiled in mouth). Currently with NGT in place.
   - PEG placement
 needs open procedure by thoracics, f/u recs
   - continue Reglan to promote motility, decrease risk of aspiration
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose
   .
   # compartment sx
 Likely developed [**1-31**] IABP use.  IABP now removed,
   patient s/p LLE fasciotomy. Wound appears necrotic this AM. Currently
   on wound vac on medial wound, aquacel on lateral wound.
   - f/u Plastics, VSurg recs
   - f/u Vascular recs re: outpatient follow-up
   - wound vac on medial compartment, aquaseal on lateral compartment

   # IDDM
 insulin gtt, [**Last Name (un) **]-stim is negative for adrenal insufficiency.
   - appreciate continued follow up by [**Last Name (un) 294**], 10units lantus with
   increased sliding scale coverage
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 294**]: insulin drip for better glycemic control.
   # Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated. Likely shock liver and rhabdo.

   # Acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory: S/P BMS to
   LMCA and LAD.   BB was held until more hemodynamically stable.
   Initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output (CI 1.7-1.9),
   now improved to CI 3.1 this AM on levophed gtt.  Elevated PA diastolic

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which is a brain disorder caused by liver dysfunction. The patient's neurologic depression has improved with lactulose treatment. However, it is important to continue monitoring the patient's neurological status.

2. Infection: The patient has a wound infection due to necrotic tissue. Cultures have shown yeast sensitivity to fluconazole, so extended treatment with fluconazole is recommended. There is also colonization with known Klebsiella species. It is important to follow up with cultures and consider appropriate antibiotic therapy.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) likely caused by poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure. The patient is dialysis-dependent and requires ongoing management of electrolyte imbalances and fluid balance.

4. Respiratory distress: The patient experienced an episode of desaturation during suctioning and was found to have a small lesion treated with iced saline lavage. Close monitoring of respiratory status and fluid management is necessary.

5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely due to blood loss from open fasciotomy and dilution from large volume IV repletion. The patient has received transfusions of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. Monitoring of blood counts and appropriate"

   # Neuro: Improved this AM.  Consistent with uremia as source for prior
   neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.

   # Respiratory distress:  Pt desat yesterday with 40cc frank blood with
   suctioning. Pt was bronched by Thoracics and found to have small lesion
 treated with iced saline lavage. No further blood with suctioning.
   - monitor fluid status and RR, continue trach mask
   - no signs of aspiration on CXR
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient has multiple medical complications including renal failure, respiratory distress, hepatic dysfunction, anemia, thrombocytopenia, ileus, compartment syndrome, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. She underwent several interventions including percutaneous coronary intervention, femoral artery catheterization, IABP use, fasciotomy, debridement of necrotic wound, placement of tunneled dialysis catheter, and placement of PEG. The patient's current condition is stable, but she requires ongoing management for her various medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury with muddy brown casts on urine analysis, hyperkalemia, anuria, and elevated creatinine levels. She is dependent on dialysis.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced desaturation with blood aspiration and required bronchoscopy. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy.
3. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy. She was previously on lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy but is now off these medications.

   # Neuro: Improved this AM.  Consistent with uremia as source for prior
   neurologic depression.
   Earlier reduction of fentanyl patch clearly helped MS, as did lactulose
   for a brief period.  She is currently off of lactulose and rifaxamin
   and hepatic encephalopathy is not thought to be contributing.  Classic
   picture of toxic metabolic, will likely clear with leg closure,
   increase HD clearance.

   brown casts on urine analysis. Hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria
   immediately post cath. Complicated by rhabdomyolysis with CK to [**Numeric Identifier **].
   CK now downtrending.  Trial off CVVH was not successful, patient
   appears to be dialysis dependent. Tunnelled HD line placed by IR.
   - Started HD [**11-19**] now tolerating off pressors

   # Respiratory distress:  Pt desat [**11-25**] with 40cc frank blood with
   suctioning. Pt was bronched by Thoracics and found to have small lesion
 treated with iced saline lavage. No further blood with suctioning.
   - monitor fluid status and RR, continue trach mask
   - no signs of aspiration on CXR
   .
   # Heme: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components due to
   blood loss from open fasciotomy, contributory factors include dilution
   from large volume IV repletion.  Heparin is now being maintained off.
   S/p transfusion of 19.5u pRBC, 2u FFP, 2u platelets, 2units Cryo thus

   - continue Reglan to promote motility, decrease risk of aspiration
   - off IV PPI, now on PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BM regimen, hold lactulose

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, who presented with an acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was found to have necrotic tissue in the left lower extremity (LLE). She also has hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, respiratory distress, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal ileus. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of necrotic tissue in the LLE and is on wound vac, which increases the risk of wound infection. The presence of yeast in tissue debridement culture also suggests a possible fungal infection.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding. She has received multiple blood product transfusions, and her coagulation profile needs close monitoring.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic dysfunction and is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. This can be exacerbated by factors such as electrolyte imbalances and medications.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) and is currently on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and acute inferior STEMI. She presented with cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and hepatic dysfunction. The patient underwent several interventions including percutaneous coronary intervention, intra-aortic balloon pump placement, fasciotomy, and wound debridement. She also required mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective coping: The patient's inability to maintain adequate fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as her renal function, may indicate ineffective coping mechanisms.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high serum sodium levels suggest a risk for hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration and neurological complications.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's history of frank blood with suctioning and the presence of a tracheostomy tube suggest a potential risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's history of diabetes mellitus and elevated blood glucose levels may predispose her to DKA, a serious complication characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels, oliguria, and the presence of muddy brown casts indicate a risk for AKI, which can progress to chronic kidney disease.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type I, atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleed, shock (cardiogenic and other), respiratory failure (acute), impaired skin integrity, renal failure (acute), pain control, and myocardial infarction (acute). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 116/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheostomy mask. The patient is awake, responsive, and answering questions.

The patient's recent events include a planned open percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, which has been postponed until the albumin level is above 2.5 g/dL. The patient was also ordered to be nothing by mouth (NPO) after midnight for an IR-guided Dobhoff placement tomorrow. Additionally, the patient's leg was re-stitched due to ongoing oozing.

The patient's labs show a white blood cell count of 7.5 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, glucose of 230 mg/dL, sodium of 143 mEq/L, potassium of 3.6 mEq/L, creatinine of 2.3 mg/dL, and a blood sugar level of 107 mg/dL. Other lab results are also provided, indicating various abnormalities.

The patient's daily flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of 741 mL total input, with 962 mL total in and 221 mL total out. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy mask, with an oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, scattered surgical sites with drainage, intact pulses, and wrapped and vacuum-assisted wounds on the lower extremities.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include but are not limited to:
1. Infection: The patient has multiple surgical sites, which increases the risk of infection.
2. Respiratory issues: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently on respiratory support.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient has acute renal failure, which may require further evaluation and management.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, which could potentially recur.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to surgical wounds, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infection.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient has high blood sugar levels, indicating uncontrolled diabetes.
8. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels, such as high sodium and low potassium.

These are potential complications that can arise"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous myocardial infarction. She presented with acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and was found to have a spinal cord lesion worrisome for infarct/hemorrhage. The patient also has renal failure, respiratory distress, gastrointestinal bleeding, impaired skin integrity, and anemia.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): Continue monitoring temperature and treating any underlying causes.
2. Hypernatremia (high sodium): Monitor sodium levels and correct if necessary.
3. Ineffective coping: Provide emotional support and involve the patient's family in the care process.
4. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type I: Administer insulin as per recommended regimen.
5. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): Monitor heart rhythm and manage with appropriate medications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleed, other (GI bleed, GIB): Continue monitoring vital signs, coagulation parameters, and transfuse blood products as needed.
7. Shock, other: Monitor hemodynamic parameters and administer appropriate fluid resuscitation.
8. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name 2]): Maintain oxygenation and ventilatory support as required.
9. Impaired skin integrity: Monitor wound healing and manage with appropriate dressings and debridement if necessary"

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous myocardial infarction. She presented with acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and subsequent complications including respiratory failure, renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, impaired skin integrity, and neurological deficits. She underwent several interventions including percutaneous coronary intervention, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement, fasciotomy, and debridement of necrotic wound. The patient also has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and is currently receiving insulin therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is currently on a tracheostomy and receiving supplemental oxygen. She has been prescribed Bactrim for presumptive VAP, indicating a concern for this complication.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE): With prolonged immobilization and decreased mobility, the patient is at risk for developing DVT, which can potentially lead to PE if emboli dislodge and travel to the lungs.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and ongoing monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is important to detect any further blood loss.

4. Renal insufficiency: The patient has acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, indicating impaired"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and was found to have small lesions in her trachea. She also had anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, respiratory distress, gastrointestinal bleeding, and impaired skin integrity. The patient underwent several interventions, including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), dialysis, tracheostomy, and fasciotomy. She is currently on multiple medications for various conditions, including diabetes management, blood thinners, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications:
1. Ineffective coping: The patient's impaired skin integrity and history of hepatic encephalopathy may indicate ineffective coping mechanisms.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels could lead to complications such as dehydration, seizures, or neurological dysfunction.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress and history of tracheostomy indicate potential respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure, indicated by muddy brown casts and anuria, may require ongoing dialysis support.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of frank blood with suctioning and previous melanotic/frankly bloody bowel movement suggests ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which needs close monitoring.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient's health summary can be summarized as follows:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type I, hyperlipidemia, and previous inferior STEMI. She presented with acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. She also had an open fasciotomy and was found to have necrotic wounds in both lower extremities.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Neurological issues: Bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, concerning for a spinal cord lesion, such as infarct/hemorrhage or abscess. Neurology consultation and MRI lumbar spine have been ordered.

2. Respiratory issues: The patient is currently maintaining saturations on 40% FiO2 through a tracheostomy. She has Stenotrophomonas sputum culture, but no other symptoms consistent with pneumonia. Presumptive VAP treatment with Bactrim has been started, and ID recommendations are being followed.

3. Renal issues: Acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD) through a tunneled line. Renal dosing of medications is being done, and HD will continue on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

4. Hematological issues: Early anemia and thromb"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Have reviewed consult recommendations. We are especially concerned
   regarding evidence of possible spinal cord infarct and paraplegia. This
   has been reported as complication of IABP although very infrequent.
   Plan for repeat MRI today.  Will review if this changes plan regarding
   left leg wound treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, who presented with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty and stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient also had an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placed but developed compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity, necessitating fasciotomy and removal of the IABP. She has since been weaned off vasopressors and pressor support.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including renal failure requiring hemodialysis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver function tests. She is also being treated for a necrotic wound on the left lower extremity, which is sensitive to fluconazole. The patient's neurological status is of particular concern, as she has bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, raising suspicion of a spinal cord lesion, possibly an infarct or hemorrhage. An MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine has been ordered to further evaluate this.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Spinal cord infarct or hemorrhage: The patient's neurological symptoms and the presence of risk factors such as IABP use suggest a potential spinal cord lesion. Immediate investigation and management are necessary to prevent further neurological deterioration.
2. Wound infection:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.

The patient's recent events include development of neurologic deficits with bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, which is concerning for a spinal cord lesion. An MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine has been ordered to further evaluate this. The patient also has been experiencing renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD) since November 19th. She has received transfusions of packed red blood cells (RBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets, and cryoprecipitate.

The patient's wounds from the fasciotomy have shown signs of necrosis and infection, with growth of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Klebsiella oxytoca. Fluconazole has been initiated for fungal prophylaxis due to the presence of candidemia. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) were elevated but have since normalized. She has been weaned off pressors and is currently maintaining oxygen saturation on 40% FiO2 through a tracheostomy (trach) tube.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   57 year old female with prolonged hospital course h/o HTN, DM, chol
   presents with STEMI. Crossing the LM with wire resulted in severe
   hypotension so LM stented and IABP placed. IABP has since been d/c'd
   and there was concern over the patient not moving her legs. MRI
   demonstrated no spinal cord infarct and this am the patient had
   movement in both LEs with command. Another complication of the cath /
   IABP has been compartment syndrome of the right lower ext requiring
   fasciotomy. Additionally, pt grew xanthamonas in the sputum.
   Medical Decision Making
   57 yo female with protracted hosptal course now improving. Pt remains
   oliguric and on renal relacement therapy. Plastice/surgery to debride
   the fasciotomy sight today or tomorrow. ID recommended bactrim for the
   xanthamonas in the sputum. Continue Plavix and asa, metoprolol 12.5mg
   [**Hospital1 **].

   on:[**2185-12-1**] 05:25 PM ------
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Following the procedure, the patient developed cardiogenic shock and required intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The IABP was later discontinued due to the development of compartment syndrome in the right lower extremity, which required fasciotomy.

The patient also experienced acute kidney injury requiring hemodialysis, and there were concerns about bleeding complications, leading to the discontinuation of heparin. The patient had necrotic wounds on the lower extremities, which were debrided and showed growth of Xanthomonas in the sputum. The patient was started on Bactrim for the Xanthomonas infection. 

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), metoprolol, clopidogrel (Plavix), aspirin, statin, epoetin, iron, and vitamin C. She is also on a regimen of pain management with IV fentanyl and bowel regimen (senna + colace), lactulose.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate, but these have improved over time. Her white blood cell count and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock, for which she underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). She also had fasciotomy of the left lower extremity (LLE) due to compartment syndrome.

Current Assessment:
- Neurological: The patient has bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, which is worrisome for a spinal cord lesion, possibly infarction, hemorrhage, or abscess. A neurology consult has been requested, and an MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine is planned.
- Respiratory: The patient is currently maintaining oxygen saturation on 40% FiO2 through a tracheostomy. Sputum culture showed Stenotrophomonas, but no other symptoms consistent with pneumonia. She is on Bactrim for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Renal: The patient has acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD), which will be continued three times a week. Her ionized calcium is low and has been repleted with calcium gluconate.
- Hematological: The patient has early anemia and thrombocytopenia likely due to blood loss from the fasciotomy, dilution from large volume IV"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Neurological: Bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine shows no evidence of anterior spinal cord infarction or other compressive processes. Further neurologic recommendations, including an electromyography (EMG) study, are planned.

2. Respiratory: The patient is currently maintained on a tracheostomy (trach) with 40% FiO2. Sputum culture showed Stenotrophomonas, but there are no symptoms consistent with pneumonia. The patient is being treated with Bactrim for presumptive ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Respiratory support will be weaned as possible.

3. Renal: Acute renal failure (ARF) requiring hemodialysis (HD) through a tunneled line. Renally dosed medications will be continued, and HD will be performed on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Ionized calcium levels are low, and calcium gluconate has been administered.

4. Hematology/Oncology: Early anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely components of the patient's condition due to blood"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Neurological: The patient exhibits bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, with movement observed in the right lower extremity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is negative for spinal infarct. The patient's neurologic status requires further evaluation and an electromyography (EMG) study.

2. Respiratory: The patient maintains oxygen saturation on 40% FiO2 through a tracheostomy (Trach) mask. Sputum culture showed Stenotrophomonas, although no other symptoms are consistent with pneumonia. The patient is being treated with Bactrim for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Continuous tracheostomy mask ventilation and weaning of FiO2 are recommended.

3. Renal: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) requiring hemodialysis (HD) three times a week through a tunneled line. Renal dosing of medications is necessary. Calcium gluconate was repleted due to low ionized calcium levels.

4. Hematologic: Early an"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was placed on long-term anticoagulation therapy. However, she developed right lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy. The patient also had episodes of hypotension and required blood transfusions due to significant blood loss during surgery. She was diagnosed with acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis and developed anemia and thrombocytopenia. The patient's wound showed signs of infection, and she was treated with antibiotics and debridement. She also had elevated liver enzymes and was diagnosed with hepatic insufficiency. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being weaned off the ventilator. She is expected to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility once she recovers.

Potential medical complications:
1. Wound infection: The patient's wound showed signs of infection, and she was treated with antibiotics and debridement. Close monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis is necessary.
2. Anemia: The patient developed anemia due to blood loss during surgery. Transfusions have been given, but ongoing monitoring of her hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is required to ensure they remain within normal ranges.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient also developed thrombocytopenia"

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon-mounted stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). Following the procedure, the patient developed right lower extremity compartment syndrome, which required fasciotomy.

The patient's hospital course has been complicated by multiple medical complications. These include hypotension after blood loss during the debridement of a necrotic wound, anemia and thrombocytopenia due to blood loss and dilutional effects, acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and hepatic insufficiency. The patient has received various treatments, including blood transfusions, medications for infection prophylaxis, and management of her underlying medical conditions.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 109/45 mmHg (60/16 mmHg - 127/87 mmHg), respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% FiO2 via tracheostomy. The patient is still receiving mechanical"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's hospital course was complicated by the development of right lower extremity compartment syndrome, which required fasciotomy. She also experienced episodes of hypotension, likely due to blood loss and anesthetic agents. The patient's coagulopathy improved with factor repletion and platelet transfusion. She continues to have significant blood loss from her wound site, requiring ongoing transfusions. Her renal function is impaired, and she is on hemodialysis (HD). The patient has an elevated lactate level and is at risk for hepatic insufficiency. Her neurological examination reveals bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, but her MR is negative for spinal infarct. The patient's respiratory status has been stable on 40% FiO2, and she is intermittently on room air. She has a history of Sputum culture positive for Stenotrophomonas, which is being treated with Bactrim. The patient is also on proton pump inhibitors, epoetin, iron/vitamin C supplementation, and anticoagulants. She has elevated liver enzymes but is now within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and acute inferior STEMI. She presented with cardiogenic shock and was initially in poor cardiac output. She underwent a procedure for debridement of the lateral wound, during which she experienced transient hypotension and required a bolus of normal saline and phenylephrine. She also received a blood transfusion due to low hemoglobin levels. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Complications: The patient has bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, which may indicate a spinal cord infarct. Further evaluation with EMG study is recommended.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient is currently maintaining saturations on 40%FiO2 on tracheostomy. She has a history of VAP, for which she is being treated with Bactrim. Weaning of FiO2 should be continued.
3. Renal Complications: The patient has acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD) through a tunneled line. Medications are being renally dosed, and HD will continue on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.
4. Hematological Complications: The patient has early anemia and thrombocytopenia likely due to blood loss from the open fasciotomy, dilution from large volume IV repletion, and GI bleed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was found to have right lower extremity compartment syndrome, which required fasciotomy. The patient also experienced hypotension after blood loss during surgery and received blood transfusions. She has been on mechanical ventilation and has had multiple complications including renal failure requiring hemodialysis, hepatic insufficiency, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a suspected central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemic shock due to ongoing blood loss from the surgical site.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to hypoperfusion and the use of nephrotoxic agents.
3. Hepatic dysfunction due to sepsis and multiorgan failure.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia as a result of blood loss and dilutional effects from fluid resuscitation.
5. Infection at the surgical site, possibly leading to wound dehiscence or abscess formation.
6. Respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pneumonia or ventilator-associated lung injury.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheters.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Hypotension has resolved from fever spike and hemodialysis yesterday
   and the phenylephrine has been weaned off.. Pt was transfused 2 u PRBC.
   Patient still not aggressively moving lower extremities but does move
   right leg. Fasciotomy site continues to ooze since debridement.
   Nephrology is pessimistic about improvement in renal function and feels
   patient will be HD dependent long term. Patient remains on Fluconazole
   for fungus in right LE wound. She continues to have sacral and occiput
   decubitus ulcers. Family meeting was held this afternoon with all 4
   daughters. [**Name (NI) **] questions answered and they were told of the patient's
   need for long term dialysis as well as the concerns over her LE
   weakness and severe right leg wound and the possible need for RLE
   amputation. They were satisfied with the encountered. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] aware
   of the patients status.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2185-12-2**] 05:42 PM ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The hospital course has been complicated by the development of right lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy, hypotension, acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD), anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a wound infection in the right lower extremity.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 109/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% FiO2 via tracheostomy. The patient is still intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 20.5%, white blood cell count of 8.8 K/uL, platelet count of 322 K/uL, creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 138 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including low sodium, potassium, and calcium levels.

The patient has been treated with various medications including heparin, phenylephrine, pantoprazole, fluconazole, and insulin. She has also received blood transfusions and fresh frozen plasma.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's vital signs show elevated temperature, sinus tachycardia, and low blood pressure. The patient's weight has decreased from 92 kg at admission to 82.3 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,745 mL with a total output of 1,483 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,262 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy mask with 100% oxygen saturation. The arterial blood gas (ABG) result is not provided in the note. Physical examination findings are incomplete, with assessments not performed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), creatinine (Cr), and lactate. Hemoglobin (Hct) has been fluctuating over the past few days. Platelet count (Plt) has been relatively stable. Glucose levels have been variable, with one reading being significantly elevated at 280 mg/dL.

The patient has received blood transfusions, including 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) with hemodilution (HD) and 2 additional units of pRBCs due to a drop in Hct to 20.5. The patient's condition is complicated by renal failure, acute pain, and myocardial infarction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient had a complicated hospital course characterized by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, hepatic insufficiency, and severe thrombocytopenia. She also developed compartment syndrome in the lower extremity and necrotic wound with fungal infection. The patient's condition has been managed with aggressive critical care measures, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and blood product transfusions. She continues to require ongoing monitoring and treatment in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent renal dysfunction: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
2. Hepatic insufficiency: The patient's hepatic function may not fully recover, leading to ongoing liver dysfunction.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's severe thrombocytopenia could increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of a necrotic wound increase the risk of developing infections, including hospital-acquired pneumonia and bloodstream infections.
5. Deep vein thrombosis ("

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. During her hospital course, she developed right lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy, hypotension likely due to hypovolemic blood loss from the operating room, and anemia and thrombocytopenia requiring blood transfusions.

The patient also experienced neurologic symptoms including bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, which were initially thought to be secondary to spinal infarct but are now believed to be due to ICU myopathy. An EMG study suggested possible dysfunction of anterior horn cells.

The patient has respiratory issues, maintaining saturations on 40% FiO2 on tracheostomy and intermittently on room air. She has a sputum culture positive for Stenotrophomonas, leading to the prescription of Bactrim for presumptive ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Renal function was impaired requiring hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. The patient had early anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely due to blood loss from the open fasciotomy, dilution from large volume IV repletion, and GI bleed. Her coagulopathy improved with factor repletion.

The patient developed a necrotic"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Hypotension has resolved following transfusion of 2u PRBC. Pressors
   remain off overnight. EMG consistent with ICU neuropathy d/t critical
   illness. Patient had become more awake, alert and comminucative since
   Fentanyl patch dose has decreased.She reports no overt pain and no
   chest pain. Fluid balance is pos by 1500 cc past 24 hours. ID feels
   that there is a fungal osteomyelitis involving the left lower extremity
   and this is being treated with PO Fluconizole for planned course of 8 -
   12 weeks. Plan per renal is to maintain a gentle negative fluid balance
   over the next 2-3 days with CVVHD as she became hypotensive after
   ultrafiltration/HD yesterday. Creat stable at 1.9 but patient remains
   essentially anuric. We will change PPI therapy to H2B due to the
   interaction of PPIs with the decreased conversion of clopidagrel to
   it's active metabolite as patient has a LM stent. Will plan to add ACEI
   in the future to prevent unfavorable remodelling after a STEMI.
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and subsequent cardiogenic shock. She underwent fasciotomy for right lower extremity compartment syndrome and required blood transfusions due to anemia and thrombocytopenia. The patient also has a fungal osteomyelitis in the left lower extremity, which is being treated with fluconazole for 8-12 weeks. She has been diagnosed with critical illness neuropathy and is experiencing weakness in both lower extremities. The patient's renal function is impaired, requiring hemodialysis. Her blood pressure is currently stable, but she still requires a tracheostomy for respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged weakness and immobility due to critical illness neuropathy.
2. Development of pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.
3. Infection or worsening of the fungal osteomyelitis if proper wound care and antibiotic therapy are not maintained.
4. Further deterioration of renal function leading to chronic kidney disease.
5. Possible need for long-term ventilatory support if weaning from the tracheostomy is not successful.
6. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism due to immobility and central venous catheters.
7. Potential complications associated with long-term use of fluconazole, such as liver"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and developed right lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by several issues including hypotension, neurologic deficits, renal failure, fungal osteomyelitis, and a complicated wound healing process. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and has been on renal dosing of medications. Her current vital signs are stable, but she remains in the ICU for further management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound infection or dehiscence: The patient's wound is currently managed with a wound vacuum (vac) and topical therapy, but there is a risk of infection or wound dehiscence due to the presence of necrotic tissue and the patient's compromised immune system.
2. Critical illness neuropathy: The patient's EMG study suggests the presence of critical illness neuropathy, which can lead to prolonged weakness and difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal failure: The patient has experienced acute renal failure, and there is a risk of chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
4. Fungal osteomyelitis: The patient has been diagnosed with fungal osteomyelitis, and long-term antifungal therapy is required to prevent"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous inferior STEMI. She presented with acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and subsequently developed right lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by hypotension, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure requiring hemodialysis, hepatic insufficiency, wound infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and hyperglycemia.

The patient is currently maintained on a tracheostomy with intermittent weaning on room air, and her sputum culture showed Stenotrophomonas. She is being treated with fluconazole for a fungal infection in the wound, and her blood cultures are pending. The patient has received blood transfusions and factor repletion due to significant blood loss and coagulopathy.

Her current medications include ranitidine, epoetin, iron, and vitamin C for anemia, as well as aspirin, clopidogrel, and a statin for her medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 115/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% FiO2, and temperature of 35.3°C.

The patient's physical examination reveals generalized obesity"

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9276**] continues to slowly improve. She remains afebrile and bloody
   drainage from the LLE has diminished. She began CVVHD yesterday as she
   was developing refractory hypotension on HD days. She has negative
   fluid balance of -345 in pat 24 hours with adequate BP control
   120's/70s. PPI was changed to H2B for concern over the issue of PPIs
   decreasing the conversion of clopidogrel to it's active metabolite. She
   remains on Bactrim for Xanthamonas sp. and will need long tern PO
   Fluconizole for fungal osteomyelitis of the left LE. Neurological
   status continue to improve yet she is unable to move her left leg. This
   is likely due to her deep debribement of nectrotic tissue in that leg
   as well as significant edema.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and subsequent cardiogenic shock. She underwent fasciotomy for right lower extremity compartment syndrome and has had multiple transfusions due to blood loss. The patient's medical conditions include acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, hepatic insufficiency, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and suspected fungal osteomyelitis of the left lower extremity.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is on multiple antibiotics and antifungals, indicating a risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or worsening wound drainage, is essential.

2. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and recent transfusions increase the risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of clotting parameters and careful management of medications that affect clotting are necessary.

3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of STEMI and cardiogenic shock, which may lead to ongoing cardiac problems. Monitoring of cardiac function and ongoing management of her medications is crucial.

4. Neurological deficits: The patient's weakness and loss of sensation in the lower extremities may persist or worsen due to critical illness neuropathy and potential superimposed anterior horn cell involvement. Rehabilitation and physical therapy should be considered.

5. Wound healing: The patient's left lower"

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9276**] continues to improve although remains hypotensive after
   aggressive ultrafiltration over the last 24 hours with [**Last Name (un) 6005**] negative
   fluid balance of -5.4L. She remains substantially positive through the
   hospitalization for + 15-20 liters. She remains on CVVHD and is awake
   and conversant in spanish. She reports no chest or abdominal pain and
   states that she has pain in the left LLE with sitting up. She runs rare
   low grade fevers to 99.9 despite bactrim for xanthamonas and
   Fluconazole PO for fungal osteomyelitis. The plan per plastic surgery
   is to take the patient back to the OR on Thursday or Friday of this
   week for further debridement of the LLE. Creat is stable at 1.2 and hct
   is stable at 29.9. The plan for today will be to stop negative fluid
   balance on CVVH and to actually run a slight positive fluid balance
   today due to SBPs in the 70-80 mm Hg systolic range. There was also
   question raised on rounds about her eyesight and we will further
   investigate this and may need an optho consult.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health
   care proxy. [**Name (NI) **] seen and examined without input from resident(s) or
   fellow(s).
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and subsequent cardiogenic shock. She underwent fasciotomy for right lower extremity compartment syndrome and has had multiple blood transfusions due to significant blood loss.

Current assessment reveals that she is hypotensive with a blood pressure of 91/47 mmHg and tachycardic with a heart rate of 106 bpm. Her respiratory support includes being on a tracheostomy with 40% FiO2. She has a positive fluid balance of -5.4L and remains on CVVHD.

She is currently on various medications including insulin, calcium gluconate, ASA, Plavix, statin, and ranitidine. The plan is to continue aggressive fluid resuscitation and optimize her blood pressure and heart rate. The next steps include further debridement of the left lower extremity wound, continued treatment for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia, and weaning off the ventilator as tolerated.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ongoing hypotension and low cardiac output, worsening renal function, respiratory failure, infections such as fungal osteomyelitis, and thromboembolic events."

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent an emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient also had a right lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy and was found to have acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been treated for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with antibiotics. The patient's medical team is planning for weaning off the ventilator and considering rehabilitation after her critical care unit (CCU) stay.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation puts her at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which has already been suspected and treated with antibiotics. She may also develop further respiratory complications such as atelectasis, bronchitis, or lung infections due to her compromised respiratory function.

2. Cardiovascular Complications: Given the patient's history of acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock, she is at risk for further cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or recurrent myocardial ischemia.

3. Renal Complications: The patient's acute renal failure requires ongoing renal support through CVVH. There is a risk of ongoing renal dysfunction or"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is being treated for multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, renal failure, and pain control issues.

The patient is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and has had phosphate replacement. Insulin therapy has been increased by 2 units, starting at 200 units, and will be adjusted if fasting blood sugar levels remain high.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is being monitored closely. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 91/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheal mask ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals wheezing sounds in the upper airway, obesity, and presence of blood oozing through the dressing of a wound on the lower extremity. Neurological examination shows minimal movement and sensation in the lower extremities.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of creatinine, blood glucose, and D-dimer. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include several issues such as inability to protect airway, impaired activity intolerance, impaired balance"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Complications:
   - VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
   - ICU-Acquired Weakness: Prolonged bed rest and immobility can lead to muscle weakness and loss of muscle mass.

2. Renal Complications:
   - ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient has experienced acute renal failure requiring dialysis. Continued renal dysfunction may lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
   - CVVH (Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration): The patient is on CVVH to manage fluid balance and remove waste products from the blood.

3. Hemodynamic Complications:
   - Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires careful monitoring and management to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
   - Cardiogenic Shock: The patient initially presented with cardiogenic shock, which required intensive care and supportive therapy.

4. Neurological Complications:
   - Critical Illness-Related Cortical Germinal Ventilation (CICGV): The patient's neurological status is compromised, with symptoms such as weakness and loss of sensation in the lower extremities.
   - ICU Myopathy: Prolonged immobilization and sedation can lead to muscle weakness and atrophy.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Blood pressure remains in the 80-100mm Hg range off CVVHD. Plan per
   plastic surgery and vascular surgery is to continue bedside wound
   debridement. Of concern, her fever curve is increasing slightly and wbc
   ct is up to 10.2k. We will try to resume HD with less ultrafiltraion to
   avoid hypotension. She will need long term Fluconazole for RLE fungal
   osteomyelitis. We will plan for d/c to rehab in the next few days if
   she remains afebrile and tolerates dialysis well. She has been stable
   from the cardiac standpoint with no chest pain. She will need lifelong
   Plavix for her LM stent.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and subsequent development of right lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy. She has been in the ICU since admission and has had multiple medical complications including hypotension, acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, elevated white blood cell count, infection of the soft tissue and bone in the left lower extremity, and hepatic insufficiency. The patient has undergone several interventions including percutaneous coronary intervention to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery, placement of a bare metal stent, and removal of an intra-aortic balloon pump. She is currently on various medications including lantus, ranitidine, epo, iron/vit C, fluconazole, ASA, Plavix, and statin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains in the 80-100mm Hg range, indicating persistent hypotension. This could be due to several factors such as hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction, or vasodilatory effects of medications.
2. Infection: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and a history of osteomyelitis in the left lower extremity. There is a possibility of ongoing infection, and further investigations are needed to identify the causative organism.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent an emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. She also had a fasciotomy performed due to compartment syndrome in her right lower extremity.

Since admission, the patient has been experiencing various medical complications. These include hypotension, acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hepatic insufficiency. The patient's white blood cell count has been trending upwards, indicating a possible infectious etiology. She has active osteomyelitis and infection of her soft tissue in the left lower extremity. Neurological issues include bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, which may be secondary to critical illness neuropathy or ICU myopathy. Respiratory concerns include maintaining oxygen saturation on a tracheostomy while weaning off high-flow oxygen. 

The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and has been on aggressive continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to elevated potassium levels. She has also been treated with antibiotics, antifungals, and anticoagulants. The patient's liver function tests have improved significantly since hospitalization, but she continues to have elevated lactate levels."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, who presented with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent a fasciotomy for right lower extremity compartment syndrome and has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/52 mmHg to 78/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, elevated white blood cell count indicating possible infection, neurologic deficits suggestive of critical illness neuropathy or superimposed anterior horn cell involvement, respiratory issues with intermittent need for supplemental oxygen, and anemia and thrombocytopenia likely due to blood loss and dilutional effects.

The patient also has a history of osteomyelitis and soft tissue infection in the lower left extremity, for which she is receiving treatment with fluconazole and may require further debridement. The patient's liver function tests are markedly elevated but have trended down since hospitalization. The patient is currently weaned off pressors and is maintaining her blood pressure with midodrine.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mrs [**Known lastname 9276**] is more awake and alert today. She mounted an appropriate
   response to Cortisol stim test makinghypoadrenalism a less likely cause
   of ther hypotension. Her SBP has remaned in the 100-130 mm Hg range off
   CVVHD and we have started Midodrine [**Hospital1 **] on the evening before and the
   morning of dialysis. She has a positive fluid balance of 1.2 L per 24
   hours which we feel is the cause for her improved BPs. Her WBC ct
   continues to rise from 10 - 12.2K today. This, along with a significant
   rise in BS,makes us think that there is an early underlying lthough her
   temp curve is not impressive. We will culture with temp spikes and
   continue Fluconazole for fungal osteo of the LLE. She is off bactim
   today. CXR is unremarkable for source of infection. Her lack of
   movement in both lower exts makes us think this is a result of her
   critical illness as well as her prolonged ICU course (>40 days). She
   does make an effore to move the muscles of the LEs but does not have
   the strength to move.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock, and subsequent development of right lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy. She has been in the ICU for over 40 days and has had several medical complications during her hospital course.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension initially thought to be due to hypovolemic blood loss from the OR, complicated by anesthetic agents; also component of fluid reduction from HD. Midodrine was started to maintain SBP in the 90s-110s range.

2. Infection: The patient's WBC count has been increasing, and sputum culture showed growth of GNR. She is also colonized with Klebsiella. Fungal infection in the leg/osteomyelitis is suspected, and fluconazole has been continued for extended treatment.

3. Neurological issues: The patient has b/l lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, which is likely secondary to ICU myopathy. EMG study suggests critical illness neuropathy with possible superimposed anterior [Doctor Last Name] cell involvement.

4. Respiratory issues: The patient is currently maintaining saturations on 35%FiO2 on trach mask and intermittently on room air. Sputum gram stain with 2+ GNR"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint and 24-hour events are not specified in the note. 

From the assessment and plan section, the patient is at risk for aspiration due to an inability to protect their airway. They also have impaired activity tolerance, balance, integumentary integrity, knowledge, muscle performance, motor function, range of motion, respiration/gas exchange, transfers, fever, hypernatremia, ineffective coping, diabetes mellitus type I, atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleed, other shock, respiratory failure, acute impaired skin integrity, cardiogenic shock, renal failure, acute pain control, and myocardial infarction.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 111/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy.

The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased hematocrit, creatinine, and potassium levels. The glucose levels are fluctuating. Other lab results indicate elevated troponin-T, CK-MB, D-dimer, lactate, LDH, and liver enzymes.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including midodrine, hemodialysis (HD), echocardiogram, blood cultures, urine culture, and antibiotics. The patient's weight has decreased from 92 kg at admission to 74.3 kg currently.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, worsening of cardiogenic shock, progression of respiratory failure, development of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection, and potential bleeding events due to gastrointestinal bleed or use of anticoagulants. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery and distal left anterior descending artery. The patient also developed right lower extremity compartment syndrome, which required fasciotomy.

She has had multiple complications including hypotension requiring vasopressor support, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD), and an infection in her leg wound. The wound culture grew fungus sensitive to fluconazole. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal therapy.

Her current medications include midodrine for blood pressure control, ranitidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis, ASA, Plavix, statin for hyperlipidemia, and Lantus for diabetes.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated liver enzymes and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration, likely due to ongoing blood loss from the leg wound. Her renal function is improving with ongoing hemodialysis.

The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, surgical incisions, and bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation. Her vital signs are stable, and she is maintaining oxygen saturation on 35% FiO2.

The patient's medical team is considering weaning her off the tracheostomy tube, attempting another session of"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9276**] looked very alert, conversant and awake this am. She reports
   no chest pain or shortness of breath. She underwent hemodyalysis
   yesterday with unclear amount of ultrafiltration (one source says 350cc
   and one says >1L) with ensuing hypotension. For this we intend to use
   Midodrine and Fluorinef to maintain BP on dialysis days. She remains
   afebrile. She is on Plavix 150 mg for thrombocytosis in the setting of
   a LM stent. We will ask neuro to assess her ongoing inability to move
   either lower extremity. She was fully awake today and was able to give
   full effort but was still unable to move her legs - or even move her
   toes. This is pertinent because if there is a spinal cord infarction
   and the chances of ever walking again are very low she may benefit from
   left BKA or AKA given the substantial muscle loss as well as the
   underlying fungal osteomyelitis. We will discuss this with her family
   after speaking to neuro.
   I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 980**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent an emergent LAD wrap-around PCI and was initially treated with IABP and pressors. The patient developed right lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy. She also experienced hypotension, which was initially attributed to blood loss and fluid reduction during hemodialysis (HD), but other causes such as sepsis and vasodilatory shock were considered. The patient's renal function deteriorated, leading to acute renal failure (ARF) requiring HD. She developed anemia and thrombocytopenia due to blood loss from the open fasciotomy and dilutional effects of IV repletion. The patient was found to have a yeast infection in her urine culture and a fungal osteomyelitis in her leg, for which she was started on fluconazole. She also had an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate worsening of the fungal infection or another source of infection. The patient's respiratory status improved with the use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and tracheostomy. She developed critical illness myopathy and neuropathy, which is likely contributing to her bilateral lower extremity weakness. The patient's liver function tests were elevated, possibly due to rhabdomyolysis and shock liver, but have since improved"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-inch tall, 74.3 kg individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical problems, including diabetes mellitus type I, atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleed, shock, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, cardiac shock, acute renal failure, and acute myocardial infarction. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/40 mmHg to 137/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. The patient has had several interventions including repletion of phosphate, continuous insulin infusion, hemodialysis, midodrine, placement of wound vac on both wounds, and restart of prior insulin regimen. The patient also had an episode of agitation and pulled out the PICC line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's current respiratory failure may lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of yeast in the urine and impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infection or wound infection.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation, cardiac shock, and acute myocardial infarction"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. 

The patient's hospital course has been complicated by several medical complications. She developed right lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy and has had ongoing issues with hypotension, which initially was thought to be due to hypovolemic blood loss from the surgery, but now appears to be septic physiology. She was started on midodrine with some improvement in blood pressure. 

She also has an increased white blood cell count and difficulty maintaining blood pressure, and her sputum culture grew gram-negative rods. She is being treated for suspected Klebsiella pneumonia with appropriate antibiotics. 

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. She has received blood transfusions and factor repletion, but continues to lose blood through her leg. 

She has had elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia, which have improved with factor repletion and blood transfusions. 

The patient's respiratory status has been stable on a tracheostomy with intermittent use of room air. 

She is currently on wound vacuum therapy for her necrotic wounds, which are colonized with fungus."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The hospital course was complicated by the development of right lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy. The patient also experienced hypotension, infection (sputum culture growing GNR), respiratory distress, acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. She underwent an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and later developed compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity, necessitating fasciotomy and removal of IABP. The patient's necrotic wound showed growth of Candida species sensitive to fluconazole, and she required prolonged treatment. She had elevated liver function tests due to shock liver and rhabdomyolysis but has shown improvement. The patient had an acute inferior STEMI in the distal left anterior descending artery territory and underwent placement of a bare metal stent to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. She was initially in cardiogenic shock but improved with medication. The patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled without the need for additional antihypertensive agents. She has been on statin therapy for hyperlipidemia. The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and she is receiving enteral nutrition. Her glycemic control is being"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She required fasciotomy for right lower extremity compartment syndrome. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which has been difficult to manage despite fluid resuscitation and the use of vasopressors. She has a known fungal osteomyelitis and is currently on fluconazole. The patient also has respiratory issues, requiring tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. She has renal failure requiring hemodialysis and has had blood product transfusions. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and creatinine levels. The patient has had various infections, including yeast in the urine and sputum, as well as colonization with Klebsiella. She has been on multiple medications, including anticoagulants, antibiotics, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of fungal osteomyelitis and is currently on fluconazole. She also has yeast in the urine and sputum. There is a risk of worsening infection or development of new infections due to her immunocompromised state and indwelling lines.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and the use of vasopressors. This may indicate sepsis or another underlying cause"

   57 yo F c HTN, DM, HLP p/w acute inferior STEMI, cardiogenic shock.
   Hospital course complicated by development of right lower extremity
   compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy
   # hypotension: Initially thought to be due to hypovolemic blood loss
   from OR, complicated by anesthetic agents; also component of fluid
   reduction from HD.  Persistent problems with hypotension suggest
   alternative etiology, Echo with normal EF and cortisol stim test wnl.
   Sepsis may be contributing to hypotension although only clear source
   fungal osteomyelitis.  Pt started on midodrine [**2185-12-6**]
 SBP 90s-110s
   during HD
   - cont midodrine 10mg TID on HD days
   - hold metoprolol on HD days
   # ID: Pt with increasing WBC count and difficulty maintaining pressure
 started on Midodrine [**2185-12-6**] during HD. Sputum Cx with GNR likely
   from pseudomonas colonization. UCx with yeast,  BCx pending. Pt has
   been afebrile. Could be worsening of fungal infection in leg, though
   plastics team does not believe leg is infected as it has good
   granulation tissue.

   # Neuro: b/l lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, MR
   negative for spinal infarct. RLE with some movement today. Weakness
   likely secondary to ICU myopathy.  EMG study suggests critical illness
   neuropathy with possible superimposed anterior [**Doctor Last Name **] cell involvement.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 34**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
   Medical Decision Making
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 9276**] continues to improve. Feeding tube is clogged so we will ask
   GI to place a PEG or we will replace the Dobhoff tube. BPs are much
   better on Midodrine. Plastics states they plan no further debridement
   of the LLE and feel there is no osteo. We will get an MRI or bone scan
   to eval for osteo as she will need long term Bactim if present. Neuro
   deficit still present in both LEs.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and previous acute inferior STEMI who developed cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent fasciotomy due to right lower extremity compartment syndrome and had an open fasciotomy. 

The patient's medical complications include hypotension, renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD), respiratory issues with sputum culture positive for GNR likely from pseudomonas colonization, anemia and thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs) with a possible bone source relating to osteomyelitis. 

The patient's current medications include metoprolol, midodrine, fluconazole, ranitidine, epo, iron/vitamin C, ASA, Plavix, statin, reglan, fentanyl patch, senna/colace, lactulose prn, and heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

The patient's disposition is currently in the CCU, with plans for rehabilitation pending."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient had an acute inferior STEMI and required cardiogenic shock management.
- They also developed right lower extremity compartment syndrome, which required a fasciotomy.
- The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to manage, with suspected causes including sepsis, hypovolemia, and the use of anesthetic agents.
- The patient's white blood cell count has been increasing, and they have difficulty maintaining pressure. They were started on midodrine during hemodialysis (HD) sessions.
- The patient's sputum culture showed growth of GNR likely from pseudomonas colonization. They are currently being treated with fluconazole and have a pending blood culture.
- The patient has b/l lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, with a negative MRI for spinal infarct. An EMG study suggests critical illness neuropathy with possible superimposed anterior spinal artery infarct involvement.
- The patient's respiratory status has been stable on 35% FiO2 on tracheostomy mask and intermittently on room air. They have completed an 8-day course of Bactrim, and their CXR shows clear lung parenchyma.

1. Hypotension: The patient has persistent problems with hypotension, which could be due to sepsis, an alternative etiology, or the effects of anesthesia and fluid reduction during hemodialysis.

2. Infection: The patient has a sputum culture growing GNR likely from pseudomonas colonization, and there is a possibility of worsening fungal infection in the leg. There is also an ongoing concern about osteomyelitis, especially since the wound is not infected according to the plastics team.

3. Neurologic Deficits: The patient has bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, with an EMG study suggesting critical illness neuropathy. There is suspicion of an anterior spinal artery infarct, but this needs to be confirmed over the next 3-4 weeks.

4. Respiratory Issues: The patient is currently maintaining saturations on 35% FiO2 on tracheostomy mask and intermittently on room air. There is a concern about"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. During her hospital course, she developed right lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy, sepsis, bilateral lower extremity weakness, loss of sensation, and difficulty maintaining blood pressure. She also had renal failure requiring hemodialysis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, necrotic wound with fungal infection, and elevated liver function tests. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to LMCA and LAD, was on pressors, and had a temporary pacemaker. Currently, she is off pressors, in sinus rhythm, and responsive to beta-blockers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has had persistent problems with hypotension, which could be due to sepsis, an alternative etiology, or fluid reduction from hemodialysis.
2. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of sepsis, as indicated by the increasing white blood cell count and difficulty maintaining blood pressure. The source of infection is unclear, but there is a possibility of fungal osteomyelitis in the leg.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function has been compromised, leading to the need for hemodialysis. It is essential to monitor kidney function and adjust medication dosages accordingly"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 34**] and [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Stable BPs on HD after transfusion on 1 u PRBC. On SSI with very labile
   blood sugars. BP is 88/35-116/66 and she receives Midodrine on HD days.
   Plastics has essentially said they do not intend on doing further
   debridement of the LLE. Wound vac in place. x-ray for ?osteo of the LLE
   is pending final read. Still no meaningful recovery of the movement in
   her LEs. Plan is to rehab early next week for ongoing care of the LE
   and trach wean. She will likely need long term HD at this point.
   I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by several medical complications, including:

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced persistent hypotension despite initial management strategies. This was initially attributed to hypovolemic blood loss from surgery, but other causes such as sepsis and the use of anesthetic agents were also considered. An echocardiogram showed a normal ejection fraction, and a cortisol stimulation test was within normal limits. The patient was started on midodrine during hemodialysis sessions to maintain blood pressure in the 90s-110s range.

2. Neurological weakness: The patient developed bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, which was initially thought to be due to spinal infarct. However, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not confirm this diagnosis. An electromyography (EMG) study suggested critical illness neuropathy with possible superimposed anterior horn cell involvement. The neurology team suspects an anterior spinal artery infarct, and the patient will be monitored for improvement over the next 3-4 weeks.

3. Respiratory issues: The patient required tracheal intubation and has been maintaining saturations on 35% FiO2 on the tracheal mask and intermittently on room air."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent a fasciotomy for right lower extremity compartment syndrome and had an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) inserted, which was later removed. The patient also had a leg wound infected with fungus, treated with fluconazole, and underwent debridement.

The patient's current issues include hypotension, possibly due to sepsis, as well as bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, initially suspected to be from an anterior spinal artery infarct but now thought to be critical illness neuropathy with possible superimposed anterior horn cell involvement. She is maintaining oxygen saturation on a tracheostomy mask and has clear lung parenchyma on chest X-ray. The patient requires hemodialysis (HD) for renal failure and has received blood transfusions. She has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) likely due to rhabdomyolysis and liver dysfunction.

The patient's medical team is considering options for discharge to a cardiac rehabilitation program. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent hypotension could indicate sepsis, especially considering the presence of a fungal infection in her leg wound. Monitoring vital signs and laboratory parameters, such as white blood cell count, will be important for"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 34**] and [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Stable BPs on HD after transfusion on 1 u PRBC. On SSI with very labile
   blood sugars. BP is 88/35-116/66 and she receives Midodrine on HD days.
   Plastics has essentially said they do not intend on doing further
   debridement of the LLE. Wound vac in place. x-ray for ?osteo of the LLE
   is pending final read. Still no meaningful recovery of the movement in
   her LEs. Plan is to rehab early next week for ongoing care of the LE
   and trach wean. She will likely need long term HD at this point.
   I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent an emergent coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) to LMCA and LAD. She developed right lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy and has been on hemodialysis (HD) due to renal failure.

The patient's medical complications include hypotension that initially thought to be due to hypovolemic blood loss from the OR, complicated by anesthetic agents and fluid reduction from HD. Persistent problems with hypotension suggest alternative etiology, and an echocardiogram with normal ejection fraction and cortisol stimulation test were within normal limits. Sepsis may be contributing to hypotension, although only a clear source of fungal osteomyelitis is present.

The patient also has neurologic issues including bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, negative for spinal infarct. The weakness is likely secondary to ICU myopathy. An EMG study suggests critical illness neuropathy with possible superimposed anterior horn cell involvement. The neurology team suspects an anterior spinal artery infarct despite a negative MRI, and will need to watch for improvement over the course of the next 3-4 weeks.

Respiratory support is being provided with a tracheostomy and intermittent use of 35% FiO2 on the tracheal mask. The sputum culture showed Stenotrophomonas, a Gram-negative rod, but no signs of pneumonia. The patient has an early anemia and thrombocytopenia likely due to blood loss from the open fasciotomy, dilution from large volume IV repletion, and GI bleed. The patient has received transfusions of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate through the hospital course. The coagulopathy was likely hepatic insufficiency given the improvement of coags and plts/HCT with factor repletion.

In terms of compartment syndrome, the patient likely developed it after the fasciotomy. The IABP was used, but the patient developed compartment syndrome in the lower extremities. The IABP is now removed, and the patient underwent lower extremity fasciotomy. The medial wound is currently on wound vac, while the lateral wound is wet to dry. The wound debridement with culture growing Candida species sensitive to fluconazole was performed. The patient's white blood cell count is stable, and she has been afebrile for several days.

The patient's other conditions include diabetic ketoacidosis, elevated liver function tests likely due to shock liver and rhabdo, and an acute inferior STEMI in the distal LAD wrap-around territory. The patient underwent BMS placement in the LMCA and LAD. Beta-blockers were held until more hemodynamically stable. The patient initially had poor cardiac output with a cardi"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient developed right lower extremity compartment syndrome, which required fasciotomy. She also experienced hypotension, which was initially attributed to hypovolemia from blood loss during surgery and the use of anesthetic agents. However, persistent hypotension suggested alternative causes, such as sepsis or midodrine intolerance. The patient was started on midodrine, and her blood pressure improved to the 90s-110s during hemodialysis (HD) sessions. Neurological symptoms of bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation were evaluated, and an electromyography (EMG) study suggested critical illness neuropathy with possible superimposed anterior horn cell involvement. The patient's respiratory status has been maintained on 35% FiO2 on the tracheostomy mask and intermittently on room air. Sputum cultures showed Stenotrophomonas, and the patient completed an 8-day course of Bactrim. Renal replacement therapy was initiated due to renal failure requiring HD. The patient received transfusions of packed red blood cells (pRBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP"

- The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.
- She presented with acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock.
- The hospital course was complicated by the development of right lower extremity compartment syndrome, requiring fasciotomy.
- The patient experienced hypotension, which was initially attributed to hypovolemic blood loss from surgery and fluid reduction during hemodialysis.
- Persistent hypotension suggests alternative etiologies, including sepsis and midodrine therapy.
- Neurological weakness and loss of sensation in both lower extremities were observed, with EMG suggesting critical illness neuropathy and possible superimposed anterior horn cell involvement.
- Respiratory issues included maintaining oxygen saturation on 35% FiO2 on tracheal mask and intermittently on room air.
- Renal failure required hemodialysis (starting on 11/19) by tunneled line, with anemia and thrombocytopenia due to blood loss from open fasciotomy and dilution from large volume IV repletion.
- The patient had elevated liver function tests, likely due to shock liver and rhabdomyolysis.
- The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement to the left main coronary artery and"

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. However, there are several important events that occurred within the past 24 hours. Renal requested discontinuation of neutrophil, iron, and sodium bicarbonate. The patient was given two doses of D50, with blood glucose levels measured at 186 mg/dL from the peripheral catheter (PICC) and 33 from the femoral site. A leg X-ray showed no bony abnormalities.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was not specified. The patient is currently receiving ranitidine for prophylaxis and dextrose 50% through the PICC line.

The review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except as noted below. The flowsheet data shows vital signs such as temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's weight has decreased from 92 kg at admission to 74.3 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1665 mL, including 276 mL of IV fluids, 460 mL of oral intake, 905 mL of tube feeds, and 100 mL of IV fluids. The total output includes 133 mL of blood products, 8 mL of urine, and 125 mL of drainage. The overall fluid balance is 1532 mL positive.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 29-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, hypernatremia, impaired skin integrity, and possible cardiac shock. 

The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and has multiple IV lines in place for medication and fluid administration. The patient's blood glucose levels are fluctuating, with some readings being within normal range while others are significantly elevated. 

The patient's vital signs indicate hypothermia, with a current temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), and tachycardia with a heart rate of 93 bpm. Blood pressure is within normal limits, but the respiratory rate is slightly elevated. Oxygen saturation is at 100% through a tracheostomy.

The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. There are also abnormalities in liver function tests and electrolyte imbalances, particularly low potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals absent peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities, and the neurologic examination is incomplete due to the patient's unresponsive state.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of the aforementioned medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of renal failure, further electrolyte im"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   BP has remained stable on Midodrine nite before and day of dialysis.
   X-ray of LLE shows no osteo so we will consult ID for their recs on
   length of Fluconazole therapy. Will adjust lanus for intermittent low
   BS to 30. CAD stable on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] , and metoprolol.
   I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **], Sack.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent an emergent fasciotomy for right lower extremity compartment syndrome and subsequently developed necrotic wounds in both lower extremities.

The patient's medical course has been complicated by several issues. Firstly, she experienced persistent hypotension that could not be explained by blood loss or anesthetic agents, leading to the consideration of alternative etiologies. The patient was started on midodrine to maintain blood pressure during hemodialysis sessions.

Secondly, the patient exhibited bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, which was initially thought to be due to ICU myopathy. However, an EMG study suggested critical illness neuropathy with possible superimposed anterior horn cell involvement. The neurology team suspects an anterior spinal artery infarct, but this is still under investigation.

Thirdly, the patient had persistent respiratory issues, including stenotrophomonas infection that was treated with Bactrim. The patient is currently maintaining saturations on 35%FiO2 on a tracheostomy mask and intermittently on room air.

Fourthly, the patient required hemodialysis due to renal failure requiring ongoing maintenance therapy. The patient also received transfusions of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets throughout her hospital course. Her co"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient's hospital course has been complicated by several issues, including hypotension, renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD), neurologic deficits consistent with critical illness neuropathy and possible anterior spinal artery infarct, respiratory infection treated with Bactrim, compartment syndrome of the right lower extremity requiring fasciotomy, and necrotic wounds in both lower extremities treated with debridement and wound vacs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced persistent problems with hypotension, initially thought to be due to hypovolemic blood loss from surgery and anesthetic agents, but later suggested to have an alternative etiology. The patient was started on midodrine and has been maintained on it during HD days to maintain blood pressure.
2. Renal Failure: The patient developed renal failure requiring HD, which is ongoing. Renal dosing of medications is being done, and the patient will continue to have follow-up renal recommendations.
3. Neurologic Deficits: The patient has shown weakness and loss of sensation in both lower extremities, likely secondary to ICU myopathy"

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 980**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Blood sugars remain very labile. We have decreased Lantus to 30 u QD
   and will cont SSI. We are awaiting ID final recs regarding the need for
   long term use of Fluconazole.Respiratory and renal status are stable.
   We will discuss with GI PEG placement in anticipation of rehab soon.
   I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 980**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent a fasciotomy for right lower extremity compartment syndrome and has had multiple transfusions. The patient's condition has been complicated by persistent hypoglycemia, clogged NGT, xanthomonas pneumonia, renal failure requiring hemodialysis, and necrotic wounds with bilateral wound vacs. She has also experienced elevated liver function tests, acute inferior STEMI in distal LAD wrap-around territory, and apical dyskinesis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels remain very labile, and measures have been taken to adjust insulin doses and monitor glucose levels closely.
2. Clogged NGT: The nasogastric tube has been a persistent issue, causing intermittent feeding difficulties. Efforts have been made to restart TF (total parenteral nutrition) and use a PEG tube once albumin levels are above 2.5.
3. Xanthomonas pneumonia: Although the patient has completed an 8-day treatment for xanthomonas pneumonia, there is a concern for colonization over true infection. Continued monitoring and follow-up with ID recs are necessary.
4. Renal failure: The patient requires ongoing hemodialysis due to renal failure. Renal dosing of medications and close"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent an emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient was initially in cardiogenic shock with poor cardiac output, but improved with the use of vasopressors.

The patient also developed right lower extremity compartment syndrome, which required fasciotomy. She experienced persistent hypotension, which was initially thought to be due to hypovolemic blood loss from surgery and the effects of anesthetic agents. Fluid reduction from hemodialysis (HD) was also a contributing factor. However, alternative causes for the persistent hypotension were considered, including adrenal insufficiency, sepsis, and vasodilatory shock. The patient underwent an echocardiogram with normal ejection fraction (EF) and cortisol stimulation test, ruling out adrenal insufficiency. There was no evidence of sepsis. Midodrine was started, and the patient's blood pressure stabilized in the 90s-110s during HD.

The patient also presented with bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, which were initially attributed to critical illness myopathy. However, an electromyography (EMG) study suggested critical illness neuropathy with"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 980**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Blood sugars remain very labile. We have decreased Lantus to 30 u QD
   and will cont SSI. We are awaiting ID final recs regarding the need for
   long term use of Fluconazole.Respiratory and renal status are stable.
   We will discuss with GI PEG placement in anticipation of rehab soon.
   I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 980**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent an emergent coronary intervention with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient also had fasciotomy for right lower extremity compartment syndrome and debridement of necrotic wounds with bilateral wound vacs.

The patient's current medical conditions include persistent hypoglycemia, renal failure requiring hemodialysis, respiratory issues, and elevated liver function tests. She is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis and osteomyelitis.

The plan moving forward includes reducing insulin dosage, changing to a six-hourly schedule for finger sticks, and consulting with an endocrinologist for insulin management. The patient will continue to receive midodrine on hemodialysis days to maintain blood pressure and will be followed up with renal recommendations. Her renal failure will be managed with ongoing hemodialysis, and she will be monitored for anemia and thrombocytopenia.

The respiratory issues will be addressed by maintaining oxygen saturation above 93% and continuing tracheostomy care. The patient's elevated liver function tests are likely due to shock liver and rhabdomyolysis, which have shown improvement since hospitalization. Ongoing monitoring and follow-up with liver function tests are recommended.

Cardiac management includes continuing aspirin"

   Medical Decision Making
   Patient is awake alert and conversive today. She has no complaints.
   Beta blockers are on hold the night before HD and day of HD and she
   continues to get Midodrine for BP support during HD. ID has recommended
   a 30 day course of Fluconazole to treat fungal infection of the LLE.
   She has been accepted to rehab today for PT and ongoing care of the LLE
   wound. We will set her up with the wound clinic as an outpatient. She
   will need CBC and LFTs at rehab on Fluconazole.
   I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 980**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery and the left anterior descending artery. The patient also developed right lower extremity compartment syndrome, which required fasciotomy. She has been on hemodialysis (HD) since November 19th and continues to require ongoing renal support.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Her blood glucose levels have been variable, ranging from 78 to 274 mg/dL. Other lab abnormalities include elevated liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and troponin-T, as well as low magnesium and potassium levels. Imaging studies reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis in the affected leg, but there is a coiled Dobhoff catheter in the stomach.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension during HD: The patient will continue to receive midodrine 10 mg three times daily on HD days and her beta-blocker medication will be held on HD days and the night prior to HD.
2. Neurological follow-up: The patient will be followed up by neurology in one month.
3. Respiratory support: The patient will continue to be on a tracheostomy"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 980**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient is awake alert and conversive today. She has no complaints.
   Beta blockers are on hold the night before HD and day of HD and she
   continues to get Midodrine for BP support during HD. ID has recommended
   a 30 day course of Fluconazole to treat fungal infection of the LLE.
   She has been accepted to rehab today for PT and ongoing care of the LLE
   wound. We will set her up with the wound clinic as an outpatient. She
   will need CBC and LFTs at rehab on Fluconazole.
   I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 980**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), resulting in cardiogenic shock. She required hemodialysis (HD) and developed right lower extremity compartment syndrome, which necessitated fasciotomy. The patient also had necrotic wounds in the lower extremities, treated with wound vacs, and was found to have a fungal infection in the wounds, for which she was prescribed a 30-day course of fluconazole.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute inferior STEMI with cardiogenic shock.
2. Right lower extremity compartment syndrome.
3. Necrotic wounds in the lower extremities.
4. Fungal infection in the wounds.
5. Renal failure requiring hemodialysis.
6. Hypotension during hemodialysis.
7. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) likely due to rhabdomyolysis and shock liver.
8. Persistent hyperglycemia despite insulin therapy.
9. Potential for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

Plan:
1. Continue treatment for acute inferior STEMI with aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, and beta-blockers.
2. Monitor blood pressure closely during hemodialysis and administer midodrine as needed.
3. Complete the 30-day course of fluconazole for fungal infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by the development of right lower extremity compartment syndrome, which required a fasciotomy. She also experienced hypotension during hemodialysis sessions and required midodrine to maintain blood pressure. The patient has been on a tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation since [**12-6**] due to xanthomonas pneumonia, but no further treatment was given as she showed no symptoms. Her renal function has been requiring hemodialysis since [**11-19**] through a tunneled line, with sessions on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The patient received transfusions of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate during her hospital stay. She was diagnosed with compartment syndrome and underwent fasciotomy. Her necrotic wounds were debrided extensively, and no longer appear infected. The patient is currently on bilateral wound vacs.

The patient's diabetes management includes reducing glargine to 12 units daily and decreasing RISS. Her liver function tests were markedly elevated but have significantly downtrended since hospitalization, now only increased alkaline phosphatase likely due to bone source relating to osteomyelitis.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 980**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient is awake alert and conversive today. She has no complaints.
   Beta blockers are on hold the night before HD and day of HD and she
   continues to get Midodrine for BP support during HD. ID has recommended
   a 30 day course of Fluconazole to treat fungal infection of the LLE.
   She has been accepted to rehab today for PT and ongoing care of the LLE
   wound. We will set her up with the wound clinic as an outpatient. She
   will need CBC and LFTs at rehab on Fluconazole.
   I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 980**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an acute inferior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The hospital course was complicated by the development of right lower extremity compartment syndrome, requiring fasciotomy. The patient also had hypotension during hemodialysis (HD), leading to the initiation of midodrine 10 mg TID on HD days and holding metoprolol on HD days and night prior to HD. Other medical conditions include renal failure requiring HD, colonization over pneumonia, necrotic wounds in the lower extremities treated with debridement and wound vacs, elevated liver function tests likely due to shock liver and rhabdomyolysis, and previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension during HD: The patient may continue to experience hypotension during hemodialysis, necessitating the use of midodrine and adjustments in antihypertensive medications such as metoprolol.
2. Fungal infection: The patient has a fungal infection in the lower extremities, which requires a prolonged course of fluconazole. Monitoring for any signs of treatment failure or drug toxicity is important.
3. Wound care: The patient's necrotic wounds need regular monitoring and maintenance of wound care. Complications such as wound infection"
