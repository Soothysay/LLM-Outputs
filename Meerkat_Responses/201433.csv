   Imaging: CXR [**2131-7-20**]: Tracheostomy tip is at the midline, approximately
   8.5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm
   with its tip below the field of view most likely in the stomach. There
   is right lower lobe atelectasis that is slightly worse than on the
   prior study. The left basal opacity is patchy in appearance and might
   represent either area of atelectasis or infection, the
   differentiation based on this radiograph cannot be done but the finding
   is more significant than on the prior radiograph. There is no
   appreciablepulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusion,
   if present, is difficult to detect on the current supine radiograph in
   the presence of atelectasis at the right lung base.
   CT Head [**2131-7-20**]: No hemorrhage, mass, or fracture. Atrophy likely
   secondary to global anoxic brain injury. Would recommend MRI.
   MRI Head [**2131-7-20**]: There is no significant interval change compared to
   MRI [**2131-7-16**]. There is diffuse volume loss for age with prominence
   of ventricles and sulci. No significant change in ventricular size has
   occurred. There is no significant hyperintensity in the cortical region
   bilaterally as before. There
   is no evidence for acute ischemia. There is stable increased signal
   within the pons and mid brain. There is mildly increased signal in the
   basal ganglia,
   which could also be related to osmotic demyelination.
   Left Lower Extremity Ultrasound [**2131-7-20**]: No DVT in the left leg.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old man with a complicated hospital course, readmitted for seizures, c/o SMV thrombus, UTI, and increasing WBC/lipase levels. He was transferred to the MICU after experiencing a PEA arrest, most likely related to mucous plugging and associated hypoxia. Post-arrest, he had copious secretions, and bronchoscopy showed edematous airways with cultures pending. His CXR also showed a new infiltrate in the right lower lobe, which could indicate pneumonia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder, Other: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance, including hypercalcemia, which is likely secondary to bone turnover. He is being treated with calcitonin and will have his electrolytes monitored.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a significant improvement over the past 24 hours. He has positive blood cultures from the code with gram-positive cocci in clusters, speciation pending. He also has an exam concerning for new pneumonia.
3. Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures: The patient's neurological exam is worsening since the arrest. He is receiving standing ativan and keppra with plans for an EEG today.
4. Hypertension: The patient was significantly hypertensive during the code setting but now has low systolic blood pressure. He will be monitored on telemetry and given hydralazine as"

   Imaging: CXR [**2131-7-20**]: Tracheostomy tip is at the midline, approximately
   8.5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm
   with its tip below the field of view most likely in the stomach. There
   is right lower lobe atelectasis that is slightly worse than on the
   prior study. The left basal opacity is patchy in appearance and might
   represent either area of atelectasis or infection, the
   differentiation based on this radiograph cannot be done but the finding
   is more significant than on the prior radiograph. There is no
   appreciablepulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusion,
   if present, is difficult to detect on the current supine radiograph in
   the presence of atelectasis at the right lung base.
   CT Head [**2131-7-20**]: No hemorrhage, mass, or fracture. Atrophy likely
   secondary to global anoxic brain injury. Would recommend MRI.
   MRI Head [**2131-7-20**]: There is no significant interval change compared to
   MRI [**2131-7-16**]. There is diffuse volume loss for age with prominence
   of ventricles and sulci. No significant change in ventricular size has
   occurred. There is no significant hyperintensity in the cortical region
   bilaterally as before. There
   is no evidence for acute ischemia. There is stable increased signal

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent hospital admission for seizures, celiac disease, UTI, and increasing white blood cell count. He was readmitted to the MICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on the floor. The arrest was likely related to mucous plugging and associated hypoxia. Post-arrest, he had copious secretions, and a bronchoscopy was performed with edematous airways, cultures pending. His chest X-ray (CXR) showed a new infiltrate in the right lower lobe (RLL), which may indicate pneumonia.

The patient is currently being treated for various medical conditions, including anoxic brain injury, seizures, hypertension, hypotension, hypercalcemia, fever of unknown origin, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and altered mental status. He is also being monitored for possible complications such as DIC, DVT, pancreatitis, UTI, and C. difficile infection.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum calcium. His blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters. The sputum culture shows gram-negative rods, while the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture is positive for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on the floor. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by several factors, including seizures, a small bowel thrombus, urinary tract infection (UTI), and increasing white blood cell (WBC) count and lipase levels. The patient was transferred to the MICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient's neurologic exam has shown worsening since the arrest, indicating ongoing concern for anoxic brain damage.
2. Hypertension: The patient was significantly hypertensive during the code setting but is now experiencing low blood pressure in the low 100s systolic.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia during the PEA arrest and is now on a cautious sliding scale for blood glucose management.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated serum calcium levels, most likely secondary to bone turnover. Calcitonin has been started as recommended by the endocrine consult service.
5. Low-grade fever/leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with significant improvement over the past 24 hours. Blood cultures from the code showed gram-positive cocci in clusters, and speciation is pending. There is also concern for new pneumonia.
6. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection, and bactrim has been started."

   Imaging: CXR [**2131-7-20**]: Tracheostomy tip is at the midline, approximately
   8.5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm
   with its tip below the field of view most likely in the stomach. There
   is right lower lobe atelectasis that is slightly worse than on the
   prior study. The left basal opacity is patchy in appearance and might
   represent either area of atelectasis or infection, the
   differentiation based on this radiograph cannot be done but the finding
   is more significant than on the prior radiograph. There is no
   appreciablepulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusion,
   if present, is difficult to detect on the current supine radiograph in
   the presence of atelectasis at the right lung base.
   CT Head [**2131-7-20**]: No hemorrhage, mass, or fracture. Atrophy likely
   secondary to global anoxic brain injury. Would recommend MRI.
   MRI Head [**2131-7-20**]: There is no significant interval change compared to
   MRI [**2131-7-16**]. There is diffuse volume loss for age with prominence
   of ventricles and sulci. No significant change in ventricular size has
   occurred. There is no significant hyperintensity in the cortical region
   bilaterally as before. There
   is no evidence for acute ischemia. There is stable increased signal
   within the pons and mid brain. There is mildly increased signal in the
   basal ganglia,
   which could also be related to osmotic demyelination.

   .
   # PEA arrest: Unclear etiology. Mucous plugging likely given copious
   secretions, especially since he has had PEA arrest in this setting
   before. Possible presepsis in setting of pneumonia given leukocytosis
   and low grade temps. [**Month (only) 8**] have been complicated by AMS in setting of
   hypoglycemia. Seizure with unwitnessed tonic clonic movements also a
   possibility, perhaps triggered by hypoglycemia. PE less likely with
   rapid recovery and as pt on heparin gtt, although subtherapeutic.
   - CXR
   - Frequent suctioning prn
   - Broad coverage with linezolid and aztreonam for now
   - Cont bactrim for UTI and po vanc for empiric C. diff coverage for now

   - F/u Neuro and ID recs
   - D5 1/2 NS with QID FSG check
   - Cont current seizure medications, Neuro to see in AM, consider EEG
   .
   # Neuro: Concern for herniation v. progression of anoxic brain injury
   v. bleed given posturing, roving eye movements, and weak corneal reflex
   in setting of hypertension to SBP 230s. Does have seizure activity
   noted on EEG at admission typified by RUE clonus and right gaze
   deviation which he currently does not exhibit.
   - Stat head CT
   - Will likely need MRI brain
   - Increase keppra to 2000mg [**Hospital1 **], cont clonazepam 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Standing ativan 2mg po q4h
   - Maintain SBP <180
   - F/u neuro recs
   .
   # Hypertension: Baseline SBP 110s-140s, now with SBP sustained >200
   after receiving epinephrine. [**Month (only) 8**] also be related to clonic movements.
   Received hydral 10mg IV and started on nitro gtt without effect.
   Subsequently received 2 doses of ativan and hydralazine 20mg IV with
   improvement in SBP to 130.
   - Standing ativan for possible seizure
   - Hydral prn for SBP >180
    - Trend lactate
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: FSG 90s-120s over past 24 hours on stable dose of
   glargine. Likely iatrogenic [**2-5**] continuation of glargine while tube
   feeds discontinued; also no longer on D5NS.  Could be  also decreased
   in setting of infection. Much less likely are pancreatic dysfunction
   (given acute course).
   - Hold glargine for now with liberal ISS
   - D5 1/2 NS with QID FSG monitoring
   - Broad antibiotics as above
   - Trend lactate
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, ?[**2-5**] bone turnover given low PTH.
   - Aggressive IV fluids
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Holding lasix for now given fluctuating BP
   - Consider calcitonin, Endo consult
   .
   # Low grade fever/leukocytosis: Likely secondary to pneumonia given
   increased sputum production. Concern for pancreatitis or infected fluid
   collection given enlargement of fluid collection in setting of rising
   lipase although not felt to be infected per GI or surgery. Pt is C.
   diff neg x 3 but on empiric treatment. Also on treatment for UTI with
   no other positive micro to date. [**Month (only) 8**] have central etiology for fevers.
   - trend WBC, LFTs, pancreatic enzymes
   - CXR
   - panculture
   - antibiotics broadened as above for possible GI source of infection
   - consider C. diff stool cytotoxicity assay
   - cont empiric treatment for C. diff
   - repeat CT abd for interval assessment

   Imaging: CXR [**2131-7-20**]: Tracheostomy tip is at the midline, approximately
   8.5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm
   with its tip below the field of view most likely in the stomach. There
   is right lower lobe atelectasis that is slightly worse than on the
   prior study. The left basal opacity is patchy in appearance and might
   represent either area of atelectasis or infection, the
   differentiation based on this radiograph cannot be done but the finding
   is more significant than on the prior radiograph. There is no
   appreciablepulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusion,
   if present, is difficult to detect on the current supine radiograph in
   the presence of atelectasis at the right lung base.
   CT Head [**2131-7-20**]: No hemorrhage, mass, or fracture. Atrophy likely
   secondary to global anoxic brain injury. Would recommend MRI.
   MRI Head [**2131-7-20**]: There is no significant interval change compared to
   MRI [**2131-7-16**]. There is diffuse volume loss for age with prominence
   of ventricles and sulci. No significant change in ventricular size has
   occurred. There is no significant hyperintensity in the cortical region
   bilaterally as before. There
   is no evidence for acute ischemia. There is stable increased signal
   within the pons and mid brain. There is mildly increased signal in the
   basal ganglia,
   which could also be related to osmotic demyelination.
   Left Lower Extremity Ultrasound [**2131-7-20**]: No DVT in the left leg.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male who was admitted to the MICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on the floor. The patient required neosynephrine but was quickly weaned off. Neurology recommended standing ativan, MRI brain, CT head, and EEG. The preliminary read of the MRI brain is unchanged, and the CT head is also unchanged. Standing insulin has been discontinued, and the patient is now on a low-dose sliding scale. Bronchoscopy with edematous airways and mucous in the right lower lobe was performed. Clonopin has been discontinued, and heparin gtt has been discontinued pending the final read of the MRI. The patient started on linezolid, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). An ultrasound of the left lower extremity was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Blood culture results show growth of gram-positive cocci in clusters. The patient's rate has been increased on the ventilator secondary to discomfort and diaphoresis.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is currently being treated for multiple medical complications including electrolyte and fluid disorder, leukocytosis, fever of unknown origin, anoxic brain damage, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, seizure, hypertension, hypoglycemia, hypotension, and DVT"

   Assessment and Plan
   PEA arrest - ? mucus plugging and acute hypoxia.   Telemetry without
   events when occurred.  Given rapid improvement and secretions on
   bronch, seems less likely PE (now on anticoagulation for SMV
   thrombus).
   HCAP
 linezolid/aztreonam/cipro for 8 days.  WBCC dramatically
   reduced.
   UTI
 Stenotrophomonas, 7 days bactrim for complicated UTI.
   Bacteremia
 GPC, will need minimum of 14 d depending on source.
   awaiting speciation.
   C.diff
 on p.o. vanc, diagnosed based on CT findings.
   Mental status
 MS has been poor post-anoxic, but slight improvement
   this afternoon with pt squeezing hands.  EEG results pending.
   Neurology continues to follow.  CT/MRI unchanged.
   Keppra increased.   Klonopin dc
   Hypotension?
 intermittently requiring fluid resuscitation yesterday
   with concerns for either early sepsis vs recovery from PEA (acidosis).-
   now improving. Will continue to fluid resuscitate as required
   Hypercalcemia- likely [**2-5**] bone turnover. Would prefer holding further
   IVF at this time given stable BP.  Plan to d/w endocrine, re:
   pamidronate in addition to.sq calcitonin.
   Pancreatitis c/b pseudocyst
 somewhat enlarged are last CT, will need
   further consideration for definitive therapy when more stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of hepatitis and pancreatitis, presenting with pseudocyst formation. He is currently experiencing hypoxic encephalopathy and seizures. The patient has been hospitalized for a prolonged period and has had a readmission for recalcitrant seizures. He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest 36 hours ago on the medical floor. The patient's recent events include sputum culture, stool culture, bronchoscopy, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Medical Complications:
1. HCAP (Hospital-acquired pneumonia) - The patient has been prescribed linezolid, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin for 8 days due to a significant reduction in white blood cell count (WBC).
2. UTI (Urinary tract infection) - Stenotrophomonas bacteria was identified, and the patient has been given bactrim for a complicated UTI.
3. Bacteremia - Gram-positive cocci (GPC) infection is suspected, and the patient will need at least 14 days of antibiotic therapy depending on the source of infection.
4. C. difficile infection - The patient has been diagnosed based on CT findings and will receive oral vancomycin.
5. Mental status - The patient's mental status has been poor post-anoxic, but there is slight improvement observed with the patient squeezing hands. EEG results are pending, and neurology continues to follow up"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of hepatitis and pancreatitis, presenting with pseudocyst formation, hypoxic encephalopathy, and seizures. He has been readmitted to the ICU for recalcitrant seizures following a previous prolonged hospitalization. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest 36 hours ago on the medical floor. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Encephalopathy: The patient has been experiencing poor mental status and seizures, which could be attributed to hypoxic injury. 
2. Seizures: The patient has recurrent seizures, and the differential diagnosis includes further hypoxic injury, ongoing delirium, or other underlying neurological conditions.
3. Sepsis: The patient's condition suggests possible sepsis due to the presence of multiple infections, including hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci (GPC).
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels, which may be due to bone turnover. This condition requires further evaluation and management.
5. Pancreatitis and Pseudocyst: The patient has a history of pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation. Further consideration for definitive therapy is needed when the patient is more stable.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has negative lower extremity Doppler ultrasound results, ruling out DVT.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with complicated hospital course
   readmitted for seizures, c/b SMV thrombus, UTI, and increasing
   WBC/lipase, now transferred to MICU s/p PEA arrest.
   PEA arrest: Most likely related to mucous plugging and associated
   hypoxia from pneumonia given copious secretions and RLL infiltrate on
   post-arrest CXR. [**Month (only) 8**] have been exacerbated by worsened mental status
   from hypoglycemia. Bronchoscopy with edematous airways; BAL cx growing
   GNR. GPC in [**2-7**] bottles from fem line likely contaminant; line removed.
   - monitor on telemetry and continuous oxygen monitoring
   - frequent suctioning prn
   - aztrenoman and ciprofloxacin day [**3-11**] for GNR VAP
   - d/c linezolid if GPC c/w contaminant on final bcx
   - cont bactrim for UTI
   - off po vanc as no evidence for C diff although cytotoxicity assay
   still pending
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - closely monitor finger sticks
   - cont standing ativan and keppra while EEG pending
   Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures:  Neurologic exam worsening since arrest.
   Initially concerned for herniation but CT head and MRI showed no
   significant progression since prior studies.  Given right gaze
   preference and hyperreflexia on the right there is continued concern
   for seizures.  He is receiving standing ativan and keppra pending EEG
   results.
   - cont keppra [**2122**] mg [**Hospital1 **] IV
   - cont standing ativan 2 mg q4h IV
   - maintain SBP < 180
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u neuron recs
   Hypertension: Patient was significantly hypertensive in the setting of
   receiving epinephrine in the code setting as well as pronounced clonus,
   ?seizure activity. Now normotensive.
   - Cont keppra with standing ativan for now
   - Hydral prn for SBP >180
   Hypoglycemia:  During PEA arrest, patient was noted to have a blood
   glucose in the 20s in the setting of holding tube feeds and receiving
   regular dose standing lantus.  Standing lantus now discontinued and on
   a cautious sliding scale.
   - Hold glargine for now with liberal ISS
   - QID finger sticks
   - treat infection
   - trend lactate
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover.  Labs notable for elevated serum calcium and low PTH.
   Started on calcitonin per Endo recs with normalization.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - cont calcitonin
   - if no improvement in calcium, consider increased dose calcitonin
   and/or pamidronate
   - f/u SPEP
   Low grade fever/leukocytosis: Leukocytosis with significant improvement
   over past 24 hours. Likely [**2-5**] VAP with BAL cx growing GNR.  Also with
   2 of 4 bcx growing GPC, which may represent contamination. Continuing
   tx for Sternotrophomonas UTI.  C. diff tx discontinued as assay neg x
   3; B-toxin assay pending. Pancreatitis has been of concern but his
   imaging has shown pseudocysts but not felt to be infected; LFTs and
   pancreatic enzymes now improving.
   - 8-day course aztreonam, cipro for VAP, to end on [**2131-7-28**]
   - cont linezolid pending speciation of blood cx
   - Bactrim for UTI, to end on [**2131-7-25**]
   - off vanc as C. diff neg x 3; f/u cytotoxicity assay
   - no plan for pancreatic fluid collection drainage at this time
   - trend amylase and lipase
   - follow ID recs
   - d/c femoral line today
   - consider repeat CT scan for reassessment
   GI Residuals: Concern for ileus although pt having BM
   - Consider abdominal imaging
   Diarrhea/Bowel thickening: CT showed stable bowel thickening; C diff
   was negative multiple times so stopped PO vanc per ID
   - monitor and keep hydrated
   - C. diff stool cytotoxicity assay pending
   - f/u ID, GI recs
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe pancreatitis earlier in course of
   critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  On admission patient with
   mild elevation of his transaminases. LFTs and pancreatitic enzymes now
   improving.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - currently receiving feeds via [**Last Name (LF) 1939**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to consider
   repositioning
   UTI: Bactrim sensitive Sternotrophomonas
   - continue bactrim for now although likely sensitive to aztreonam as
   well to end on [**2131-7-25**]
   SMV thrombus: Thrombus may be related to pancreatitis and inflamation
   in area. LENIs negative.  Heparin gtt held initially given concern for

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old man with a complicated hospital course, including seizures, a superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombus, urinary tract infection (UTI), and increasing white blood cell (WBC) count and lipase levels. He was readmitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was likely due to mucous plugging and associated hypoxia from pneumonia. The patient's mental status has worsened due to hypoglycemia. He has bronchoscopic findings of gram-negative rods (GNR) and gram-positive cocci (GPC) in clusters, likely contaminants from the femoral line. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and UTI. His neurological exam is concerning for seizures, and he is on anticonvulsant therapy. Other issues include hypertension, hypercalcemia, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and gastrointestinal (GI) residuals. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of GNR infection, which is commonly associated with VAP. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential to prevent further complications.
2. Seizures: The patient's neurological exam suggests ongoing seizure activity, which can be a result of anoxic brain injury. Close monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with a weight of 250cc. They have been admitted to the ICU and have a history of altered mental status, seizure, anoxic brain damage, acute respiratory failure, necrotizing pancreatitis, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension, and hypercalcemia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/63 mmHg to 107/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on continuous monitoring, multi-lumen central line, and has had blood cultures drawn from both the right arm and femoral line.

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: Given the presence of multiple organisms in the blood cultures, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction.
2. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to underlying conditions, increasing the risk of infections.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on ventilatory support, indicating acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
4. Pancreatitis: Necrotizing pancreatitis has been diagnosed, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and anoxic brain damage increase the risk of neurological complications, including potential long-term deficits.
6. Hypercalcemia: The patient's corrected calcium level is elevated, which may require further management to prevent complications such as renal dysfunction or cardiac arrhythmias.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition are sepsis, infection, respiratory failure, pancreatitis, neurological complications, and hypercalcemia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a complicated hospital course readmitted for seizures, c. diff colitis, UTI, and increasing WBC/lipase levels. He was transferred to the MICU after experiencing a PEA arrest, likely due to mucous plugging and associated hypoxia, exacerbated by hypoglycemia. Post-arrest, he had copious secretions, and bronchoscopy with edematous airways, cultures pending. His CXR also showed a new infiltrate in the right lower lobe.

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics for VAP and UTI, anticonvulsants for possible seizures, and medications for various other conditions such as hypertension, hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, and low-grade fever/leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures: The patient's neurological exam has been worsening since the arrest, and there is continued concern for seizures. He is receiving standing ativan and keppra with plans for an EEG today.
2. Hypertension: The patient was significantly hypertensive during the code setting and is now experiencing low blood pressures in the low 100s systolic.
3. Hypoglycemia: During the PEA arrest, the patient had a blood glucose in the 20s, and standing lantus has been discontinued. A cautious sliding scale is being used.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated serum calcium and low PTH, likely secondary to bone turnover. He is being treated with calcitonin and will have further evaluation.
5. Low-grade fever/leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with significant improvement over the past 24 hours. He has positive blood cultures from the code with gram-positive cocci in clusters, speciation pending. He also has an exam concerning for new pneumonia.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation. His pancreatic enzymes are being trended, and he is receiving feeds via a feeding tube.
7. UTI: The patient has a sensitive Sternotrophomonas infection, for which he is being treated with bactrim.
8. SMV thrombus: The thrombus may be related to pancreatitis and inflammation in the area. Heparin gtt was held initially due to concern for worsening neurologic exam but will be continued.
9. VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia, and measures such as HOB elevation and mouth care are being implemented.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and assessment may be required for a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition."

   regular dose standing lantus.  Standing lantus now discontinued and on
   a cautious sliding scale.
   - Hold glargine for now with liberal ISS
   - QID finger sticks
   - treat infection

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male who was readmitted to the ICU after experiencing a complicated hospital course, including seizures, a deep vein thrombosis, urinary tract infection, and increasing white blood cell count and lipase levels. The patient had a previous admission for a mucous plug-related pulmonary embolism, which led to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He was resuscitated and transferred to the MICU.

The patient's current condition includes anoxic brain injury/seizures, hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, low-grade fever/leukocytosis, rash, gastrointestinal residuals, diarrhea/bowel thickening, hypertension, pancreatitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), SMV thrombus, and non-gap metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has developed a GNR infection in the bronchoalveolar lavage culture. Antibiotics have been started for VAP.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): There is evidence of GPC infection from the femoral line, which may be a contaminant. The femoral line has been removed.
3. Drug-induced rash: The patient has developed a rash, which may be related to medication.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient has had an episode of severe pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation. Pancreatic enzymes are now"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was resuscitated. Initial assessment revealed possible mucus plugging and acute hypoxia as the cause of the arrest. However, given the rapid improvement and presence of secretions on bronchoscopies, pneumonia (PE) seems less likely, and the patient is now on anticoagulation for a superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombus.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues. He is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) with linezolid, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin for 8 days. White blood cell count has dramatically reduced, and gram-negative rods are awaiting speciation. The patient also has a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Stenotrophomonas, for which he will receive 7 days of bactrim. If urine analysis is negative, bactrim may be discontinued. Additionally, the patient has bacteremia with gram-positive cocci (GPC), awaiting source identification and minimum 14-day treatment depending on the source. Surveillance cultures will be checked to guide further antibiotic therapy.

The patient is also being treated for Clostridium difficile infection (C.diff) based on CT findings. Oral vancomycin was administered, and it was discontinued due to a negative assay."

","The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of recent admission for pancreatitis, pseudocyst, ARDS, respiratory failure, and a previous cardiac arrest on 6-11, resulting in hypoxic encephalopathy and seizures. He was readmitted for seizures on 7-9 due to a superior mesenteric vein thrombus, urinary tract infection, and increasing white blood cell count and lipase levels. He then experienced another PEA arrest on 7-19 and was transferred to the MICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with complicated hospital course
   (admitted [**5-17**] w/ pancreatitis c/b pseudocyst, ARDS and resp failure,
   w/ PEA arrest on [**6-11**], subsequent hypoxic encepholpathy and sz d/o),
   readmitted for seizures on [**7-9**] , c/b SMV thrombus, UTI, and increasing
   WBC/lipase, now transferred to MICU s/p PEA arrest on [**7-19**].
   1. HCAP
 linezolid/aztreonam/cipro for 8 days.  WBCC dramatically
   reduced.  Pseudomonas growing from BAL.  Given two separate colonies,
   seems reasonable to continue both aztreonam and cipro.
   2. Bacteremia
 GPC, will need minimum of 14 d depending on source.
   awaiting speciation.  Plan to continue linezolid x 48h after
   surveillance cx
s neg.
   3. Rash
 concerning for drug eruption.  No evidence of SJS.   Seems
   less likely anticonvulsant hypersensitivity but keppra dose was
   recently changes.  We have stopped the bactrim (after 5 days).
   4.  UTI
 Stenotrophomonas, now growing from second urine culture.
   Will need to discuss further therapy w/ ID. .
   5.  PEA arrest - ? mucus plugging and acute hypoxia.   Telemetry
   without events when occurred.  Given rapid improvement and secretions
   on bronch, seems less likely PE (now on anticoagulation for SMV
   thrombus).
   6.  Mental status
 Mild improvement follows commands, tracks.  EEG
   results pending. Neurology continues to follow.  CT/MRI unchanged.
   Keppra increased.   Klonopin dc
   7.  Hypercalcemia- likely [**2-5**] bone turnover.  IVF held.  Plan to d/w
   endocrine, re: pamidronate in addition to.sq calcitonin if Ca
   increases.
   8.  Pancreatitis c/b pseudocyst
 somewhat enlarged on last CT.
   Discussed w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6237**], no intervention currently indicated Pancreatic
   enzymes trending down.

   I was physically present with the resident team for discussion of the
   above findings and independently examined the patient.  I would agree
   with the findings as described above and would add the following
   comments.
   Patient with prolonged hospital course with initial presentation with
   pancreatitis and now with recurrent PEA arrest and ICU admission.
   -Current active issues to be managed as follows
   1)Respiratory Failure-Continue Linezolid/Aztreonam/Cipro
                                     -Move to wean ventilatory support
                                     -Will move to negative fluid balance
   as possible
   2)Altered Mental Status-Patient able to move all extremities, not
   following commands to my exam
                                     -Follow neuro exam and minimize
   sedation as possible.
   3)Seizure Disorder-Continue with EEG and Keppra/Ativan
   4)Rash
Patient with new rash
macular without blistering/bullae
   formation and no mucosal lesions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a complicated hospital course. The patient has been admitted multiple times for various conditions, including pancreatitis with pseudocyst, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, PEA arrest, hypoxic encephalopathy, and seizures.

The current assessment indicates several medical complications that need to be managed:

1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP): The patient has been diagnosed with HCAP and is currently being treated with linezolid, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been identified in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and both aztreonam and ciprofloxacin will be continued.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci. A minimum of 14 days of antibiotic therapy is recommended, depending on the source of the infection. Linezolid will be continued for an additional 48 hours after obtaining surveillance cultures.

3. Rash: The patient has developed a rash, which is suspected to be a drug eruption. The anticonvulsant medication, keppra, was recently changed, and bactrim has been stopped. No evidence of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is present.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has grown from the second urine culture. Further therapy will be discussed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old man with a complicated hospital course. He has been admitted multiple times, including for seizures, a SMV thrombus, UTI, and increasing lipase levels. He was transferred to the MICU after experiencing a PEA arrest. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure of 125/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and supportive care. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated troponin levels. Imaging studies indicate an enlarged pseudocyst related to pancreatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HCAP (Healthcare-associated pneumonia) - The patient has been diagnosed with healthcare-associated pneumonia, which is a common complication in hospitalized patients.
2. Bacteremia - The patient has bacteremia, which means bacteria are present in the blood. This can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
3. Rash - The patient has developed a rash, which could be due to a drug eruption. It is important to identify the cause and adjust the medication regimen accordingly.
4. UTI (Urinary tract infection) - The patient has a Stenotrophomonas infection in the urine, which requires further therapy.
5. PEA arrest - The patient experienced a"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with complicated hospital course
   readmitted for seizures, c/b SMV thrombus, UTI, and increasing
   WBC/lipase, now transferred to MICU s/p PEA arrest.
   PEA arrest: Most likely related to mucous plugging and associated
   hypoxia from pneumonia given copious secretions and RLL infiltrate on
   post-arrest CXR. [**Month (only) 8**] have been exacerbated by worsened mental status
   from hypoglycemia. Bronchoscopy with edematous airways; BAL cx growing
   GNR. GPC in [**2-7**] bottles from fem line likely contaminant; Femoral line
   removed.
   - monitor on telemetry and continuous oxygen monitoring
   - frequent suctioning prn
   - aztrenoman and ciprofloxacin day [**3-11**] for GNR VAP
   - d/c linezolid if GPC c/w contaminant on final bcx
   - cont bactrim for UTI
   - off po vanc as no evidence for C diff although cytotoxicity assay
   still pending
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - closely monitor finger sticks
   - cont standing ativan and keppra while EEG pending
   Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures:  Neurologic exam worsening since arrest.
   Initially concerned for herniation but CT head and MRI showed no
   significant progression since prior studies.  Given right gaze
   preference and hyperreflexia on the right there is continued concern
   for seizures.  He is receiving standing ativan and keppra pending EEG
   results.
   - cont keppra [**2122**] mg [**Hospital1 **] IV
   - cont standing ativan 2 mg q4h IV
   - maintain SBP < 180
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u neuron recs
   Hypoglycemia:  During PEA arrest, patient was noted to have a blood
   glucose in the 20s in the setting of holding tube feeds and receiving
   regular dose standing lantus.  Standing lantus now discontinued and on
   a cautious sliding scale.
   - Hold glargine for now with liberal ISS
   - QID finger sticks
   - treat infection
   - trend lactate
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover.  Labs notable for elevated serum calcium and low PTH.
   Started on calcitonin per Endo recs with normalization.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - cont calcitonin
   - if no improvement in calcium, consider increased dose calcitonin
   and/or pamidronate
   - f/u SPEP
   Low grade fever/leukocytosis: Leukocytosis with significant improvement
   over past 24 hours. Likely [**2-5**] VAP with BAL cx growing GNR.  Also with
   2 of 4 bcx growing GPC, which may represent contamination. Continuing
   tx for Sternotrophomonas UTI.  C. diff tx discontinued as assay neg x
   3; B-toxin assay pending. Pancreatitis has been of concern but his
   imaging has shown pseudocysts but not felt to be infected; LFTs and
   pancreatic enzymes now improving.
   - 8-day course aztreonam, cipro for VAP, to end on [**2131-7-28**]
   - cont linezolid pending speciation of blood cx
   - Bactrim for UTI, to end on [**2131-7-25**]
   - off vanc as C. diff neg x 3; f/u cytotoxicity assay
   - no plan for pancreatic fluid collection drainage at this time
   - trend amylase and lipase
   - follow ID recs
   - d/c femoral line today
   - consider repeat CT scan for reassessment
   Rash: concerning for drug rash
   - d/c bactrim
   GI Residuals: Concern for ileus although pt having BM
   - restart tubefeeds and check residual
   Diarrhea/Bowel thickening: CT showed stable bowel thickening; C diff
   was negative multiple times so stopped PO vanc per ID
   - monitor and keep hydrated
   - C. diff stool cytotoxicity assay pending
   - f/u ID, GI recs
   Hypertension: Patient was significantly hypertensive in the setting of
   receiving epinephrine in the code setting as well as pronounced clonus,
   ?seizure activity. Now normotensive.
   - Cont keppra with standing ativan for now
   - Hydral prn for SBP >180
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe pancreatitis earlier in course of
   critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  On admission patient with
   mild elevation of his transaminases. LFTs and pancreatitic enzymes now
   improving.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - currently receiving feeds via [**Last Name (LF) 1939**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to consider
   repositioning
   UTI: Bactrim sensitive Sternotrophomonas
   - continue bactrim for now although likely sensitive to aztreonam as
   well to end on [**2131-7-25**]
   SMV thrombus: Thrombus may be related to pancreatitis and inflamation
   in area. LENIs negative.  Heparin gtt held initially given concern for
   worsening neurologic exam but restarted
   - continue heparin gtt
   Non gap metabolic acidosis: pH now improving although still
   hyperchloremic
   - Off NS IVF

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of recent admission and complicated hospital course, readmitted for seizures, SMV thrombus, UTI, and increasing WBC/lipase levels. He was transferred to the MICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was likely related to mucous plugging and associated hypoxia from pneumonia given copious secretions and right lower lobe infiltrate on post-arrest chest X-ray. The patient also had exacerbated mental status due to hypoglycemia. Bronchoscopy with edematous airways; BAL culture growing GNR. GPC in 2-7 bottles from fem line likely contaminant; Femoral line removed.

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics (aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, linezolid), antiepileptic drugs (lorazepam, levetiracetam), and other ICU medications (heparin, famotidine, lorazepam).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 130/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 50%. The patient's neurological examination is worsening since the arrest, showing diffuse clonus and right gaze preference. An"

   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with complicated hospital course
   readmitted for seizures, c/b SMV thrombus, UTI, and increasing
   WBC/lipase, now transferred to MICU s/p PEA arrest.
   PEA arrest: Most likely related to mucous plugging and associated
   hypoxia from pneumonia given copious secretions and RLL infiltrate on
   post-arrest CXR. [**Month (only) 8**] have been exacerbated by worsened mental status
   from hypoglycemia. Bronchoscopy with edematous airways; BAL cx growing
   GNR. GPC in [**2-7**] bottles from fem line likely contaminant; Femoral line
   removed.
   - monitor on telemetry and continuous oxygen monitoring
   - frequent suctioning prn
   - switching aztreonam to tobramycin; cont cipro for [**Last Name (LF) 3005**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] complete
   8 d course
   - cont linezolid until GPCs speciated
   - stopped bactrim for UTI
   - off po vanc as no evidence for C diff although cytotoxicity assay
   still pending
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - closely monitor finger sticks
   - cont standing ativan and keppra while EEG pending, although widened
   interval btw ativan to q6hrs from q4hrs
   Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures:  Neurologic exam worsening since arrest.
   Initially concerned for herniation but CT head and MRI showed no
   significant progression since prior studies.  Given right gaze
   preference and hyperreflexia on the right there is continued concern
   for seizures.  He is receiving standing ativan and keppra pending EEG
   results.
   - no evidence of seizures yet
   - cont keppra [**2122**] mg [**Hospital1 **] IV
   - change ativan to q 6hrs, consider change to clonazepam in future per
   neuro recs
   - maintain SBP < 180
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u neuro recs
   Hypoglycemia:  During PEA arrest, patient was noted to have a blood
   glucose in the 20s in the setting of holding tube feeds and receiving
   regular dose standing lantus.  Standing lantus now discontinued and on
   a cautious sliding scale.
   - Hold glargine for now with liberal ISS
   - QID finger sticks
   - treat infection
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.  Labs notable
   for elevated serum calcium and low PTH.  Started on calcitonin per Endo
   recs.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - increased dose of calcitonin and started pamidronate today, expect
   pamidronate to take about 4 days to work and can try to taper off the
   calcitonin during this time frame
   - f/u SPEP
   Low grade fever/leukocytosis: Leukocytosis stable. Likely [**2-5**] [**Month/Day (2) 3005**] with
   BAL cx growing GNR.  Also with 2 of 4 bcx growing GPC, which may
   represent contamination. Continuing tx for Sternotrophomonas UTI.  C.
   diff tx discontinued as assay neg x 3; B-toxin assay pending.
   Pancreatitis has been of concern but his imaging has shown pseudocysts
   but not felt to be infected; LFTs and pancreatic enzymes now improving.
   - 8-day course tobra and cipro for [**Month/Day (2) 3005**]
   - cont linezolid pending speciation of blood cx
   - stopped bactrim
   - off vanc as C. diff neg x 3; f/u cytotoxicity assay
   - no plan for pancreatic fluid collection drainage at this time
   - trend amylase and lipase
   - follow ID recs
   - consider repeat CT scan for reassessment
   Rash: concerning for drug rash
   - d/c bactrim
   GI Residuals: Concern for ileus although pt having BM
   - restart tubefeeds and check residual
   - will start reglan today if there is no interaction with seizure meds
   Diarrhea/Bowel thickening: CT showed stable bowel thickening; C diff
   was negative multiple times so stopped PO vanc per ID
   - monitor and keep hydrated
   - C. diff stool cytotoxicity assay pending
   - f/u ID, GI recs
   Hypertension: Patient was significantly hypertensive in the setting of
   receiving epinephrine in the code setting as well as pronounced clonus,
   ?seizure activity. Now normotensive.
   - Cont keppra with standing ativan for now
   - Hydral prn for SBP >180
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe pancreatitis earlier in course of
   critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  On admission patient with
   mild elevation of his transaminases. LFTs and pancreatitic enzymes now
   improving.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - TFs being held in setting of  high residuals
   UTI: Bactrim sensitive Sternotrophomonas
   - continue bactrim for now although likely sensitive to the tobra that
   is being started as well
   SMV thrombus: Thrombus may be related to pancreatitis and inflamation
   in area. LENIs negative.  Heparin gtt held initially given concern for
   worsening neurologic exam but restarted
   - continue heparin gtt
   - changed to lower goal of 50-70 for PTT
   Non gap metabolic acidosis: pH now improving although still
   hyperchloremic
   - Off NS IVF

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo w/ prior heavy EtOH abuse and complications of portal HTN.
   Hypoxic encephalopathy due to PEA arrest in [**6-12**]. Readmitted from rehab
   on [**7-9**] for seizure, found to have SMV thrombus and UTI. Transferred to
   ICU on [**7-19**] for PEA arrest.
   1. s/p PEA arrest- ? mucus plugging and acute hypoxia.   Telemetry
   without events when occurred.  Given rapid improvement and secretions
   on bronch, seems less likely PE (now on anticoagulation for SMV
   thrombus).  cont to monitor.
   2. VAP- linezolid/aztreonam/cipro for 8 days.  Pseudomonas growing from
   BAL.  Given two separate colonies, seems reasonable to continue both
   aztreonam and cipro.
   2. Bacteremia
 GPC, awaiting speciation.  Plan to continue linezolid x
   48h after surveillance cx
s neg.
   3. Rash
 concerning for drug eruption.  No evidence of SJS.   Seems
   less likely anticonvulsant hypersensitivity but keppra dose was
   recently changes.  We have stopped the bactrim (after 5 days).
   4.  UTI
 Stenotrophomonas, now growing from second urine culture.
   Will need to discuss further therapy w/ ID. .
   6.  Mental status
 Mild improvement follows commands, tracks.  EEG
   results pending. Neurology continues to follow.  CT/MRI unchanged.
   Keppra increased.   Klonopin dc
   7.  Hypercalcemia- likely [**2-5**] bone turnover.  IVF held.  Plan to d/w
   endocrine, re: pamidronate in addition to.sq calcitonin if Ca
   increases.
   8.  Pancreatitis c/b pseudocyst
 somewhat enlarged on last CT.
   Discussed w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6237**], no intervention currently indicated Pancreatic
   enzymes trending down.
   9. SMV thrombus- heparin gtt for now, eventual coumadin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old woman with a history of heavy alcohol abuse and complications related to portal hypertension. She was readmitted to the hospital for a seizure and was found to have a superior mesenteric vein thrombus and urinary tract infection. She was transferred to the ICU on July 19th for a cardiac arrest. The patient's current conditions include hypoxic encephalopathy due to the cardiac arrest, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteremia with GPCs, a drug rash, urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, altered mental status, hypercalcemia, and a possible pseudocyst in the pancreas.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. s/p PEA arrest - The patient experienced a sudden cardiac arrest, which could have led to mucus plugging and acute hypoxia. Although she has shown rapid improvement, it is essential to continue monitoring her condition.
2. VAP - The patient has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She is currently receiving linezolid, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin. It is important to continue these antibiotics for an extended period to treat the infection effectively.
3. Bacteremia - The patient has bacteremia with GPCs, and the specific bacteria are still awaiting identification. The plan is to continue linez"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo w/ prior heavy EtOH abuse and complications of portal HTN.
   Hypoxic encephalopathy due to PEA arrest in [**6-12**]. Readmitted from rehab
   on [**7-9**] for seizure, found to have SMV thrombus and UTI. Transferred to
   ICU on [**7-19**] for PEA arrest.
   1. s/p PEA arrest- ? mucus plugging and acute hypoxia.   Telemetry
   without events when occurred.  Given rapid improvement and secretions
   on bronch, seems less likely PE (now on anticoagulation for SMV
   thrombus).  cont to monitor.
   2. VAP- linezolid/aztreonam/cipro for 8 days.  Pseudomonas growing from
   BAL.  Given two separate colonies, seems reasonable to continue both
   aztreonam and cipro.
   2. Bacteremia
 GPC, awaiting speciation.  Plan to continue linezolid x
   48h after surveillance cx
s neg.
   3. Rash
 concerning for drug eruption.  No evidence of SJS.   Seems
   less likely anticonvulsant hypersensitivity but keppra dose was
   recently changes.  We have stopped the bactrim (after 5 days).
   4.  UTI
 Stenotrophomonas, now growing from second urine culture.
   Will need to discuss further therapy w/ ID. .
   6.  Mental status
 Mild improvement follows commands, tracks.  EEG
   results pending. Neurology continues to follow.  CT/MRI unchanged.
   Keppra increased.   Klonopin dc
   7.  Hypercalcemia- likely [**2-5**] bone turnover.  IVF held.  Plan to d/w
   endocrine, re: pamidronate in addition to.sq calcitonin if Ca
   increases.
   8.  Pancreatitis c/b pseudocyst
 somewhat enlarged on last CT.
   Discussed w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6237**], no intervention currently indicated Pancreatic
   enzymes trending down.
   9. SMV thrombus- heparin gtt for now, eventual coumadin

   which I agree.  I independently examined the patient and would add the
   following comments 28 yo male with pancreatitis, pseudocyst, anoxic
   injury, seizures, hypercalcemia, SMV thrombosis. He was recently
   readmitted to MICU s/p PEA arrest. Active issues have included:
   1. Acute respiratory failure- remains mechanically ventilated but
   tolerating PS ventilation, continue to decrease venitilator support as
   tolerated
   Pan-sensitive Pseudomonas recovered from sputum,
   2. Leukocytosis: followed by ID consult team with Pseudomonas VAP,
   stenotrophomonas UTI. Coag-negative staph recovered  from [**7-20**] blood
   cultures, though no growth yet from surveillance cultures. On
   linezolid/aztreonam/ciprofloxacin. Will continue to adjust abx as
   needed.
   3. Altered mental status- mild improvement over weekend. Spoke with
   neurology consult team with recommendations for resuming Klonipin due
   to EEG abnormalities.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 40 minutes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol abuse and complications of portal hypertension. The patient has been admitted multiple times for various conditions including hypoxic encephalopathy due to PEA arrest, seizure, SMV thrombus, and UTI. The patient is currently in the ICU for PEA arrest and has several medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given in the progress note are:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient remains mechanically ventilated but is tolerating pressure support ventilation. There is a pan-sensitive Pseudomonas infection in the sputum, indicating a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is being managed by an ID consult team. There are concerns about Pseudomonas VAP and Stenotrophomonas UTI. Coag-negative staph was recovered from blood cultures on 7/20, but no growth yet from surveillance cultures. The patient is currently on linezolid/aztreonam/ciprofloxacin, and the antibiotic regimen will be adjusted as needed.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has shown mild improvement over the weekend. Neurology consult team recommends resuming Klonopin due to EEG abnormalities.

4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia, likely due to bone turnover. Intr"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of heavy alcohol abuse, complications of portal hypertension, and previous hypoxic encephalopathy due to a cardiac arrest. She was readmitted from rehabilitation for seizures and found to have a superior mesenteric vein thrombus and urinary tract infection. She was transferred to the ICU on July 19th for a second cardiac arrest.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Suspected mucus plugging and acute hypoxia during the cardiac arrest, but rapid improvement and presence of secretions on bronchoscopy suggest less likely pulmonary embolism (now on anticoagulation for SMV thrombus). Monitoring continues.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which she is receiving linezolid, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin for 8 days.
3. Bacteremia with Gram-positive cocci (GPC), awaiting speciation. Plan to continue linezolid for 48 hours after obtaining surveillance culture results.
4. Rash concerning for drug eruption, especially with recent changes in anticonvulsant medication. Bactrim has been stopped after 5 days.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, which is now growing from a second urine culture. Further therapy discussion with Infectious Disease specialist is needed.
6. Mild improvement in mental"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with complicated hospital course
   readmitted for seizures, c/b SMV thrombus, UTI, and increasing
   WBC/lipase, now transferred to MICU s/p PEA arrest.
   PEA arrest: Most likely related to mucous plugging and associated
   hypoxia from pneumonia given copious secretions and RLL infiltrate on
   post-arrest CXR. [**Month (only) 8**] have been exacerbated by worsened mental status
   from hypoglycemia. Bronchoscopy with edematous airways; BAL cx growing
   GNR. GPC in [**2-7**] bottles from fem line likely contaminant; Femoral line
   removed.
   - monitor on telemetry and continuous oxygen monitoring
   - frequent suctioning prn
   - switching aztreonam to tobramycin; cont cipro for [**Last Name (LF) 3005**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] complete
   8 d course.  D1 = [**7-23**].
   - cont linezolid until GPCs speciated
   - stopped bactrim for UTI
   - off po vanc as no evidence for C diff although cytotoxicity assay
   still pending
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - closely monitor finger sticks
   - cont standing ativan and keppra while EEG pending, although widened
   interval btw ativan to q6hrs from q4hrs
   Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures:  Neurologic exam worsening since arrest.
   Initially concerned for herniation but CT head and MRI showed no
   significant progression since prior studies.  Given right gaze
   preference and hyperreflexia on the right there is continued concern
   for seizures.  He is receiving standing ativan and keppra pending EEG
   results.
   - no evidence of seizures yet
   - cont keppra [**2122**] mg [**Hospital1 **] IV
   - change ativan to q 6hrs, consider change to clonazepam in future per
   neuro recs
   - maintain SBP < 180
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u neuro recs
   Hypoglycemia:  During PEA arrest, patient was noted to have a blood
   glucose in the 20s in the setting of holding tube feeds and receiving
   regular dose standing lantus.  Standing lantus now discontinued and on
   a cautious sliding scale.
   - Hold glargine for now with liberal ISS
   - QID finger sticks
   - treat infection
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.  Labs notable
   for elevated serum calcium and low PTH.  Started on calcitonin per Endo
   recs.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - increased dose of calcitonin and started pamidronate today, expect
   pamidronate to take about 4 days to work and can try to taper off the
   calcitonin during this time frame
   - f/u SPEP
   Low grade fever/leukocytosis: Leukocytosis stable. Likely [**2-5**] [**Month/Day (2) 3005**] with
   BAL cx growing GNR.  Also with 2 of 4 bcx growing GPC, which may
   represent contamination. Continuing tx for Sternotrophomonas UTI.  C.
   diff tx discontinued as assay neg x 3; B-toxin assay pending.
   Pancreatitis has been of concern but his imaging has shown pseudocysts
   but not felt to be infected; LFTs and pancreatic enzymes now improving.
   - 8-day course tobra and cipro for [**Month/Day (2) 3005**]
   - cont linezolid pending speciation of blood cx
   - stopped bactrim
   - off vanc as C. diff neg x 3; f/u cytotoxicity assay
   - no plan for pancreatic fluid collection drainage at this time
   - trend amylase and lipase
   - follow ID recs
   - consider repeat CT scan for reassessment
   Rash: concerning for drug rash
   - d/c bactrim
   GI Residuals: Concern for ileus although pt having BM
   - restart tubefeeds and check residual
   - will start reglan today if there is no interaction with seizure meds
   Diarrhea/Bowel thickening: CT showed stable bowel thickening; C diff
   was negative multiple times so stopped PO vanc per ID
   - monitor and keep hydrated
   - C. diff stool cytotoxicity assay pending
   - f/u ID, GI recs
   Hypertension: Patient was significantly hypertensive in the setting of
   receiving epinephrine in the code setting as well as pronounced clonus,
   ?seizure activity. Now normotensive.
   - Cont keppra with standing ativan for now
   - Hydral prn for SBP >180
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe pancreatitis earlier in course of
   critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  On admission patient with
   mild elevation of his transaminases. LFTs and pancreatitic enzymes now
   improving.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - TFs being held in setting of  high residuals
   UTI: Bactrim sensitive Sternotrophomonas
   - continue bactrim for now although likely sensitive to the tobra that
   is being started as well
   SMV thrombus: Thrombus may be related to pancreatitis and inflamation
   in area. LENIs negative.  Heparin gtt held initially given concern for
   worsening neurologic exam but restarted
   - continue heparin gtt
   - changed to lower goal of 50-70 for PTT
   Non gap metabolic acidosis: pH now improving although still
   hyperchloremic
   - Off NS IVF

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation and is tolerating pressure support trials.
2. Infection: The patient is being treated for CoN Staph bacteremia, Pseudomonas HCAP, and Stenotrophomonas UTI. Although there are no further fevers, leukocytosis persists.
3. Altered mental status: This is multifactorial and includes recent arrest, fevers, seizures, and hypercalcemia. Overnight EEG continues to show epileptiform activity.
4. Pancreatitis/pseudocyst: The patient's lipase levels are increasing, along with tenderness, preventing adequate enteral nutrition. A"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol abuse and complications of portal hypertension.
- He presented with hypoxic encephalopathy due to a previous cardiac arrest and was admitted to the ICU for a second cardiac arrest.
- The patient's current conditions include PEA (pulseless electrical activity) with unclear etiology, anoxic brain injury with seizures, pancreatitis/pancreatic pseudocyst, hypoxemic respiratory failure, Pseudomonas healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), Stenotrophomonas urinary tract infection (UTI), GPC bacteremia related to a groin line, possible Bactrim reaction, hypercalcemia, and SMV thrombus.
- The patient is receiving various treatments including ABX (antibiotics), PSV weaning, continuous EEG, phenytoin, lorazepam, famotidine, and heparin gtt.
- The patient has been readmitted from rehab for seizures and was found to have a superior mesenteric vein thrombus and urinary tract infection.
- The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, as well as low sodium and potassium levels.
- Imaging studies include a CXR showing low lung volumes without clear infiltrate and an MRI brain showing no significant interval change.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 129/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PEA arrest with unclear etiology: The patient experienced a second cardiac arrest, which is a serious and life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention.
2. Anoxic brain injury with seizures: The patient's brain injury due to hypoxia may result in long-term neurological deficits and seizures.
3. Pancreatitis/pancreatic pseudocyst: The patient's elevated lipase levels indicate ongoing inflammation in the pancreas, which can lead to complications such as pseudocysts, abscesses, or necrosis.
4. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
5. Pseudomonas HCAP: The patient's infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be challenging to treat and may lead to worsening respiratory symptoms or dissemination of infection.
6. GPC bacteremia: The presence of GPC bacteremia may indicate a line-related infection, which can spread to other parts of the body if not managed appropriately.
7. Possible Bactrim reaction: The patient's eosinophilia and rash could be a hypersensitivity reaction to Bactrim, necessitating alternative antibiotic options.
8. Hypercalcemia: The patient's elevated calcium levels can lead to complications such as kidney stones, bone demin"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with complicated hospital course
   readmitted for seizures, c/b SMV thrombus, UTI, and increasing
   WBC/lipase, now transferred to MICU s/p PEA arrest.
   PEA arrest: Most likely related to mucous plugging and associated
   hypoxia from pneumonia given copious secretions and RLL infiltrate on
   post-arrest CXR. [**Month (only) 8**] have been exacerbated by worsened mental status
   from hypoglycemia. Bronchoscopy with edematous airways; BAL cx growing
   GNR. GPC in [**2-7**] bottles from fem line likely contaminant; Femoral line
   removed.
   - monitor on telemetry and continuous oxygen monitoring
   - frequent suctioning prn
   - switching aztreonam to tobramycin; cont cipro for [**Last Name (LF) 3005**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] complete
   8 d course.  D1 = [**7-23**].
   - cont linezolid until GPCs speciated
   - stopped bactrim for UTI
   - off po vanc as no evidence for C diff although cytotoxicity assay
   still pending
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - closely monitor finger sticks
   - cont standing ativan and keppra while EEG pending, although widened
   interval btw ativan to q6hrs from q4hrs
   Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures:  Neurologic exam worsening since arrest.
   Initially concerned for herniation but CT head and MRI showed no
   significant progression since prior studies.  Given right gaze
   preference and hyperreflexia on the right there is continued concern
   for seizures.  He is receiving standing ativan and keppra pending EEG
   results.
   - no evidence of seizures yet
   - cont keppra [**2122**] mg [**Hospital1 **] IV
   - change ativan to q 6hrs, consider change to clonazepam in future per
   neuro recs
   - maintain SBP < 180
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u neuro recs
   Hypoglycemia:  During PEA arrest, patient was noted to have a blood
   glucose in the 20s in the setting of holding tube feeds and receiving
   regular dose standing lantus.  Standing lantus now discontinued and on
   a cautious sliding scale.
   - Hold glargine for now with liberal ISS
   - QID finger sticks
   - treat infection
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.  Labs notable
   for elevated serum calcium and low PTH.  Started on calcitonin per Endo
   recs.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - increased dose of calcitonin and started pamidronate today, expect
   pamidronate to take about 4 days to work and can try to taper off the
   calcitonin during this time frame
   - f/u SPEP
   Low grade fever/leukocytosis: Leukocytosis stable. Likely [**2-5**] [**Month/Day (2) 3005**] with
   BAL cx growing GNR.  Also with 2 of 4 bcx growing GPC, which may
   represent contamination. Continuing tx for Sternotrophomonas UTI.  C.
   diff tx discontinued as assay neg x 3; B-toxin assay pending.
   Pancreatitis has been of concern but his imaging has shown pseudocysts
   but not felt to be infected; LFTs and pancreatic enzymes now improving.
   - 8-day course tobra and cipro for [**Month/Day (2) 3005**]
   - cont linezolid pending speciation of blood cx
   - stopped bactrim
   - off vanc as C. diff neg x 3; f/u cytotoxicity assay
   - no plan for pancreatic fluid collection drainage at this time
   - trend amylase and lipase
   - follow ID recs
   - consider repeat CT scan for reassessment
   Rash: concerning for drug rash
   - d/c bactrim
   GI Residuals: Concern for ileus although pt having BM
   - restart tubefeeds and check residual
   - will start reglan today if there is no interaction with seizure meds
   Diarrhea/Bowel thickening: CT showed stable bowel thickening; C diff
   was negative multiple times so stopped PO vanc per ID
   - monitor and keep hydrated
   - C. diff stool cytotoxicity assay pending
   - f/u ID, GI recs
   Hypertension: Patient was significantly hypertensive in the setting of
   receiving epinephrine in the code setting as well as pronounced clonus,
   ?seizure activity. Now normotensive.
   - Cont keppra with standing ativan for now
   - Hydral prn for SBP >180
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe pancreatitis earlier in course of
   critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  On admission patient with
   mild elevation of his transaminases. LFTs and pancreatitic enzymes now
   improving.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - TFs being held in setting of  high residuals
   UTI: Bactrim sensitive Sternotrophomonas
   - continue bactrim for now although likely sensitive to the tobra that
   is being started as well
   SMV thrombus: Thrombus may be related to pancreatitis and inflamation
   in area. LENIs negative.  Heparin gtt held initially given concern for
   worsening neurologic exam but restarted
   - continue heparin gtt
   - changed to lower goal of 50-70 for PTT
   Non gap metabolic acidosis: pH now improving although still
   hyperchloremic
   - Off NS IVF

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for seizures, SMV thrombus, UTI, and increasing WBC/lipase. He was transferred to the MICU following a PEA arrest, most likely due to mucous plugging and associated hypoxia from pneumonia. The patient also experienced worsened mental status from hypoglycemia. A bronchoscopy with edematous airways showed BAL CX growing GNR, and a femoral line was removed.

Assessment and Plan:
- Monitor on telemetry and continuous oxygen monitoring
- Frequent suctioning as needed
- Switched aztreonam to tobramycin; continue cipro for complete 8-day course. D1 = [7-23]
- Continue linezolid until GPCs speciate, per ID will DC today
- Stopped bactrim for UTI
- Off po vanc as no evidence for C diff although cytotoxicity assay still pending
- F/u cultures
- F/u ID recs
- Closely monitor finger sticks

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with complicated hospital course
   readmitted for seizures, c/b SMV thrombus, UTI, and increasing
   WBC/lipase, now transferred to MICU s/p PEA arrest.
   PEA arrest: Most likely related to mucous plugging and associated
   hypoxia from pneumonia given copious secretions and RLL infiltrate on
   post-arrest CXR. [**Month (only) 8**] have been exacerbated by worsened mental status
   from hypoglycemia. Bronchoscopy with edematous airways; BAL cx growing
   GNR. GPC in [**2-7**] bottles from fem line likely contaminant; Femoral line
   removed.
   - monitor on telemetry and continuous oxygen monitoring
   - frequent suctioning prn
   - switching aztreonam to tobramycin; cont cipro for [**Last Name (LF) 3005**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] complete
   8 d course.  D1 = [**7-23**].
   - cont linezolid until GPCs speciated
   - stopped bactrim for UTI
   - off po vanc as no evidence for C diff although cytotoxicity assay
   still pending
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - closely monitor finger sticks
   - cont standing ativan and keppra while EEG pending, although widened
   interval btw ativan to q6hrs from q4hrs
   Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures:  Neurologic exam worsening since arrest.
   Initially concerned for herniation but CT head and MRI showed no
   significant progression since prior studies.  Given right gaze
   preference and hyperreflexia on the right there is continued concern
   for seizures.  He is receiving standing ativan and keppra pending EEG
   results.
   - no evidence of seizures yet
   - cont keppra [**2122**] mg [**Hospital1 **] IV
   - change ativan to q 6hrs, consider change to clonazepam in future per
   neuro recs
   - maintain SBP < 180
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u neuro recs
   Hypoglycemia:  During PEA arrest, patient was noted to have a blood
   glucose in the 20s in the setting of holding tube feeds and receiving
   regular dose standing lantus.  Standing lantus now discontinued and on
   a cautious sliding scale.
   - Hold glargine for now with liberal ISS
   - QID finger sticks
   - treat infection
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.  Labs notable
   for elevated serum calcium and low PTH.  Started on calcitonin per Endo
   recs.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - increased dose of calcitonin and started pamidronate today, expect
   pamidronate to take about 4 days to work and can try to taper off the
   calcitonin during this time frame
   - f/u SPEP
   Low grade fever/leukocytosis: Leukocytosis stable. Likely [**2-5**] [**Month/Day (2) 3005**] with
   BAL cx growing GNR.  Also with 2 of 4 bcx growing GPC, which may
   represent contamination. Continuing tx for Sternotrophomonas UTI.  C.
   diff tx discontinued as assay neg x 3; B-toxin assay pending.
   Pancreatitis has been of concern but his imaging has shown pseudocysts
   but not felt to be infected; LFTs and pancreatic enzymes now improving.
   - 8-day course tobra and cipro for [**Month/Day (2) 3005**]
   - cont linezolid pending speciation of blood cx
   - stopped bactrim
   - off vanc as C. diff neg x 3; f/u cytotoxicity assay
   - no plan for pancreatic fluid collection drainage at this time
   - trend amylase and lipase
   - follow ID recs
   - consider repeat CT scan for reassessment
   Rash: concerning for drug rash
   - d/c bactrim
   GI Residuals: Concern for ileus although pt having BM
   - restart tubefeeds and check residual
   - will start reglan today if there is no interaction with seizure meds
   Diarrhea/Bowel thickening: CT showed stable bowel thickening; C diff
   was negative multiple times so stopped PO vanc per ID
   - monitor and keep hydrated
   - C. diff stool cytotoxicity assay pending
   - f/u ID, GI recs
   Hypertension: Patient was significantly hypertensive in the setting of
   receiving epinephrine in the code setting as well as pronounced clonus,
   ?seizure activity. Now normotensive.
   - Cont keppra with standing ativan for now
   - Hydral prn for SBP >180
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe pancreatitis earlier in course of
   critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  On admission patient with
   mild elevation of his transaminases. LFTs and pancreatitic enzymes now
   improving.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - TFs being held in setting of  high residuals
   UTI: Bactrim sensitive Sternotrophomonas
   - continue bactrim for now although likely sensitive to the tobra that
   is being started as well

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, anoxic brain damage, and seizures. He has been hospitalized for a prolonged period and has developed complications such as necrotizing pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status (not delirium), and seizure without status epilepticus.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and is tolerating pressure support ventilation. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with appropriate antibiotics. The patient's seizures have been controlled with fosphenytoin, and he is also on Keppra and Ativan for seizure management.

The patient has hypercalcemia, which is being treated with calcitonin and pamidronate. He has fevers, which are attributed to VAP and a stenotrophomonas UTI, and linezolid has been discontinued per Infectious Disease consultation. There is also a thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), for which he is receiving heparin.

The patient has metabolic acidosis, and non-gap metabolic acidosis is being treated with normal saline (NS) infusion cessation. The patient's nutrition is a concern, and enteral feeds will be restarted. If the patient continues to have high residuals, a post-pyloric placement may be beneficial.

In terms of ICU care,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, anoxic brain damage, and seizures. He has been hospitalized for a prolonged period and has developed multiple complications, including necrotizing pancreatitis, SMV thrombosis, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, and seizure activity. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is tolerating pressure support ventilation. He is also experiencing hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, and has had recent infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and urinary tract infection. The patient's abdominal imaging shows pseudocysts that have not changed appreciably, and he is on heparin for the SMV thrombus. The patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management of his various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and tolerating pressure support ventilation. It is important to continue monitoring his respiratory status and adjusting ventilator settings as needed to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient has suffered anoxic brain damage due to prolonged periods of inadequate oxygen supply to the brain. Recovery from anoxic brain injury can be unpredictable, and it is important to continue neurological monitoring and provide appropriate supportive care.

3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels which need to be managed with medications such as pamidronate and calcitonin. Close"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with complicated hospital course
   readmitted for seizures, c/b SMV thrombus, UTI, and increasing
   WBC/lipase, was transferred to MICU s/p PEA arrest.
   .
   Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures:  Neurologic exam worsening, now
   persistent since arrest.  Initially concerned for herniation but CT
   head and MRI showed no significant progression since prior studies.
   Given right gaze preference and hyperreflexia on the right there is
   continued concern for seizures.  He is receiving standing ativan and
   keppra as EEG showing persisent seizure activity.
   - yesterday
s EEG showing evidence of likely status.
   - cont keppra [**2122**] mg [**Hospital1 **] IV
   - change ativan to q 6hrs, loaded with fosphenytoin yesterday, will
   continue to load today with 500mg then 200mg this PM.  Then 100mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - maintain SBP < 180
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   Eosinophilia.  Continues to trend up.
   .
   PEA arrest: Most likely related to mucous plugging and associated
   hypoxia from pneumonia given copious secretions and RLL infiltrate on
   post-arrest CXR. [**Month (only) 8**] have been exacerbated by worsened mental status
   from hypoglycemia. Bronchoscopy with edematous airways; BAL cx growing
   GNR. GPC in [**2-7**] bottles from fem line likely contaminant; Femoral line
   removed.
   - monitor on telemetry and continuous oxygen monitoring
   - frequent suctioning prn
   - switched aztreonam to tobramycin; cont cipro for [**Last Name (LF) 3005**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] complete 8
   d course.  D1 = [**7-23**].
   - cont linezolid until GPCs speciated, per ID will DC today.
   - stopped bactrim for UTI
   - off po vanc as no evidence for C diff although cytotoxicity assay
   still pending
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - closely monitor finger sticks
   - cont standing ativan and keppra, loaded on fosphenytoin yesterday.
   Hypoglycemia:  During PEA arrest, patient was noted to have a blood
   glucose in the 20s in the setting of holding tube feeds and receiving
   regular dose standing lantus.  Standing lantus now discontinued and on
   a cautious sliding scale.
   - Hold glargine for now with liberal ISS
   - QID finger sticks
   - treat infection
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.  Labs notable
   for elevated serum calcium and low PTH.  Started on calcitonin per Endo
   recs.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - increased dose of calcitonin and started pamidronate yesterday.,
   expect pamidronate to take about 4 days to work and can try to taper
   off the calcitonin during this time frame
   - f/u SPEP
   Low grade fever/leukocytosis: Leukocytosis stable. Likely [**2-5**] [**Month/Day (2) 3005**] with
   BAL cx growing GNR.  Also with 2 of 4 bcx growing GPC, which may
   represent contamination. Continuing tx for Sternotrophomonas UTI.  C.
   diff tx discontinued as assay neg x 3; B-toxin assay pending.
   Pancreatitis has been of concern but his imaging has shown pseudocysts
   but not felt to be infected; LFTs and pancreatic enzymes now improving.
   - 8-day course tobra and cipro for [**Month/Day (2) 3005**]
   - off vanc as C. diff neg x 3; f/u cytotoxicity assay
   -DC bactrim and linezolid.
   - no plan for pancreatic fluid collection drainage at this time
   - trend amylase and lipase
   - follow ID recs
   - consider repeat CT scan for reassessment
   Rash: concerning for drug rash
   - d/c bactrim
   GI Residuals: Concern for ileus although pt having BM
   - restart tubefeeds and check residual
   - reglan started.
   Diarrhea/Bowel thickening: CT showed stable bowel thickening; C diff
   was negative multiple times so stopped PO vanc per ID
   - monitor and keep hydrated
   - C. diff stool cytotoxicity assay pending
   - f/u ID, GI recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old man with a complicated hospital course, readmitted for seizures, SMV thrombus, UTI, and increasing WBC/lipase. He was transferred to the MICU after experiencing a PEA arrest. The patient has an anoxic brain injury and persistent seizure activity. He is receiving standing Ativan and Keppra, and his EEG showed evidence of likely status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Eosinophilia: The patient's eosinophil count is trending up, which could indicate an allergic reaction or parasitic infection.
2. PEA arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest likely related to mucous plugging and associated hypoxia from pneumonia. The worsened mental status from hypoglycemia exacerbated the condition.
3. GNR UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by Gram-negative rods (GNR), which is being treated with antibiotics.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated serum calcium levels, possibly due to bone turnover from immobility and poor kidney excretion. He is being treated with calcitonin and pamidronate.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient had a blood glucose in the 20s during the PEA arrest and is at risk for recurrent hypoglycemia. His standing lantus has been discontinued, and he is on a cautious sliding scale.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient had severe pancre"

   Eosinophilia.  Continues to trend up in spite of being off bactrim for
   several days.  Most concerning meds are tobra which was recently added,
   linezolid which has already been stopped, cipro which patient has been
   on for 6 days, and dilantin which is new.

   1. Acute respiratory failure: resolved, back to trach collar and stable
   x 24h, pna tx as below
   2. Anoxic brain injury/AMS- No obvious neurological change  over the
   past day; however, multifactorial etiology behind his AMS  ( recent
   anoxia, continued seizure activity, hypercalcemia, medications) and
   would not necessarily anticipate a rapid improvement
   -loaded with fosphenytoin yesterday due to continued seizure activity
   -On Keppra and ativan
   -Ongoing EEG monitoring
   -Hypercalcemia has been treated with pamidronate and calcitonin,
   continue to monitor levels
   3. Hypercalcemia: preumably due to immobilization, levels still high,
   on calcitonin and s/p a dose of pamidronate.
   4. Leukocytosis:covering for Pseudomonas VAP and stenotrophomonas UTI
   -Continue tobramycin and ciprofloxacin (planning for 14d course so far)
   -Vanco dc

d due to recovery
   of only CoNS from [**Month/Year (2) 1056**] cultures with negative surveillance cultures
   -No additional infectious process by abdominal imaging
   5. Eosinophilia: will trend today, probably related to some new med,
   ABX vs fosphenytoin?
   -will touch base w/ ID and Neuro re: poss med effect and adjustment
   6. Pancreatitis: abdominal imaging showed pseudocysts which have not
   changed appreciably, no evidence of super-infection
   -tolerating tube feeds
   7. SMV thrombus: per lit review requires 6 mos anticoag
   -heparin gtt for now, coumadin transition starting tonight

   28 yo male with pancreatitis/pseudocysts, anoxic injury, SMV
   thrombosis, acute respiratory failure, seizures, hypercalcemia,
   leukocytosis/. He has remained on TC today, but is intermittently
   coughing and requiring suctioning as frequently as every hour.
   Leukocytosis persists, now with eosinophilia. Is tolerating enteral
   feeds.
   Plan trach collar trials as tolerated, suctioning, nebs. Neurology team
   continuing to follow and adjust seizure medications. The eosinophilia
   raises concern for a drug reaction, with the most likely culprit
   including abx vs dilantin- will touch base with ID and Neurology
   consult teams. Current level of nursing care is too high for him to go
   to the floor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a prolonged hospitalization following pancreatitis, pseudocyst, SMV thrombosis, acute respiratory failure, PEA arrest, seizures, and hypercalcemia. The patient's acute respiratory failure has resolved, but he remains on a tracheal collar and is stable. He is also experiencing anoxic brain injury/Altered Mental Status (AMS) due to recent anoxia, continued seizure activity, hypercalcemia, and medications. The patient's hypercalcemia has been treated with pamidronate and calcitonin, and his levels are still high. He has leukocytosis, which is being covered for Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and Stenotrophomonas urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is tolerating tube feeds and has a history of pancreatitis with pseudocysts that have not changed appreciably. He also has a SMV thrombus, for which he will require six months of anticoagulation. The patient's current disposition is stable in the ICU, but he may need to be on the floor in the next 24 hours. He is at high risk for requiring ICU-level care for respiratory status due to suctioning needs.

Potential medical complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient has already experienced this complication but has been resolved.
2. Anoxic brain injury/Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient is unlikely"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizure,
   being treated for VAP with tobra/cipro.
   .
   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.  Not
   interactive.  He was previously in has been loaded with phenytoin.  No
   longer receiving continue EEG monitor.  Prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue standing ativan
   - neuro recommends to continue current therapy, may consider switching
   dilantin due to interaction with coumadin
   . .
   Respiratory failure/VAP.  Patient has been on TCM for 24 hours and
   tolerating it well.  Has a vigorous cough.  On tobra/cipro with plan
   for two week course to be completed [**8-3**].  Pt  coughing worsened
   overnight, oxygenating well but appeared uncomfortable especially with
   worsened tachycardia.  Switched to PS and improved.
   - continue tobra/cipro (end date [**8-3**])
   - continue nebs PRN
   - return to TCM today
   - consider trach change as having worsening erythema and mild discharge
   around trach
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Patient is not
   withdrawing and is on standing ativan.  Did not respond to fentanyl
   boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF boluses,
   either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.
   - consider new infection if fever spikes
   - consider PE if respiratory sats drop
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  Lipase is trending down.  CT scan of the abdomen
   on [**7-25**] shows stable pancreatic pseudocysts.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - had high residuals again yesterday, continue tube feeds if possible
   Eosinophilia.  Continues to trend up in spite of being off bactrim for
   several days.  Most concerning meds are tobra which was recently added,
   linezolid which has already been stopped, cipro which patient has been
   on for 6 days, and dilantin which is new.  Is possible to have about 2
   week eosinophilia after stopping Bactrim.
   - continue tobra/cipro for now
   - continue dilantin for now
   - trend eos count
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP.  Additionally, patient was hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of
   recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  Now that patient is finally tolerating tube feeds,
   anticipate patient will have hyperglycemia.
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - continue calcitonin and s/p pamidronate
   - follow ca and monitor for hypocalcemia
   .
   SMV thrombus.  Therapeutic on heparin drip for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal of 50-70 for PTT
   - initiate bridging with coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior NGT
   suctioning, seizures.
   - follow bicarb

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis and pseudocysts.
- He suffered two episodes of PEA arrest and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.
- The patient is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Tobramycin and Ciprofloxacin.
- He has AMS secondary to anoxic brain injury/seizures, poor mental status prognosis, and respiratory failure/VAP.
- The patient has tachycardia without a clear etiology, diabetes, hypercalcemia, SMV thrombus, and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to his immunocompromised state, tracheostomy site erythema and purulent discharge, and ongoing treatment for VAP.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with ongoing respiratory failure/VAP despite being on TCM and receiving antibiotics.
3. Tachycardia: The patient continues to experience tachycardia without a clear etiology, which may be due to infection, sepsis, or other underlying causes.
4. Diabetes: The patient is at risk for hyperglycemia due to initiation of tube feeds and ongoing management of diabetes.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizure,
   being treated for VAP with tobra/cipro.
   .
   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.  Not
   interactive.  He was previously in has been loaded with phenytoin.  No
   longer receiving continue EEG monitor.  Prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue standing ativan
   - neuro recommends to continue current therapy, may consider switching
   dilantin due to interaction with coumadin
   . .
   Respiratory failure/VAP.  Patient has been on TCM for 24 hours and
   tolerating it well.  Has a vigorous cough.  On tobra/cipro with plan
   for two week course to be completed [**8-3**].  Pt  coughing worsened
   overnight, oxygenating well but appeared uncomfortable especially with
   worsened tachycardia.  Switched to PS and improved.
   - continue tobra/cipro (end date [**8-3**]), and due to PO bioavailablility,
   switching from PO cipro to IV cipro; tobra level ok and will continue
   current dosing
   - continue nebs PRN
   - return to TCM today
   - consider bronch to look for irritation around trach site, start
   lidocaine IH treatment PRN
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Patient is not
   withdrawing and is on standing ativan.  Did not respond to fentanyl
   boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF boluses,
   either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.
   - consider new infection if fever spikes, no cultures needed at this
   time
   - consider PE if respiratory sats drop
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  Lipase is trending down.  CT scan of the abdomen
   on [**7-25**] shows stable pancreatic pseudocysts.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes, up only mildly today
   - had high residuals again yesterday, continue tube feeds if possible
   Eosinophilia.  Continues to trend up in spite of being off bactrim for
   several days.  Has potentional to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] eosinophilia
   for two weeks after offending [**Doctor Last Name **] removed.
   - continue tobra/cipro for now
   - continue dilantin for now
   - trend eos count
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  Now that patient is finally tolerating tube feeds,
   anticipate patient will have hyperglycemia.
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - s/p pamidronate
   - stop calcitonin today
   - follow ca and monitor for hypocalcemia
   .
   SMV thrombus.  Therapeutic on heparin drip for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal of 50-70 for PTT
   - initiate bridging with coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior NGT
   suctioning, seizures.
   - follow bicarb

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, and previous cardiac arrest with anoxic brain injury and seizure. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including acute mental status secondary to anoxic brain injury/seizures, respiratory failure/VAP, tachycardia, eosinophilia, hypercalcemia, SMV thrombus, and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Mental Status: The patient's prognosis regarding mental status is poor due to the anoxic brain injury and seizure activity. He is not interactive and requires continued antiepileptic therapy.
2. Respiratory Failure/VAP: The patient has been on tube continuous mechanical ventilation (TCM) for 24 hours and tolerating it well. He has a vigorous cough and is being treated with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin for VAP. However, his coughing worsened overnight, and he appeared uncomfortable, especially with worsened tachycardia. He was switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and improved.
3. Tachycardia: No clear etiology of tachycardia has been identified. The patient is not withdrawing and is on standing lorazepam. He did not respond to fentanyl"

   for two week course to be completed [**8-3**].
   - continue tobra/cipro (though this may be contributing to
   eosinophilia)
   - continue TCM
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  Lipase is trending down.  CT scan of the abdomen
   on [**7-25**] shows stable pancreatic pseudocysts.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - tolerating tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Continues to trend up in spite of being off bactrim for
   several days.  Most concerning meds are tobra which was recently added,
   linezolid which has already been stopped, cipro which patient has been
   on for 6 days, and dilantin which is new.
   - continue tobra/cipro for now
   - continue dilantin for now
   - trend eos count
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP.  Additionally, patient was hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of
   recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  Now that patient is finally tolerating tube feeds,
   anticipate patient will have hyperglycemia.
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - continue calcitonin and s/p pamidronate
   - follow ca and monitor for hypocalcemia
   .
   SMV thrombus.  Therapeutic on heparin drip for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal of 50-70 for PTT
   - initiate bridging with coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Patient is not
   withdrawing and is on standing ativan.  Did not respond to fentanyl
   boluses.  [**Month (only) 8**] be dehydrated as patient was NPO with no IVFs for several
   day.
   - bolus with NS to look for HR response

   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior NGT
   suctioning, seizures.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by pseudocysts, previous episodes of cardiac arrest with anoxic brain injury and seizure, being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. AMS (Altered Mental Status) secondary to anoxic brain injury/Seizures. The patient is not interactive, has suffered two PEA (Pulseless Electrical Activity) arrests, and has poor prognosis regarding mental status.
2. Respiratory failure/VAP. The patient is tolerating tracheostomy tube change well and is on a two-week course of tobramycin and ciprofloxacin for VAP treatment.
3. Pancreatitis. The patient has severe necrotizing pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation. There are no plans for surgical intervention, and lipase levels are trending down.
4. Eosinophilia. The patient's eosinophil count continues to increase despite being off bactrim for several days. The concerning medications include tobramycin, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, and dilantin.
5. S/p PEA arrest. This was likely secondary to mucous plugging from VAP.
6. Diabetes. The patient had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initiation of glargine."

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo male with prolonged hospitalization following pancreatitis, with
   pseudocyst, SMV thrombosis, chronic respiratory failure, PEA arrest x
   2, seizures, hypercalcemia.
   1. Acute respiratory failure: resolving, back to trach collar and
   stable x 48h, pna tx as below.
   -pulm toilet
   2. Coughing fits: may be related to trach placement; not having
   purulent sputum production
   -will instill lidocaine 1-2% prn for comfort
   -will eval w/ bronch for trach placement
   3. Anoxic brain injury/AMS- No obvious neurological change  over the
   past day; however, multifactorial etiology behind his AMS  ( recent
   anoxia, continued seizure activity, hypercalcemia, medications) and
   would not necessarily anticipate a rapid improvement
   -loaded with fosphenytoin yesterday due to continued seizure activity
   -On Keppra and ativan
   -Hypercalcemia has been treated with pamidronate and calcitonin,
   continue to monitor levels
   3. Hypercalcemia: preumably due to immobilization, levels normalizing,
   -wil dc calcitonin and monitor levels
   4. Leukocytosis:covering for Pseudomonas VAP and stenotrophomonas UTI
   -Continue tobramycin and ciprofloxacin (planning for 14d course so far,
   end date [**8-2**])
   -Vanco dc
d due to Cdiff negative x 3, linezolid dc
d due to recovery
   of only CoNS from blood cultures with negative surveillance cultures
   -No additional infectious process by abdominal imaging
   5. Eosinophilia: will trend today, per Id, could still be related to
   prior bactrim exposure
   6. Pancreatitis: abdominal imaging showed pseudocysts which have not
   changed appreciably, no evidence of super-infection
   -tolerating tube feeds
   7. SMV thrombus: per lit review requires 6 mos anticoag
   -heparin gtt for now, coumadin transition
   Remainder of plan as per housestaff note

   1. Acute respiratory failure: resolving, back to trach collar and
   stable x 48h, pna tx as below.
   -pulm toilet
   2. Coughing fits: may be related to trach placement; not having
   purulent sputum production
   -will instill lidocaine 1-2% prn for comfort
   -will eval w/ bronch for trach placement
   3. Anoxic brain injury/AMS- No obvious neurological change  over the
   past day; however, multifactorial etiology behind his AMS  ( recent
   anoxia, continued seizure activity, hypercalcemia, medications) and
   would not necessarily anticipate a rapid improvement
   -loaded with fosphenytoin yesterday due to continued seizure activity
   -On Keppra and ativan
   -Hypercalcemia has been treated with pamidronate and calcitonin,
   continue to monitor levels
   3. Hypercalcemia: preumably due to immobilization, levels normalizing,
   -wil dc calcitonin and monitor levels
   4. Leukocytosis:covering for Pseudomonas VAP and stenotrophomonas UTI
   -Continue tobramycin and ciprofloxacin (planning for 14d course so far,
   end date [**8-2**])
   -Vanco dc

d due to recovery
   of only CoNS from blood cultures with negative surveillance cultures
   -No additional infectious process by abdominal imaging
   5. Eosinophilia: will trend today, per Id, could still be related to
   prior bactrim exposure
   6. Pancreatitis: abdominal imaging showed pseudocysts which have not
   changed appreciably, no evidence of super-infection

   I was physically present with the resident team on this date for
   discussion of the above history, exam and assessment and plan with
   which I agree.  I independently examined the patient and would add the
   following comments:
   28 yo male with severe alcoholic pancreatitis in [**5-12**] with complicated
   hospitalization notable for respiratory failure s/p trach, PEA arrest
   and anoxic encephalopathy, seizures. Readmitted from rehab in early
   [**Month (only) 280**] for further management of continued seizures, SMV thrombosis,
   hypercalcemia. MICU transfer [**7-20**] following another PEA arrest,
   possibly due to mucous plugging. Subsequently he was also found to have
   Pseudomonas HCAP and Stenotrophomonas UTI. Major issues include:
   1. Acute respiratory failure: improving, has been on TC yesterday
   though with continued coughing. Bronchoscopy this afternoon was
   relatively unrevealing, showing some irritation near the trach and a
   minor amount of purulent secretions in the lingula. Has been receiving
   lidocaine and will also try guiafenisen.
   2. Pseudomonas HCAP: on cipro/tobra until [**8-3**]
   3. Altered mental status: multifactorial, with recent PEA arrest,
   hypercalcemia, resolving infections, and seizures. No further
   epileptiform activity before continuous EEG monitors were pulled. Neuro
   continuing to follow.
   4. Pancreatitis/pseudocysts: Underwent CT [**7-25**] that showed continued
   maturation of his known pseudocysts, but no superinfections. If pt not
   tolerating enteral feeds, consider post-pyloric placement
   5. SMV thrombosis: decreased on [**7-25**] CT- plan 6 mo. course of
   anticoagulation.
   6. Hypercalcemia: seen by Endocrinology and thought most likely
   secondary to immobility with increased bone turnover. Appears to be
   responding to calcitonin/pamidronate.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 40 minutes.

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of severe alcoholic pancreatitis, who has been hospitalized for respiratory failure, tracheostomy, PEA arrest, anoxic encephalopathy, seizures, and SMV thrombosis. He was readmitted from rehab for continued seizures, hypercalcemia, and SMV thrombosis. The patient was transferred to the MICU after another PEA arrest, possibly due to mucous plugging. He also has a history of Pseudomonas hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and Stenotrophomonas urinary tract infection.

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, improving but with continued coughing. He has been on tracheal collar recently. A bronchoscopy was performed, showing some irritation near the trachea and a minor amount of purulent secretions in the lingula. The patient is receiving lidocaine for coughing and will also try guaifenesin.

The patient is being treated for Pseudomonas HCAP with ciprofloxacin and tobramycin until August 3rd. He has altered mental status, which is multifactorial, including recent PEA arrest, hypercalcemia, resolving infections, and seizures. His pancreatitis and pseudocysts are being managed, and he is tolerating tube feeds. The patient has an SMV thrombus, for which he will receive a 6-month course of anticoagulation."

   longer receiving continue EEG monitor.  Prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue standing ativan
   - neuro recommends to continue current therapy, may consider switching
   dilantin due to interaction with coumadin

   Respiratory failure/VAP.  Patient has been on TCM for 24 hours and
   tolerating it well.  Has a vigorous cough.  On tobra/cipro with plan
   for two week course to be completed [**8-3**].  Pt  coughing worsened
   overnight, oxygenating well but appeared uncomfortable especially with
   worsened tachycardia.  Switched to PS and improved.
   - continue tobra/cipro (end date [**8-3**]), and due to PO bioavailablility,
   switching from PO cipro to IV cipro; tobra level ok and will continue
   current dosing
   - continue nebs PRN
   - return to TCM today
   - consider bronch to look for irritation around trach site, start

   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Patient is not
   withdrawing and is on standing ativan.  Did not respond to fentanyl
   boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF boluses,
   either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.
   - consider new infection if fever spikes, no cultures needed at this

   on [**7-25**] shows stable pancreatic pseudocysts.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes, up only mildly today
   - had high residuals again yesterday, continue tube feeds if possible
   Eosinophilia.  Continues to trend up in spite of being off bactrim for
   several days.  Has potentional to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] eosinophilia
   for two weeks after offending [**Doctor Last Name **] removed.
   - continue tobra/cipro for now
   - continue dilantin for now
   - trend eos count

   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  Now that patient is finally tolerating tube feeds,
   anticipate patient will have hyperglycemia.
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - s/p pamidronate
   - stop calcitonin today
   - follow ca and monitor for hypocalcemia
   .
   SMV thrombus.  Therapeutic on heparin drip for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal of 50-70 for PTT
   - initiate bridging with coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior NGT
   suctioning, seizures.

   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizure,
   being treated for VAP with tobra/cipro.
   .
   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.  Not
   interactive.  He was previously in has been loaded with phenytoin.  No
   longer receiving continue EEG monitor.  Prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg TID
   - continue standing ativan
   - neuro recommends to continue current therapy, may consider switching
   dilantin due to interaction with coumadin
   . .
   Respiratory failure/VAP-due to stenotrophomonas.  Patient has been on
   TCM for 24 hours and tolerating it well.  Has a vigorous cough.  On
   tobra/cipro with plan for two week course to be completed [**8-3**].  Pt
   coughing worsened overnight, oxygenating well but appeared
   uncomfortable especially with worsened tachycardia.  Switched to AC
   from PSV with minimal improvement.
   - continue tobra/cipro (end date [**8-3**]), and due to PO bioavailablility,
   switching from PO cipro to IV cipro; tobra level ok and will continue
   current dosing
   - continue nebs PRN
   - return to TCM today
   - bronch performed yesterday.
   -will send CXR/sputum  today given spike o/n
   -will consider steroids.

   #fever-pt with several possible sources. Being tx for VAP. Will pan cx
   and continue same abx for now.
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Patient is not
   withdrawing and is on standing ativan.  Did not respond to fentanyl
   boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF boluses,
   either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.
   - consider new infection if fever spikes, no cultures needed at this
   time
   - consider PE if respiratory sats drop
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  Lipase is trending down.  CT scan of the abdomen
   on [**7-25**] shows stable pancreatic pseudocysts.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes, up only mildly today
   - had high residuals again yesterday, continue tube feeds if possible
   Eosinophilia.  Continues to trend up in spite of being off bactrim for
   several days.  Has potentional to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] eosinophilia
   for two weeks after offending [**Doctor Last Name **] removed.
   - continue tobra/cipro for now
   - continue dilantin for now
   - trend eos count
   .
   Hyponatremia-likely secondary to SIADH from multiple neuro insults.
   -ulytes
   -continue to trend.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  Now that patient is finally tolerating tube feeds,
   anticipate patient will have hyperglycemia.
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - s/p pamidronate
   - stop calcitonin today
   - follow ca and monitor for hypocalcemia
   .
   SMV thrombus.  Therapeutic on heparin drip for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal of 50-70 for PTT
   - initiate bridging with coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior NGT
   suctioning, seizures.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of altered mental status, respiratory failure, pancreatitis, sepsis, and anoxic brain damage. The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and respiratory support. The patient's condition has been monitored through frequent vital sign measurements, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support, indicating respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration or complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of anoxic brain damage, acute respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, and seizure. The patient underwent bronchoscopy without significant secretions or inflammation, and continues to cough frequently but responds to lidocaine infusions. The patient has been febrile and started on robitussin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°C, heart rate of 120s, blood pressure ranging from 96/34 mmHg to 145/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on various medications including heparin sodium, famotidine, fentanyl, lorazepam, and dilantin. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, elevated WBC count, increased Hct, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has been diagnosed with leukocytosis, anoxic brain damage, acute pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, altered mental status, and seizure. The patient's current condition is stable in the ICU, receiving proper nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic treatments for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and the current disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis indicate a possible infection, which could worsen if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure and persistent tachycardia suggest a risk of further respiratory compromise.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis without organ dysfunction indicates a systemic inflammatory response, which can progress to septic shock if not treated promptly.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's acute pancreatitis, specifically necrotizing pancreatitis, poses a risk of complications such as infected pancreatic necrosis or pancreatic pseudocyst.
5. Seizure: The patient's seizure history increases the risk of recurrent seizures, which can be potentially life-threatening if not managed appropriately.
6. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient's pre-existing anoxic brain damage puts him at risk of neurological deterioration and potential long-term disability.
7. Blood Clots: The patient's immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots, particularly deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
8. Pressure Ulcers: Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection and other complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical progress to promptly identify and manage any potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo male with prolonged hospitalization following pancreatitis, with
   pseudocyst, SMV thrombosis, chronic respiratory failure, PEA arrest x
   2, seizures, hypercalcemia.
   1. Acute respiratory failure: resolving, back to trach collar and
   stable x 48h but still tachypneic, pna tx as below.
   -pulm toilet
 will recheck CXR and sputum culture
   - if bronch showed moderate inflammation would steroids be appropriate
   for cough too
   - tachypnea likely compensating for metabolic acidosis
 will send VBG
   today
   2. Coughing fits: may be related to trach placement; not having
   purulent sputum production. ?CNS triggered. Perhaps needs a longer
   trach
   -hold on lidocaine for now
   3. Anoxic brain injury/AMS- No obvious neurological change  over the
   past day; however, multifactorial etiology behind his AMS  ( recent
   anoxia, continued seizure activity, hypercalcemia, medications) and
   would not necessarily anticipate a rapid improvement
   -loaded with fosphenytoin [**7-26**] due to continued seizure activity
   -On Keppra and ativan
   -Hypercalcemia has been treated with pamidronate and calcitonin,
   continue to monitor levels
   3. Hypercalcemia: presumably due to immobilization, levels normalizing,
   - monitor levels
   4. Leukocytosis:covering for Pseudomonas VAP and stenotrophomonas UTI
   -Continue tobramycin and ciprofloxacin (planning for 14d course so far,
   end date [**8-2**])
   -Vanco dc
d due to Cdiff negative x 3, linezolid dc
d due to recovery
   of only CoNS from blood cultures with negative surveillance cultures
   -No additional infectious process by abdominal imaging
   5. Eosinophilia: will [**Last Name (LF) 1940**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] ID, could still be related to prior
   bactrim exposure- may remain elevated for days. ?dilantin as
   possibility
   6. Pancreatitis: abdominal imaging showed pseudocysts which have not
   changed appreciably, no evidence of super-infection

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of prolonged hospitalization following pancreatitis, pseudocyst, SMV thrombosis, chronic respiratory failure, PEA arrest x 2, seizures, and hypercalcemia. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, coughing fits, anoxic brain injury/AMS, hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, pancreatitis, SMV thrombus, and hyponatremia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving but still tachypneic. Pulmonary toilet, CXR, and sputum culture will be rechecked. Steroids may be considered if bronchoscopy shows moderate inflammation.
2. Coughing fits: The coughing may be related to tracheostomy placement and could be CNS triggered. A longer tracheostomy tube might be needed, and lidocaine will be held for now.
3. Anoxic brain injury/AMS: The patient's neurological status has not shown obvious change over the past day. The multifactorial etiology behind AMS includes recent anoxia, continued seizure activity, hypercalcemia, and medications. Rapid improvement is not expected.
4. Hypercalcemia: Presumably due to immobilization, levels are normalizing. Calcium levels will be monitored.
5. Leukocytosis: Coverage for Pseudomonas VAP and stenotroph"

   28 yo male with prolonged hospitalization following pancreatitis, with
   pseudocyst, SMV thrombosis, chronic respiratory failure, PEA arrest x
   2, seizures, hypercalcemia.
   1. Acute respiratory failure: resolving, back to trach collar and
   stable x 48h but still tachypneic, pna tx as below.
   -pulm toilet
 will recheck CXR and sputum culture
   - if bronch showed moderate inflammation would steroids be appropriate
   for cough too
   - tachypnea likely compensating for metabolic acidosis
 will send VBG
   today
   2. Coughing fits: may be related to trach placement; not having
   purulent sputum production
   -hold on lidocaine for now
   3. Anoxic brain injury/AMS- No obvious neurological change  over the
   past day; however, multifactorial etiology behind his AMS  ( recent
   anoxia, continued seizure activity, hypercalcemia, medications) and
   would not necessarily anticipate a rapid improvement
   -loaded with fosphenytoin [**7-26**] due to continued seizure activity
   -On Keppra and ativan
   -Hypercalcemia has been treated with pamidronate and calcitonin,
   continue to monitor levels
   3. Hypercalcemia: preumably due to immobilization, levels normalizing,
   -wil dc calcitonin and monitor levels
   4. Leukocytosis:covering for Pseudomonas VAP and stenotrophomonas UTI
   -Continue tobramycin and ciprofloxacin (planning for 14d course so far,
   end date [**8-2**])
   -Vanco dc
d due to Cdiff negative x 3, linezolid dc
d due to recovery
   of only CoNS from blood cultures with negative surveillance cultures
   -No additional infectious process by abdominal imaging
   5. Eosinophilia: will [**Last Name (LF) 1940**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] ID, could still be related to prior
   bactrim exposure- may remain elevated for days. ?dilantin as
   possibility
   6. Pancreatitis: abdominal imaging showed pseudocysts which have not
   changed appreciably, no evidence of super-infection
   -tolerating tube feeds
   7. SMV thrombus: per lit review requires 6 mos anticoag
   -heparin gtt for now, coumadin transition
   8. Hyponatremia
 send urine lytes to eval for SIADH

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of prolonged hospitalization following pancreatitis, pseudocyst, SMV thrombosis, chronic respiratory failure, PEA arrest x 2, seizures, hypercalcemia. He has been experiencing acute respiratory failure, coughing fits, anoxic brain injury/AMS, hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, pancreatitis, SMV thrombus, and hyponatremia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.5 C (101.3 F), heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 145/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume of 590 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, respiratory system compliance of 89, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's physical examination reveals general hiccups, clear lungs without wheeze or rhonchi, tachycardia, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, no rashes, and warm extremities.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.6 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level of 7.2 g/dL, platelet count of 437 K/uL, blood glucose levels ranging from 120 to 231 mg/dL, sodium level of 9 mg/dL, potassium level of 15 mEq/L, chloride level of 3.6 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 17.3 mEq/L, magnesium level of 1.5 mg/dL, calcium level of 9.1 mg/dL, and phosphorus level of 2.3 mg/dL. The patient also has an elevated leukocyte count with neutrophils at 63.8%, lymphocytes at 21.0%, and eosinophils at 10.7%. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of CK, CKMB, Troponin-T, LDH, and abnormal liver function tests.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to tracheostomy irritation and inflammation, continued seizures, hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, pancreatitis, SMV thrombus, and hyponatremia."

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo male with prolonged hospitalization following pancreatitis, with
   pseudocyst, SMV thrombosis, chronic respiratory failure, PEA arrest x
   2, seizures, hypercalcemia.
   1. Acute respiratory failure: resolving, back to trach collar and
   stable x 48h but still tachypneic, pna tx as below.
   -pulm toilet
 will recheck CXR and sputum culture
   - if bronch showed moderate inflammation would steroids be appropriate
   for cough too
   - tachypnea likely compensating for metabolic acidosis
 will send VBG
   today
   2. Coughing fits: may be related to trach placement; not having
   purulent sputum production. ?CNS triggered. Perhaps needs a longer
   trach
   -hold on lidocaine for now
   3. Anoxic brain injury/AMS- No obvious neurological change  over the
   past day; however, multifactorial etiology behind his AMS  ( recent
   anoxia, continued seizure activity, hypercalcemia, medications) and
   would not necessarily anticipate a rapid improvement
   -loaded with fosphenytoin [**7-26**] due to continued seizure activity
   -On Keppra and ativan
   -Hypercalcemia has been treated with pamidronate and calcitonin,
   continue to monitor levels
   3. Hypercalcemia: presumably due to immobilization, levels normalizing,
   - monitor levels
   4. Leukocytosis:covering for Pseudomonas VAP and stenotrophomonas UTI
   -Continue tobramycin and ciprofloxacin (planning for 14d course so far,
   end date [**8-2**])
   -Vanco dc
d due to Cdiff negative x 3, linezolid dc
d due to recovery
   of only CoNS from blood cultures with negative surveillance cultures
   -No additional infectious process by abdominal imaging
   5. Eosinophilia: will [**Last Name (LF) 1940**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] ID, could still be related to prior
   bactrim exposure- may remain elevated for days. ?dilantin as
   possibility
   6. Pancreatitis: abdominal imaging showed pseudocysts which have not
   changed appreciably, no evidence of super-infection
   -tolerating tube feeds
   7. SMV thrombus: per lit review requires 6 mos anticoag
   -heparin gtt for now, coumadin transition
   8. Hyponatremia
 send urine lytes to eval for SIADH

","Summary:
- 28-year-old male with a history of prolonged hospitalization due to pancreatitis, pseudocyst, SMV thrombosis, chronic respiratory failure, PEA arrest x2, seizures, and hypercalcemia.
- Currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, resolving but still tachypneic, on tracheostomy collar.
- Coughing fits possibly related to tracheostomy placement, no purulent sputum production.
- Anoxic brain injury with altered mental status, no obvious neurological change over the past day.
- Hypercalcemia treated with pamidronate and calcitonin, levels normalizing.
- Leukocytosis being covered for Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and stenotrophomonas urinary tract infection (UTI).
- Eosinophilia possibly related to prior bactrim exposure or dilantin.
- Pancreatitis with pseudocysts, no evidence of super-infection.
- SMV thrombus requires 6-month anticoagulation.
- Hyponatremia with plans to send urine lytes to evaluate for SIADH.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving but he remains tachypneic. Continued monitoring and management of respiratory support is necessary.
2. Coughing fits: Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the coughing fits. Possible triggers include tracheostomy placement"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizure,
   being treated for VAP with tobra/cipro.
   .
   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.  Not
   interactive.  He was previously in has been loaded with phenytoin.  No
   longer receiving continue EEG monitor.  Prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg TID
   - continue standing ativan
   - neuro recommends to continue current therapy, may consider switching
   dilantin due to interaction with coumadin
   . .
   Respiratory failure/VAP-due to stenotrophomonas.  Patient has been on
   TCM for 24 hours and tolerating it well.  Has a vigorous cough.  On
   tobra/cipro with plan for two week course to be completed [**8-3**].  Pt
   coughing worsened overnight, oxygenating well but appeared
   uncomfortable especially with worsened tachycardia.  Switched to AC
   from PSV with minimal improvement.
   - continue tobra/cipro (end date [**8-3**]), and due to PO bioavailablility,
   switching from PO cipro to IV cipro; tobra level ok and will continue
   current dosing
   - continue nebs PRN
   - return to TCM today
   - bronch performed yesterday.
   -will send CXR/sputum  today given spike o/n
   -will consider steroids.
   .
   #fever-pt with several possible sources. Being tx for VAP. Will pan cx
   and continue same abx for now.
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Patient is not
   withdrawing and is on standing ativan.  Did not respond to fentanyl
   boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF boluses,
   either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.
   - consider new infection if fever spikes, no cultures needed at this
   time
   - consider PE if respiratory sats drop
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  Lipase is trending down.  CT scan of the abdomen
   on [**7-25**] shows stable pancreatic pseudocysts.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes, up only mildly today
   - had high residuals again yesterday, continue tube feeds if possible
   Eosinophilia.  Continues to trend up in spite of being off bactrim for
   several days.  Has potentional to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] eosinophilia
   for two weeks after offending [**Doctor Last Name **] removed.
   - continue tobra/cipro for now
   - continue dilantin for now
   - trend eos count
   .
   Hyponatremia-likely secondary to SIADH from multiple neuro insults.
   -ulytes
   -continue to trend.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  Now that patient is finally tolerating tube feeds,
   anticipate patient will have hyperglycemia.
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - s/p pamidronate
   - stop calcitonin today
   - follow ca and monitor for hypocalcemia
   .
   SMV thrombus.  Therapeutic on heparin drip for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal of 50-70 for PTT
   - initiate bridging with coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior NGT
   suctioning, seizures.
   - follow bicarb

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory Failure/VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia): The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure and VAP caused by Stenotrophomonas. The current treatment involves using tobramycin and ciprofloxacin, and the plan is to continue the antibiotics for two weeks. However, the patient's coughing worsened overnight, indicating a possible worsening of the respiratory condition. Further evaluation, such as CXR and sputum cultures, is recommended.

2. AMS (Altered Mental Status) secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures: The patient has suffered two PEA (Pulseless Electrical Activity) arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity. The prognosis regarding mental status is poor. The patient is not interactive and requires continued EEG monitoring. Antiepileptic drugs like keppra, phenytoin, and ativan are being used for seizure prophylaxis.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia likely secondary to SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone) from multiple neuro insults. The electrolyte panel shows a sodium level of 324 mEq/L. Further evaluation with ultras and trend of sodium levels is recommended.

4. Eosinophilia: The patient has an increasing eosinophil count despite being off"

   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizure,
   being treated for VAP with tobra/cipro.
   .
   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.  Not
   interactive.  He was previously in has been loaded with phenytoin.  No
   longer receiving continue EEG monitor.  Prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg TID
   - continue standing ativan
   - neuro recommends to continue current therapy, may consider switching
   dilantin due to interaction with coumadin
   . .
   Respiratory failure/VAP-due to stenotrophomonas.  Patient was back on
   AC then weaned to PS overnight.  Has a vigorous cough.  On tobra/cipro
   with plan for two week course to be completed [**8-3**].
   - continue tobra/cipro (end date [**8-3**]), and due to PO bioavailablility,
   switching from PO cipro to IV cipro;
   - discussed tobra levels with ID, will check peak 20 minutes after dose
   tomorrow, for now continue current regimen
   - continue nebs PRN
   - return to TCM today if tolerated
   - bronch performed without anatomical cause for couging.
   -will consider steroids.
   .
   Fever and leukocytosis:  no clear source at this time, cultures are
   pending, GS on sputum showed 4+ GNRs, most likely source is pulmonary
   considering the cough.  [**Month (only) 8**] not be clearing known pseudomonas.
   - continue current abx
   - trend fever curve/ WBCs
   .
   Hyponatremia-likely secondary to SIADH from multiple neuro insults.
   - u lytes and osms consistent with SIADH
   - fluid restrict, will discuss with pharmacy and nutrition
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Patient is not
   withdrawing and is on standing ativan.  Did not respond to fentanyl
   boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF boluses,
   either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.
   - likely secondary to fevers
   - consider PE if respiratory sats drop
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  Lipase is trending down.  CT scan of the abdomen
   on [**7-25**] shows stable pancreatic pseudocysts.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes, down slightly today
   - had high residuals again yesterday, continue tube feeds if possible
   Eosinophilia.  Continues to trend up in spite of being off bactrim for
   several days.  Has potentional to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] eosinophilia
   for two weeks after offending [**Doctor Last Name **] removed.
   - continue tobra/cipro for now
   - continue dilantin for now, monitor for new drug rashes
   - trend eos count
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  Now that patient is finally tolerating tube feeds,
   anticipate patient will have hyperglycemia.
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - s/p pamidronate
   - stopped calcitonin
   - follow ca and monitor for hypocalcemia
   .
   SMV thrombus.  Therapeutic on heparin drip for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis.
   - stopped hep gtt as therapeutic
   - initiate bridging with coumadin with plan for 6 month course

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a prolonged hospitalization history following pancreatitis, pseudocyst, SMV thrombosis, chronic respiratory failure, PEA arrest twice, seizures, and hypercalcemia. He is currently in the ICU with various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and oxygenation is good. It is planned to wean him to a lower level of support today. There is an ongoing concern about treating his known pneumonia due to low antibiotic levels.

2. Coughing fits: These may be related to tracheostomy placement, as the sputum is thick and possibly not being adequately treated. There is also a possibility of CNS involvement, and a longer tracheostomy may be needed. Lidocaine has been held for now.

3. Anoxic brain injury/Acute Mental Status Changes (AMS): There have been no obvious neurological changes over the past day. The AMS could be due to recent anoxia, continued seizure activity, hypercalcemia, and medications. It is unlikely that there will be rapid improvement.

4. Hyponatremia: This is suggested by urine electrolytes indicating SIADH. Fluid restriction will be attempted through pharmacy adjustment of IV medications and nutrition adjustment to tube feeds.

5. Leukocytosis: Coverage is being provided for Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia"

The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. He has a fever of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit, altered mental status, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, leukocytosis, anoxic brain damage, acute pancreatitis, and a history of seizures. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications including Coumadin (Warfarin) and Famotidine (Pepcid). His vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypertension, and normal oxygen saturation. The patient has been receiving fluids and blood products, and his fluid balance shows a positive intake of 3,021 mL with an output of 2,735 mL. His respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR set at 12, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an RSBI of 45. His ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with an HCO3- level of 16 mEq/L. The patient's peripheral pulses and skin were not assessed, and his neurologic examination was also not performed. Lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin level, increased creatinine level, high blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's PT/PTT/INR levels are significantly elevated, indicating a coagulation"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of prolonged hospitalization following pancreatitis, pseudocyst, SMV thrombosis, chronic respiratory failure, PEA arrest x 2, seizures, and hypercalcemia.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation (CPAP/PSV) and is oxygenating well.
- He has a tracheostomy tube in place and is coughing frequently, which may be due to thick sputum and possible pneumonia.
- The patient is experiencing coughing fits that manifest as seizure activity, possibly related to tracheostomy placement or CNS triggered.
- He has anoxic brain injury and altered mental status (AMS) due to recent anoxia, continued seizure activity, hypercalcemia, and medications.
- The patient's sodium levels are low, suggesting SIADH, and he is being fluid restricted.
- He has leukocytosis, which is being covered for Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and stenotrophomonas urinary tract infection (UTI).
- The patient's eosinophil count is elevated, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
- Abdominal imaging shows pseudocysts that have not changed appreciably, with no evidence of super-infection.
- The patient has an SMV thrombus and requires anticoagulation therapy.
- He also has metabolic acidosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of s/p PEA arrest. The patient is currently unresponsive and in encephalopathy. The patient has a history of leukocytosis, necrotizing pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, and seizure. The patient is receiving nutrition through NovaSource Renal (Full) at 40 mL/hour and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines including a PICC line. Prophylaxis measures include DVT prevention with Coumadin, stress ulcer prevention with PPI, and VAP prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's history of leukocytosis and sepsis suggests an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis and potentially organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's necrotizing pancreatitis can progress, leading to complications such as infected pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's encephalopathy and altered mental status may persist or worsen, potentially resulting in prolonged ICU stay and increased risk of complications.
5. Seizure: The patient"

   Respiratory failure/VAP-due to stenotrophomonas.  Patient was back on
   AC then weaned to PS overnight.  Has a vigorous cough.  On tobra/cipro
   with plan for two week course to be completed [**8-3**].
   - continue tobra/cipro (end date [**8-3**]), and due to PO bioavailablility,
   switching from PO cipro to IV cipro;
   - discussed tobra levels with ID, will check peak 20 minutes after dose
   tomorrow, for now continue current regimen
   - continue nebs PRN
   - return to TCM today if tolerated
   - bronch performed without anatomical cause for couging.
   -will consider steroids.

   Fever and leukocytosis:  no clear source at this time, cultures are
   pending, GS on sputum showed 4+ GNRs, most likely source is pulmonary
   considering the cough.  [**Month (only) 8**] not be clearing known pseudomonas.
   - continue current abx
   - trend fever curve/ WBCs

   Hyponatremia-likely secondary to SIADH from multiple neuro insults.
   - u lytes and osms consistent with SIADH
   - fluid restrict, will discuss with pharmacy and nutrition

   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Patient is not
   withdrawing and is on standing ativan.  Did not respond to fentanyl
   boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF boluses,
   either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.
   - likely secondary to fevers
   - consider PE if respiratory sats drop
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  Lipase is trending down.  CT scan of the abdomen
   on [**7-25**] shows stable pancreatic pseudocysts.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes, down slightly today
   - had high residuals again yesterday, continue tube feeds if possible
   Eosinophilia.  Continues to trend up in spite of being off bactrim for
   several days.  Has potentional to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] eosinophilia
   for two weeks after offending [**Doctor Last Name **] removed.
   - continue tobra/cipro for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, and previous PEA arrests. He has suffered an anoxic brain injury with seizure activity and is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. The patient's mental status is poor due to AMS secondary to anoxic brain injury/seizures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/VAP: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently being treated for VAP caused by Stenotrophomonas. He will continue to receive tobramycin and ciprofloxacin until August 3rd. The plan is to switch from oral ciprofloxacin to IV ciprofloxacin due to poor PO bioavailability. Nebulizers will be used as needed, and the patient will be returned to tidal volume-controlled mandatory ventilation (TCM) today if tolerated. A bronch will be performed to identify any anatomical causes for coughing. Steroids may be considered.

2. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient has fever and leukocytosis with no clear source at this time. Cultures are pending, and the most likely source of infection is pulmonary considering the cough. The patient will continue on the current antibiotic regimen, and the trend in fever curve and white blood cell count will be monitored.

   Respiratory failure/VAP.  Patient has vigorous cough and tolerates PS
   better than TCM.  On tobra/cipro with plan for two week course to be
   completed [**8-3**].  However, rising WBC, new infiltrate is suggestive of
   ?new PNA versus inadequately treated VAP, vs other infection.  Sputum
   culture growing 4+ GNRs in spite of double GNR coverage with
   tobra-cipro.

","The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis and pseudocysts. He has suffered two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity. He is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin, despite having rising white blood cell count and fevers. The patient also has hyponatremia likely secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which is consistent with neurologic insults. He is volume overloaded, so a trial of diuresis will be given if no improvement is seen after fluid restriction.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to respiratory failure/VAP. He has a vigorous cough and tolerates pressure support (PS) better than mandatory ventilation (TCM). The sputum culture is growing 4+ Gram-negative rods despite double coverage with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. It is unclear whether this represents a new pneumonia or inadequately treated VAP, or if there might be another infection present. An infectious disease (ID) consult has been requested for antibiotic management in a patient with multiple allergies and already being double covered for GNRs.

The patient has tachycardia with no clear etiology. He is not withdrawing and is on standing lorazepam. The tachycardia did not respond to fentanyl boluses or extra loraz"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a complicated hospital course following alcoholic pancreatitis, pseudocysts, anoxic encephalopathy, seizure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure and has leukocytosis with persistent GNR's from cultures, suggesting inadequate treatment. He is on PSV ventilation and will be weaned as tolerated. The patient also has altered mental status, likely due to a combination of factors including anoxic encephalopathy, infections, hypercalcemia, and seizures. He is on medications for seizures and has mildly improved hyponatremia with water restriction. Pancreatic enzymes are decreasing, but the etiology for nausea and vomiting is unclear. The patient still has elevated hypercalcemia, which is being monitored daily, and calcitonin may be used if it continues to rise. Additionally, the patient has a superior mesenteric vein thrombus and is on anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an ongoing infection or inadequate treatment, which could lead to further complications if not addressed promptly.
3. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient has anoxic encephalopathy, which can result"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a complicated hospital course following alcoholic pancreatitis. He has several medical conditions and complications, including acute respiratory failure, leukocytosis, altered mental status, anoxic encephalopathy, seizure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure. If not properly managed, this can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially progress to respiratory arrest.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's persistent leukocytosis indicates an ongoing infection or inadequate treatment. If left untreated or if the infection spreads, it can lead to severe sepsis or septic shock.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be a result of anoxic encephalopathy or other factors such as infections or hypercalcemia. If not addressed, this can potentially lead to further cognitive decline or even coma.

4. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. If sepsis progresses, it can result in septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and potentially death.

5. Pancreatitis: Although the patient's pancreatic enzymes are decreasing, there is still ongoing pancreatitis. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to complications such as necrotizing pancreatitis or pancreatic pseudocysts.

   Respiratory failure/VAP.  Patient has vigorous cough and tolerates PS
   better than TCM.  On tobra/cipro with plan for two week course to be
   completed [**8-3**].  However, rising WBC, new infiltrate is suggestive of
   ?new PNA versus inadequately treated VAP, vs other infection.  Sputum
   culture growing 4+ GNRs in spite of double GNR coverage with
   tobra-cipro.
   - continue tobra/cipro (end date [**8-3**])
   - check peak tobra levels to ensure adequate dosing
   - continue nebs PRN
   - consider TCM trial today
   - ID consult for Abx management in patient with multiple allergies and
   already being double covered for GNRs with tobra/cipro

   Hyponatremia-likely secondary to SIADH from multiple neuro insults.
   Urine lytes and osms consistent with SIADH.  Will give trial of
   diuresis if no improvement after fluid restriction given that patient
   is volume overloaded.

   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Patient is not
   withdrawing and is on standing ativan.  Did not respond to fentanyl
   boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF boluses,
   either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely partially related
   to fevers, though tachycardia precedes fevers.

   downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes

   Eosinophilia.  Persistent eosinophilia in spite of being off bactrim
   for several days.  Has potentional to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**]
   eosinophilia for two weeks after offending [**Doctor Last Name **] removed.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   related to dilantin, but will continue to follow for now.
   - continue tobra/cipro for now

   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  Now that patient is finally tolerating tube feeds,
   anticipate patient will have hyperglycemia.
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia

   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, and anoxic brain injury secondary to two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin, but has rising white blood cell (WBC) count and fevers.

The patient also has acute mental status changes (AMS) due to anoxic brain injury and seizures. Neurological recommendations include continuing keppra, phenytoin, and lorazepam. The patient's respiratory failure/VAP is being managed with tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, nebulized bronchodilators, and consideration for a trial of closed-loop positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV).

The patient has hyponatremia likely secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) from multiple neuro insults. Fluid restriction is being implemented initially, with a plan for diuresis if there is no improvement after fluid restriction.

Tachycardia of unclear etiology is also present. The patient has severe necrotizing pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation and is being monitored for pancreatic enzymes. Eosinophilia is persistent despite being off bactrim, and potential causes are being investigated.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizure,
   being treated for VAP with tobra/cipro, though having rising WBC and
   fevers.

   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.  Not
   interactive.  He was previously in has been loaded with phenytoin.  No
   longer receiving continue EEG monitor.  Prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg TID
   - continue standing ativan
   - neuro recommends to continue current therapy, may consider switching
   dilantin due to interaction with coumadin

   Respiratory failure/VAP.  Patient has vigorous cough and tolerates PS
   better than TCM.  On tobra/cipro with plan for two week course to be
   completed [**8-3**].  However, rising WBC, new infiltrate is suggestive of
   ?new PNA versus inadequately treated VAP, vs other infection.  Sputum
   culture growing 4+ GNRs in spite of double GNR coverage with
   tobra-cipro.
   - continue tobra/cipro (end date [**8-3**])
   - check peak tobra levels to ensure adequate dosing
   - continue nebs PRN
   - consider TCM trial today
   - ID consult for Abx management in patient with multiple allergies and
   already being double covered for GNRs with tobra/cipro
   .
   Hyponatremia-likely secondary to SIADH from multiple neuro insults.
   Urine lytes and osms consistent with SIADH.  Will give trial of
   diuresis if no improvement after fluid restriction given that patient
   is volume overloaded.
   - fluid restrict
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Patient is not
   withdrawing and is on standing ativan.  Did not respond to fentanyl
   boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF boluses,
   either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely partially related
   to fevers, though tachycardia precedes fevers.

   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  Lipase is trending down.  CT scan of the abdomen
   on [**7-25**] shows stable pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend
   downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds at reduce rates due to vomiting today
   Eosinophilia.  Persistent eosinophilia in spite of being off bactrim
   for several days.  Has potentional to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**]
   eosinophilia for two weeks after offending [**Doctor Last Name **] removed.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   related to dilantin, but will continue to follow for now.
   - continue tobra/cipro for now
   - continue dilantin for now
   - trend eos count
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  Now that patient is finally tolerating tube feeds,
   anticipate patient will have hyperglycemia.
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - s/p pamidronate
   - stopped calcitonin; will monitor Ca and consider resuming calcitonin
   if need

   SMV thrombus.  S/p heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis.
   - continue coumadin with plan for 6 month course

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is showing signs of infection, including fevers and rising white blood cell count. The sputum culture is growing 4+ GNRs, suggesting a possible infection. The current treatment with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin may not be effective, and there is a need for further antibiotic management.

2. Seizure and anoxic brain injury: The patient has suffered two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity. The prognosis regarding mental status is poor, and the patient is not interactive. There is a need to continue seizure prophylaxis with keppra and phenytoin.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia likely secondary to SIADH from multiple neuro insults. Fluid restriction should be initiated, and if no improvement is seen, a trial of diuresis can be considered.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has an unexplained tachycardia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

5. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe necrotizing pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation. The lipase levels are trending down, indicating improvement, but close monitoring of pancreatic enzymes is necessary.

6. Eosinophilia: The patient has persistent eos"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizure,
   being treated for VAP with tobra/cipro, though having rising WBC and
   fevers.
   Fever/Leukocytosis:  most likely secondary to pneumonia as sputum
   growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas.  The tobra and cipro seem
   appropriately dosed, but we did adjust timing per ID recs.  Could be
   other source, including c.diff as his abd exam is slightly tender and
   his stool output has increased.
   - send stool for c.diff culture, added PO flagyl for empiric treatment
   - tobra/cipro as dosed above per ID recs
   - allergy consult for meropenem desensitization and possible test of
   other cephalosporins
   - consider colistin if patient hemodynamics change
   - consider fluconazole for yeast in urine if it regrows after foley
   change
   - will try to obtain peripheral access, pull PICC and culture line
   .
   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.  Not
   interactive.  He was previously in has been loaded with phenytoin.  No
   longer receiving continue EEG monitor.  Prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg TID
   - continue standing ativan
   - neuro recommends to continue current therapy, checking dilantin level
   in AM
   . .
   Respiratory failure/VAP.  Patient has vigorous cough and tolerates PS
   better than TCM.  On tobra/cipro with plan for two week course to be
   completed [**8-3**].  However, rising WBC, new infiltrate is suggestive of
   ?new PNA versus inadequately treated VAP, vs other infection.  Sputum
   culture growing 4+ GNRs in spite of double GNR coverage with
   tobra-cipro.
   - continue tobra/cipro (end date [**8-3**]), see above for treatment plan
   - continue nebs PRN
   - continue to keep on PS for now
   .
   Hyponatremia-likely secondary to SIADH from multiple neuro insults.
   Urine lytes and osms consistent with SIADH.  Will give trial of
   diuresis if no improvement after fluid restriction given that patient
   is volume overloaded.
   - fluid restrict
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely
   partially related to fevers, though tachycardia precedes fevers.
   - telemetry, has somewhat stabalized in 110s
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  Lipase is trending down.  CT scan of the abdomen
   on [**7-25**] shows stable pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend
   downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds at reduce rates due to vomiting today
   - consider abd exam if persistent fevers
   Eosinophilia.  Persistent eosinophilia in spite of being off bactrim
   for several days.  Has potentional to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**]
   eosinophilia for two weeks after offending [**Doctor Last Name **] removed.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   related to dilantin, but will continue to follow for now.
   - continue tobra/cipro for now
   - resolved because having stress reaction, cont to monitor diffs
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  In setting of worsening infection, has had increasing
   hyperglycemia
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - s/p pamidronate
   - consider restarting calcitonin as ca is on the upper limit of normal,
   but stable
   .
   SMV thrombus.  S/p heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis.
   - continue coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   - decrease from 2 mg to 1 mg given flagyl initiation
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior NGT
   suctioning, seizures.
   - follow bicarb

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis and subsequent pseudocyst formation. He has experienced two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests, resulting in anoxic brain injury and seizure activity. The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin, but is still experiencing fevers and rising white blood cell count (WBC).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure of 115/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His physical examination reveals tracheostomy site erythema and skin erosion with mild purulent discharge, coarse breath sounds diffusely, and peripheral edema with more pronounced edema in the right leg.

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count of 31.0 K/uL, elevated serum glucose of 176 mg/dL, elevated creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, hyponatremia with sodium levels at 103 mEq/L, and hypercalcemia with calcium levels at 9.2 mg/dL. Imaging studies show stable pancreatic pseudocysts.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a complicated hospital course following alcoholic pancreatitis. He has been diagnosed with pseudocysts post-pancreatitis, anoxic encephalopathy, seizure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure - The patient has persistent VAP despite being on tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. There is a need for continued ventilator support and consideration of changing antibiotic therapy.

2. Leukocytosis - The patient has persistent growth of Pseudomonas in urine and sputum, along with diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. This suggests ongoing infection, and appropriate antibiotic coverage needs to be maintained.

3. Clostridium difficile infection - Given the presence of leukocytosis and diarrhea, there is a concern for Clostridium difficile infection. Empiric treatment with metronidazole and possible oral vancomycin should be considered, and follow-up C. difficile toxin assay is recommended.

4. Multifactorial altered mental status - The patient's minimal change in mental status can be attributed to multiple factors, including anoxic encephalopathy, infections, hypercalcemia, and seizures. Continuing seizure prophylaxis with keppra and dilantin is advised.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo male with complicated hospital course following alcoholic
   pancreatitis [**5-12**] with pseudocysts post-pacnreatitis, anoxic
   encephalopahty, seizure, VAP
   1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure- Pseudomonas VAP, persistent
   despite tobramycin and ciprofloxacin
   -on cipro and tobra for Pseudomonas VAP
   -asking Allergy to assist w/ meropenem desensitization per ID request
   -per ID, linezolid added yest for empiric GPC coverage
   -vent support for now
   2. Leukocytosis- persistent Pseudomonas growth in urine and sputum,
   also w/ diarrhea and abd discomfort
   -VAP coverage and ABX issues as above
   -empiric C.diff w/ metronidazole and poss po vanco; f/u C.diff toxin
   assay
   -may consider treating yeast in urine, but will check on urine
   post-foley change
   3. AMS: minimal change, though multifactorial (anoxic enceph.,
   infections, hypercalcemia, seizures). Continue keppra/dilantin for
   seizures.
   4. Hyponatremia: mildly improved with free water restriction.
   5. Pancreatitis: Pancreatic enzymes decreasing. Had been tolerating
   TF's in past few days, so etiology for N/V unclear, perhaps related to
   acute infxn. Lipase continuing to downtrend. tf at lower rate as
   tolerated
   -following LFTs and amylase/lipase
   -consider CT a/p if still no response to tx for infectious issues as
   above
   6. Hypercalcemia: stable, follow daily, calcitonin if it conitnues to
   rise
   7. SMV thrombus: on coumadin anticoagulation
   -down-dose coumadin today given addition of ABX, 1mg/d and follow INR
   Remainder of plan as per housestaff note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a complicated hospital course following alcoholic pancreatitis, pseudocysts post-pancreatitis, anoxic encephalopathy, seizure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic respiratory failure due to Pseudomonas VAP, which has not improved despite being treated with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. The patient also has leukocytosis with persistent Pseudomonas growth in urine and sputum, as well as diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. He is currently on empiric coverage for GPC, C. difficile, and yeast in urine. The patient's mental status has improved minimally, and he continues to receive anticonvulsant medications. He has mild hyponatremia that has improved with free water restriction. His pancreatitis enzymes are decreasing, but he is still experiencing nausea and vomiting. The patient has hypercalcemia and is being monitored closely. He also has a SMV thrombus and is on coumadin anticoagulation. The patient's overall condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure - The patient's respiratory function is compromised due to Pseudomonas VAP, which has not improved with current antibiotic treatment. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory status.
2. Leukocytosis with persistent Pseudomonas growth - The presence of persistent P"

   -ID, prefers to tx with meropenem with allergies recs re: desensit as
   30% of people develop irreversible renal failure with colistin. also
   prefer to await sensitivities. Would tx with fluconazole if persistent
   yeast despite foley change.
   -ID asked to start ceftaz while awaiting decision from allergy re:
   meropenem desensit
   -allergy consulted
   -asked neuro re: benzos, state 1mg q8h is ok, but do slowly
   -tx empirically for c.diff with po flagyl
   -PIVs attempted, keeping picc for today as may start meropenem and
   ?anaphylaxis etc.
   -allergy believes no value in meropenem desensit as delayed/cell

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizure,
   being treated for VAP with tobra/cipro, though having rising WBC and
   fevers.
   Fever/Leukocytosis:  most likely secondary to pneumonia as sputum
   growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas.  The tobra and cipro seem
   appropriately dosed, but we did adjust timing per ID recs.  Could be
   other source, including c.diff as his abd exam is slightly tender and
   his stool output has increased.
   - send stool for c.diff culture, added PO flagyl for empiric treatment
   - tobra/cipro as dosed above per ID recs
   - allergy consult for meropenem desensitization and possible test of
   other cephalosporins
   - consider colistin if patient hemodynamics change
   - consider fluconazole for yeast in urine if it regrows after foley
   change
   - will try to obtain peripheral access, pull PICC and culture line
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, and previous PEA arrests resulting in anoxic brain injury and seizures.
- He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin, but has rising white blood cell count and fevers.
- Sputum culture shows growth of 2 colonies of Pseudomonas, so adjustments to antibiotic timing were made per ID recommendations.
- There is a possibility of other sources of infection, including Clostridium difficile, given the patient's slightly tender abdomen and increased stool output.
- Stool culture for C. difficile was sent, and empiric treatment with PO flagyl was initiated.
- Allergy consult was requested for meropenem desensitization and possible test of other cephalosporins.
- Colistin may be considered if the patient's hemodynamics change.
- Fluconazole might be considered for yeast in urine if it regrows after Foley catheter change.
- The patient's anoxic brain injury and seizures have resulted in altered mental status (AMS), with poor prognosis regarding mental status.
- Neurology recommends continuing current therapy, checking Dilantin level in the morning.
- The patient has respiratory failure/VAP with a vigorous cough and tolerates pressure support (PS) better than tidal volume-controlled mandatory ventilation (TCM).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions. The patient's chief complaints are anoxic brain injury and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient has a history of allergies to meropenem and has been advised to avoid this antibiotic due to the risk of anaphylaxis. The physician prefers to await sensitivities before initiating treatment. If persistent yeast infection is observed despite a Foley catheter change, the patient may be treated with fluconazole.

The patient's recent events include the ID recommending meropenem with allergies suggesting desensitization as 30% of people develop irreversible renal failure with colistin. The ID also suggested starting ceftazidime while awaiting a decision from allergy regarding meropenem desensitization. Allergy consultation was obtained, and neuro consultation was sought regarding the use of benzodiazepines, with the recommendation to administer 1 mg of lorazepam every 8 hours but do so slowly.

Empirical treatment for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection was initiated with oral Flagyl. Peripheral intravenous lines (PIVs) were attempted, with the decision to keep the PICC line in place for today as meropenem may be started and possibly anaphylaxis, etc.

The patient experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizures and was given 1 mg of ativan with good effect.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizures,
   with ongoing fevers likely secondary to resistant pseudomonas VAP.
   Fever/Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to pneumonia as sputum
   growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas, which is likely secondary to
   resistance.  Could be other source, including c.diff as his abd exam is
   slightly tender and his stool output has increased.  Overall, WBC with
   additional of linezolid, ceftaz and flagyl.  Allergy did not feel that
   desensitization for meropenem would be effective as this was a type 4
   rather than type 1 reaction.
   - d/c cipro as this is lowering seizure threshold and pseudomonas is
   resistant to cipro
   - continue tobra (d1 = [**7-23**]) , but reduce frequency to q 48 hours given
   that 36 hour trough was 1.6
   - continue ceftaz  (day 1 = [**7-31**]) as double coverage
   - continue flagyl (day 1 = [**7-31**]) for empiric c. diff treatment and send
   more stool samples for c. diff; consider d/c of flagyl tomorrow if c.
   diff neg again
   - d/c linezolid as no clear gram positive source
   - cosider meropenem if febrile or unstable; skin blistering occurred in
   the setting of anasarca and occurred predominantly on the legs which is
   atypical for a drug rash; nevertheless, we will reserve [**Last Name (un) **] unless
   absolutely necessary
   - f/u colisitin sensitivies for pseudomonas, though would prefer to
   avoid this as it can cause irreversible renal failure
   .
   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.  Not
   interactive.  He was previously in has been loaded with phenytoin.  Has
   two witnessed tonic clonic seizures last night.  Prognosis regarding
   mental status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg TID
   - reload phenytoin per neuro
   - continue standing ativan
 no taper given recent seizures
   - d/c cipro as this lowers the seizure threshold
   . .
   Respiratory failure/VAP.  Patient had vigorous cough and has been
   tolerating PS better than TCM.  However, rising WBC and fevers is
   suggestive of ?new PNA versus inadequately treated VAP, vs other
   infection.  Sputum culture growing 4+ GNRs in spite of double GNR
   coverage with tobra-cipro. In light of cipro resistance, abx have been
   changed to tobra/ceftaz for double gram negative coverage.
   - continue tobra/ ceftaz; d/c cipro
   - continue nebs PRN
   - TCM trial today
   .
   Hyponatremia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and
   seizures.  Also may be hypovolemic.
   - fluid restrict
   - consider diuresis tomorrow if no improvement.
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely
   partially related to fevers, though tachycardia precedes fevers.  It
   has somewhat stabalized in 100s to 110s.
   - telemetry
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Improving; may have been secondary to bactrim exposure.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  In setting of worsening infection, has had increasing
   hyperglycemia
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.   S/p
   pamidronate and Calcitonin.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   .
   SMV thrombus.  S/p heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis.
   - continue coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior saline
   infusion and seizures.
   - follow bicarb

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis and subsequent pseudocysts. He has experienced two PEA arrests and is now suffering from anoxic brain injury and seizures. The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) likely secondary to resistant pseudomonas, and his fever and leukocytosis suggest ongoing infection. He also has c.diff, which is being treated empirically with flagyl. The patient's medications include Coumadin, Pepcid, Dilantin, Lorazepam, Ceftazidime, and Flagyl. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and hypercalcemia. The patient's prognosis regarding mental status is poor due to AMS secondary to anoxic brain injury and seizures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's current infection is likely due to resistant pseudomonas, which requires aggressive treatment. There is a risk of further deterioration if the infection is not adequately managed.
2. Clostridium difficile (c.diff) infection: The patient's increased stool output and tender abdomen suggest a possible worsening of c.diff infection. This needs to be monitored closely, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent spread to other patients.
3. Seizure activity: The patient has experienced seizures, which could be related to the anoxic brain injury. It is crucial to continue seizure"

   1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure- Pseudomonas VAP, persistent
   despite tobramycin and ciprofloxacin
   On PS ventilation and will continue to wean: decrease to PS 5 and if he
   tolerates, will consider TC this afternoon
   2. Leukocytosis- persistent Pseudomonas growth in urine and sputum. His
   leukocytosis is decreased today. Multiple abx added yesterday, so
   unclear which one caused the improvement. Given high MIC to Ceftazidine
   (8); ID remains concerned that his current abx coverage will be
   inadequate to treat his Pseudomonas VAP which is newly resistant to
   cipro
   *Ceftazidine and Tobramycin for Pseudomonas VAP
   *Cultures so far negative for GPC infection so will dc linezolid. Will
   also dc ciproflox given resistance to Pseudomonas. Continue flagyl for
   empiric Cdiff coverage
   *No benefit from desensitization per Allergy consult. Risks of
   re-administering Merepenem acknowledged; however, it appears there
   aren't any other adequate therpeutic options left. Will touch base with
   them regarding degree of systemic risk associated with giving Merepenem
   3. AMS: multifactorial (anoxic enceph., infections, hypercalcemia,
   seizures).Spoke with neuro consult team who attribute seizures
   yesterday to a known interaction between dilantin and coumadin
   resulting in subtherapeutic dosing.
   *Loaded with fosphenytoin this morning
   *Neuro will contact with recs in dilantin dosing based on post-loading
   level
   *No changes to current doses of keppra and lorazepam
    4. Hyponatremia: mildly decreased this morning, despite free water
   restriction. Could reflect recent seizure activity. Will re-check
   tomorrow. Consider diuresis if it remains low
   5. Pancreatitis: Pancreatic enzymes decreasing. Lipase continuing to
   downtrend. Continue TF as tolerated

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a complicated hospital course following alcoholic pancreatitis, pseudocysts post-pancreatitis, anoxic encephalopathy, seizure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has acute on chronic respiratory failure due to Pseudomonas VAP, persistent leukocytosis, acute pancreatitis with necrotizing pancreatitis, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, and seizure without status epilepticus.

Plan:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure - Continue weaning from mechanical ventilation and consider transitioning to spontaneous breathing trials.
2. Leukocytosis - Monitor improvement in leukocyte count after adding multiple antibiotics.
3. Pancreatitis - Continue enteral nutrition and monitor pancreatic enzyme levels.
4. Anoxic brain damage - ManageAMS and seizures by optimizing antiepileptic drug dosing and considering further interventions.
5. Hyponatremia - Recheck serum sodium levels tomorrow and consider diuresis if low.
6. Hypercalcemia - Monitor calcium levels daily and consider calcitonin therapy if necessary.
7. SMV thrombus - Continue anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure - Continued inadequate oxygenation or ventilation despite weaning efforts.

   1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure- Pseudomonas VAP, persistent
   despite tobramycin and ciprofloxacin
   On PS ventilation and will continue to wean: decrease to PS 5 and if he
   tolerates, will consider TC this afternoon
   2. Leukocytosis- persistent Pseudomonas growth in urine and sputum. His
   leukocytosis is decreased today. Multiple abx added yesterday, so
   unclear which one caused the improvement. Given high MIC to Ceftazidine
   (8); ID remains concerned that his current abx coverage will be
   inadequate to treat his Pseudomonas VAP which is newly resistant to
   cipro
   *Ceftazidine and Tobramycin for Pseudomonas VAP
   *Cultures so far negative for GPC infection so will dc linezolid. Will
   also dc ciproflox given resistance to Pseudomonas. Continue flagyl for
   empiric Cdiff coverage
   *No benefit from desensitization per Allergy consult. Risks of
   re-administering Merepenem acknowledged; however, it appears there
   aren't any other adequate therpeutic options left. Will touch base with
   them regarding degree of systemic risk associated with giving Merepenem
   3. AMS: multifactorial (anoxic enceph., infections, hypercalcemia,
   seizures).Spoke with neuro consult team who attribute seizures
   yesterday to a known interaction between dilantin and coumadin
   resulting in subtherapeutic dosing.
   *Loaded with fosphenytoin this morning
   *Neuro will contact with recs in dilantin dosing based on post-loading
   level
   *No changes to current doses of keppra and lorazepam
    4. Hyponatremia: mildly decreased this morning, despite free water
   restriction. Could reflect recent seizure activity. Will re-check
   tomorrow. Consider diuresis if it remains low
   5. Pancreatitis: Pancreatic enzymes decreasing. Lipase continuing to
   downtrend. Continue TF as tolerated
   -following LFTs and amylase/lipase
   6. Hypercalcemia: stable, follow daily, calcitonin if it conitnues to
   rise

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a complicated hospital course following alcoholic pancreatitis. He has multiple comorbidities including anoxic encephalopathy, seizure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), leukocytosis, acute on chronic respiratory failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's current condition includes acute pancreatitis with necrotizing changes, respiratory failure, sepsis, altered mental status, and a seizure. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient has persistent VAP despite receiving tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and will continue to be weaned off the ventilator. The plan is to decrease the PS level to 5 and consider transitioning to a tracheostomy if tolerated.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely due to persistent Pseudomonas growth in urine and sputum. The recent addition of multiple antibiotics may have contributed to the improvement of leukocytosis. However, given the high MIC to ceftazidime, the ID remains concerned about the adequacy of the current antibiotic coverage for treating Pseudomonas VAP.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatic enzymes are decreasing, indicating improvement in pancreatitis. However, the presence of nec"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient with decreasing leukocytosis, decreasing fever curve; ID
   recommends staying course for pseudomonas treatment, although think we
   will likely have ceftaz resistance soon
   - continued ceftaz, tobra (changed dosing from q36 to q48hrs), and
   flagyl (although c.diff was negative)
   - stopped linezolid as no evidence of GPC
   - stopped cipro as pseudomonas cipro resistant
   - neuro recommended loading dose of dilantin and then changed daily
   dosing to 100 mg at 8am, 100 mg at 4pm, 200 mg at 12am, will check
   dilantin level tomorrow
   - no new recs from endo, cont to monitor calcium

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including anemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, leukocytosis, anoxic brain damage, acute pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, and seizure. The patient is receiving treatment for these conditions and is being closely monitored. The patient's vital signs are stable, and they are maintaining adequate oxygenation. However, there is concern about the patient's tolerance to a tracheostomy mask and their ability to breathe without ventilatory support. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and antiepileptic drugs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure and is currently on ventilatory support. There is a potential risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and immobility.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. If not appropriately managed, it can progress to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizures,
   with ongoing fevers likely secondary to resistant pseudomonas VAP.
   Fever/Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to pneumonia as sputum
   growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas, which is likely secondary to
   resistance.  Could be other source, including c.diff as his abd exam is
   slightly tender and his stool output has increased.  Overall, WBC with
   additional of linezolid, ceftaz and flagyl.  Allergy did not feel that
   desensitization for meropenem would be effective as this was a type 4
   rather than type 1 reaction.
   - d/c cipro as this is lowering seizure threshold and pseudomonas is
   resistant to cipro
   - continue tobra (d1 = [**7-23**]) , but reduce frequency to q 48 hours given
   that 36 hour trough was 1.6
   - continue ceftaz  (day 1 = [**7-31**]) as double coverage
   - continue flagyl (day 1 = [**7-31**]) for empiric c. diff treatment and send
   more stool samples for c. diff; consider d/c of flagyl tomorrow if c.
   diff neg again
   - d/c linezolid as no clear gram positive source
   - cosider meropenem if febrile or unstable; skin blistering occurred in
   the setting of anasarca and occurred predominantly on the legs which is
   atypical for a drug rash; nevertheless, we will reserve [**Last Name (un) **] unless
   absolutely necessary
   - f/u colisitin sensitivies for pseudomonas, though would prefer to
   avoid this as it can cause irreversible renal failure
   .
   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.  Not
   interactive.  He was previously in has been loaded with phenytoin.  Has
   two witnessed tonic clonic seizures last night.  Prognosis regarding
   mental status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg TID
   - reload phenytoin per neuro
   - continue standing ativan
 no taper given recent seizures
   - d/c cipro as this lowers the seizure threshold
   . .
   Respiratory failure/VAP.  Patient had vigorous cough and has been
   tolerating PS better than TCM.  However, rising WBC and fevers is
   suggestive of ?new PNA versus inadequately treated VAP, vs other
   infection.  Sputum culture growing 4+ GNRs in spite of double GNR
   coverage with tobra-cipro. In light of cipro resistance, abx have been
   changed to tobra/ceftaz for double gram negative coverage.
   - continue tobra/ ceftaz; d/c cipro
   - continue nebs PRN
   - TCM trial today
   .
   Hyponatremia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and
   seizures.  Also may be hypovolemic.
   - fluid restrict
   - consider diuresis tomorrow if no improvement.
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely
   partially related to fevers, though tachycardia precedes fevers.  It
   has somewhat stabalized in 100s to 110s.
   - telemetry
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Improving; may have been secondary to bactrim exposure.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  In setting of worsening infection, has had increasing
   hyperglycemia
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.   S/p
   pamidronate and Calcitonin.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   .
   SMV thrombus.  S/p heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis.
   - continue coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior saline
   infusion and seizures.
   - follow bicarb

He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Summary:
- The patient's leukocytosis and fever curve have been decreasing, and the ID recommends continuing the current antibiotic regimen for pseudomonas treatment.
- The patient is allergic to meropenem, so desensitization is not recommended.
- Tobramycin, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and linezolid have been discontinued due to resistance or lack of efficacy.
- Ceftazidime is being continued as double coverage for pseudomonas.
- Flagyl is being continued empirically for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) treatment, and more stool samples will be sent for C. diff.
- Dilantin has been started for seizure prophylaxis, and the level will be checked tomorrow.
- Coumadin has been started for bridging SMV thrombus likely secondary to severe pancreatitis.
- Fluid restriction is being implemented due to hyponatremia, which may be central SIADH or hypovolemic.
- Telemetry is ongoing due to tachycardia without a clear etiology.
- Pancreatic enzymes are trending downward, indicating improvement in pancreatitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizures,
   with ongoing fevers likely secondary to resistant pseudomonas VAP.
   Fever/Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to pneumonia as sputum
   growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas, which is likely secondary to
   resistance.  Could be other source, including c.diff as his abd exam is
   slightly tender and his stool output has increased.  Overall, WBC with
   additional of linezolid, ceftaz and flagyl.  Allergy did not feel that
   desensitization for meropenem would be effective as this was a type 4
   rather than type 1 reaction.
   - d/c cipro as this is lowering seizure threshold and pseudomonas is
   resistant to cipro
   - continue tobra (d1 = [**7-23**]) , but reduce frequency to q 48 hours given
   that 36 hour trough was 1.6
   - continue ceftaz  (day 1 = [**7-31**]) as double coverage
   - continue flagyl (day 1 = [**7-31**]) for empiric c. diff treatment and send
   more stool samples for c. diff; consider d/c of flagyl tomorrow if c.
   diff neg again
   - d/c linezolid as no clear gram positive source
   - cosider meropenem if febrile or unstable; skin blistering occurred in
   the setting of anasarca and occurred predominantly on the legs which is
   atypical for a drug rash; nevertheless, we will reserve [**Last Name (un) **] unless
   absolutely necessary
   - f/u colisitin sensitivies for pseudomonas, though would prefer to
   avoid this as it can cause irreversible renal failure
   .
   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.  Not
   interactive.  He was previously in has been loaded with phenytoin.  Has
   two witnessed tonic clonic seizures last night.  Prognosis regarding
   mental status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue phenytoin 100 mg TID
   - reload phenytoin per neuro
   - continue standing ativan
 no taper given recent seizures
   - d/c cipro as this lowers the seizure threshold
   . .
   Respiratory failure/VAP.  Patient had vigorous cough and has been
   tolerating PS better than TCM.  However, rising WBC and fevers is
   suggestive of ?new PNA versus inadequately treated VAP, vs other
   infection.  Sputum culture growing 4+ GNRs in spite of double GNR
   coverage with tobra-cipro. In light of cipro resistance, abx have been
   changed to tobra/ceftaz for double gram negative coverage.
   - continue tobra/ ceftaz; d/c cipro
   - continue nebs PRN
   - TCM trial today
   .
   Hyponatremia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and
   seizures.  Also may be hypovolemic.
   - fluid restrict
   - consider diuresis tomorrow if no improvement.
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely
   partially related to fevers, though tachycardia precedes fevers.  It
   has somewhat stabalized in 100s to 110s.
   - telemetry
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Improving; may have been secondary to bactrim exposure.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  In setting of worsening infection, has had increasing
   hyperglycemia
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.   S/p
   pamidronate and Calcitonin.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   .
   SMV thrombus.  S/p heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis.
   - continue coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior saline
   infusion and seizures.
   - follow bicarb

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis and pseudocysts, who experienced two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest with subsequent anoxic brain injury and seizures. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with the following potential medical complications:

1. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has been experiencing decreasing fever and leukocytosis, which is likely secondary to pneumonia caused by resistant pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The current treatment includes Tobramycin, Ceftazidime, and Flagyl. The antibiotic regimen may need to be adjusted based on culture sensitivity results.

2. AMS (Altered Mental Status) secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures: The patient is not interactive and has suffered two PEA arrests, resulting in anoxic brain injury with ongoing seizure activity. Phenytoin has been loaded, and additional antiepileptic medications such as Kendra and Ativan are being continued. The prognosis regarding mental status is poor.

3. Respiratory Failure/VAP: The patient has shown signs of respiratory failure, including a vigorous cough and intolerance to tracheostomy mask (TCM). Despite double coverage with Tobramycin and Ciprofloxacin, the sputum culture is growing 4+ Gram-negative rods. Antibiotic therapy has been changed to include Ceftazidime for double Gram"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, PEA arrest, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He is currently being treated for resistant pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's fever and leukocytosis have been improving, and he is showing clinical improvement. 

The patient has been prescribed ceftazidime, tobramycin, and metronidazole for the pseudomonas infection. The dosage of tobramycin has been adjusted to every 48 hours due to a 36-hour trough level of 1.6. Flagyl has been stopped as c.diff negative and stool output is stable. Meropenem may be considered if the patient becomes febrile or unstable, but it is noted that the patient experienced skin blistering with meropenem in the past. Colistin sensitivities for pseudomonas are being followed, although this antibiotic can cause irreversible renal failure.

The patient's mental status is poor, and he has had two witnessed tonic-clonic seizures last night. He has been loaded with phenytoin and is currently on keppra 1 g. Dilantin has been reloaded with one gram, and the dosing has been changed to 100 mg at 8 am and 4 pm, and"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient with decreasing leukocytosis, decreasing fever curve; ID
   recommends staying course for pseudomonas treatment, although think we
   will likely have ceftaz resistance soon
   - continued ceftaz, tobra (changed dosing from q36 to q48hrs), and
   flagyl (although c.diff was negative)
   - stopped linezolid as no evidence of GPC
   - stopped cipro as pseudomonas cipro resistant
   - neuro recommended loading dose of dilantin and then changed daily
   dosing to 100 mg at 8am, 100 mg at 4pm, 200 mg at 12am, will check
   dilantin level tomorrow
   - no new recs from endo, cont to monitor calcium

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizures,
   with ongoing fevers likely secondary to resistant pseudomonas VAP.
   Fever/Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to pneumonia as sputum
   growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas.  Could be other source, although
   c.diff negative, lipase trending down, blood cx negative.  Now on
   ceftaz, tobra and po flagyl.  WBC improving, and clinically improved.
   - continue tobra (d1 = [**7-23**]) , but reduce frequency to q 48 hours given
   that 36 hour trough was 1.6
   - continue ceftaz  (day 1 = [**7-31**]) as double coverage
   - would stop flagyl as c.diff negative and stool output stable
   - cosider meropenem if febrile or unstable; skin blistering occurred in
   the setting of anasarca and occurred predominantly on the legs which is
   atypical for a drug rash; nevertheless, we will reserve [**Last Name (un) **] unless
   absolutely necessary
   - f/u colisitin sensitivies for pseudomonas, though would prefer to
   avoid this as it can cause irreversible renal failure
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.  Not
   interactive.  He was previously in has been loaded with phenytoin.  Has
   two witnessed tonic clonic seizures last night.  Prognosis regarding
   mental status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - reloaded dilantin yesterday with one gram, changed dosing to 100mg at
   8 am and 4 pm, and 200 mg at midnight
   - continue standing ativan
 no taper given recent seizures
   - d/c
ed cipro [**8-1**] as this lowers the seizure threshold
   . .
   Respiratory failure/VAP.  Patient had vigorous cough and has been
   tolerating PS better than TCM.  On coverage for resistant pseudomonas
   vap.  Coughing fits seem to be do to irritation as he is s/p bronch
   without obvious source
   - continue tobra/ ceftaz
   - continue nebs PRN
   - TCM trial today
   .
   Anemia.  Likely multifactorial, chronic disease, phlebotomy.  Is slow
   drop.
   - transfuse 1 u PRBCs today with lasix
   .
   Hyponatremia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and
   seizures.  Also may be hypovolemic.
   - fluid restrict
   - will try diuresis today
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely
   partially related to fevers, though tachycardia precedes fevers.  It
   has somewhat stabalized in 100s to 110s.
   - telemetry
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Improving; may have been secondary to bactrim exposure.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  In setting of worsening infection, has had increasing
   hyperglycemia
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.   S/p
   pamidronate and Calcitonin.  Ca stable recently.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   .
   SMV thrombus.  S/p heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis.
   - continue coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   - increase coumadin from 1 to 2 mg because of INR 1.9 and flagyl being
   stopped
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior saline
   infusion and seizures.
   - follow bicarb

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, post-cardiac arrest with anoxic brain injury and seizures, and ongoing fevers likely secondary to resistant pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's leukocytosis is decreasing, and the fever curve is also improving. He is currently on ceftazidime, tobramycin, and flagyl for the infection. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and is on pressure support ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection: The patient has been diagnosed with VAP caused by resistant pseudomonas. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy to treat the infection and prevent its spread.
2. Anoxic brain injury/Seizures: The patient has suffered two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity. He is currently on phenytoin and dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. Monitoring for seizure activity and adjusting antiepileptic medication doses may be necessary.
3. Respiratory failure/VAP: The patient has respiratory failure due to VAP. Continued coverage for resistant pseudomonas VAP with antibiotics like ceftazidime and tobramycin is recommended. Nebulization with bronchodilators can be used as needed to relieve bronchospasm.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo male with complicated hospital course following alcoholic
   pancreatitis [**5-12**] with pseudocysts post-pacnreatitis, anoxic
   encephalopahty, seizure, VAP
   1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure- Pseudomonas VAP, persistent
   despite tobramycin and ceftazidime
   -On PS ventilation and will continue to wean: decrease to PS 5 and if
   he tolerates, will consider TC this afternoon
   2. Leukocytosis- persistent Pseudomonas growth in urine and sputum. His
   leukocytosis is decreased today. Multiple abx added yesterday, so
   unclear which one caused the improvement. Given high MIC to Ceftazidine
   (8); ID remains concerned that his current abx coverage will be
   inadequate to treat his Pseudomonas VAP which is newly resistant to
   cipro
   -Ceftazidine and Tobramycin for Pseudomonas VAP
   -dc flagyl today
   -per discussion w/ pt's brother (a staff dermatologist at [**Hospital1 587**]), rash in
   [**5-12**] assoc w/ meropenem reaction was NOT a drug rash. therefore might
   consider this with close monitoring for inevitable MDR-Pseudomonas in
   the future
   3. AMS: multifactorial (anoxic enceph., infections, hypercalcemia,
   seizures).Spoke with neuro consult team who attribute seizures 2d ago
   to a known interaction between dilantin and coumadin resulting in
   subtherapeutic dosing.
   -touch base w/ Neuro re: poss change to fosphenytoin for better PICC
   line tolerance
   -cont Keppra and Dilantin
   4. Hyponatremia: mildly decreased this morning, despite free water
   restriction. Could reflect recent seizure activity. Will re-check
   tomorrow. Consider diuresis if it remains low
   -Lasix today
   5. Pancreatitis: Pancreatic enzymes decreasing. Lipase continuing to
   downtrend. Continue TF as tolerated
   -following LFTs and amylase/lipase
   6. Hypercalcemia: stable, follow daily, calcitonin if it conitnues to
   rise
   7. SMV thrombus: on coumadin anticoagulation
   8. Anemia- transfuse 1u prbc today
   -check for guaiac stools

   note, and would add: 28 yo male with prolonged hospitalization
   following severe alcoholic pancreatitis/pseudocysts with acute
   respiratory failure, s/p PEA arrest x 2, VAP, seizures, SMV thrombosis,
   hypercalcemia. Current problems include acute respiratory failure,
   leukocytosis in the context of resistant Pseudomonas VAP,
   multifactorial AMS (hypercalcemia, seizures, infection, anoxic
   encephalopathy). Some improvement today, with dropping WBC and no
   further seizures. Based on discussion with pt
s brother, rash
   previously attributed to merepenem reaction not typical in appearance
   or distribution for drug rash. There is high risk for the Pseudomonas
   recovered from his sputum cultures for becoming more resistant in the
   future, so should he develop s/sx of sepsis, merepenem remains a
   potential treatment choice.
   Will continue to wean vent today, abx adjustment as above.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent on pt: 35 minutes.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a complicated hospital course following alcoholic pancreatitis with pseudocysts, anoxic encephalopathy, seizure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been experiencing acute respiratory failure and has not tolerated the tracheostomy collar yesterday. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), blood pressure ranging from 121/57 mmHg to 123/71 mmHg, heart rate of 114 bpm, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 471 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 108. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, tracheostomy site changes, tachycardia, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be non-attentive, responding to noxious stimuli, with non-purposeful movement and undetermined muscle tone. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.6 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 127 mEq/L, hypercalcemia with a calcium level of 11 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 20.6%. Other lab results, including kidney function tests, liver enzymes, and electrolytes, are within normal ranges. Blood cultures from July 28th and July 30th revealed Pseudomonas infection in the sputum, while urine cultures showed negative results. 

The assessment and plan include treatment for acute respiratory failure due to Pseudomonas VAP, leukocytosis, anoxic encephalopathy, hypercalcemia, and pancreatitis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a plan to wean and potentially consider tracheostomy closure. Antibiotics have been adjusted to address the resistant Pseudomonas infection. 

Overall, the patient remains critically ill with ongoing management of multiple medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizures,
   with ongoing fevers likely secondary to resistant pseudomonas VAP.
   Fever/Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to pneumonia as sputum
   growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas.  Could be other source, although
   c.diff negative, lipase trending down, blood cx negative.  Now on
   ceftaz, tobra and po flagyl.  WBC improving, and clinically improved.
   - continue tobra (d1 = [**7-23**]) , but reduce frequency to q 48 hours given
   that 36 hour trough was 1.6
   - continue ceftaz  (day 1 = [**7-31**]) as double coverage
   - would stop flagyl as c.diff negative and stool output stable
   - cosider meropenem if febrile or unstable; skin blistering occurred in
   the setting of anasarca and occurred predominantly on the legs which is
   atypical for a drug rash; nevertheless, we will reserve [**Last Name (un) **] unless
   absolutely necessary
   - f/u colisitin sensitivies for pseudomonas, though would prefer to
   avoid this as it can cause irreversible renal failure
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.  Not
   interactive.  He was previously in has been loaded with phenytoin.  Has
   two witnessed tonic clonic seizures last night.  Prognosis regarding
   mental status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - reloaded dilantin yesterday with one gram, changed dosing to 100mg at
   8 am and 4 pm, and 200 mg at midnight
   - continue standing ativan
 no taper given recent seizures
   - d/c
ed cipro [**8-1**] as this lowers the seizure threshold
   . .
   Respiratory failure/VAP.  Patient had vigorous cough and has been
   tolerating PS better than TCM.  On coverage for resistant pseudomonas
   vap.  Coughing fits seem to be do to irritation as he is s/p bronch
   without obvious source
   - continue tobra/ ceftaz
   - continue nebs PRN
   - TCM trial today
   .
   Anemia.  Likely multifactorial, chronic disease, phlebotomy.  Is slow
   drop.
   - transfuse 1 u PRBCs today with lasix
   .
   Hyponatremia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and
   seizures.  Also may be hypovolemic.
   - fluid restrict
   - will try diuresis today
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely
   partially related to fevers, though tachycardia precedes fevers.  It
   has somewhat stabalized in 100s to 110s.
   - telemetry
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Improving; may have been secondary to bactrim exposure.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  In setting of worsening infection, has had increasing
   hyperglycemia
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.   S/p
   pamidronate and Calcitonin.  Ca stable recently.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   .
   SMV thrombus.  S/p heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis.
   - continue coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   - increase coumadin from 1 to 2 mg because of INR 1.9 and flagyl being
   stopped
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior saline
   infusion and seizures.
   - follow bicarb

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient has a history of recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis and pseudocysts. They experienced two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests and have anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.
2. The patient has ongoing fevers likely secondary to resistant pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Sputum culture showed growth of two colonies of pseudomonas.
3. The patient is currently on ceftazidime, tobramycin, and oral Flagyl. The WBC count is improving, indicating a positive response to the antibiotic therapy.
4. The patient's mental status is poor due to AMS secondary to anoxic brain injury and seizures. Phenytoin has been loaded, and the patient is on keppra, dilantin, and ativan.
5. The patient has respiratory failure/VAP and is tolerating pressure support (PS) better than timed cough mode (TCM). Coverage for resistant pseudomonas VAP is being continued.
6. The patient has anemia, likely multifactorial, chronic disease, and phlebotomy. A slow transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with lasix has been initiated.
7. Hyponatremia may be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and seizures or hypovolemic"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizures,
   with ongoing fevers likely secondary to resistant pseudomonas VAP.
   Fever/Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to pneumonia as sputum
   growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas.  Could be other source, although
   c.diff negative, lipase trending down, blood cx negative.  Now on
   ceftaz, tobra and po flagyl.  WBC improving, and clinically improved.
   - continue tobra (d1 = [**7-23**]) , but reduce frequency to q 48 hours given
   that 36 hour trough was 1.6
   - continue ceftaz  (day 1 = [**7-31**]) as double coverage
   - would stop flagyl as c.diff negative and stool output stable
   - cosider meropenem if febrile or unstable; skin blistering occurred in
   the setting of anasarca and occurred predominantly on the legs which is
   atypical for a drug rash; nevertheless, we will reserve [**Last Name (un) **] unless
   absolutely necessary
   - f/u colisitin sensitivies for pseudomonas, though would prefer to
   avoid this as it can cause irreversible renal failure
   - appreciate ID recs

   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.  Not
   interactive.  He was previously in has been loaded with phenytoin.  Has
   two witnessed tonic clonic seizures last night.  Prognosis regarding
   mental status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - reloaded dilantin yesterday with one gram, changed dosing to 100mg at
   8 am and 4 pm, and 200 mg at midnight
   - continue standing ativan
 no taper given recent seizures
   - d/c
ed cipro [**8-1**] as this lowers the seizure threshold

   Respiratory failure/VAP.  Patient had vigorous cough and has been
   tolerating PS better than TCM.  On coverage for resistant pseudomonas
   vap.  Coughing fits seem to be do to irritation as he is s/p bronch
   without obvious source
   - continue tobra/ ceftaz
   - continue nebs PRN
   - TCM trial today

   Anemia.  Likely multifactorial, chronic disease, phlebotomy.  Is slow
   drop.
   - transfuse 1 u PRBCs today with lasix

   Hyponatremia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and
   seizures.  Also may be hypovolemic.
   - fluid restrict
   - will try diuresis today
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely
   partially related to fevers, though tachycardia precedes fevers.  It
   has somewhat stabalized in 100s to 110s.
   - telemetry
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Improving; may have been secondary to bactrim exposure.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  In setting of worsening infection, has had increasing
   hyperglycemia
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.   S/p
   pamidronate and Calcitonin.  Ca stable recently.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   .
   SMV thrombus.  S/p heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis.
   - continue coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   - increase coumadin from 1 to 2 mg because of INR 1.9 and flagyl being
   stopped
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior saline
   infusion and seizures.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis and subsequent pseudocysts. The patient has experienced two episodes of PEA arrest and anoxic brain injury with seizures. He is currently in the ICU and is on various medications including antibiotics for resistant pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), anticonvulsants for seizures, and medications for AMS (altered mental status) due to anoxic brain injury.

The patient's vital signs show fever, elevated heart rate (tachycardia), and normal blood pressure. The respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. VAP: The patient has been diagnosed with resistant pseudomonas VAP and is already on appropriate antibiotic coverage. It is important to continue aggressive pulmonary hygiene and optimize respiratory support.

2. Seizures: The patient has had witnessed tonic-clonic seizures, and appropriate anticonvulsant therapy has been initiated. Close monitoring for seizure activity and adherence to the seizure management plan are necessary.

3. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's prognosis regarding mental status is poor due to the anoxic brain injury. Continuous neurological monitoring and supportive care are essential.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, post-cardiac arrest with anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing ongoing fevers likely secondary to resistant pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's white blood cell count is improving, and he is clinically improved.

The patient's mental status is poor, and he is not interactive. He has suffered two previous episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests and has been loaded with phenytoin. He had two witnessed tonic-clonic seizures last night. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is on coverage for resistant pseudomonas VAP. He tolerated a tracheostomy mask for a few hours yesterday but returned to pressure support due to increased coughing and discomfort.

The patient's anemia is likely multifactorial, with chronic disease and phlebotomy being possible causes. His sodium levels are low and may be due to central SIADH secondary to anoxic brain injury and seizures or hypovolemia. The patient's tachycardia has no clear etiology and may be related to fever, which is improving as the fever curve decreases.

The patient has severe necrotizing pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation. His lipase levels are trending downward. He also has eosinophilia, which may have been"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint and 24-hour events are not specified in the note. 

The patient underwent several changes in their medical management over the past day. They were switched from intravenous to oral formulation of dilantin, stopped taking flagyl, and increased the dosage of coumadin from 1 mg to 2 mg daily due to subtherapeutic INR. Additionally, heparin bridge was started. The patient received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), which increased their hematocrit level from 20.6% to 23.9%. However, their hematocrit then decreased to 19.2% after drawing off blood from the PICC line. 

The patient was also started on a trial of diuresis with lasix. It is mentioned that the PICC line is occluded and may need to be replaced in the morning. Thrombolytic therapy (TPA) was successful in clearing only one of the lines. The patient tolerated total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for a few hours but then had to be put back on tube feeding due to ongoing coughing fits and discomfort. The tidal volumes were lower than baseline, so the pressure support (PS) was increased to 8. 

The patient has a history of allergies to meropenem. The last doses of antibiotics administered were ciprofloxacin on [**2131-8-1**] at 04:17 AM, linezolid on [**2131-8-1**] at 10:00 AM, metronidazole on [**2131-8-2**] at 08:58 AM, tobramycin on [**2131-8-2**] at 10:00 PM, and ceftazidime on [**2131-8-3**] at 04:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.0°C (100.4°F), a heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/64 mmHg to 135/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia. The patient's weight is currently 98.8 kg.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,615 mL, with 960 mL given through the oral route, 980 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TF), and 1,134 mL through intravenous fluids (IVF). The output includes 4,010 mL of urine and 1,185 mL of drain output. The overall fluid balance is negative by 1,395 mL.

The patient requires respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. The set tidal volume (Vt) is 512 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 101. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 11 cmH2O, and the patient's oxygen saturation remains at 100%.

The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 21.4 to 31.0 thousand cells per microliter, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 19.2% to 24.9%, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 461 to 748 cells per microliter, and creatinine (Cr) level at 0.7 mg/dL. Glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with anemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, leukocytosis, anoxic brain damage, acute pancreatitis, necrotizing pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, and seizure.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving NovaSource Renal (Full) nutrition at 40 mL/hour. The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line placed on [**2131-7-20**] at 04:06 AM and an 18-gauge line placed on [**2131-7-31**] at 12:15 PM. Prophylactic measures include DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis.

   Fever/Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to pneumonia as sputum
   growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas.  Now on ceftaz and tobra.  WBC
   improving, and clinically improved.
   - continue tobra (d1 = [**7-23**]) , but reduce frequency to q 48 hours given
   that 36 hour trough was 1.6
   - continue ceftaz  (day 1 = [**7-31**]) as double coverage
   - cosider meropenem if febrile or unstable; skin blistering occurred in
   the setting of anasarca and occurred predominantly on the legs which is
   atypical for a drug rash; nevertheless, we will reserve [**Last Name (un) **] unless
   absolutely necessary

   two witnessed tonic clonic seizures last night.  Prognosis regarding
   mental status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - reloaded dilantin [**8-1**] with one gram, changed dosing to 100mg at 8 am
   and 4 pm, and 200 mg at midnight, level 3.5 this morning; will follow

   Respiratory failure/VAP.  Patient had vigorous cough and has been
   tolerating PS better than TCM.  On coverage for resistant pseudomonas
   vap.  Coughing fits seem to be do to irritation as he is s/p bronch
   without obvious source.  Tolerated trach mask for a few hours yesterday
   and returned to PS due to increased coughing and discomfort.
   - continue tobra/ ceftaz
   - continue nebs PRN
   - continue to try trach mask as tolerated
   .
   Anemia.  Likely multifactorial, chronic disease, phlebotomy.  Is slow
   drop, s/p 2 u PRBCs yesterday with appropriate bump (although had one
   hct that was likely spuriously low).
   - cont to monitor hct
   - heparin turned off, but no obvious source of bleeding, will restart

   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to

   boluses, either.  Seemed to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely
   partially related to fever, and is improving as fever curve is starting
   to decrease.

   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Now PMNs have returned to [**Location 201**], eosinophilia has come
   back; may have been secondary to bactrim exposure.

   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.

   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.   S/p
   pamidronate and Calcitonin.  Ca stable recently.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - checking thyroid function today
   .
   SMV thrombus.  S/p heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis, has had subtherapeutic INR and
   started on heparin gtt yesterday but stopped in the setting of dropped
   hct.
   - would continue to bridge with heparin as long as hct stablized
   - continue coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   - increase coumadin from 1 to 2 mg because of INR 1.9 and flagyl being
   stopped
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior saline
   infusion and seizures.
   - follow bicarb

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, and previous cardiac arrest with anoxic brain injury and seizures. He is currently in the ICU with ongoing fevers likely secondary to resistant pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been on ceftazidime and tobramycin, but his WBC count is improving and he is clinically improved. There are concerns about AMS secondary to anoxic brain injury and seizures, respiratory failure/VAP, anemia, hyponatremia, tachycardia, pancreatitis, eosinophilia, hypercalcemia, SMV thrombus, and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/VAP: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and efforts should be made to clear any airway obstructions. Continued coverage with antibiotics is appropriate, and weaning off ventilatory support should be considered if the patient shows improvement.

2. Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures: The patient's mental status is poor, and there is a risk of recurrent seizures. Phenytoin has been loaded, and keppra is being continued. Close neurological monitoring is essential, and further consultation with neurology may be required.

3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be multifactorial, and chronic disease or phlebotomy could be contributing factors. Monitoring the hem"

   encephalopahty, seizure, VAP
   1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure- Pseudomonas VAP, persistent
   despite tobramycin and ceftazidime
   -On PSV 5/5 and stable, cont trach collar trials
   -Not tolerating trach collar due to coughing fits and tachypnea; will
   ask IP or Thoracics informally about mgmt strategies. For now cont
   lidocaine topical and dextromethorphan
   2. Leukocytosis- likely due to persistent Pseudomonas growth in urine
   and sputum vs seizure activity. His leukocytosis continues to
   defervesce. Given high MIC to Ceftazidine (8), ID remains concerned
   that his current abx coverage will eventually become inadequate to
   treat his Pseudomonas
   -Ceftazidine and Tobramycin for Pseudomonas VAP; per discussion w/ pt's
   brother (a staff dermatologist at [**Hospital1 587**]), rash in [**5-12**] assoc w/ meropenem
   reaction was NOT a drug rash. therefore might consider this with close
   monitoring for inevitable MDR-Pseudomonas in the future
   3. AMS: multifactorial (anoxic enceph., infections, hypercalcemia,
   seizures).Spoke with neuro consult team who attribute seizures 3d ago
   to a known interaction between dilantin and coumadin resulting in
   subtherapeutic dosing.
   -cont Keppra and Dilantin and Ativan
   4. Hyponatremia: hypervolemic, could also reflect recent seizure
   activity.
   -Lasix diuresis today
   -free water restriction
   5. Pancreatitis: Pancreatic enzymes stable. Continue TF as tolerated
   6. Hypercalcemia: stable, follow daily, calcitonin if it conitnues to
   rise

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a complicated hospital course following alcoholic pancreatitis, pseudocysts post-pancreatitis, anoxic encephalopathy, seizure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been experiencing acute respiratory failure due to Pseudomonas VAP, which has been persistent despite receiving tobramycin and ceftazidime. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and stable but not tolerating tracheostomy collar due to coughing fits and tachypnea. Leukocytosis is present, likely due to persistent Pseudomonas growth in urine and sputum. The patient's white blood cell count is still decreasing, and there have been no further seizures since a repeat fosphenytoin load earlier this week. The patient's mental status has improved today, with increased eye tracking. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure - The patient's persistent VAP despite antibiotic treatment indicates a potential complication. Close monitoring and adjustment of the treatment plan are necessary.
2. Leukocytosis - The patient's high leukocyte count may be due to ongoing infection or seizure activity. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. AMS (acute mental status changes) - The patient's multifactorial AMS could be attributed to anoxic encephalopathy,"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo male with complicated hospital course following alcoholic
   pancreatitis [**5-12**] with pseudocysts post-pacnreatitis, anoxic
   encephalopahty, seizure, VAP
   1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure- Pseudomonas VAP, persistent
   despite tobramycin and ceftazidime
   -On PSV 5/5 and stable, cont trach collar trials
   -Not tolerating trach collar due to coughing fits and tachypnea; will
   ask IP or Thoracics informally about mgmt strategies. For now cont
   lidocaine topical and dextromethorphan
   2. Leukocytosis- likely due to persistent Pseudomonas growth in urine
   and sputum vs seizure activity. His leukocytosis continues to
   defervesce. Given high MIC to Ceftazidine (8), ID remains concerned
   that his current abx coverage will eventually become inadequate to
   treat his Pseudomonas
   -Ceftazidine and Tobramycin for Pseudomonas VAP; per discussion w/ pt's
   brother (a staff dermatologist at [**Hospital1 587**]), rash in [**5-12**] assoc w/ meropenem
   reaction was NOT a drug rash. therefore might consider this with close
   monitoring for inevitable MDR-Pseudomonas in the future
   3. AMS: multifactorial (anoxic enceph., infections, hypercalcemia,
   seizures).Spoke with neuro consult team who attribute seizures 3d ago
   to a known interaction between dilantin and coumadin resulting in
   subtherapeutic dosing.
   -cont Keppra and Dilantin and Ativan
   4. Hyponatremia: hypervolemic, could also reflect recent seizure
   activity.
   -Lasix diuresis today
   -free water restriction
   5. Pancreatitis: Pancreatic enzymes stable. Continue TF as tolerated
   6. Hypercalcemia: stable, follow daily, calcitonin if it conitnues to
   rise
   7. SMV thrombus: on coumadin anticoagulation
   -heparin gtt while subtherapeutic, if Hct stable
   8. Anemia- goal hct > 21
   -check for guaiac stools

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a complicated hospital course following alcoholic pancreatitis, pseudocysts post-pancreatitis, anoxic encephalopathy, seizure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been unresponsive to the current antibiotics, ceftazidime and tobramycin, for his Pseudomonas VAP. His leukocytosis continues to defervesce, and there is concern that the current antibiotic coverage may become inadequate to treat his Pseudomonas infection. The patient's seizures are attributed to a known interaction between dilantin and coumadin resulting in subtherapeutic dosing. He also has hyponatremia, pancreatitis, hypercalcemia, SMV thrombus, and anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure due to Pseudomonas VAP, which is persistent despite treatment with tobramycin and ceftazidime.
2. Leukocytosis likely due to persistent Pseudomonas growth in urine and sputum, or seizure activity.
3. Multifactorial acute mental status change (AMS) due to anoxic encephalopathy, infections, hypercalcemia, and seizures.
4. Hyponatremia, which could reflect recent seizure activity or hypervolemic status.
5. Pancreatitis with pancreatic enzymes stable.
6. Hypercalcemia, which is stable and"

   -HCT stable
   -TSH/T4 showing hypothyroidism
   -will need to call to thoracics in am/Gangatav who placed trach to see
   if adjustment vs. downsizing will be beneficial, as already tried
   lidocaine/dextromethorphan, as coughing fits when on TCM
   -neuro suggested increasing dilantin to 200mg 4pm and mn, 100mg 8am
   -on TCM and sitting upright in chair, much less coughing

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, post-cardiac arrest with anoxic brain injury, seizures, and ongoing fevers likely secondary to resistant pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently on ceftaz and tobramycin, and his WBC count is improving. The patient's mental status is altered due to anoxic brain injury and seizures. He has suffered two PEA arrests and has been loaded with phenytoin. He has had two witnessed tonic-clonic seizures last night, and his prognosis regarding mental status is poor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/VAP: The patient has had vigorous coughing and is tolerating pressure support (PS) better than timed control mode (TCM). He is on coverage for resistant pseudomonas VAP. Coughing fits seem to be due to irritation as he has bronchospasm without an obvious source. He tolerated a tracheostomy mask for a few hours yesterday and returned to PS overnight.
2. Anemia: The patient likely has multifactorial anemia, including chronic disease and phlebotomy. His HCT is stable, and he received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday with an appropriate bump (although one HCT reading was likely spurious).
3. Hyponatremia: The patient may have central"

The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, and previous PEA arrest with anoxic brain injury and seizures. He is currently experiencing ongoing fevers likely secondary to resistant pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His WBC count is improving, and he is clinically improved. 

The patient has been started on ceftazidime and tobramycin for the VAP. His respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV with a tracheostomy tube, FiO2 of 40%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. 

Other medical complications include anemia, likely multifactorial, chronic disease, and phlebotomy. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells yesterday with an appropriate bump. 

Hyponatremia is present, possibly due to central SIADH secondary to anoxic brain injury and seizures, as well as hypovolemia. 

Tachycardia is present but no clear etiology has been identified. 

Pancreatitis is severe necrotizing pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation. No surgical intervention is planned.

5. The neurologist suggested increasing dilantin to 200mg at 4 pm and mn, 100mg at 8 am.
6. The patient is currently on TCM (Total Contact Moisture) and sitting upright in a chair, resulting in much less coughing.
7. The patient will start taking 25mcg of levothyroxine as per the endocrinologist's recommendation. TFTs will be rechecked in 2 weeks.
8. The patient has a history of allergies to meropenem, skin blisters.
9. The last doses of antibiotics administered were linezolid on [**2131-8-1**] at 10:00 AM, metronidazole on [**2131-8-2**] at 08:58 AM, tobramycin on [**2131-8-2**] at 10:00 PM, and ceftazidime on [**2131-8-3**] at 08:32 PM.
10. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion at 1,400 units/hour.
11. Other ICU medications include furosemide (Lasix) on [**2131-8-3**] at 10:35 AM and famotidine (Pepcid) on [**2131-8-3**] at 08:32 PM.
12. The patient has various medical and family history changes, but review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.
13. The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and ABG results are within normal limits.
14. Physical examination findings indicate the presence of anemia, leukocytosis, altered mental status, and other conditions.
15. Laboratory results show abnormalities in WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, glucose, and other parameters.
16. The patient is diagnosed with anemia, electrolyte/fluid disorder, leukocytosis, anoxic brain damage, acute pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, and seizure.
17. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (PICC line), prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, VAP), and comments regarding communication and code status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of anoxic brain damage, development of organ dysfunction in the context of sepsis, progression of acute pancreatitis, and potential complications related to altered mental status and seizure."

   Fever/Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to pneumonia as sputum
   growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas.  Now on ceftaz and tobra.  WBC
   improving, and clinically improved.

   partially related to fever, and is improving as fever curve is starting
   to decrease.

   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.

   Eosinophilia.  Now PMNs have returned to [**Location 201**], eosinophilia has come
   back; may have been secondary to bactrim exposure.

   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.   S/p
   pamidronate and Calcitonin.  Ca stable recently.

   SMV thrombus.  S/p heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus likely
   secondary to severe pancreatitis, has had subtherapeutic INR and
   started on heparin gtt yesterday but stopped in the setting of dropped
   hct.
   - would continue to bridge with heparin as long as hct stablized
   - continue coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   - increase coumadin from 1 to 2 mg because of INR 1.9 and flagyl being
   stopped

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, and subsequent PEA arrest with anoxic brain injury and seizures. He is currently experiencing ongoing fevers likely secondary to resistant pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been on coverage for resistant pseudomonas VAP with ceftazidime and tobramycin. His WBC count is improving, and he is clinically improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia, which could be multifactorial due to chronic disease, phlebotomy, or other causes. It is a slow drop, and he received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday with an appropriate bump.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient may have central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and seizures. He also may have hypovolemic hyponatremia. His sodium levels are slightly improved with a trial of Lasix yesterday, so he can continue with Lasix today.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has unexplained tachycardia that did not respond to fentanyl boluses, extra ativan doses, or IV fluid boluses. It may be partially related to fever and is improving as the fever curve is starting to decrease.
4. Respiratory Failure/VAP: The patient has severe respiratory failure"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   28 yo indian male with complicated history- [**2131-5-4**] admission for
   severe necrotizing pancreatitis in the setting of heavy EtOH use. Hosp
   course complicated by seizure and PEA arrest and resultant hypoxic
   encephalopathy. Chronic resp failure s/p trach in [**2131-6-4**]. Prior
   acute pancreatitis w/ pseudocyst formation. Was re-admitted to [**Hospital1 **] from
   rehab in early [**Month (only) 280**] for recurrent seizure activity. Also found to have
   SMV thrombosis in early [**Month (only) 280**]- on heparin gtt. Transferred to the ICU on
   [**7-20**] for a second PEA arrest, presumably due to mucus plug and
   hypoxemia. Initially in ICU course with persistent seizure activity-
   now resolved on Dilantin + Keppra + Ativan. Being covered w/ tobramycin
   and cetazidime (stopped cipro based on recent sensis) for Pseudomonas
   in sputum and in urine.  Mental status is currently withdrawing to
   noxious stimuli, not following commands, moving all 4 but
   nonpurposeful.  Defervescing on ABX regimen. Seized on the night of
   [**7-31**], responded to more Ativan, got re-loaded with Dilantin on [**8-1**].
   Plan is to return to rehab, looks like early next week is reasonable.
   Major issue is one of coughing fits every time he is on trach collar.
   Tolerates PSV 5/5 [**Last Name **] problem. Bronch'd earlier this week with nothing
   in the airways and well-positioned trach w/ minimal tracheal
   irritation. Not sure why this is happening though I suspect some local
   irritation- it is resolved w/ topical lidocaine though we are trying to
   minimize this due to seizure risk.

   Tolerating TM, but with intermittent coughing from secretions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including severe necrotizing pancreatitis, chronic respiratory failure, seizure disorder, and hypoxic encephalopathy. He has been admitted multiple times for recurrent seizures and a recent PEA arrest. The patient is currently in the ICU for another PEA arrest due to a mucus plug and hypoxemia. He has been on mechanical ventilation but is now tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well. He has a tracheostomy tube in place and is being weaned off sedation. The patient's mental status is withdrawing, and he is experiencing coughing fits when wearing his tracheostomy collar.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and maintain proper tracheostomy tube hygiene to prevent this complication.
2. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizures, and there is a risk of recurrence while in the ICU. Continuing seizure prophylaxis with Dilantin and monitoring the patient's neurologic status is crucial.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can lead to altered mental status and seizures. Fluid restriction and diuresis may be necessary to manage this electrolyte imbalance.
4. Superior mesenteric vein (SMV)"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   28 yo indian male with complicated history- [**2131-5-4**] admission for
   severe necrotizing pancreatitis in the setting of heavy EtOH use. Hosp
   course complicated by seizure and PEA arrest and resultant hypoxic
   encephalopathy. Chronic resp failure s/p trach in [**2131-6-4**]. Prior
   acute pancreatitis w/ pseudocyst formation. Was re-admitted to [**Hospital1 **] from
   rehab in early [**Month (only) 280**] for recurrent seizure activity. Also found to have
   SMV thrombosis in early [**Month (only) 280**]- on heparin gtt. Transferred to the ICU on
   [**7-20**] for a second PEA arrest, presumably due to mucus plug and
   hypoxemia. Initially in ICU course with persistent seizure activity-
   now resolved on Dilantin + Keppra + Ativan. Being covered w/ tobramycin
   and cetazidime (stopped cipro based on recent sensis) for Pseudomonas
   in sputum and in urine.  Mental status is currently withdrawing to
   noxious stimuli, not following commands, moving all 4 but
   nonpurposeful.  Defervescing on ABX regimen. Seized on the night of
   [**7-31**], responded to more Ativan, got re-loaded with Dilantin on [**8-1**].
   Plan is to return to rehab, looks like early next week is reasonable.
   Major issue is one of coughing fits every time he is on trach collar.
   Tolerates PSV 5/5 [**Last Name **] problem. Bronch'd earlier this week with nothing
   in the airways and well-positioned trach w/ minimal tracheal
   irritation. Not sure why this is happening though I suspect some local
   irritation- it is resolved w/ topical lidocaine though we are trying to
   minimize this due to seizure risk.
   24 Hour Events:
   Tolerating TM, but with intermittent coughing from secretions.

   - would continue to bridge with heparin as long as hct stablized
   - continue coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   - increase coumadin from 1 to 2 mg because of INR 1.9 and flagyl being
   stopped

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by pseudocysts. He has experienced two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and has sustained anoxic brain injury with seizures. He is currently on coverage for resistant pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's mental status is poor, and he is not interactive. He has been loaded with phenytoin and is on keppra, dilantin, and ativan for seizure prophylaxis. He is also on tobra and ceftaz to treat the VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/VAP: The patient has ongoing fevers and leukocytosis likely secondary to pneumonia, which may progress to severe sepsis or septic shock if not adequately controlled.
2. Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures: The patient's prognosis regarding mental status is poor due to the anoxic brain injury and seizure activity. There is a risk of further seizures and potential neurological deterioration.
3. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient's mental status is altered due to the anoxic brain injury and seizures. This can lead to difficulty in communication and decision-making.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has been started on levoxyl for hypothyroidism, which should be monitored with repeat thyroid function tests in two weeks.
5. Anemia: The patient has"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, PEA arrest, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He is currently in the ICU with ongoing fevers likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has tracheostomy tube in place. His vital signs are stable, but he has an elevated heart rate (tachycardia) without a clear etiology. He has been improving clinically with improved fever curve and WBC count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VAP: The patient has sputum growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas, indicating a bacterial infection in the lungs. He is already on ceftazidime and tobramycin, which should help treat the infection. It is important to continue monitoring his respiratory status and lab results.
2. AMS (Altered Mental Status) secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures: The patient's mental status is improving but the prognosis is poor. He is on keppra, dilantin, and ativan for seizure control. Regular monitoring of neurologic status is required.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which may be due to central SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone) secondary to anoxic brain injury and seizures. Close monitoring of serum sodium and"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizures,
   with ongoing fevers likely secondary to VAP which is overall improving.
   VAP/Respiratory failure:  Sputum growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas in
   addition to ALCALIGENES XYLOSOXIDANS.  Now on ceftaz and tobra with
   fever curve and WBC improving..  WBC improving, and clinically
   improved.  Patient is not tolerated TCM trials due to coughing fits.
   Trach was downsized today to 6 tube with hopes of improved patient
   comfort.
   - continue tobra (d1 = [**7-23**] q 48 hours until [**8-14**]
   - continue ceftaz  (day 1 = [**7-31**]) until [**8-14**]
   - cosider meropenem if febrile or unstable; skin blistering occurred in
   the setting of anasarca and occurred predominantly on the legs which is
   atypical for a drug rash; nevertheless, we will reserve [**Last Name (un) **] unless
   absolutely necessary
   - f/u colisitin sensitivies for pseudomonas, though would prefer to
   avoid this as it can cause irreversible renal failure
   - appreciate ID recs
   -TCM trials as tolerated
   .
   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.
   Overall mental status is improving, but prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue increase dose of dilantin 200-200-100 per neurology as
   dilantin level has been repeatedly subtherapeutic
   - continue standing ativan
   .
   Hypothyroid.  TFTs consistent with hypothyroidism. Endocrine
   recommended starting levoxyl 25mcg daily with repeat TFTs in 2 wks.
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   Anemia.  Likely multifactorial, chronic disease, phlebotomy.
   - cont to monitor hct
   - stable, heparin resumed.
   - guaiac stools
   .
   Hyponatremia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and
   seizures.   Stable.
   - continued to have concentrated TFs and abx
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seems to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely partially
   related to fever, and is improving as fever curve is starting to
   decrease.
   - telemetry
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Now PMNs have returned to [**Location 201**], eosinophilia has come
   back; may have been secondary to bactrim exposure several weeks ago.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  In setting of worsening infection, has had increasing
   hyperglycemia
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.   S/p
   pamidronate and Calcitonin.  Ca stable recently.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - trend calcium
   .
   SMV thrombus.  Undergoing heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus
   likely secondary to severe pancreatitis.  INR remains subtherapeutic
   - continue heparing to coumadin briding
   - continue coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior saline
   infusion and seizures.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, PEA arrest, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He is currently in the ICU with ongoing fevers likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been improving clinically, but his mental status is still poor. He has several medical complications including AMS (acute mental status secondary to anoxic brain injury/seizures), hypothyroidism, anemia, hyponatremia, tachycardia, pancreatitis, eosinophilia, diabetes, hypercalcemia, and SMV thrombus. He is receiving multiple medications and treatments for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VAP: The patient has a positive sputum culture growing pseudomonas, indicating an infection in the lungs. This could lead to worsening respiratory failure and potentially sepsis.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe necrotizing pancreatitis with pseudocysts. If the pseudocysts become infected or there is a complication such as a ruptured pseudocyst, it can lead to further complications.
3. AMS: The patient's anoxic brain injury and seizures have resulted in ongoing mental status changes. There is a poor prognosis for full recovery of mental status.
4. Diabetes: The patient's recent hypoglycemia and increasing hyperglycemia indicate uncontrolled blood sugar levels. Poor glyc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), anoxic brain injury from previous pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest due to mucous plugging, and subsequent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient experienced a seizure as a result of these complications. The patient's allergies include meropenem. 

24-hour events include downsizing the tracheostomy tube to a 6 and performing bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient's medications include heparin sodium, lorazepam (Ativan), famotidine (Pepcid), and others listed below. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for coughing episodes. Flow sheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant measurements. 

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress. Neurological examination is notable for attentive behavior and purposeful movement but does not assess tone. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hematocrit and platelet count, normal creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal range. 

Assessment and plan include anemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, leukocytosis, anoxic brain damage, acute pancreatitis with necrotizing features, respiratory failure"

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1516**]
s note above and
   agree with her findings and plan of care.  We have also discussed the
   pt
s case with his father, an internist.  The patient had been on
   trache collar but is now back on the vent with RR28 and VE of 13L/min.
   He often deveiops cough and tachypnea with spontaneous resp.  This
   cough has defied clear understanding
 it seems better on the vent than
   off and it has responded to topical lidocaine instilled via the trache
   into his airway.  It seems not related to airway secretions. GERD
   should not be an issue with his HOB elevated and his being on PPI.
   Bronch today showed no tracheal granulomas around trache and not trauma
   of trachea by tracheostomy tube.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), anoxic brain injury from a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest due to mucous plugging, and seizure disorder. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placements. The patient is currently experiencing coughing episodes and has had a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) performed. His allergies include meropenem, and he is currently on various medications including heparin sodium, lorazepam (Ativan), famotidine (Pepcid), and others. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate 114 bpm, blood pressure 113/53 mmHg, respiratory rate 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, leukocytosis, elevated lactic acid levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's current assessment includes anoxic brain damage, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), pancreatitis, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and altered mental status. The plan includes continuing cefaz and Tobramycin until August 14th, adjusting the ventilator settings, monitoring for seizure activity, and evaluating for potential complications such as SIADH, tachycardia, eosinophilia"

   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizures,
   with ongoing fevers likely secondary to VAP which is overall improving.
   VAP/Respiratory failure:  Sputum growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas in
   addition to ALCALIGENES XYLOSOXIDANS.  Now on ceftaz and tobra with
   fever curve and WBC improving..  WBC improving, and clinically
   improved.  Patient is not tolerated TCM trials due to coughing fits.
   Trach was downsized today to a size 6 tube with hopes of improved
   patient comfort.
   - continue tobra (d1 = [**7-23**]) q 48 hours until [**8-14**]
   - continue ceftaz  (day 1 = [**7-31**]) until [**8-14**]
   - cosider meropenem if febrile or unstable; skin blistering occurred in
   the setting of anasarca and occurred predominantly on the legs which is
   atypical for a drug rash; nevertheless, we will reserve [**Last Name (un) **] unless
   absolutely necessary
   - f/u colisitin sensitivies for pseudomonas, though would prefer to
   avoid this as it can cause irreversible renal failure
   - appreciate ID recs
   -TCM trials as tolerated
   .
   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.
   Overall mental status is improving, but prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue increase dose of dilantin 200-200-100 per neurology as
   dilantin level has been repeatedly subtherapeutic
   - continue standing ativan
   - appreciate neuro recs
   .
   Hypothyroid.  TFTs consistent with hypothyroidism. Endocrine
   recommended starting levoxyl 25mcg daily with repeat TFTs in 2 wks.
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   Anemia.  Likely multifactorial, chronic disease, phlebotomy.
   - cont to monitor hct
   - stable, heparin resumed.
   - guaiac stools
   .
   Hyponatremia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and
   seizures.   Stable.
   - continued to have concentrated TFs and abx
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seems to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely partially
   related to fever, and is improving as fever curve is starting to
   decrease.
   - telemetry
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Now PMNs have returned to [**Location 201**], eosinophilia has come
   back; may have been secondary to bactrim exposure several weeks ago.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  In setting of worsening infection, has had increasing

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis and subsequent pseudocysts. He has experienced two PEA arrests, resulting in anoxic brain injury and seizures. The patient is currently in the ICU for ongoing fevers likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The sputum culture grew two colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the patient is being treated with tobramycin and ceftazidime.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient has suffered two PEA arrests and subsequent anoxic brain injury. This has led to altered mental status, which is expected to have a poor prognosis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, most likely due to VAP. He is currently on CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
3. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has ongoing fevers, indicating possible sepsis. He is being treated with antibiotics, and his WBC count is improving.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe necrotizing pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation. Surgical intervention is not planned, and the patient's pancreatic enzymes are trending downward.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, likely secondary to central"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, post-cardiac arrest with anoxic brain injury, seizures, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently being treated with tobramycin and ceftazidime for VAP. The patient's tracheostomy tube size was decreased today due to improved comfort. The patient's fever curve and white blood cell count are improving, indicating a positive response to treatment. He is also on famotidine, lorazepam, and various other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure not due to ARDS. He is on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 40%. His respiratory support needs to be closely monitored.
2. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to VAP. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary.
3. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient suffered from anoxic brain injury due to two episodes of PEA arrest. His mental status is improving but prognosis regarding mental status is poor.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe necrotizing pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation. Close monitoring of pancreatic enzymes and tube feeds is required.
5. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has hyponatremia, anemia, and hypercalc"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 28M prolonged hospital course over past few
   months with pancreatitis c/b ARF, arrest, hypoxic neurologic injury,
   respiratory failure, recurrent pneumonia. Trach downsized, adjusting
   fosphenytoin per neuro recs.
   Exam notable for Tm 100.6 BP 140/50 HR 100-110 RR 19 with sat 99 on PSV
   [**10-8**]. WD man, eyes track, follows some commands. Trach c/d/i. Coarse BS
   B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 2+ edema. Labs notable for WBC 17K, HCT 27, K+
   4.0, Cr 0.6.
   Agree with plan to manage recurrent pneumonia with ceftaz / tobra. For
   respiratory failure, continue TM trials during the day with PSV
   overnight and as needed. Mental status is slowly improving. For
   seizures, continue fosphenytoin and keppra per neuro recs. Pancreatitis
   is stable, tolerating TFS, no role for drainage at this point. Ongoing
   FW restriction for hyponatremia. DM is well controlled. Hypercalcemia
   is stable. SMV thrombus resolving - will get anticoagulated for six
   months. Monitoring eosinophilia, will recheck [**Last Name (un) **] stim. Above d/w
   mother at bedside. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizures,
   with ongoing fevers likely secondary to VAP which is overall improving.
   VAP/Respiratory failure:  Sputum growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas in
   addition to ALCALIGENES XYLOSOXIDANS.  Now on ceftaz and tobra with
   fever curve and WBC improving..  WBC improving, and clinically
   improved.  Patient has not tolerated TCM trials due to coughing fits.
   Trach was downsized yesterday to a size 6 tube with hopes of improved
   patient comfort.
   - continue tobra (d1 = [**7-23**]) q 48 hours until [**8-14**]
   - continue ceftaz  (day 1 = [**7-31**]) until [**8-14**]
   - cosider meropenem if febrile or unstable; skin blistering occurred in
   the setting of anasarca and occurred predominantly on the legs which is
   atypical for a drug rash; nevertheless, we will reserve [**Last Name (un) **] unless
   absolutely necessary
   - f/u colisitin sensitivies for pseudomonas, though would prefer to
   avoid this as it can cause irreversible renal failure
   - appreciate ID recs
   -TCM trials as tolerated
   .
   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.
   Overall mental status is improving, but prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue increase dose of dilantin 200-200-100 per neurology as
   dilantin level has been repeatedly subtherapeutic
   - continue standing ativan
   - appreciate neuro recs, now recommending 300mg IV Q6 with [**Hospital1 **] troughs
   and continuing PO for now. Will discuss with neuro re: defined course.
   .
   Hypothyroid.  TFTs consistent with hypothyroidism. Endocrine
   recommended starting levoxyl 25mcg daily with repeat TFTs in 2 wks.
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   Anemia.  Likely multifactorial, chronic disease, phlebotomy.
   - cont to monitor hct
   - stable, heparin resumed.
   - guaiac stools
   .
   Hyponatremia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and
   seizures.   Stable.
   - continued to have concentrated TFs and abx
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seems to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely partially
   related to fever, and is improving as fever curve is starting to
   decrease.
   - telemetry
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Now PMNs have returned to [**Location 201**], eosinophilia has come
   back; may have been secondary to bactrim exposure several weeks ago.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  In setting of worsening infection, has had increasing
   hyperglycemia
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.   S/p
   pamidronate and Calcitonin.  Ca stable recently.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - trend calcium
   .
   SMV thrombus.  Undergoing heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus
   likely secondary to severe pancreatitis.  INR remains subtherapeutic
   - continue heparing to coumadin briding
   - continue coumadin with plan for 6 month course
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior saline
   infusion and seizures.
   - follow bicarb

   Communication:  Comments:
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, PEA arrest, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is improving. The patient also has hypothyroidism, anemia, hyponatremia, tachycardia, pancreatitis, eosinophilia, diabetes, hypercalcemia, SMV thrombus, and metabolic acidosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the progress note include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged use of medical devices such as the tracheostomy tube and central venous catheter.

2. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures increases the risk of recurrent seizure activity, especially if his neurologic status worsens or if there are any electrolyte imbalances.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is closely monitored due to his VAP and previous respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory function if proper ventilation and infection control measures are not maintained.

4. Pancreatitis complications: The patient has severe necrotizing pancreatitis with pseudocysts. Complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or rupture of pseudocysts may occur, leading to further systemic infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, and previous PEA arrests with anoxic brain injury and seizures. He is currently in the ICU with ongoing fevers likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is improving. The patient has not tolerated tracheostomy tube changes due to coughing fits and has been downsized to a size 6 tube. He is receiving ceftazidime and tobramycin for VAP, with plans to continue these antibiotics until August 14th. If febrile or unstable, meropenem may be considered, but skin blistering occurred with previous use. Colistin sensitivities for pseudomonas will be followed up, but its use may be avoided due to potential irreversible renal failure.

The patient also has AMS secondary to anoxic brain injury and seizures, with overall mental status improving but poor prognosis regarding mental status. He is on keppra 1 g, increasing doses of dilantin, and lorazepam for seizure management. Hypothyroidism is present, with thyroid function tests consistent with hypothyroidism. Levoxyl 25mcg daily has been started, with repeat TFTs in two weeks.

Anemia is likely multifactorial, chronic disease, and phlebotomy-related. Chronic disease and ongoing blood loss from NG tube are suspected contributors. Hyponatrem"

   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 35 min
","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a complex medical history, including pancreatitis complicated by cerebral edema, several episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests, recurrent seizures, and resistant pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been critically ill and has experienced multiple complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VAP: The patient has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia, which is a common complication in critically ill patients who are on mechanical ventilation. The causative organism is resistant pseudomonas, making it challenging to treat.
2. Seizures: The patient is experiencing recurrent seizures, which may be attributed to the cerebral edema caused by the pancreatitis or due to other factors.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient initially presented with necrotizing pancreatitis, which has led to several complications.
4. SMV thrombosis: The patient has developed a superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis, which is a potential complication of pancreatitis.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has ongoing fluid restrictions due to hyponatremia, a condition characterized by low levels of sodium in the blood.
6. Hypercalcemia: The patient has stable hypercalcemia, which requires monitoring.
7. PEG or doboff: The patient requires further evaluation regarding placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or a feeding jejunostomy (doboff"

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a complex medical history, including necrotizing pancreatitis, cerebral edema, multiple episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrests, recurrent seizures, and resistant pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 113 beats per minute, blood pressure of 124/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on aerosol-cool with tracheostomy tube ventilation. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's imaging shows the presence of pseudomonas bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures. 

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further seizures, progression of pancreatitis, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's current treatment plan includes antibiotic therapy for VAP, aggressive management of seizures, continued nutritional support through tube feeds, and systemic anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU with ongoing monitoring and management of his critical condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male who is currently unresponsive and in the ICU due to a previous pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has a history of allergies to meropenem and skin blisters. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/59 mmHg to 139/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheal mask. The patient is receiving various medications, including famotidine, lorazepam, and regular insulin for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and there is a mention of respiratory support with a tracheal mask. This suggests the possibility of acute respiratory failure, although it is not specified as ARDS.

2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of fever may indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis. Additionally, the patient has multiple comorbidities that increase the risk of developing sepsis.

3. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient's unresponsive state and history of a PEA arrest suggest potential anoxic brain damage due to inadequate oxygen supply to the brain during the cardiac arrest.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient"

   24 Hour Events:
   - thoracics consulted, will try to place bedside PEG tomorrow; holding
   coumadin tonight, stopping heparin and TFs at midnight, labs at 3am
   with coags and type and cross for FFP if INR >1.5
   - dilantin level therapeutic at 530pm, called neuro and per their recs,
   stopped IV dilantin, continue to check daily levels and adjust as
   needed per those
   - endo recs suggested starting vit d 50,000u twice weekly for 4 weeks
   and then rechecking level
   - insulin scale was switched from humalog to regular and titrated up
   for mild hyperglycemia
   - Na worsened, urine lytes showed Na of 100, so still likely consistent
   with SIADH, although on lasix so isn't clear
   - had appropriate cortisol stim test, 10 --> 30
   - tolerated trach mask all night

   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizures,
   with ongoing fevers likely secondary to VAP which is overall improving.
   VAP/Respiratory failure:  Sputum growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas in
   addition to ALCALIGENES XYLOSOXIDANS.  Now on ceftaz and tobra with
   fever curve and WBC improving..  WBC improving, and clinically
   improved.  Patient has not tolerated TCM trials due to coughing fits.
   Trach was downsized [**8-6**] to a size 6 tube with hopes of improved patient
   comfort.
   - continue tobra (d1 = [**7-23**]) q 48 hours until [**8-14**]
   - continue ceftaz  (day 1 = [**7-31**]) until [**8-14**]
   - cosider meropenem if febrile or unstable; skin blistering occurred in
   the setting of anasarca and occurred predominantly on the legs which is
   atypical for a drug rash; nevertheless, we will reserve [**Last Name (un) **] unless
   absolutely necessary

   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.
   Overall mental status is improving, but prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue increase dose of dilantin 200-200-100
   - continue standing ativan
   - appreciate neuro recs, now recommending 300mg IV Q6 with [**Hospital1 **] troughs
   and continuing PO for now. Will discuss with neuro re: defined course.
   .
   Hypothyroid.  TFTs consistent with hypothyroidism. Endocrine
   recommended starting levoxyl 25mcg daily with repeat TFTs in 2 wks.
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   Anemia.  Likely multifactorial, chronic disease, phlebotomy.
   - cont to monitor hct
   - stable, heparin resumed.
   .
   Hyponatremia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and
   seizures.   Stable.
   - continued to have concentrated TFs and abx
   - will [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] stim test today
   - continue lasix today as total body up
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seems to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely partially
   related to fever, and is improving as fever curve is starting to
   decrease.
   - telemetry
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to bactrim, cont to monitor.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  In setting of worsening infection, has had increasing
   hyperglycemia
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.   S/p
   pamidronate and Calcitonin.  Ca stable recently.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - trend calcium

   SMV thrombus.  Undergoing heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus
   likely secondary to severe pancreatitis.  INR remains subtherapeutic

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis and subsequent pseudocysts. He has experienced two episodes of PEA arrest and has anoxic brain injury with ongoing seizure activity. The patient has also been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, anemia, hyponatremia, tachycardia, pancreatitis with pancreatic pseudocysts, eosinophilia, diabetes, hypercalcemia, SMV thrombus, and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's current condition includes ongoing fevers likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently receiving treatment with ceftazidime and tobramycin for the VAP, and his fever curve and WBC count are improving. The patient has not tolerated trials of tracheostomy due to coughing fits and has been placed on a size 6 tracheostomy tube for improved patient comfort.

The patient's mental status is improving, but the prognosis regarding mental status is poor. He is being treated with keppra, dilantin, and ativan for AMS secondary to anoxic brain injury and seizures. He has been started on levoxyl for hypothyroidism and will have repeat TFTs in 2 weeks. The patient's anemia is likely multifactorial, chronic disease, phlebotomy, and will continue to monitor HCT. He has stable hyponat"

   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizures,
   with ongoing fevers likely secondary to VAP which is overall improving.
   VAP/Respiratory failure:  Sputum growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas in
   addition to ALCALIGENES XYLOSOXIDANS.  Now on ceftaz and tobra with
   fever curve and WBC improving..  WBC improving, and clinically
   improved.  Patient has not tolerated TCM trials due to coughing fits.
   Trach was downsized [**8-6**] to a size 6 tube with hopes of improved patient
   comfort.
   - continue tobra (d1 = [**7-23**]) q 48 hours until [**8-14**]
   - continue ceftaz  (day 1 = [**7-31**]) until [**8-14**]
   - cosider meropenem if febrile or unstable; skin blistering occurred in
   the setting of anasarca and occurred predominantly on the legs which is
   atypical for a drug rash; nevertheless, we will reserve [**Last Name (un) **] unless
   absolutely necessary
   - f/u colisitin sensitivies for pseudomonas, though would prefer to
   avoid this as it can cause irreversible renal failure
   - appreciate ID recs

   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.
   Overall mental status is improving, but prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue increase dose of dilantin 200-200-100
   - continue standing ativan
   - appreciate neuro recs, now recommending 300mg IV Q6 with [**Hospital1 **] troughs
   and continuing PO for now. Will discuss with neuro re: defined course.
   .
   Hypothyroid.  TFTs consistent with hypothyroidism. Endocrine
   recommended starting levoxyl 25mcg daily with repeat TFTs in 2 wks.
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   Anemia.  Likely multifactorial, chronic disease, phlebotomy.
   - cont to monitor hct
   - stable, heparin resumed.
   .
   Hyponatremia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and
   seizures.   Stable.
   - continued to have concentrated TFs and abx
   - will [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] stim test today
   - continue lasix today as total body up
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seems to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely partially
   related to fever, and is improving as fever curve is starting to
   decrease.
   - telemetry
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to bactrim, cont to monitor.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  In setting of worsening infection, has had increasing
   hyperglycemia
   - follow fingersticks and cover with HISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.   S/p
   pamidronate and Calcitonin.  Ca stable recently.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - trend calcium
   .
   SMV thrombus.  Undergoing heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus
   likely secondary to severe pancreatitis.  INR remains subtherapeutic
   - depending on if surgery can place a peg, will stop coumadin and
   heparin and transition to lovenox
   - if [**Doctor First Name 91**] will place peg, hold coumadin and cont heparin gtt

   Metabolic acidosis.  Likely multifactorial secondary to prior saline
   infusion and seizures.
   - follow bicarb

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, and anoxic brain injury with seizures. He experienced two PEA arrests and is currently minimally responsive. The patient has various medical complications including VAP, AMS, hypothyroidism, anemia, hyponatremia, tachycardia, pancreatitis, eosinophilia, diabetes, hypercalcemia, SMV thrombus, metabolic acidosis, and FEN. The patient's condition is improving but with a poor prognosis regarding mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's sputum culture grew colonies of pseudomonas, indicating an infection that may lead to worsening respiratory failure.
2. Acute Mesial Syndrome (AMS): The patient's anoxic brain injury and seizures have resulted in AMS, which can progress to permanent neurological damage.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid function tests indicate hypothyroidism, requiring levothyroxine supplementation.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic disease-related anemia, possibly exacerbated by phlebotomy.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia likely due to central SIADH secondary to anoxic brain injury and seizures.
6. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is not fully explained"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizures,
   with ongoing fevers likely secondary to VAP which is overall improving.
   VAP/Respiratory failure:  Sputum growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas in
   addition to ALCALIGENES XYLOSOXIDANS.  Now on ceftaz and tobra with
   fever curve and WBC improving.  Has also been tolerating trach [**Last Name (un) 3041**].
   Trach was downsized [**8-6**] to a size 6 tube with hopes of improved patient
   comfort.  Trach secretions now show pseudomonas colonies with
   intermediate ceftaz resistance.
   - continue tobra (d1 = [**7-23**]) q 48 hours until [**8-14**]
   - continue ceftaz  (day 1 = [**7-31**]) until [**8-14**], but will discuss with ID
   re:  use of darbopenem
   - cosider meropenem if febrile or unstable; skin blistering occurred in
   the setting of anasarca and occurred predominantly on the legs which is
   atypical for a drug rash; nevertheless, we will reserve [**Last Name (un) **] unless
   absolutely necessary
   - f/u colisitin sensitivies for pseudomonas, though would prefer to
   avoid this as it can cause irreversible renal failure
   -TCM trials as tolerated

   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.
   Overall mental status is improving, but prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue increase dose of dilantin 200-200-100
   - continue standing ativan
   - appreciate neuro recs
   .
   Hypothyroid.  TFTs consistent with hypothyroidism. Endocrine
   recommended starting levoxyl 25mcg daily with repeat TFTs in 2 wks.
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   Anemia.  Likely multifactorial, chronic disease, phlebotomy.
   - cont to monitor hct
   - stable, heparin resumed.
   .
   Hyponatremia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and
   seizures.   Worsened yesterday with lasix.  [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim was apporpirate
   so not likely to be due to adrenal insufficiency.
   - continued to have concentrated TFs and abx
   - will [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] stim test today
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seems to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely partially
   related to fever, and is improving as fever curve is starting to
   decrease.
   - telemetry
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to bactrim, cont to monitor.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  In setting of worsening infection, has had increasing
   hyperglycemia
   - follow fingersticks and cover with RISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.   S/p
   pamidronate and Calcitonin.  Ca stable recently.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - trend calcium
   .
   SMV thrombus.  Undergoing heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus
   likely secondary to severe pancreatitis.  INR remains subtherapeutic
   - lovenox to coumadin briding after G-tube placement
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Unclear etiology, but stable.  Possibly related to
   respiratory status.
   - follow bicarb
   - check VBG

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of etoh pancreatitis, multiple complications, anoxic brain injury, and pea arrests. He is currently in the ICU and has been unresponsive to commands. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is receiving various medications including sedatives, antibiotics, and antiepileptic drugs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Proper mouth care and elevation of the head of bed should be continued as prophylaxis.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has a PICC line in place. There is a risk of developing a CLABSI, so careful line maintenance and monitoring for signs of infection are necessary.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is immobile and at increased risk for thromboembolic events. Restarting systemic anticoagulation after the procedure is recommended to prevent DVT formation.
4. Hypotension and fluid imbalance: The patient's blood pressure is low, and there is a negative fluid balance indicated by the difference between input and output volumes. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are essential.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's ABG results show metabolic acidosis. Further investigation and correction of electrolyte imbalances are necessary"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of etoh pancreatitis, multiple complications, anoxic brain injury, and pea arrests. He is currently in the ICU for further management. 

The patient was unable to tolerate a procedure for obtaining a bedside peg tube and will require an open procedure later in the day. He is stable with no other significant events. 

The patient has allergies to meropenem and skin blisters. He received tobramycin and ceftazidime as antibiotics, with the latest culture showing resistance to ceftazidime. 

The patient is receiving multiple medications including lorazepam, famotidine, midazolam, fentanyl, and others. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for cough and no shortness of breath. 

Flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal limits, including a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure of 118/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient has a sinus tachycardia rhythm and is receiving respiratory support with a tracheostomy mask, controlled mechanical ventilation, and supplemental oxygen. 

Physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, and no cyanosis or clubbing. 

Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's unresponsive state"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis and pseudocysts, who experienced two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest with subsequent anoxic brain injury and seizures. He is currently admitted to the ICU for severe respiratory failure due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has multiple medical complications including hypothyroidism, anemia, hyponatremia, tachycardia, pancreatitis, eosinophilia, diabetes, hypercalcemia, SMV thrombus, and metabolic acidosis. He underwent an unsuccessful attempt at bedside percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) but had a successful PEG placement in the operating room. The patient's condition is improving, but his prognosis regarding mental status is poor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing severe respiratory failure due to VAP. It is crucial to continue aggressive treatment with appropriate antibiotics and maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation support.
2. Pseudomonas infection: The patient's tracheostomy secretions show pseudomonas colonies with intermediate ceftaz resistance. This indicates a potential infection with this antibiotic-resistant organism, which requires careful monitoring and consideration of alternative antibiotic therapy.
3. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's two episodes of PEA arrest have resulted in anoxic brain injury, leading to AMS (altered mental status) and poor prognosis for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of being unable to tolerate oral intake. The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but it was successfully weaned off. However, the patient required reintubation due to respiratory distress and is currently on standby ventilation mode with a tracheostomy. The patient also has a newly placed PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) tube for nutrition, as an attempt at bedside PEG was unsuccessful.

The patient has a history of allergies to meropenem and has been receiving multiple antibiotics including ceftazidime and tobramycin. He is on several ICU medications such as midazolam (versed), fentanyl, lorazepam (Ativan), and famotidine (Pepcid).

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 115 bpm and slightly elevated blood pressure. His respiratory rate is within normal limits, and his oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 851 mL and output of 1875 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1024 mL. The patient's weight has decreased from 99.5 kg at admission to 92.1 kg currently.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and slightly decreased platelet count. Blood glucose levels are elevated, and kidney function appears to be normal based on creatinine levels. Liver"

   Hypothyroid.  TFTs consistent with hypothyroidism. Endocrine
   recommended starting levoxyl 25mcg daily with repeat TFTs in 2 wks.
   - continue levothyroxine

   Anemia.  Likely multifactorial, chronic disease, phlebotomy.
   - cont to monitor hct
   - stable, heparin resumed.

   Hyponatremia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and
   seizures.   [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim was apporpirate so not likely to be due to
   adrenal insufficiency.
   - continued to have concentrated TFs and abx
   -improved yesterday with NPO status.
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seems to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely partially
   related to fever, and is improving as fever curve is starting to
   decrease.

   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to bactrim, cont to monitor.

   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently on antibiotics to treat the infection. However, the presence of intermediate ceftaz resistance suggests that the bacteria may not be fully susceptible to the current treatment. This could lead to a worsening infection and the need for alternative antibiotics.

2. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures due to anoxic brain injury. It is important to continue seizure prophylaxis with medications such as keppra and dilantin to prevent further seizure activity.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which may be due to central SIADH caused by anoxic brain injury and seizures. Monitoring sodium levels and adjusting treatment accordingly is necessary.

4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia does not have a clear etiology and has not responded to fentanyl boluses, ativan doses, or IV fluids. Continuous monitoring and further investigation are required to determine the cause.

5. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe necrotizing pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation. Although the lipase levels are trending downward, ongoing monitoring of pancreatic enzymes is needed. The patient is also at risk for developing complications related to the pseudocysts.

6. Diabetes: The patient has had hypoglycemia during P"

   nutrition for 36 hours
   - Neuro recommends:
   *Resume Dilantin 300mg IV Q6 hrs with trough before each dose, with
   goal uncorrected level of [**7-15**] (should correct roughly to [**10-20**] based
   on yesterday's albumin level).  Discontinue boluses and continue PO/NG
   once at goal.
   *increase standing PO/NG Dilantin to 200 TID and continue during period
   of boluses.
   - Na increased when patient was strictly NPO for G-tube placement
   - lovenox started this morning

   BAL now showing ceftaz resistant pseudomonas.
   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizures,
   with ongoing fevers likely secondary to VAP which is overall improving.
   VAP/Respiratory failure:  Sputum growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas in
   addition to ALCALIGENES XYLOSOXIDANS.  Now on ceftaz and tobra with
   fever curve and WBC improving.  Has also been tolerating trach [**Last Name (un) 3041**].
   Trach was downsized [**8-6**] to a size 6 tube with hopes of improved patient
   comfort.  Trach secretions now show pseudomonas colonies with
   intermediate ceftaz resistance.
   - continue tobra (d1 = [**7-23**]) q 48 hours until [**8-14**]
   -dc ceftaz as now resistant..
   - cosider meropenem if febrile or unstable; skin blistering occurred in
   the setting of anasarca and occurred predominantly on the legs which is
   atypical for a drug rash; nevertheless, we will reserve [**Last Name (un) **] unless
   absolutely necessary
   - f/u colisitin sensitivies for pseudomonas, though would prefer to
   avoid this as it can cause irreversible renal failure
   -TCM trials as tolerated

   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.
   Overall mental status is improving, but prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue increase dose of dilantin 200-200-200
   - continue standing ativan
   - appreciate neuro recs, IV boluses until at goal.
   .
   Hypothyroid.  TFTs consistent with hypothyroidism. Endocrine
   recommended starting levoxyl 25mcg daily with repeat TFTs in 2 wks.
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   Anemia.  Likely multifactorial, chronic disease, phlebotomy.
   - cont to monitor hct
   - stable, heparin resumed.
   .
   Hyponatremia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and
   seizures.   [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim was apporpirate so not likely to be due to
   adrenal insufficiency.
   - continued to have concentrated TFs and abx
   -improved yesterday with NPO status.
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seems to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely partially
   related to fever, and is improving as fever curve is starting to
   decrease.
   - telemetry
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to bactrim, cont to monitor.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  In setting of worsening infection, has had increasing
   hyperglycemia
   - follow fingersticks and cover with RISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.   S/p
   pamidronate and Calcitonin.  Ca stable recently.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - trend calcium
   .
   SMV thrombus.  Undergoing heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus
   likely secondary to severe pancreatitis.  INR remains subtherapeutic
   - lovenox to coumadin briding after G-tube placement
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Unclear etiology, but stable.  Possibly related to
   respiratory status.
   - follow bicarb

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, PEA arrest, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. The patient has been experiencing fevers likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is overall improving. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place.

The patient's current medications include meropenem, tobramycin, famotidine, fentanyl, lorazepam, fosphenytoin, and levoxyl. The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal thyroid function tests.

The patient's medical conditions include VAP, AMS (acute mental status change) due to anoxic brain injury and seizures, hypothyroidism, anemia, hyponatremia, tachycardia, pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation, eosinophilia, history of PEA arrest, diabetes mellitus, hypercalcemia, and a thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein (SMV).

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been experiencing fevers likely secondary to VAP. It is important to monitor for worsening respiratory symptoms, increased fever, and changes in sputum culture.

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo man with h/o recent admission with necrotizing pancreatitis c/b
   pseudocysts, s/p PEA arrest x2 with anoxic brain injury and seizures,
   with ongoing fevers likely secondary to VAP which is overall improving.
   VAP/Respiratory failure:  Sputum growing 2 colonies of pseudomonas in
   addition to ALCALIGENES XYLOSOXIDANS.  Now on ceftaz and tobra with
   fever curve and WBC improving.  Has also been tolerating trach [**Last Name (un) 3041**].
   Trach was downsized [**8-6**] to a size 6 tube with hopes of improved patient
   comfort.  Trach secretions now show pseudomonas colonies with
   intermediate ceftaz resistance.
   - continue tobra (d1 = [**7-23**]) q 48 hours until [**8-14**]
   -dc ceftaz as now resistant..
   - cosider meropenem if febrile or unstable; skin blistering occurred in
   the setting of anasarca and occurred predominantly on the legs which is
   atypical for a drug rash; nevertheless, we will reserve [**Last Name (un) **] unless
   absolutely necessary
   - f/u colisitin sensitivies for pseudomonas, though would prefer to
   avoid this as it can cause irreversible renal failure
   -TCM trials as tolerated
   .
   AMS secondary to Anoxic Brain Injury/Seizures.  Patient has suffered
   two PEA arrests and has anoxic brain injury with seizure activity.
   Overall mental status is improving, but prognosis regarding mental
   status is poor.
   - continue keppra 1 g [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue increase dose of dilantin 200-200-200
   - continue standing ativan
   - appreciate neuro recs, IV boluses until at goal.
   .
   Hypothyroid.  TFTs consistent with hypothyroidism. Endocrine
   recommended starting levoxyl 25mcg daily with repeat TFTs in 2 wks.
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   Anemia.  Likely multifactorial, chronic disease, phlebotomy.
   - cont to monitor hct
   - stable, heparin resumed.
   .
   Hyponatremia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be central SIADH due to anoxic brain injury and
   seizures.   [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim was apporpirate so not likely to be due to
   adrenal insufficiency.
   - continued to have concentrated TFs and abx
   -improved yesterday with NPO status.
   .
   Tachycardia.  No clear etiology of tachycardia.  Did not respond to
   fentanyl boluses or extra ativan doses.  Did not respond it IVF
   boluses, either.  Seems to worsen with coughing fits.  Likely partially
   related to fever, and is improving as fever curve is starting to
   decrease.
   - telemetry
   .
   Pancreatitis:  Patient with severe necrotizing pancreatitis earlier in
   course of critical illness with pseudocyst formation.  No plans for
   surgical invention.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**7-25**] shows stable
   pancreatic pseudocysts.  Lipase continues to trend downward.
   - trending pancreatic enzymes
   - continue tube feeds
   Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to bactrim, cont to monitor.
   .
   S/p PEA arrest.  This is felt to be secondary to mucous plugging from
   VAP, continue suctioning as needed.  Additionally, patient was
   hypoglycemic on the floor in setting of recently starting glargine.
   - monitor on tele
   Diabetes.  Had hypoglycemia during PEA arrest after initation of
   glargine.  In setting of worsening infection, has had increasing
   hyperglycemia
   - follow fingersticks and cover with RISS, which has been titrated up
   - if long acting insulin is needed will start low given recent
   hypoglycemia
   .
   Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, but most likely secondary to bone
   turnover from being immobile and poor kidney excretion.   S/p
   pamidronate and Calcitonin.  Ca stable recently.
   - appreciate Endo recs
   - trend calcium
   .
   SMV thrombus.  Undergoing heparin to coumadin bridging for SMV thrombus
   likely secondary to severe pancreatitis.  INR remains subtherapeutic
   - lovenox to coumadin briding after G-tube placement
   .
   Metabolic acidosis.  Unclear etiology, but stable.  Possibly related to
   respiratory status.
   - follow bicarb
   - check VBG

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of recent admission for necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocysts, PEA arrest, anoxic brain injury, and seizures. He is currently in the ICU with ongoing fevers likely secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His vital signs show a sinus tachycardia, normal blood pressure, and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheal mask ventilation. The patient has a tracheostomy in place, which was downsized to size 6.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift, increased lactate level, and low platelet count. His renal function is impaired, as evidenced by an elevated creatinine level. Other lab abnormalities include hypothyroidism, hyponatremia, eosinophilia, hypercalcemia, anemia, and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's current medications include tobramycin, ceftazidime (now discontinued due to resistant pseudomonas), dilantin, enoxaparin (Lovenox), famotidine (Pepcid), fosphenytoin, lorazepam (Ativan), and levoxyl.

The patient's assessment and plan include:
1. VAP/Respiratory failure: The patient's sputum culture showed growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and he has been on ceftazidime and tobramycin. However,"
