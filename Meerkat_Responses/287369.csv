","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old gentleman with cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and an active seizure disorder. He presents with hypothermia, bradycardia, leukopenia, and altered mental status after upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms. There are no clear signs of infection. The patient's recent URI symptoms suggest a possible oropharyngeal source such as an abscess or foreign body causing abscess or pneumonia (PNA). The patient is currently being warmed using a bair hugger and antibiotic coverage has been changed to Unasyn for aspiration PNA, oral flora, Staph, Strep, and Gram-negative bacteria other than Pseudomonas.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia without exposure to the elements raises concern for severe sepsis or thyroid dysfunction. Immediate actions include warming the patient slowly with a bair hugger, ruling out myxedema coma with TSH, T3, T4, and cortisol tests, and following up with blood and urine cultures.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is not at his baseline, indicating possible causes such as sepsis from CNS, oral source, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, phenytoin toxicity, keppra toxicity, carbamazepine toxicity, or myxedema coma. Further workup includes ABG to evaluate respiratory status"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and an active seizure disorder. He presented with hypothermia, bradycardia, leukopenia, and altered mental status after experiencing URI symptoms without clear signs of infection. The patient has a history of poor oral intake, which may have contributed to hypernatremia and hyperchloremia. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and being treated for presumed aspiration pneumonia. Additional investigations are planned to rule out other potential causes such as myxedema coma, central nervous system infection, Clostridium difficile infection, and foreign body in the oropharynx.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's altered mental status, leukopenia, and recent URI symptoms, there is a concern for severe sepsis. Immediate treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care is necessary.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and inability to protect his airway increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further imaging and cultures are pending.
3. Myxedema Coma: The patient's hypothermia and bradycardia could be indicative of myxedema coma, especially considering his history of mental retardation. Thyroid function tests should be urgently performed to rule out this condition.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions and interventions. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) at 03:54 AM, broadened antibiotic therapy, and experienced a generalized seizure that was aborted with Ativan IV. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn) all administered on 03/05/2196.

The patient is receiving various medications including Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis, Lorazepam (Ativan), and other ICU medications. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the seizure event.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 95 bpm with a range of 67-103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/57 mmHg to 133/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute with a range of 9-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 5,010 mL with an output of 825 mL, resulting in a balance of 4,670 mL. The patient is receiving fluids through intravenous (IV) access.

The patient requires respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has a SpO2 of 96%."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with mental retardation who presented with hypotension and altered mental status. He was found to have a rectal temperature of 89F and upper respiratory symptoms, including cough and upper airway stridor. The patient received empiric antibiotics in the emergency department and experienced a brief generalized tonic-clonic seizure. 

The patient underwent two lumbar punctures overnight and received lorazepam to break a localized seizure. His last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn). The patient is on heparin sodium for prophylaxis, lorazepam (Ativan), Keppra, and thiamine.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure ranging from 104/41 to 133/86 mmHg, a heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal limits, ranging from 37.1°C to 37.9°C.

The patient has a history of mental retardation and is unable to provide his own medical history. He has a fever, diarrhea, delirium, and pain but cannot answer questions regarding pain. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned symptoms.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with mental retardation and chronic seizure disorder who presented with altered mental status (AMS), hypothermia, and recurrent seizures. The patient's mental status is difficult to interpret, and there is a concern for ongoing seizure activity. The patient has been given ativan to break the seizure, and neurology input has been requested. The hypothermia is improving with supportive measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient has experienced recurrent seizures, which could lead to further complications if not properly managed.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature may increase the risk of complications such as arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and organ dysfunction.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various causes including infection, post-ictal state, or adrenal insufficiency. This may impair the patient's ability to maintain adequate airway, breathing, and circulation.
4. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting a concern for possible infection. If an infection is present, it can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's low cortisol levels raise concerns for adrenal insufficiency, which can result in shock and organ failure if not treated promptly.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has lower extremity edema, which increases the"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with mental retardation who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and altered mental status. He presented with persistent upper respiratory symptoms, cough, and upper airway stridor. The patient was found to have a rectal temperature of 89F and received empiric antibiotics in the emergency department. He experienced a brief generalized tonic-clonic seizure but responded well to intravenous fluids.

Overnight, the patient underwent a lumbar puncture twice and had another localized seizure, for which he received ativan to break. The patient is unable to provide a medical history due to encephalopathy. No known drug allergies were reported.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), lorazepam (ativan), levetiracetam (Keppra), and thiamine. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for hypothermia, diarrhea, delirium, and inability to answer pain.

Vital signs show a maximum temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F) and current temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), with a blood pressure ranging from 104/41 mmHg to 133/86 mmHg, heart rate between 67-103 bpm, respiratory rate between 9-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old gentleman with cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and an active seizure disorder. He presents with hypothermia, bradycardia, leukopenia, and altered mental status after URI symptoms without clear localizing signs of infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's URI symptoms and lack of clear localizing signs of infection may indicate a potential sepsis. The combination of hypothermia, leukopenia, and altered mental status is concerning for an ongoing infection.

2. Central Nervous System (CNS) Infection: Given the patient's altered mental status and seizure disorder, there is a risk of CNS infection such as meningitis or encephalitis. The presence of fever and neck stiffness should be assessed to rule out these conditions.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory support with aerosol-cool and low oxygen saturation indicates potential respiratory compromise. Continuous monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary to prevent respiratory failure.

4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia, which may be due to poor oral intake. Frequent monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential to manage this imbalance and prevent further complications.

5. Seizure Control: The patient's seizure disorder requires careful monitoring and management. Adjustments to antiepileptic medications may be needed to control seizure activity"

   Disposition:
","The patient's medical history includes a seizure without status epilepticus, hypernatremia (high sodium), hypothermia, altered mental status (not delirium), and bradycardia. 

The patient is currently receiving prophylactic heparin sodium for DVT, antibiotics (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, and ampicillin/sulbactam), lorazepam (Ativan), and other ICU medications. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/62 mmHg to 122/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, and lactic acid, with decreased levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit. 

The patient's physical examination is incomplete, with assessments not performed on peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other areas. 

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hypernatremia, infection due to prolonged antibiotic use, development of deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer bleeding, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and further deterioration of the patient's altered mental status."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and an active seizure disorder. He presents with hypothermia, bradycardia, leukopenia, and altered mental status after experiencing URI symptoms without clear signs of infection. Possible seizure activity was observed on EEG.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient is intermittently hypothermic without an identified infectious source. This may not be sepsis-related. Neurological dysautonomia related to current neuro issues should be considered.
2. Altered Mental Status: The combination of seizure disorder, post-ictal state, and baseline mental retardation is causing the altered mental status. Hypothermia and sepsis workup should be continued, along with monitoring drug levels and following neurology recommendations. Acyclovir should be continued for empirical HSV encephalitis until the PCR results from CSF are available.
3. Seizure Disorder: The patient had a seizure today, which was controlled with ativan. Phenytoin levels are elevated but within previous ranges. Continue IV Keppra, increase dose of carbamazepine, continue ativan standing, and implement seizure/fall precautions. Neurology recommendations should be followed.
4. Bradycardia: The bradycardia is likely due to hypothermia, and the rate has improved with warming. The plan remains the same as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and an active seizure disorder. He presented with hypothermia, bradycardia, leukopenia, and altered mental status after experiencing upper respiratory infection symptoms without clear signs of infection. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, antivirals, and anticonvulsants. He continues to show altered mental status and seizure activity. Other concerns include hypernatremia, hypothermia, and bradycardia. The patient is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, altered mental status, and leukopenia, may indicate a possible sepsis. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy accordingly is important.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be due to delirium, especially considering his baseline mental retardation. It is crucial to assess and manage potential causes of delirium, such as infections or medication side effects.
3. Seizure Control: The patient's seizure disorder requires close monitoring and appropriate anticonvulsant therapy. Ensuring proper medication levels and managing seizure triggers is essential.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be corrected carefully to prevent rapid shifts in serum osmolality and potential neurological complications.
5. Hypothermia: The patient's"

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined MR. [**Known lastname 13474**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 347**]; his note and the ICU
   team note from today reflect my input.  I would add/emphasize that this
   51 y/o man with complex neurologic history presented with hypotension
   and hypothermia.  Hypotension has improved, but hypothermia persists
   (close to normothermic, but requiring Bair hugger).  Has had some
   localized seizures.  Exam shows somnolence with some upper airway
   sounds, regular heart, clear lungs, soft abdomen.  Meds, labs, and
   imaging all reviewed.
   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o man with encephalopathy, hypotension (resolved), and hypothermia
   (ongoing).  Hypothermia is quite perplexing.  He does not appear
   overtly septic (though conceivable).  Adrenal insufficiency adequately
   excluded, as is hypothyroidism.  Clearly not environmental related.  We
   are left with potential neurologic causes predominating.  Hypothalamic
   issues might be at play
 he has some hypernatremia and relatively
   [**Name2 (NI) 4886**] urine output.  Will consult neurology for their thoughts (as well
   as assistance with management of complex seizure disorder), continue
   EEG, consider MRI, and evaluate urine Osm.  If dilute urine, then
   consider further evaluation for diabetes insipidus.  Other issues as
   per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 347**].

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a complex neurological history who presented with hypotension and hypothermia. The hypotension has improved, but the hypothermia persists. The patient also experienced some localized seizures. 

Upon examination, the patient is somnolent with regular heart sounds, clear lungs, and a soft abdomen. The vital signs show a temperature of 35.5°C (95.9°F), blood pressure ranging from 98/59 mmHg to 122/80 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin/Sulbactam, Acyclovir, and Vancomycin), anticonvulsants (Keppra, Thiamine, Tegretol, and Ativan), and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

Lab results indicate hypernatremia with a sodium level of 144 mEq/L, slightly elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated potassium levels. Other lab values are within normal range. 

The assessment and plan include the following: 
1. Hypernatremia: Continue free water administration.
2. Seizure, without status epilepticus: Continue current AED regimen and continuous EEG.
3. Hypothermia: No evidence of infection,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy presenting with hypothermia and transient hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and antiepileptics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 98/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has a history of anemia and is unable to answer pain assessments. The patient has been receiving aggressive antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen for seizure management. The patient's mental status remains altered, and there is no evidence of infection or other systemic cause for the hypothermia. The patient is critically ill and is expected to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has been diagnosed with a seizure, and despite being on an aggressive AED regimen, there is still a risk of recurrent seizures.
2. Infection: Although cultures have been negative so far, the patient is still at risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, especially since he has been intubated and on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a positive total in of 5,122 mL and total out of 2,000 mL,"

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of chronic psychosis presenting with hypothermia, transient hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and antiepileptic drugs. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 98/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, presence of an NG tube, right lower extremity edema, and warm skin without rash.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, and slightly elevated potassium levels of 5.3 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes hypernatremia, seizure activity, hypothermia, and altered mental status. The plan includes continuing free water for hypernatremia, continuous EEG and current AED regimen for seizure activity, and passive warming for hypothermia. The altered mental status is being closely monitored, and an MRI brain is planned to investigate further.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and an active seizure disorder. He presents with hypothermia, bradycardia, leukopenia, and altered mental status after URI symptoms without clear signs of infection. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are as follows:

1. Hypothermia: The patient is intermittently hypothermic without any infectious source identified. This may indicate neurological dysautonomia related to his current neuro issues. It is important to address this condition promptly to prevent further complications.

2. Altered Mental Status: The combination of seizure disorder, post-ictal state, and baseline mental retardation may contribute to the patient's altered mental status. It is crucial to rule out other potential causes such as infection, medication side effects, or neurological disorders. Further evaluation and consultation with the neurology team are recommended.

3. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a known seizure disorder and experienced a seizure episode today. It is important to continue antiepileptic medications (Keppra and Carbamazepine) and provide seizure/fall precautions to prevent further seizures.

4. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is likely due to hypothermia, and the heart rate improved with warming. Monitoring and managing the patient's body temperature is essential to prevent recurrent bradycardia.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is in the ICU with several ongoing medical conditions. The patient has hypernatremia (high sodium levels), a recent seizure, hypothermia, altered mental status (not delirium), and bradycardia. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antiviral medication, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), lorazepam, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Seizure recurrence: Since the patient had a recent seizure, there is a risk of further seizures due to ongoing underlying brain dysfunction or electrolyte imbalances.

2. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. If the antibiotics are ineffective or if the infection spreads, it could lead to a worsening of the patient's condition.

3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a positive fluid balance, which may contribute to the development of complications such as pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure.

4. Delirium: Although the patient's mental status is described as altered but not delirium, there is still a risk of developing delirium due to the patient's critical condition and potential medication effects.

5. Thromboembolic events: The patient is receiving heparin sodium as DVT prophylaxis. Despite this, there"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia (high sodium): This condition can lead to dehydration, seizures, and brain damage if not treated promptly.
2. Seizure disorder: The patient's altered mental status and possible seizure indicate a potential ongoing seizure disorder that requires further evaluation and management.
3. Hypothermia: The patient's intermittent hypothermia needs to be addressed and investigated for its underlying cause, especially since no infectious source has been identified.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's slow heart rate may require further investigation and treatment to prevent complications such as poor tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
5. Leukopenia (low white blood cell count): This condition can increase the risk of infections and should be monitored closely.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's baseline mental retardation combined with the current altered mental status may indicate an underlying neurological condition that needs evaluation and management.
7. Possible HSV encephalitis: The patient is being treated empirically for HSV encephalitis, which is a serious condition requiring prompt recognition and treatment to prevent complications like neurological damage and death.

The potential medical complications listed above require immediate attention and further evaluation to prevent worsening of the patient's condition."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and an active seizure disorder. He presents with hypothermia, bradycardia, leukopenia, and altered mental status after experiencing URI symptoms without clear signs of infection. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/71 to 138/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight is currently 102.5 kg.

The patient's labs indicate hyponatremia with a sodium level of 110 K/uL, elevated blood glucose at 99 mg/dL, leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 4.8, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 127, and an increased creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. Other lab results show slightly low hemoglobin, elevated potassium, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient has multiple medical conditions including hypernatremia, seizure disorder, hypothermia, altered mental status, and bradycardia. Possible complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's leukopenia and URI symptoms may indicate an increased risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis or other infections is crucial"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with hypothermia. The patient's temperature has been consistently below normal levels. The patient experienced seizures, leading to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy. Antibiotics were administered, including ceftriaxone, ampicillin/sulbactam, vancomycin, and acyclovir.

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate within the normal range, but slightly lower than average blood pressure. The respiratory rate is on the higher end of normal, and the oxygen saturation level is at 95%. The patient's weight remains unchanged from admission.

The fluid balance shows a total input of 5944 mL and a total output of 3230 mL since 98 AM. The current temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). The patient's maximum temperature recorded was also 36.8°C (98.2°F). The heart rate is 87 bpm, with a range of 73-90 bpm. The blood pressure is 125/53 mmHg, with a range of 100-138/51-73 mmHg. The respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, with a range of 15-28 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation level is 95%. The rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's labs reveal normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. The creatinine level is within normal range. However,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy (CP), mental retardation (MR), and seizure disorder. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS), ongoing seizures, and hypothermia of unclear cause. 

Upon evaluation for AMS, it was found that the patient's seizures were the main cause. An MRI is pending to evaluate for other structural diseases. Infection, adrenal or thyroid abnormalities, thiamine deficiency, and environmental exposure have been ruled out as potential causes of hypothermia, leaving neurological causes as the main possibility.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/53 to 138/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient has been receiving various medications, including lorazepam, heparin, and several anti-epileptic drugs such as dilantin, keppra, and carbamazepine.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypothermia: The patient's low body temperature requires immediate attention as severe hypothermia can lead to cardiac arrest and death if not treated promptly.

2. Seizures: The patient's ongoing seizures need to be managed effectively to prevent further complications and ensure the patient's safety.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old gentleman with a history of cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and an active seizure disorder. He presents with hypothermia, bradycardia, leukopenia, and altered mental status after experiencing upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms without clear signs of infection. The patient's MRI of the head showed brain and cerebellar atrophy, with no abnormal signal within the hippocampal regions or other focal abnormalities. There were ventricular changes described that could be consistent with periventricular leukomalacia and the patient's history of cerebral palsy. No enhancing brain lesions were seen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure Disorder: The patient's altered mental status and upper airway issues may be related to his seizure disorder. He is currently on multiple anti-epileptic medications guided by neurology.
2. Hypothermia: The patient had an episode of hypothermia, which has since resolved.
3. Altered Mental Status: This is likely related to neurologic problems, and there is evidence of sepsis.
4. HSV Encephalitis: The patient is being treated with acyclovir for empiric HSV encephalitis until the results of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PCR return.
5. Potential Infection: The patient's leukopenia and URI symptoms suggest a possible infection, and blood cultures are pending.
6. Respiratory Issues: The patient has prominent upper airway expiratory wheeze/vibratory sound, which may indicate respiratory difficulties.
7. Edema: The patient has significant edema to his knees bilaterally.
8. Possible DVT: The patient is receiving heparin for DVT prophylaxis, indicating a potential risk for deep vein thrombosis.

Please note that this summary and list of potential complications are based on the provided progress note. A thorough evaluation of the patient's medical history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic tests would be necessary for a comprehensive assessment and accurate prediction of potential complications."

","The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. 

The patient underwent an MRI of the head, which showed brain and cerebellar atrophy with ventricular changes consistent with periventricular leukomalacia. No abnormal signal within the hippocampal regions or other focal abnormalities were noted. There were no enhancing brain lesions.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.1°C (98.8°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate (HR) of 80 bpm with a normal range of 75-91 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 112/53 mmHg to 159/98 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 25 breaths per minute with a normal range of 17-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show the following: white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 4.8 to 5.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 35.0% to 36.8%, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 108 to 119 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 0.7 to 1.0 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) ranging from 28 to 32 mmHg, glucose levels ranging from 85 to 99 mg/dL, and other lab values including PT/PTT/INR, differential white blood cell count, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

The patient has been receiving various medications including ampicillin/sulbactam, vancomycin, acyclovir, heparin sodium, and lorazepam. The patient also has a nasogastric (NG) tube and is receiving fluids through intravenous (IV) lines.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypernatremia (high sodium), seizure without status epilepticus, hypothermia, altered mental status (not delirium), and bradycardia. The ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include worsening of hypernatremia, recurrent seizures, development of delirium or altered mental status, and potential cardiovascular complications due to bradycardia."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with cerebral palsy and mental retardation who presented with hypothermia and seizures. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple medications, including antiepileptic drugs, antibiotics, and anticoagulants. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 133/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient has a history of poor dentition and exhibits pedal edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's seizure activity has been controlled with lorazepam and other antiepileptic medications. The plan is to continue seizure management and provide supportive care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to antiepileptic drugs and potential aspiration risk, there is a risk of developing infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or bloodstream infection.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT, especially with the use of central venous catheters.
3. Ventricular Arrhythmias: The patient's history of seizures and the use of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and an active seizure disorder. He presents with hypothermia, bradycardia, leukopenia, and altered mental status following URI symptoms without clear signs of infection. Possible seizure. The patient is on multiple anti-epileptics and has a neurology-guided regimen. He is also being treated with acyclovir for empiric HSV encephalitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure disorder: The patient's altered mental status and upper airway issues may be related to his seizure disorder. It is important to continue the current anti-epileptic medications and follow neurology recommendations.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is currently within normal range, but close monitoring should be continued.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely related to neurologic problems. It is important to continue with the current treatment plan, including acyclovir for empiric HSV encephalitis until the PCR results from the CSF are available.
4. Infection: Although there are no clear localizing signs of infection, the presence of leukopenia raises concerns for possible infection. Continuous monitoring and appropriate cultures should be done to rule out any infection.
5. Fluid balance: The patient has received a significant amount of IV fluids, resulting in a positive fluid balance. Close monitoring of the patient's fluid"

The patient's vital signs are as follows: 
- Temperature: 35.7°C (96.2°F)
- Heart rate: 67 bpm
- Blood pressure: 112/72 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 99% on nasal cannula

The patient has been sedated and unable to provide a history. There are no known drug allergies. The patient received acyclovir on [**2196-3-9**] 07:37 AM and is currently on heparin sodium (prophylaxis) and lorazepam (Ativan).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of seizures. The flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and nutritional support.

The patient's physical examination revealed well-nourished general appearance, poor dentition, symmetric chest expansion with expiratory/inspiratory wheezes, soft non-tender abdomen, and warm skin without rash or jaundice. Neurologic examination showed purposeful movement, normal tone, and the patient responded to commands but"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with cerebral palsy (CP), mental retardation (MR), and a seizure disorder admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS). The patient's history was obtained from medical records and housestaff, as he is unable to provide history due to sedation. He has no known drug allergies. The patient received acyclovir on [**2196-3-9**] and was given heparin sodium for prophylaxis, along with lorazepam for sedation.

24-hour events include blood cultures taken at [**2196-3-8**] 10:00 PM, and urine culture also taken at the same time. The patient remained in the unit as a neuro step-down bed was unavailable.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, poor dentition, symmetric chest expansion with exp/insp wheezes, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, warm skin without rash or jaundice, and right lower extremity edema at 1+ with left lower extremity edema at 1+. Neurologic examination shows purposeful movement but inconsistent following of commands.

Lab results show a sodium level of 12.9 g/dL, indicating hypernatremia. Other lab values include elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), and TCO2. Glucose levels"
