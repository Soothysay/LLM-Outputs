 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   51-year-old man with hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis presented with
   hypotension, altered mental status, GI bleed.
   .
   # GI bleed: bleeding from NG site this morning but EGD revealed no
   active bleeding source and did show gastroesophageal junction ulcers.
   Patient did appear to bleed from colostomy site, but bleeding seems to
   have stopped. Received 2 units of pRBCs but Hct dropped from 28 to 23.
   Patient has multiple antibodies so it is a challenge get the right
   antigen-free blood products. Had EGD earlier, which revealed no active
   bleeding source and did reveal an GE junction ulcer. Surgery already
   saw colostomy which stopped bleeding. R IJ CVL site was bleeding and
   surgery placed a stitch and bleeding slowed down.
   - transfuse 2 more units of pRBCs
   - IVF as needed
   - keep active type and screen
   - PPI IV bid
   - f/u surgery recs
   - f/u GI recs
   - serial Hcts
   - maintain adequate IV access; currently has R IJ [**Location (un) 342**] line, large-bored
   PIVs
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: with elevated LFTs, bili. Discriminant function
   67. Very poor prognosis.
   - NPO for now but will need aggressive nutritional support once able to
   take TF
   - will consider steroids once infection is ruled out
   - CIWA
   - hepatology recs
   .
   # Altered mental status: concerning for hepatic encephalopathy. Less
   likely are uremia, infections, CNS hypoperfusion due to GI bleed.
   - lactulose, rifaximin
   - consider head imaging if mental status does not improve
   .
   # Acute kidney injury with contraction alkalosis: likely from
   hypovolemia. Hepatorenal syndrome is possible. Already received albumin
   earlier.
   - IVF resuscitation as needed
   - renally dose meds, no indication for HD currently
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Leukocytosis: with mild left shift. Might be caused by infection or
   reactive leukocytosis from GI bleed.
   - empiric vanco, ceftriaxone, metronidazole
   - f/u cx
   .
   # Hyponatremia: likely hypovolemic hyponatremia. FENa 1%.
   - IV NS and serial chemistry panels
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, npo give aspiration risk
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   -Bowel regimen, ppi

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis. He presented with hypotension, altered mental status, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be concerning for hepatic encephalopathy, which is a common complication of liver cirrhosis. It is important to manage this condition with lactulose and rifaximin.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis with a left shift suggests a possible infection. Empiric antibiotic coverage should be continued, and further cultures should be obtained to identify the causative organism.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary. Hepatorenal syndrome should also be considered due to the underlying liver disease.
4. GI bleeding: Although the active bleeding source has been identified and treated, there is a risk of re-bleeding. Prophylactic therapy with medications such as proton pump inhibitors should be continued to prevent further gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time indicate a coagulopathy. Close monitoring of clotting factors and appropriate"

","Summary:
The patient is a male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has experienced trauma and has been in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have shown signs of renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and liver function abnormalities. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and their hemoglobin concentration has dropped after receiving a blood transfusion. The patient has received multiple medications, including antibiotics and pain management drugs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of blood in the patient's stool or nasogastric tube suggests internal bleeding. This can result in hypovolemia, shock, and potentially require surgical intervention.
3. Liver function abnormalities: Elevated liver enzymes and low albumin levels indicate liver dysfunction. This can lead to impaired metabolism of drugs and nutrients, coagulopathy, and decreased immune function.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's confusion and sleepiness may be attributed to various factors such as medication side effects, electrolyte imbalances, organ dysfunction, or sepsis.
5. Hypotension: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure indicates potential inadequate tissue perfusion, which can lead to organ ischemia and dysfunction.
6. Infection: The patient's use of"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   51-year-old man with hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis presented with
   hypotension, altered mental status, GI bleed.
   .
   # GI bleed: bleeding from NG site this morning but EGD revealed no
   active bleeding source and did show gastroesophageal junction ulcers.
   Patient did appear to bleed from colostomy site, but bleeding seems to
   have stopped. Received 2 units of pRBCs but Hct dropped from 28 to 23.
   Patient has multiple antibodies so it is a challenge get the right
   antigen-free blood products. Had EGD earlier, which revealed no active
   bleeding source and did reveal an GE junction ulcer. Surgery already
   saw colostomy which stopped bleeding. R IJ CVL site was bleeding and
   surgery placed a stitch and bleeding slowed down.
   - transfuse 2 more units of pRBCs
   - IVF as needed

   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: with elevated LFTs, bili. Discriminant function
   67. Very poor prognosis.
   - NPO for now but will need aggressive nutritional support once able to
   take TF
   - will consider steroids once infection is ruled out
   - CIWA
   - hepatology recs
   .
   # Altered mental status: concerning for hepatic encephalopathy. Less
   likely are uremia, infections, CNS hypoperfusion due to GI bleed.
   - lactulose, rifaximin
   - consider head imaging if mental status does not improve
   .
   # Acute kidney injury with contraction alkalosis: likely from
   hypovolemia. Hepatorenal syndrome is possible. Already received albumin
   earlier.
   - IVF resuscitation as needed
   - renally dose meds, no indication for HD currently
   - f/u renal recs

   # Leukocytosis: with mild left shift. Might be caused by infection or
   reactive leukocytosis from GI bleed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis. He presented with hypotension, altered mental status, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and acute kidney injury. After receiving 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), the patient is now stable.

Medical Complications:

1. GI Bleed: The patient experienced bleeding from the colostomy, nasogastric (NG) tube, and central venous line (CVL) site yesterday but has stopped today. Endoscopy showed bleeding from ulcers without varices. The plan includes monitoring hemoglobin (Hct) levels, maintaining adequate intravenous (IV) access, and administering proton pump inhibitor (PPI) IV bid.

2. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and bilirubin levels, indicating liver dysfunction. The discriminant function is 67, indicating a very poor prognosis. Nutritional support and consideration of steroids once infection is ruled out will be necessary. Hepatology recommendations should also be followed.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. Other possible causes like uremia, infections, and CNS hypoperfusion are less likely. Lactulose and rifaximin should be administered to manage this condition.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with Hepatitis C and alcohol-induced cirrhosis. He was admitted with decompensated liver disease, acute renal failure (ARF), and acute blood loss anemia. The patient's condition has been complex, involving multiple medical complications.

1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has experienced significant blood loss, likely due to a gastrointestinal bleed, possibly related to a gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) ulcer. This has been further complicated by the presence of red blood cell antibodies, making it difficult to match suitable blood for transfusion.

2. Cirrhosis: The patient's liver disease is a result of both alcohol consumption and Hepatitis C infection. There may also be acute alcoholic hepatitis on top of the underlying liver disease. Decompensation is likely related to gastrointestinal bleeding as mentioned earlier.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, possibly due to pre-renal causes, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's urine output has been reasonable, indicating that he may have a contraction alkalosis. There are no immediate indications for hemodialysis (HD), but renal function should be closely monitored.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which is most likely due to volume contraction and chronic liver disease.

5. Hypokalemia: The cause of low"

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Hepatitis C-related complications: The patient has a history of Hepatitis C, which can lead to chronic liver disease and potentially progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. Complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and hepatorenal syndrome may develop.

2. Alcohol-related liver disease complications: The patient's cirrhosis is also attributed to alcohol use. Continued alcohol consumption can worsen liver function and lead to further complications like alcoholic hepatitis and liver failure.

3. Acute blood loss anemia complications: The patient has experienced significant blood loss, leading to acute blood loss anemia. This can result in hypovolemic shock and inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues. It is important to closely monitor and manage the patient's fluid balance and hemodynamic stability.

4. Acute renal failure complications: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which can be pre-renal, intrinsic renal, or post-renal in origin. Complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy (e.g., dialysis) should be considered.

5. Infection-related complications: The patient is on multiple antibiotics, indicating a concern for infections"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo male with Hep C and EtOH cirrhosis admitted with-
   1. Acute blood loss anemia- due to GI bleed most likely. Thought to be
   ostomy-site related though GEJ ulcer also seen. Also d/t IJ line site
   bleeding in the setting of coagulopathy. Resuscitation complicated by
   numerous RBC Ab making matching more difficult. Hemodyn stable.
   -Serial hct
s, [**Hospital1 7**] PPI, reverse anticoagulation while pt bleeding with
   ffp, vitamin K. Surgery and GI following
   -No [**Doctor First Name 213**] wanted as per disc w/ pt and brother [**Name (NI) **]
   2. Cirrhosis- EtOH and HCV related. Poss acute alc hep on top of
   underlying liver disease. Decompensation also prob related to GIB as
   above
   -cont lactulose and rifaximin; encephalopathy clearing
   -supp mgmt, trend LFTs
   3. ARF- pre-renal/ATN vs hepatorenal. Pt is making reasonable urine
   output and probably has a contraction alkalosis. No acute indications
   for HD.
   -re-check
lytes after resuscitation, dose meds for CrCl<10. Renal team
   following
   -bolus IVF for UOP; even to slightly positive fluid balance for now
   4. Hyponatremia- most likely [**1-6**] volume contraction and chronic liver
   dz
   5. Hypokalemia: unclear cause; may have  artificially low levels due to
   alkalosis causing translocation- will re-check after further fluid
   resusctiation
   6. Leukocytosis: unclear source, inflammation nonspecifically vs pulm
   source or GI source
   -cont vanco + CTX + Flagyl
   -recheck vanco level in the AM

   51 yo male with EtOH and Hep C cirrhosis, transferred from floor with
   GI bleed/acute blood  loss anemia, AMS, ARF. More alert today and
   attempts to communicate, though speech somewhat slurred.  Hct still
   somewhat low after 4 units blood; however, no longer noticing active
   bleeding from colostomy/trauma line. Hyponatremia and alkalosis
   improving with resuscitation and pt appears more alert. Remains in
   renal failure with borderline urine output. Major problems:
   1.       Acute blood loss anemia: still need to trend hct
s given
   inappropriately low increase with last transfusion, but rate of visible
   bleeding seems to be slowing and pt
s hemodynamics have been within n
   limits. Correct coagulopathy as needed for active bleeding, on PPI
   2.       Cirrhosis- on lactulose/rifaximini
   3.       ARF- renal function minimally changed with fluid
   resuscitation, borderline urine output but this may be partly [**1-6**]
   volume as he is putting out a lot of stool from lactulose. Will match
   I/O or run slightly positive today
   4.       AMS- multifactorial [**1-6**] hep.encephalopathy, renal failure,
   GIB, ?sepsis. Slowly improving
   5.       Leukocytosis: on empiric Vanc/CTX/flagyl, scale back in next
   1-2 days

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and EtOH cirrhosis admitted with decompensated liver disease, acute renal failure (ARF), and acute blood loss anemia. The patient has been receiving blood transfusions, and his hemodynamic status has been stable. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has experienced significant blood loss, leading to anemia. Monitoring the patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels and providing further blood transfusions as needed is crucial to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.

2. Cirrhosis: The patient's underlying liver disease is likely exacerbated by alcohol use and Hepatitis C infection. Close monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) and management of encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin is important.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause, whether it is pre-renal, intrinsic renal, or post-renal. Adjusting medication dosages for renal clearance and ensuring adequate fluid balance are important considerations.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to hepatic encephalopathy. Management with lactulose and rifaximin should continue, along with addressing other contributing factors such as electrolyte imbalances and infections"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hypotension, altered mental status, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently admitted to the ICU and has been diagnosed with renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and altered mental status. The patient's prognosis is very poor, and the medical team is discussing options for discharge with hospice if there is no chance of cure and the patient's condition continues to deteriorate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be concerning for hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver cirrhosis. It is characterized by confusion, disorientation, and other neurological symptoms.
2. GI Bleeding: The patient has experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and require urgent intervention to control the bleeding and prevent further blood loss.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury, which can occur due to hypovolemia from GI bleeding or as a complication of liver cirrhosis (hepatorenal syndrome).
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis suggests a possible infection, and the presence of purulent drainage from the peritoneal tap attempt site indicates a potential source of infection that needs to be addressed.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   51-year-old man with hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis presented with
   hypotension, altered mental status, GI bleed.
   .
   # GI bleed: bleeding from NG site this morning but EGD revealed no
   active bleeding source and did show gastroesophageal junction ulcers.
   Patient did appear to bleed from colostomy site, but bleeding seems to
   have stopped. Received 2 units of pRBCs but Hct dropped from 28 to 23.
   Patient has multiple antibodies so it is a challenge get the right
   antigen-free blood products. Had EGD earlier, which revealed no active
   bleeding source and did reveal an GE junction ulcer. Surgery already
   saw colostomy which stopped bleeding. R IJ CVL site was bleeding and
   surgery placed a stitch and bleeding slowed down.
   - transfuse 2 more units of pRBCs
   - IVF as needed
   - keep active type and screen
   - PPI IV bid
   - f/u surgery recs
   - f/u GI recs
   - serial Hcts
   - maintain adequate IV access; currently has R IJ [**Location (un) 342**] line, large-bored
   PIVs
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: with elevated LFTs, bili. Discriminant function
   67. Very poor prognosis.
   - NPO for now but will need aggressive nutritional support once able to
   take TF
   - will consider steroids once infection is ruled out
   - CIWA
   - hepatology recs
   .
   # Altered mental status: concerning for hepatic encephalopathy. Less
   likely are uremia, infections, CNS hypoperfusion due to GI bleed.
   - lactulose, rifaximin
   - consider head imaging if mental status does not improve
   .
   # Acute kidney injury with contraction alkalosis: likely from
   hypovolemia. Hepatorenal syndrome is possible. Already received albumin
   earlier.
   - IVF resuscitation as needed
   - renally dose meds, no indication for HD currently
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Leukocytosis: with mild left shift. Might be caused by infection or
   reactive leukocytosis from GI bleed.
   - empiric vanco, ceftriaxone, metronidazole
   - f/u cx
   .
   # Hyponatremia: likely hypovolemic hyponatremia. FENa 1%.
   - IV NS and serial chemistry panels
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, npo give aspiration risk
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis. He presented with hypotension, altered mental status, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) but his hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 28 to 23. He also has multiple antibodies, making it challenging to obtain the right antigen-free blood products. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed no active bleeding source and showed gastroesophageal junction ulcers. The patient also bled from the colostomy site, but the bleeding has stopped. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI bleed: The patient has experienced bleeding from the nasogastric (NG) site and colostomy site. The bleeding from the NG site has stopped, and there is no active bleeding source found during EGD. However, the patient did bleed from the colostomy site, but the bleeding seems to have stopped. 
   - Transfuse 2 more units of pRBCs
   - IV fluids as needed
   - Keep active type and screen
   - PPI IV bid
   - Follow up with surgery recommendations
   - Follow up with GI recommendations
   - Serial Hcts

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with Hepatitis C and EtOH cirrhosis admitted to the ICU with decompensated liver disease and acute blood loss anemia. The patient's condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications to consider.

1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has experienced significant blood loss, likely due to a gastrointestinal bleed. This has resulted in acute blood loss anemia, which is currently stable. However, further monitoring and management are required.

2. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis caused by both alcohol abuse and Hepatitis C infection. This underlying liver disease may have been exacerbated by recent acute alcoholic hepatitis. Management of cirrhosis involves supportive care, including lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy and rifaximin to prevent infection.

3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient has evidence of renal dysfunction, which could be pre-renal/acute tubular necrosis or hepatorenal syndrome. The patient is producing urine and does not currently require hemodialysis. Renal function should be closely monitored.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may be due to infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of infection. Antibiotic treatment should be continued based on culture results.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of liver function, development of hepatorenal syndrome, infections, and worsening of renal function"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and alcohol-induced cirrhosis. He was admitted with decompensated liver disease and acute blood loss anemia, which has since been stabilized. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/45 to 127/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, jaundice, and lower abdominal stage II breakdown. The patient's neurological status is described as attentive, following simple commands, and showing mild asterixis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia - The patient's anemia is thought to be due to a gastrointestinal bleed, possibly from an ostomy-site-related issue or a gastric junctional ulcer. This complication has been stabilized, but the patient may require further management and monitoring.
2. Cirrhosis - The patient's cirrhosis is related to both alcohol consumption and Hepatitis C infection. Decompensation of the liver disease is suspected to be related to the gastrointestinal bleed mentioned earlier. Treatment for cirrhosis includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin to manage encephalopathy, providing supportive management, and monitoring liver function tests.
3. Acute renal failure"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient is unable to provide any history due to encephalopathy. The patient has a history of renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and liver function abnormalities. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 109/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's labs show elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has multiple lines, including a trauma line, and is receiving prophylactic medications for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the disposition is unknown. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding, altered mental status, and abnormal liver function tests suggest the possibility of an underlying infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and may require immediate intervention.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's low oxygen saturation and requirement for mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing ARDS. This condition can result in severe respiratory failure and may necessitate additional supportive measures.

3. Liver Failure: The abnormal liver function tests indicate potential liver dysfunction."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. He presented with hypotension, altered mental status, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's current condition includes renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for dialysis.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient experienced lower gastrointestinal bleeding, which may continue or recur, potentially causing hypotension and anemia.
3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's liver function is impaired due to alcoholic cirrhosis. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and an increased risk of infections.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing confusion and disorientation. This can be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy and requires monitoring and treatment.
5. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic treatment are necessary.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis: The patient requires DVT prophylaxis due to immobility and risk factors.
7. Aspiration Risk: Due to altered mental status, the patient has an increased risk of aspiration. Nasogastric tube removal and proper feeding guidelines should be considered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to hepatitis C and alcohol use, who was admitted with acute blood loss from an ostomy site. The patient has also been diagnosed with gastritis and gastric ulcers. The patient's renal function has stabilized, and there are improvements in mental status. There is no evidence of bleeding anymore.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: Despite the patient's current stable condition, there is a risk of recurrent bleeding due to ESLD and gastritis with gastric ulcers. Close monitoring of vital signs and regular assessment of the ostomy site and gastrointestinal symptoms are necessary to prevent any potential bleeding episodes.

2. Infection: ESLD weakens the immune system, making patients more susceptible to infections. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in vital signs, is important to prevent and manage any potential infections.

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: ESLD can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by confusion, altered mental status, and coma. Regular monitoring of the patient's mental status and neurologic function is crucial to detect any signs of hepatic encephalopathy.

4. Liver Failure: ESLD is a progressive condition, and there is a risk of further deterioration in liver function. Regular assessment of liver function tests and close monitoring of the patient's overall condition are necessary to manage complications associated with liver"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with end-stage liver disease from hepatitis C and alcohol use, admitted with acute blood loss from the ostomy site, which has been stabilized. He also has gastritis and gastric ulcers. The patient's renal function has stabilized, and mental status has improved. There is no more evidence of bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatitis C: The patient has ESLD due to hepatitis C. This condition can lead to complications such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.
2. Alcohol use: The patient's ESLD is also attributed to alcohol use. Continued alcohol consumption can worsen liver disease and lead to additional complications.
3. Gastritis and gastric ulcers: The patient has gastritis and gastric ulcers, which can cause bleeding, abdominal pain, and potentially lead to complications such as perforation or infection.
4. Acute blood loss: The patient initially presented with acute blood loss from the ostomy site. Re-bleeding or ongoing blood loss could occur, resulting in hypotension, shock, and organ dysfunction.
5. Renal function: Although the patient's renal function has stabilized, there is still a risk of renal impairment due to liver disease, medication use, or other factors. Monitoring renal function and adjusting treatment accordingly is essential.
6. Mental status: While the patient's mental status has improved, encephalopathy may"

   Assessment and Plan
   51-year-old man with hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis presented with
   hypotension, altered mental status, GI bleed.
   # GI bleed: stopped currently.   Hct stable
   - daily Hct
   - IVF as needed
   - keep active type and screen
   - PPI IV bid
   - maintain adequate IV access; currently has R IJ [**Location (un) 342**] line
 plan to
   remove today  given no signs of active bleed
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: with elevated LFTs, bili. Discriminant function
   67. Very poor prognosis.
   - Bedside swallow eval, advance to clears, remove NG tube
   - Nutrition recs re: Hep diet
   - hepatology recs
   # Altered mental status: mild hepatic encephalopathy, improving.
   - continue lactulose, rifaximin
   # Acute kidney injury : improving, likely secondary to hypovolemia

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis. He presented with hypotension, altered mental status, and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently stable with controlled bleeding. His vital signs are within normal limits, although his respiratory rate is slightly elevated. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and a decreased platelet count. He has a history of acute kidney injury but is currently improving. The patient's mental status is described as alert but encephalopathic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has a history of acute kidney injury, which could progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the bleeding has been controlled, there is still a risk of re-bleeding or complications related to the initial bleed.
3. Liver failure: The patient's alcoholic cirrhosis and elevated liver enzymes indicate ongoing liver damage, which may lead to hepatic encephalopathy and other complications.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis suggests an infection, which needs to be monitored and treated appropriately.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to the patient's immobilization and risk factors, there is a potential for developing DVT.
6. Stress ulcers: The patient's ICU stay and critical illness increase the risk of developing stress ul"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C and alcohol use, who was admitted to the ICU for bleeding from an ostomy site, hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and hepatic encephalopathy. There has been improvement in renal function and mental status over the last few days, along with stable hematocrit levels. The patient is currently waiting for a bed on the floor and will continue to be monitored for signs of bleeding. Disposition planning is in progress, including the possibility of going home with hospice.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding from the ostomy site indicates a risk of further bleeding episodes. Close monitoring of vital signs, especially blood pressure and hemodynamic stability, is crucial to detect any signs of internal bleeding.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to liver dysfunction or ongoing blood loss. Monitoring blood pressure and providing appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support as needed are essential to maintain adequate perfusion.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF requires careful monitoring of renal function, electrolyte levels, and fluid balance. Ensuring adequate renal perfusion and avoiding nephrotoxic substances are important to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: This condition can cause altered mental status and neurological symptoms."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis. He presented with hypotension, altered mental status, and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient received transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 2 fresh frozen plasma (FFP) units, which stopped the GI bleed. His hematocrit (Hct) has been stable in the high 20s since then.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and bilirubin levels are still elevated, indicating ongoing liver abnormalities. The prognosis for alcoholic hepatitis/cirrhosis is very poor, and the patient and family have opted for home hospice with no escalation of care. Nutritional support will be continued, and hepatology recommendations will be followed up.

The patient's altered mental status has almost resolved, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose and rifaximin will be continued to manage this condition.

The patient experienced acute kidney injury (AKI), with creatinine (Cr) peaking at 6.7 and now improving to 4.5. This may be secondary to recent hypovolemia and possibly hepatorenal syndrome. Nephrology will be consulted, and IV fluid resuscitation will be provided as needed. Medications will be dosed based on renal function, and hemodialysis (HD) is not"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) from hepatitis C and alcohol use, admitted to the ICU for bleeding from an ostomy site, hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), and hepatic encephalopathy. There has been an improvement in renal function and mental status over the last several days, with a stable hematocrit (hct). The patient is waiting for a bed on the floor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient was admitted to the ICU due to bleeding from the ostomy site. It is crucial to continue monitoring for any signs of bleeding.
2. Hypotension: The patient presented with hypotension upon admission. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient initially had ARF, but there has been an improvement in renal function. It is essential to monitor kidney function and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has been experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by confusion and disorientation. Monitoring mental status and administering appropriate medications to manage this condition is essential.
5. Jaundice: The patient has jaundice, indicating ongoing liver dysfunction. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is necessary to assess the progression of ESLD.

The patient has shown improvement in renal function and mental status over the past few days, with stable hematocrit levels. He is currently waiting for a bed on the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding from the ostomy site: The patient initially came to the ICU due to bleeding from the ostomy site. Although the bleeding has been controlled, there is still a risk of further bleeding, especially considering the patient's underlying liver disease and use of anticoagulants.
2. Hypotension: The patient was admitted with hypotension, which could indicate poor perfusion and potentially lead to organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management are essential to prevent complications.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient presented with acute renal failure, which can have various causes such as hypotension, nephrotoxic drugs, or sepsis. It is crucial to assess and manage renal function closely to avoid further deterioration.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy, a condition characterized by cognitive impairment and altered mental status due to liver dysfunction. Proper management of this condition is important to prevent further neurological complications.
