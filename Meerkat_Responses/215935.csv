","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, cholecystitis, hip fracture (femoral neck fracture, femur), and bacteremia. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been started on Lasix for volume overload. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/89 mmHg to 150/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates fluid balance with a total intake of 462 mL and total output of 1325 mL. The patient is receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, metoprolol, and Lasix. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine level, normal blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function test results. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation with assist and autoflow modes, set tidal volume of 600 mL, set respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%, respiratory system compliance of 54.5 cmH2O"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 72 y/o M hx PAF, CAD s/p CABG, R hip
   replacement c/b joint enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolongues
   intubation transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for trach and peg
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial with volume overload
   and deconditioning. I have low suspicion for pulmonary infection at
   this point given lack of fever, leukocytosis, infiltrate on CXR.
   - consult IP re: trach and peg
   - f/u read CXR
   - diuresis (1L today) with 40 IV lasix
   - continue vent, currently on AC
   - routine vent care
   .
   # Septic joint/bacteremia:
   - repeat blood cx
   - antibiotic pak in place
   - consult ortho re: joint (and d/w family re: furture care of hip
   joint)
   .
   # Endocarditis
   - continue ampicillin/gentamycin duration likely 6 weeks
   - repeat echo in AM
   - renally dose gent
   - daily EKG given aortic valve involvement
   .
   # Elevated LFTs/alk phos: Per OSH, had dilated CBD and possible stones.
   On exam, he does not appear to have fever, abd tenderness or signs of
   cholangitis. I suspect perhaps choledocholithiasis or intrahepatic
   cholestasis from severe illness
   - f/u read RUQ U/S
   - trend LFTs and pending U/S will d/w ERCP
   .
   # PAF:
   - had been on coumadin, but held in anticipation of procedure
   - rate control with BB
   .
   # HTN:
   - continue BB
   .
   # CAD:
   - continue ASA, BB, statin, ? why not on ACEI
   .
   # DM: takes metformin at home
   - ISS for now as not sure from OSH records how much standing he was
   requiring
   .
   # Gout:
   - continue allopurinol
   .
   # Diabetes:
   - continue lantus and ISS

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and previous CABG surgery. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and prolonged intubation due to joint enterococcus infection and sepsis. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy, receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions for sedation. The patient has multiple comorbidities including congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, gout, and hyperlipidemia. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 140/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature of 35.5°C.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including volume overload, deconditioning, and body habitus. Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters and ensuring proper ventilation support is essential.
2. Sepsis: The patient's history of joint enterococcus infection and prolonged intubation increases the risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and response to antibiotic therapy is necessary.
3. Endocarditis: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may increase the risk of endocard"

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting, right hip replacement, and joint enterococcus infection, sepsis, and prolonged intubation. He was transferred to the hospital for percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement.

The patient underwent trach and G-tube placement on 01/15/2173. He is currently active for feeding and correcting free water deficit. An echocardiogram is concerning for pulmonary embolism, and a CT angiogram is pending. The patient is also on fentanyl patch and Klonopin with the goal to wean off midazolam and versed. Pressure support trial is planned today.

Allergies include Levaquin (oral), Ativan (oral), and adhesive tape (topical). The last doses of antibiotics were administered on 01/15/2173 at 08:41 PM.

Vital signs include temperature at 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 131/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has atrial fibrillation as his heart rhythm.

   This is a 72 y/o M hx PAF, CAD s/p CABG, R hip replacement c/b joint
   enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolonged intubation transferred to
   [**Hospital1 5**] for trach and peg placement by IP
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial with volume overload,
   systolic failure, and deconditioning, body habitus. Low suspicion for
   pulmonary infection at this point given lack of fever, leukocytosis,
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Trach placed yesterday by IP, currently tolerating PSV, consider
   trach mask trial today if more alert
   - diuresis (goal 2L negative) with 40 IV lasix, will repeat later today
   if decreased UOP
   - continue vent, currently on PSV
   - began fentanyl patch and Clonipine 0.5 mg TID yesterday, will attempt
   to transition off midazolam and versed, switch clonipine to ativan for
   agitation
   - routine vent care
   - TTE showed evidence of right heart strain, CTA did not show evidence
   of PE.
   .
   # Septic hip joint/bacteremia:
   - Continue ampicillin and gentamicin, gent level low yesterday, changed
   dosing, will check level tomorrow AM
   - repeat blood cx daily
   - antibiotic pak in place
   - Ortho on board
   .
   # Endocarditis
   - continue ampicillin/gentamycin duration likely 6 weeks
   - TTE was done yesterday, no vegetations seen, consider TEE to rule out
   persistent vegetations if worsens clinically
   - continue to renally dose gent
   - daily EKG given aortic valve involvement
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Large free water deficit of 3L
   - Attempt to correct with D5W and free water boluses once start tube
   feeds
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   # Elevated LFTs/alk phos:  Likely secondary to cholelithiasis, however
   no evidence of cholecystitis per RUQ US
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   # PAF:
   - had been on coumadin, but held in anticipation of procedure, INR now
   1.4, will ask IP when to restart coumadin
   - rate control with BB
   .
   # HTN:
   - continue BB
   .
   # CAD:
   - continue ASA, BB, statin,
   - unclear why not on [**Name (NI) 3930**], but renal insufficiency with Crn at 1.2,
   hold off on starting for now
   .
   # DM: takes metformin at home, holding here
   - Cover with ISS for hyperglycemia

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), right hip replacement complicated by joint enterococcus infection and sepsis. The patient was transferred to the ICU for percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is most likely experiencing multifactorial respiratory failure due to volume overload, systolic heart failure, and deconditioning. There is low suspicion for pulmonary infection at this point.

2. Septic hip joint/bacteremia: The patient has a history of joint enterococcus infection and sepsis. Antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) have been started, and blood cultures are being repeated daily. An orthopedic consult has been obtained.

3. Endocarditis: The patient has evidence of right heart strain on a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), which raises suspicion for endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is being considered to rule out persistent vegetations if the patient worsens clinically. Ampicillin and gentamicin will be continued for a duration of approximately 6 weeks.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has a large free water deficit of 3L. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72 y/o M hx PAF, CAD s/p CABG, R hip replacement c/b joint
   enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolongues intubation transferred to
   [**Hospital1 5**] for trach and peg
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial with volume overload
   and deconditioning, body habitus. Low suspicion for pulmonary infection
   at this point given lack of fever, leukocytosis, infiltrate on CXR.
   - trach and peg today via IP
   - diuresis (1L today) with 40 IV lasix
   - continue vent, currently on AC, will attempt PS trial this afternoon
   -begin fentanyl patch and Clonipine 0.5 mg TID after procedure to
   attempt to wean, may consider haldol as needed for agitation thereafter
   - routine vent care
   .
   # Septic joint/bacteremia:
   - repeat blood cx
   - antibiotic pak in place
   - consult ortho re: joint (and d/w family re: furture care of hip
   joint)-specifically inquire about timeline for anticoagulation
   .
   # Endocarditis
   - continue ampicillin/gentamycin duration likely 6 weeks
   - repeat echo in AM
   - renally dose gent
   - daily EKG given aortic valve involvement, follow up on EKG from today
   .
   # Elevated LFTs/alk phos: Per OSH, had dilated CBD and possible stones.
   On exam, he does not appear to have fever, abd tenderness or signs of
   cholangitis. I suspect perhaps choledocholithiasis or intrahepatic
   cholestasis from severe illness
   - f/u read RUQ U/S-read pending
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   # PAF:
   - had been on coumadin, but held in anticipation of procedure
   - rate control with BB
   .
   # HTN:
   - continue BB
   .
   # CAD:
   - continue ASA, BB, statin, ? why not on ACEI
   .
   # DM: takes metformin at home
   - ISS for now as not sure from OSH records how much standing he was
   requiring
   .
   # Gout:
   - continue allopurinol
   .
   # Diabetes:
   - continue lantus and ISS
   .
   #FEN-NPO, will attempt to correct free water deficit when able to
   tolerate PO

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), right hip replacement complicated by joint enterococcus infection and sepsis. He was transferred to the ICU for percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, septic joint/bacteremia, possible endocarditis, elevated liver function tests/alkaline phosphatase, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, gout, and cholecystitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary complications: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which carries risks such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Infection: Given the patient's previous joint infection and bacteremia, there is a risk of further infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections or hospital-acquired pneumonia.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, increasing his risk for cardiac events such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or heart failure.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has elevated liver function tests and a history of cholecystitis. There is a risk of further hepatic dysfunction or"

   due to delirium/sedation/critical illness
   Septic right hip:  s/p removal,  on amp/gent for enterococcal
   bacteremia
   RV dysfunction:  likely with chronic pulm HTN with obesity vs. distolic
   heart failure
   CAD:  on ASA, beta blocker.
   hypernatremia:  likely related to diuresis, replete free water

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous hospitalization for an artificial hip infection and respiratory failure. He underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion. The patient is currently on continuous sedation and has ongoing respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37°C (98.6°F)
- Heart rate: 105 bpm (normal range: 74-105 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 147/95 mmHg (systolic range: 92-163 mmHg, diastolic range: 47-104 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute (normal range: 0-19 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,080 mL and 1,042 mL since 12 AM, indicating ongoing fluid loss. His blood products and urine output are within normal limits.

The patient is receiving several medications including fentanyl patch, midazolam, ampicillin, gentamicin, lasix, pepcid, and others. He has allergies to levofloxacin, lorazepam, and adhesive tape.

The patient's recent laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72 y/o M hx PAF, CAD s/p CABG, R hip replacement c/b joint
   enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolonged intubation transferred to
   [**Hospital1 5**] for trach and peg placement by IP
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial with volume overload,
   systolic failure, and deconditioning, body habitus. Low suspicion for
   pulmonary infection at this point given lack of fever, leukocytosis,
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Trach placed by IP, consider trach mask trial today if more alert
   - diuresis (goal 2L negative) with 40 IV lasix, will repeat later today
   if decreased UOP
   - continue vent, currently on [**Last Name (LF) 4377**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] decrease PS to 8 from 10
   - began fentanyl patch and Clonipine 0.5 mg TID yesterday, will attempt
   to transition off midazolam and versed, switch clonipine to ativan for
   agitation, prn fentanyl for movement, will cut down fentanyl patch dose
   by [**12-18**] today
   - routine vent care
   - TTE showed evidence of right heart strain, CTA did not show evidence
   of PE.
   .
   # Hand pain-patient grimaces when manipulating right hand, per daughter
   patient
broke hand at OSH and was in cast
.  The patient was not
   transferred with cast on.
   -obtain hand X rays
   .place lidocaine patches for pain control
   .
   # Septic hip joint/bacteremia:
   - Continue ampicillin and gentamicin, gent level low yesterday, changed
   dosing, will check level tomorrow AM
   - repeat blood cx daily
   - antibiotic pak in place
   - Ortho on board-will eval possible hematoma today, rec. holding on
   imaging for now
   .
   # Endocarditis
   - continue ampicillin duration likely 6 weeks, stop gentamicin today as
   has completed 10 day course
   - TTE was done yesterday, no vegetations seen, consider TEE to rule out
   persistent vegetations if worsens clinically
   - daily EKG given aortic valve involvement
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Large free water deficit of 3L
   - Attempt to correct with 1 L D5W and free water boluses with tube
   feeds 250 mL Q 4 hours
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   # Elevated LFTs/alk phos:  Likely secondary to cholelithiasis, however
   no evidence of cholecystitis per RUQ US
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   # PAF:
   - had been on coumadin, but held in anticipation of procedure, INR now
   1.4, restarted yesterday, continue dosing
   - rate control with BB
   .
   # HTN:
   - continue BB
   .
   # CAD:
   - continue ASA, BB, statin,
   - unclear why not on [**Name (NI) 3930**], but renal insufficiency with Crn at 1.2,
   hold off on starting for now
   .
   # DM: takes metformin at home, holding here
   - Cover with ISS for hyperglycemia

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and a recent right hip replacement. He was admitted to the ICU due to a joint enterococcus infection, sepsis, and prolonged intubation. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypernatremia, elevated liver function tests, and potential endocarditis. He also has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, gout, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including volume overload, systolic failure, and deconditioning. Low suspicion for pulmonary infection at this point.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a large free water deficit of 3L and requires correction with D5W and free water boluses.
3. Elevated Liver Function Tests: The elevated liver function tests are likely secondary to cholelithiasis, but there is no evidence of cholecystitis per RUQ US.
4. Potential Endocarditis: The patient may have endocarditis, and further evaluation with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is recommended to rule out persistent vegetations if the patient's clinical condition worsens.
5. Septic Hip Joint/Bacteremia: The patient has a septic hip joint and bacteremia, and the appropriate antibiotics have been initiated. Blood cultures should be repeated daily,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72 y/o M hx PAF, CAD s/p CABG, R hip replacement c/b joint
   enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolonged intubation transferred to
   [**Hospital1 5**] for trach and peg placement by IP
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial with volume overload,
   systolic failure, and deconditioning, body habitus. Low suspicion for
   pulmonary infection at this point given lack of fever, leukocytosis,
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Trach placed yesterday by IP, currently tolerating PSV, consider
   trach mask trial today if more alert
   - diuresis (goal 2L negative) with 40 IV lasix, will repeat later today
   if decreased UOP
   - continue vent, currently on PSV
   - began fentanyl patch and Clonipine 0.5 mg TID yesterday, will attempt
   to transition off midazolam and versed, switch clonipine to ativan for
   agitation
   - routine vent care
   - TTE showed evidence of right heart strain, CTA did not show evidence
   of PE.
   .
   # Septic hip joint/bacteremia:
   - Continue ampicillin and gentamicin, gent level low yesterday, changed
   dosing, will check level tomorrow AM
   - repeat blood cx daily
   - antibiotic pak in place
   - Ortho on board
   .
   # Endocarditis
   - continue ampicillin/gentamycin duration likely 6 weeks
   - TTE was done yesterday, no vegetations seen, consider TEE to rule out
   persistent vegetations if worsens clinically
   - continue to renally dose gent
   - daily EKG given aortic valve involvement
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Large free water deficit of 3L
   - Attempt to correct with D5W and free water boluses once start tube
   feeds
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   # Elevated LFTs/alk phos:  Likely secondary to cholelithiasis, however
   no evidence of cholecystitis per RUQ US
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   # PAF:
   - had been on coumadin, but held in anticipation of procedure, INR now
   1.4, will ask IP when to restart coumadin
   - rate control with BB
   .
   # HTN:
   - continue BB
   .
   # CAD:
   - continue ASA, BB, statin,
   - unclear why not on [**Name (NI) 3930**], but renal insufficiency with Crn at 1.2,
   hold off on starting for now
   .
   # DM: takes metformin at home, holding here
   - Cover with ISS for hyperglycemia
   .
   # Gout:
   - continue allopurinol
   .
   #FEN- Will start tube feeds with free water flushes at 3pm today,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions including hypernatremia, cholecystitis, respiratory failure, hip fracture, and bacteremia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 141/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 30%. The patient's blood cultures have grown rare enterococcus from tissue and wound cultures but not from blood cultures. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's renal function is impaired with an elevated creatinine level. The patient's glucose levels have been within normal range. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's chronic respiratory failure increases the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The use of mechanical ventilation and prolonged intubation can also lead to lung injury.
2. Infection: The presence of bacteremia and rare enterococcus in tissue and wound cultures indicates an ongoing infection. There is a risk of developing further"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of hip infection, sepsis, and respiratory failure. He has been weaned off continuous sedation and is now following simple commands. The patient has several medical conditions including atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, and gout. He is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic measures. The patient's vital signs show elevated blood pressure and heart rate, with a respiratory rate within normal limits. His oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,329 mL and total output of 4,645 mL, indicating a positive balance of 2,316 mL. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is inadequate ventilation or oxygenation.
2. Fluid overload: The positive fluid balance suggests the possibility of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema or heart failure.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, indicating a risk for dehydration or imbalances in electrolyte levels.
4. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating consciousness and occasional following of commands suggest delirium. If not addressed, this can lead to further confusion and potential complications.
5. Enterococcal bacteremia: The patient has enterococcal bacteremia, and improper management may result in the spread of infection or development"

   enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolonged intubation transferred to
   [**Hospital1 5**] for trach and peg placement by IP
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial with volume overload,
   systolic failure, and deconditioning, body habitus. Low suspicion for
   pulmonary infection at this point given lack of fever, leukocytosis,
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Trach placed by IP, consider trach mask trial today if more alert
   - diuresis (goal 2L negative) with 40 IV lasix, will repeat later today
   if decreased UOP
   - continue vent, currently on [**Last Name (LF) 4377**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] decrease PS to 8 from 10
   - began fentanyl patch and Clonipine 0.5 mg TID yesterday, will attempt
   to transition off midazolam and versed, switch clonipine to ativan for
   agitation, prn fentanyl for movement, will cut down fentanyl patch dose
   by [**12-18**] today
   - routine vent care
   - TTE showed evidence of right heart strain, CTA did not show evidence
   of PE.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), right hip replacement complicated by joint enterococcus infection, sepsis, and prolonged intubation. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, which is most likely multifactorial with volume overload, systolic failure, and deconditioning. 

The patient has several medical complications, including a broken hand with evidence of destruction of the distal and middle phalanx, hypernatremia (high sodium levels), elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and a history of cholecystitis without evidence of cholecystitis on right upper quadrant ultrasound. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is currently on warfarin, but the INR is subtherapeutic at 1.4. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 164/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator, and temperature of 37.3°C. The patient's blood glucose levels have been ranging from 81 to 169 mg/dL, and their white blood cell count has been fluctuating between 4.2 and 8.0 thousand cells per microliter.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), right hip replacement, joint enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolonged intubation, and broken hand. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to volume overload, systolic failure, and deconditioning. The patient underwent tracheostomy placement and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode.

The patient's medical conditions include septic right hip joint/bacteremia, endocarditis, hypertension, sinus tachycardia, hypernatremia, elevated liver function tests (LFTs)/alkaline phosphatase, peripheral arterial disease (PAF), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and gout. The patient's current medications include ampicillin, fentanyl patch, heparin sodium, famotidine, lorazepam, and various other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including volume overload, systolic failure, and deconditioning. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjustment of ventilatory support as needed is essential.

2. Septic Right Hip Joint/Bacteremia: The patient has a septic right hip joint and bacteremia. He is being treated with a 6-week"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72 y/o M hx PAF, CAD s/p CABG, R hip replacement c/b joint
   enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolonged intubation transferred to
   [**Hospital1 5**] for trach and peg placement by IP
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial with volume overload,
   systolic failure, and deconditioning, body habitus. Low suspicion for
   pulmonary infection at this point given lack of fever, leukocytosis,
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Trach placed by IP, trach mask trial tried but failed, still on PS
   [**4-20**] (down from PEEP of 8) earlier.
   - tried to hold sedation as much as possible, currently on low dose
   fentanyl patch after being on heavy sedation for week + at OSH, likely
   cause of AMS
   - TTE showed evidence of right heart strain, CTA did not show evidence
   of PE.
   .
   # Hand pain-patient grimaces when manipulating right hand, per daughter
   patient
broke hand at OSH and was in cast
.  The patient was not
   transferred with cast on.
   -xrays positive for distal and middle phalanx fracture
   - plastics consulted, in splint now, will follow up as outpatient, not
   a surgical fix
   .place lidocaine patches for pain control
   .
   # Septic R hip joint/bacteremia:
   - on ampicillin (will need 6 week course of endocarditis), gent stopped
   yesterday as he completed 10 d course
   - antibiotic pak in place
   - repeat blood cx daily
   - Ortho on board-think he likely has hematoma still in his thigh, but
   is improving, have signed off, will need new hip replacement in the
   future when more clinically stable.  For now, started PT without
   passive range of motion of R hip
   .
   # Endocarditis
   - continue ampicillin duration likely 6 weeks, stop gentamicin today as
   has completed 10 day course
   - TTE was done yesterday, no vegetations seen, consider TEE to rule out
   persistent vegetations if worsens clinically
   - daily EKG given aortic valve involvement
   .
   # Hypertension / sinus tachycardia
 both up today, grimacing more,
   likely secondary to pain
   -          started methadone, was on 20 mg tid dose at OSH, can add
   PRNs as needed
   -          consider increasing fentanyl patch dose if needed.
   -          Continuing BB at same dose
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  resolved
   - Corrected with D5W boluses, now just continuing tube feeds with 150
   mL free water flushes Q 4 hours
   .
   # Elevated LFTs/alk phos:  Likely secondary to cholelithiasis, however
   no evidence of cholecystitis per RUQ US
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   # PAF:
   - had been on coumadin, but held in anticipation of procedure, INR now
   1.6, restarted [**1-17**], continue dosing
   - rate control with BB
   ..
   # CAD:
   - continue ASA, BB, statin,
   - unclear why not on [**Name (NI) 3930**], but renal insufficiency with Crn at 1.2,
   hold off on starting for now
   .
   # DM: takes metformin at home, holding here
   - Cover with ISS for hyperglycemia
   .
   # Gout:
   - continue allopurinol
   .

   Addendum to Plan Section:
   # Fluid overload
 likely from fluid resuscitation after surgeries and
   during infection treatment at OSH.  Has been responding moderately to
   IV lasix pushes.
   - Starting lasix gtt today, titrating with goal of 1-2L negative
   pending BP toleration
   - Has new decreased EF per recent echo, likely due to acute stress on
   heart.  Will plan on repeat echo in approximately a week, checking
   TSH/T4 tomorrow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU for multiple medical conditions. The patient has a broken hand with a fracture of the distal and middle phalanx, as well as a hematoma on the right medial thigh. They also have hypernatremia, which has been improved with D5W and free water boluses. The patient is on various medications including fentanyl, Coumadin (warfarin), heparin sodium, famotidine, and lorazepam.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (101 bpm) and blood pressure (164/99 mmHg). Their respiratory rate is within normal range (27 breaths per minute), and their oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient has been diagnosed with supra ventricular tachycardia (SVT).

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 4,187 mL of fluids, with 1,968 mL given through IV fluids. The total output includes 5,165 mL of urine and 5 mL of NG drainage.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, the note mentions several significant events that have occurred over the past few days.

Firstly, the patient failed a trial off mechanical ventilation (TM, RR 36-40, RSBI 130s) and was placed back on ventilatory support. If the patient does not show improvement within 12-18 weeks, further investigations such as EEG, LP, CT, and MRI may be necessary.

Secondly, the patient was started on methadone and fentanyl was planned to be discontinued once the patient was stable. This indicates that the patient may have opioid dependency or chronic pain management issues.

Thirdly, the patient had negative response to lasix given through a gastrointestinal tube (neg 1L on lasix gtt). This suggests that the patient may have renal insufficiency or resistance to diuretics.

Fourthly, blood culture from the patient's peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line showed gram-positive rods. The healthcare team attempted to establish peripheral intravenous (PIV) access and remove the PICC line due to infection, but the IV team failed to do so.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72 y/o M hx PAF, CAD s/p CABG, R hip replacement c/b joint
   enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolonged intubation transferred to
   [**Hospital1 5**] for trach and peg placement by IP
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial with volume overload,
   systolic failure, and deconditioning, body habitus. Low suspicion for
   pulmonary infection at this point given lack of fever, leukocytosis,
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Trach placed by IP, trach mask trial tried but failed, still on PS
   [**4-20**] (down from PEEP of 8) earlier.
   - tried to hold sedation as much as possible, currently on low dose
   fentanyl patch after being on heavy sedation for week + at OSH, likely
   cause of AMS
   - TTE showed evidence of right heart strain, CTA did not show evidence
   of PE.
   .
   # Hand pain-patient grimaces when manipulating right hand, per daughter
   patient
broke hand at OSH and was in cast
.  The patient was not
   transferred with cast on.
   -xrays positive for distal and middle phalanx fracture
   - plastics consulted, in splint now, will follow up as outpatient, not
   a surgical fix
   .place lidocaine patches for pain control
   .
   # Septic R hip joint/bacteremia:
   - on ampicillin (will need 6 week course of endocarditis), gent stopped

   is improving, have signed off, will need new hip replacement in the
   future when more clinically stable.  For now, started PT without
   passive range of motion of R hip
   .
   # Endocarditis
   - continue ampicillin duration likely 6 weeks, stop gentamicin today as
   has completed 10 day course

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of PAF, CAD, and joint enterococcus infection. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, sepsis, and prolonged intubation. The patient has undergone several procedures including tracheostomy, peg placement, and right hip replacement. He has been diagnosed with hand pain due to a fractured hand, septic right hip joint/bacteremia, and possible endocarditis. The patient is also experiencing hypertension and sinus tachycardia, hypernatremia, elevated liver function tests/alkaline phosphatase, and atrial fibrillation. He has a history of diabetes mellitus, gout, and renal insufficiency. The patient is currently receiving various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, beta-blockers, statins, and pain management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and includes volume overload, systolic failure, and deconditioning. Low suspicion for pulmonary infection at this point.
2. Septic right hip joint/bacteremia: The patient has a suspected septic right hip joint and bacteremia. He is being treated with ampicillin for a duration of 6 weeks, and gentamicin has been stopped as it completed a 10-day course.
3. Endocarditis: The patient may have endocarditis, and further investigation is needed"

   systolic failure, and deconditioning, body habitus. Low suspicion for
   pulmonary infection at this point given lack of fever, leukocytosis,
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Trach placed by IP, trach mask trial tried yesterday, will try again
   today, still on PS 5/5 (down from PEEP of 8) earlier

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of peripheral artery disease (PAF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), right hip replacement, joint enterococcus infection, sepsis, and prolonged intubation. He was transferred to the hospital for tracheostomy and peg placement. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, endocarditis, gout, volume overload, right wrist fracture, septic right hip joint/bacteremia, hypertension/sinus tachycardia, hypernatremia, elevated liver function tests/alkaline phosphatase, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to a combination of factors such as volume overload, systolic failure, and deconditioning. Low suspicion for pulmonary infection at this point.

2. Endocarditis: The patient has signs and symptoms suggestive of endocarditis, including a history of joint infection and positive blood cultures. Treatment includes a prolonged course of antibiotics and consideration for transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out persistent vegetations.

3. Gout: The patient has gout, which is evident on his left wrist. Treatment includes colchicine and allopurinol, and he has been started on prednisone 20mg PO daily"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, which is being exacerbated by their current condition. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Infection/Bacteremia: The presence of blood culture results indicating gram-positive rods suggests a potential bloodstream infection. This increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia. This condition can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to various factors such as medication side effects, infection, or other underlying causes.

5. Hip Fracture: The patient has a femoral neck fracture, which is a serious injury that can lead to complications such as non-union, avascular necrosis, or post-operative infections.

6. Cholecystitis: The patient has a history of calculous cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder due to gallstones. This condition can cause abdominal pain and potential complications like gallbladder rupture.

7. Acute Pain: The patient is experiencing acute pain, likely due to the hip fracture and other factors. Proper pain management is essential to prevent further complications.

8. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72 y/o M hx PAF, CAD s/p CABG, R hip replacement c/b joint
   enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolonged intubation transferred to
   [**Hospital1 5**] for trach and peg placement by IP
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial with volume overload,
   systolic failure, and deconditioning, body habitus. Low suspicion for
   pulmonary infection at this point given lack of fever, leukocytosis,
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Trach placed by IP, trach mask trial tried but failed, still on PS
   [**4-20**] (down from PEEP of 8) earlier.
   - tried to hold sedation as much as possible, currently on low dose
   fentanyl patch after being on heavy sedation for week + at OSH, likely
   cause of AMS
   - TTE showed evidence of right heart strain, CTA did not show evidence
   of PE.
   .
   # Hand pain-patient grimaces when manipulating right hand, per daughter
   patient
broke hand at OSH and was in cast
.  The patient was not
   transferred with cast on.
   -xrays positive for distal and middle phalanx fracture
   - plastics consulted, in splint now, will follow up as outpatient, not
   a surgical fix
   .place lidocaine patches for pain control
   .
   # Septic R hip joint/bacteremia:
   - on ampicillin (will need 6 week course of endocarditis), gent stopped
   yesterday as he completed 10 d course
   - antibiotic pak in place
   - repeat blood cx daily
   - Ortho on board-think he likely has hematoma still in his thigh, but
   is improving, have signed off, will need new hip replacement in the
   future when more clinically stable.  For now, started PT without
   passive range of motion of R hip
   .
   # Endocarditis
   - continue ampicillin duration likely 6 weeks, stop gentamicin today as
   has completed 10 day course
   - TTE was done yesterday, no vegetations seen, consider TEE to rule out
   persistent vegetations if worsens clinically
   - daily EKG given aortic valve involvement
   .
   # Hypertension / sinus tachycardia
 both up today, grimacing more,
   likely secondary to pain
   -          started methadone, was on 20 mg tid dose at OSH, can add
   PRNs as needed
   -          consider increasing fentanyl patch dose if needed.
   -          Continuing BB at same dose
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  resolved
   - Corrected with D5W boluses, now just continuing tube feeds with 150
   mL free water flushes Q 4 hours
   .
   # Elevated LFTs/alk phos:  Likely secondary to cholelithiasis, however
   no evidence of cholecystitis per RUQ US
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   # PAF:
   - had been on coumadin, but held in anticipation of procedure, INR now
   1.6, restarted [**1-17**], continue dosing
   - rate control with BB
   ..
   # CAD:
   - continue ASA, BB, statin,
   - unclear why not on [**Name (NI) 3930**], but renal insufficiency with Crn at 1.2,
   hold off on starting for now
   .
   # DM: takes metformin at home, holding here
   - Cover with ISS for hyperglycemia

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of peripheral artery disease (PAF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), right hip replacement, joint enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolonged intubation, and transfer to another hospital for tracheostomy and peg placement.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient most likely has multifactorial respiratory failure due to volume overload, systolic failure, and deconditioning. There is low suspicion for pulmonary infection at this point given the lack of fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient is on positive pressure ventilation (PPV) and has a tracheostomy tube in place.

2. Hand pain: The patient grimaces when manipulating his right hand, and x-rays show fractures of the distal and middle phalanges. Plastic surgery was consulted, and the patient is now in a splint. Surgical fixation is not planned at this time, and lidocaine patches are being used for pain control.

3. Septic right hip joint/bacteremia: The patient has a septic right hip joint and bacteremia. He is on ampicillin for a 6-week course and gentamicin was stopped yesterday after completing a 10-day course. Antibiotic packs are in place, and blood cultures are being repeated daily. Orthoped"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72 y/o M hx PAF, CAD s/p CABG, R hip replacement c/b joint
   enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolonged intubation transferred to
   [**Hospital1 5**] for trach and peg placement by IP
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial with volume overload,
   systolic failure, and deconditioning, body habitus. Low suspicion for
   pulmonary infection at this point given lack of fever, leukocytosis,
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Trach placed by IP, tolerated trach mask for the majority of the day
   yesterday, will keep on trach mask
   - hold sedation as much as possible, off fentanyl, on methadone 10mg
   TID
   - TTE showed evidence of right heart strain, CTA did not show evidence
   of PE.
   .
   # Endocarditis
   - continue ampicillin duration 6 weeks
   - no vegetations on TTE, would consider TEE if condition worsens
   .
   # Gout
 notable on L wrist
   - on colchicine, allopurinol, prednisone 20mg PO daily
   .
   # Volume overloaded
   - convert to Lasix PO QID
   .
   # R wrist fx- .
   - xrays positive for distal and middle phalanx fracture
   -plastics consulted, in splint now, will follow up as outpatient
   - place lidocaine patches for pain control
   .
   # Septic R hip joint/bacteremia:
   - on ampicillin (will need 6 week course of endocarditis
   - antibiotic pak in place
   - repeat blood cx daily
   - Ortho has signed off will follow-up as outpatient, will need new hip
   replacement in the future when more clinically stable.  For now,
   started PT without passive range of motion of R hip
   .
   # Hypertension / sinus tachycardia
 both up today, grimacing more,
   likely secondary to pain
   - started methadone, 10mg TID PO
   - Continuing BB at same dose
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  resolved
   - Continuing tube feeds with 150 mL free water flushes Q8 hours
   .
   # Elevated LFTs/alk phos:  Likely secondary to cholelithiasis, however
   no evidence of cholecystitis per RUQ US
   - LFTs improving
   .
   # PAF:
   - had been on coumadin, but held in anticipation of procedure, INR now
   1.6, restarted [**1-17**], continue dosing
   - rate control with BB
   ..
   # CAD:
   - continue ASA, BB, statin,
   - unclear why not on [**Name (NI) 3930**], held off on starting given [**Doctor First Name **]
   .
   # DM: takes metformin at home, holding here
   - Cover with ISS for hyperglycemia
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72 y/o M hx PAF, CAD s/p CABG, R hip replacement c/b joint
   enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolonged intubation transferred to
   [**Hospital1 5**] for trach and peg placement by IP
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial with volume overload,
   systolic failure, and deconditioning, body habitus. Low suspicion for
   pulmonary infection at this point given lack of fever, leukocytosis,
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Trach placed by IP, trach mask trial tried yesterday, will try again
   today, still on PS 5/5 (down from PEEP of 8) earlier
   - tried to hold sedation as much as possible, off fentanyl
   - TTE showed evidence of right heart strain, CTA did not show evidence
   of PE.
   .
   # Endocarditis
   - continue ampicillin duration likely 6 weeks, stop gentamicin today as
   has completed 10 day course
   - TTE was done yesterday, no vegetations seen, consider TEE to rule out
   persistent vegetations if worsens clinically
   - daily EKG given aortic valve involvement
   .
   # Gout
 notable on L wrist
   - on colchicine and allopurinol
   - started on prednisone 20mg PO daily
   .
   # Volume overloaded
   - con
t Lasix drip ( will discuss on rounds tomorrow changing to bolus)
   .
   # R wrist fx- .
   -xrays positive for distal and middle phalanx fracture
   - plastics consulted, in splint now, will follow up as outpatient, not
   a surgical fix
   .place lidocaine patches for pain control
   .
   # Septic R hip joint/bacteremia:
   - on ampicillin (will need 6 week course of endocarditis), gent stopped
   yesterday as he completed 10 d course
   - antibiotic pak in place
   - repeat blood cx daily
   - Ortho on board-think he likely has hematoma still in his thigh, but
   is improving, have signed off, will need new hip replacement in the
   future when more clinically stable.  For now, started PT without
   passive range of motion of R hip
   .
   # Hypertension / sinus tachycardia
 both up today, grimacing more,
   likely secondary to pain
   -          started methadone, 10mg TID PO
   -          Continuing BB at same dose
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  resolved
   - Corrected with D5W boluses, now just continuing tube feeds with 150
   mL free water flushes Q 4 hours
   .
   # Elevated LFTs/alk phos:  Likely secondary to cholelithiasis, however
   no evidence of cholecystitis per RUQ US
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   # PAF:
   - had been on coumadin, but held in anticipation of procedure, INR now
   1.6, restarted [**1-17**], continue dosing
   - rate control with BB
   ..
   # CAD:
   - continue ASA, BB, statin,
   - unclear why not on [**Name (NI) 3930**], but renal insufficiency with Crn at 1.2,
   hold off on starting for now
   .
   # DM: takes metformin at home, holding here
   - Cover with ISS for hyperglycemia
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and previous CABG surgery. He also had a right hip replacement but developed a joint enterococcus infection and sepsis. He underwent tracheostomy and peg placement.

2. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to volume overload, systolic heart failure, and deconditioning. The tracheostomy trial was successful, and he is still on PS 5/5.

3. The patient has a low suspicion of pulmonary infection, as there is no fever, leukocytosis, or infiltrate on CXR.

4. The patient has endocarditis and is being treated with ampicillin for six weeks. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed to rule out persistent vegetations if the patient's condition worsens.

5. The patient has gout, which is being managed with colchicine, allopurinol, and prednisone.

6. The patient is volume overloaded and is receiving a lasix drip. It is planned to discuss changing to bolus administration tomorrow.

7. The patient has a right wrist fracture and is in a splint. Plastic surgery consulted, and it is not a surgical fix.

8. The patient had septic right hip joint/bacter"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72 y/o M hx PAF, CAD s/p CABG, R hip replacement c/b joint
   enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolonged intubation transferred to
   [**Hospital1 5**] for trach and peg placement by IP
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial with volume overload,
   systolic failure, and deconditioning, body habitus. Low suspicion for
   pulmonary infection at this point given lack of fever, leukocytosis,
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Tolerated trach mask for the majority of the day yesterday, brief
   periods of apnea (not new)
   - hold sedation as much as possible, off fentanyl, on methadone 10mg
   TID
   - TTE showed evidence of right heart strain, CTA did not show evidence
   of PE.
   .
   # Endocarditis
   - continue ampicillin duration 6 weeks (started on [**12-29**])
   - no vegetations on TTE, would consider TEE if condition worsens
   .
   # Gout
 notable on L wrist
   - on colchicine, allopurinol, prednisone 20mg PO daily
   .
   # Volume overloaded
   - net neutral yesterday, increase to Lasix IV QID
   .
   # R wrist fx- .
   - xrays positive for distal and middle phalanx fracture
   -plastics consulted, in splint now, will follow up as outpatient
   - place lidocaine patches for pain control
   .
   # Septic R hip joint/bacteremia:
   - on ampicillin (will need 6 week course)
   - antibiotic pak in place
   - repeat blood cx daily
   - Ortho has signed off, will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3878**] as outpatient,
   will need new hip replacement in the future when more clinically
   stable.  For now, started PT without passive range of motion of R hip
   .
   # Hypertension / sinus tachycardia
 both up today, grimacing more,
   likely secondary to pain
   - started methadone, 10mg TID PO
   - Continuing BB at same dose
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  resolved
   - Continuing tube feeds with 150 mL free water flushes Q8 hours
   .
   # Elevated LFTs/alk phos:  Likely secondary to cholelithiasis, however
   no evidence of cholecystitis per RUQ US
   - LFTs improving
   .
   # PAF:
   - had been on coumadin, but held in anticipation of procedure, INR now
   2.5, increased dose to 7.5mg on [**1-20**]
   - rate control with BB

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and previous joint infection. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, likely multifactorial in nature, including volume overload, systolic failure, and deconditioning. The patient has been intubated and placed on a tracheostomy tube. He is also being treated for endocarditis, gout, volume overload, a fractured wrist, septic right hip joint, hypertension, hypernatremia, elevated liver enzymes, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and management.
2. Pulmonary infection: Although there is currently no evidence of pulmonary infection, it is important to monitor for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobility and risk factors, there is a potential for DVT. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent clot formation.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation, the risk of developing VAP is increased. Adequate lung hygiene and appropriate antibiotic coverage should be maintained.
5. Endocarditis: The patient is being treated for endocarditis, and regular follow-up with echocardiograms will be necessary to assess"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 72 y/o M hx PAF, CAD s/p CABG, R hip replacement c/b joint
   enterococcus infection, sepsis, prolonged intubation transferred to
   [**Hospital1 5**] for trach and peg placement by IP
   # Respiratory failure: Most likely multifactorial with volume overload,
   systolic failure, and deconditioning, body habitus. Low suspicion for
   pulmonary infection at this point given lack of fever, leukocytosis,
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Tolerated trach mask for the majority of the day yesterday, brief
   periods of apnea (not new)
   - hold sedation as much as possible, off fentanyl, on methadone 10mg
   TID
   - TTE showed evidence of right heart strain, CTA did not show evidence
   of PE.
   .
   # Endocarditis
   - continue ampicillin duration 6 weeks (started on [**12-29**])
   - no vegetations on TTE, would consider TEE if condition worsens
   .
   # Gout
 notable on L wrist
   - on colchicine, allopurinol, prednisone 20mg PO daily
   .
   # Volume overloaded
   - net neutral yesterday, continue Lasix PO QID
   .
   # R wrist fx- .
   - xrays positive for distal and middle phalanx fracture
   -plastics consulted, in splint now, will follow up as outpatient
   - place lidocaine patches for pain control
   .
   # Septic R hip joint/bacteremia:
   - on ampicillin (will need 6 week course)
   - antibiotic pak in place
   - repeat blood cx daily
   - Ortho has signed off, will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3878**] as outpatient,
   will need new hip replacement in the future when more clinically
   stable.  For now, started PT without passive range of motion of R hip
   .
   # Hypertension / sinus tachycardia
 both up today, grimacing more,
   likely secondary to pain
   - started methadone, 10mg TID PO
   - Continuing BB at same dose
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  resolved
   - Continuing tube feeds with 150 mL free water flushes Q8 hours
   .
   # Elevated LFTs/alk phos:  Likely secondary to cholelithiasis, however
   no evidence of cholecystitis per RUQ US
   - LFTs improving
   .
   # PAF:
   - had been on coumadin, but held in anticipation of procedure, INR now
   2.5, increased dose to 7.5mg on [**1-20**]
   - rate control with BB
   ..
   # CAD:
   - continue ASA, BB, statin,
   - unclear why not on [**Name (NI) 3930**] on admission, continue to hold given [**Doctor First Name **]
   .
   # DM: takes metformin at home, holding here
   - Cover with ISS for hyperglycemia
   .
   #FEN-Tube feeds with free water flushes

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and previous joint enterococcus infection. He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and right hip replacement. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, septic right hip joint/bacteremia, gout, volume overload, right wrist fracture, hypertension, sinus tachycardia, hypernatremia, elevated liver function tests, and previous peripheral arterial disease (PAF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, involving volume overload, systolic failure, and deconditioning. Low suspicion for pulmonary infection at this point.
2. Endocarditis: The patient has been on ampicillin for six weeks due to joint enterococcus infection. No vegetations on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), but considering TEE if condition worsens.
3. Gout: The patient has gout, which is being managed with colchicine, allopurinol, and prednisone.
4. Volume Overload: The patient is volume overloaded, and Lasix (furosemide) is being given to help with fluid balance.
5. Right Wrist Fracture: The patient has a right wrist fracture, which is being managed with splinting and will require follow-up as an outpatient.
6. Septic"
