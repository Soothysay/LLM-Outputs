","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis B cirrhosis who presented to the hospital after experiencing a seizure. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

The patient's medical history includes hypoglycemia, altered mental status, hypotension, pneumonia, cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and possible arrhythmia. He was given antibiotics in the ER for suspected meningitis but is currently on hold due to lack of fever and other signs of infection.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/54 mmHg to 124/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. His mixed venous oxygen saturation is 81%.

The patient has been on multiple medications including norepinephrine, antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime), lactulose, PPI, and others. He is also receiving IV fluids and has been given 1 unit of packed red blood cells.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure recurrence due to uncontrolled glucose levels.
2. Infection, especially since the patient was given antibiotics in the ER.
3. Possible aspiration pneumonia due to seizure.
4. Variceal bleeding related to cir"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis B cirrhosis who presented to the hospital after experiencing a seizure. The patient's initial blood glucose level during the seizure was low, but it subsequently rose to 200 mg/dL following administration of D50. Despite this, the patient had another seizure, leading to concerns about possible infection or other causes.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoglycemia and altered mental status, likely post-ictal. His blood pressure is also unstable, with episodes of hypotension that improved with fluid resuscitation. The patient's lactate levels are elevated, suggesting possible sepsis or dehydration. 

Additionally, the patient has been identified with pneumonia, likely aspiration-related given the seizure episode. There is no leukocytosis or fever present. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for both nosocomial pneumonia and potential meningitis.

The patient has a known history of cirrhosis with grade III varices and gastritis. He requires ongoing management with proton pump inhibitors and lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy. Thrombocytopenia is noted but is at baseline levels.

There are concerns about possible arrhythmias, including complete heart block, but this has not been confirmed. The patient's EKG showed some abnormalities, and cardiac enzymes will be monitored. 

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring for glycemic control, infection, and hemodynamic stability."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis B cirrhosis who presented to the ICU after experiencing a seizure. The patient's medical history includes diabetes, hypertension, and cirrhosis. The patient has been admitted multiple times for hyperglycemia while on insulin, indicating possible insulin resistance. The patient's current condition is complicated by hypoglycemia, altered mental status, hypotension, pneumonia, and potential complications related to cirrhosis such as varices and portal vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient had a seizure, which could be due to hypoglycemia. Neurology is following up on this.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood sugar levels may be a result of excessive insulin use or sepsis. Glucose levels should be closely monitored.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is somnolent but arousable with no signs of focal neurological deficits. Further evaluation by a neurologist is recommended.
4. Hypotension: The patient experienced low blood pressure, possibly due to dehydration or sepsis. Closely monitor CVP and central venous saturation.
5. Pneumonia: The patient may have aspiration pneumonia, especially considering the recent seizure episode. Antibiotics are being administered to cover both hospital-acquired and community-acquired pathogens.
6. Cirrhosis Complications: The patient has grade"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis B cirrhosis who presented to the ICU after experiencing a seizure. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoglycemia, likely due to his recent hospitalization and treatment with insulin. His altered mental status is attributed to the post-ictal state, and he received 4 mg of Ativan during transport. His vital signs have stabilized, and he is no longer dependent on pressors. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated lactate level, which improved with fluid resuscitation. There are no positive cultures, suggesting that the hypotension may be caused by dehydration rather than sepsis. The patient has been prescribed antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, likely due to aspiration during the seizure. He also has grade III varices on esophagogastroduodenoscopy, gastritis, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's cardiac status includes a possible arrhythmia, which was initially suspected to be complete heart block but is now considered unlikely. The patient's ST segment changes have been ruled out for myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's recent admission for hyperglycemia while on insulin therapy indicates a potential complication of hypoglycemia. Monitoring glucose levels is essential to prevent further seizures.
2. Infection: The patient has been prescribed antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished, anxious individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of anemia, diabetes mellitus type I, cirrhosis of the liver, and seizures. The patient was weaned off levophed and did well throughout the day. They were able to eat and did not require an anti-seizure medication. Blood glucose levels were around 200 during the day, with a reduced dose of NPH administered. No new culture data were available. An abdominal ultrasound showed no detectable portal flow, which is consistent with thrombotic occlusion or extremely low velocity flow. The patient also has cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly and varices, cholelithiasis, and allergies to adefovir. The patient received cefipime and vancomycin as antibiotics. They were on various ICU medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix). The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted below. Vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 112/65 to 126/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient had sinus rhythm, a central venous pressure of 13 mmHg, and fluid balance"

   -HSV PCR pending
   -neuro consult, appreciate recommendations
   # Hypoglycemia: recent admit for hyperglycemia while on 35 units of
   lantus, on 75:25 30 u [**Hospital1 **] now.  This may be the reason for hypoglycemia
   versus sepsis.  Treat possible infection and titrate down insulin to
   NPH 12 units [**Hospital1 **] and RISS.
   -Continue lower dose of NPH until tolerating diet
   -[**Last Name (un) 276**] as outpatient
   #  Altered Mental Status: likely post ictal and received 4 mg Ativan in
   the ambulance en route. MS improved this am.
   -control glucose to avoid further seizures

   -continue lactulose as ammonia 75
   -f/u cultures
   #  Hypotension: Lactate elevated, improved w/ fluids.   Able to wean
   pressors.  BP nadir was 80/42 in ER.  No positive cultures.
   -monitor CVP
   -possibly from dehydration versus sepsis
now BP improved
   -hold antihypertensives

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis B cirrhosis who presented to the hospital after experiencing a seizure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to various medical complications. The main findings and concerns include hypoglycemia, altered mental status, hypotension, pneumonia, cirrhosis, and possible arrhythmia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level was low, which can cause seizures and altered mental status. Monitoring glucose levels and adjusting insulin dosage are necessary to prevent further hypoglycemia.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is likely post-ictal due to the recent seizure. It is important to control glucose levels to avoid further seizures and consult with a neurologist for further evaluation and management.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced low blood pressure, possibly due to dehydration or sepsis. Monitoring CVP and providing appropriate fluid resuscitation are important to maintain adequate blood pressure.

4. Pneumonia: The patient likely has aspiration pneumonia in the setting of the seizure. Covering for nosocomial pneumonia with antibiotics such as vancomycin and cefepime is necessary. Follow-up CXR and culture data will guide further management.

5. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of Hepatitis B cirrhosis. Management includes daily PPI, lactulose for hep"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis B cirrhosis. He was admitted for a seizure, new ascites likely due to portal vein thrombosis, and other medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has been weaned off levophed and is tolerating oral intake. His blood glucose levels have been relatively stable throughout the day, and he has not required any additional insulin. Cultures have shown no growth, indicating no active infection.

Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure likely related to hypoglycemia. Neurology is following up on this issue.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's recent admission was for hyperglycemia while on lantus insulin. He is now experiencing hypoglycemia, which may be due to a combination of factors including his recent meal (60% carbohydrate) and sepsis. Treatment involves lowering the dose of NPH and RISS.
3. Hypotension: The patient had an episode of hypotension, which improved with fluid administration. It is likely related to ativan-induced hypotension. Pressors may be required in the short term.
4. Pneumonia: The patient likely has aspiration pneumonia secondary to seizure activity. No leukocytosis or fever is present. Antibiotics have been initiated, and they can be discontinued"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for hypoglycemic seizures due to an insulin medication error at home. The patient has increased ascites and portal vein thrombosis (PVT) based on the ultrasound. He is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 130/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. He is on mechanical ventilation. The patient has evidence of crackles in the right lower lung fields and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show low white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profile. The patient's blood glucose level is low at 99 mg/dL. Imaging reveals a retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray. The patient's medical team plans to perform a paracentesis to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and initiate treatment for varices.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and potential portosystemic shunting, hepatic encephalopathy may develop due to liver dysfunction.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing"
