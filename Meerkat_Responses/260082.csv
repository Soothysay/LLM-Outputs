   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for
   PNA, here with SOB and cholecystitis.
   .
   1.  SOB.  Patient present with SOB of unclear duration.  She is obese
   resulting in restriction and has significant left effusion on CXR.
   Patietn has history of two recent admissions for PNA, with worsened
   cough and rising WBC suggestive of PNA versus pulmonary abscess.  Per
   report, most recent echo reveals normal EF but not clear when this was
   performed.
   - Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl for PNA
   - consider CT chest if stable given limited value of CXR though cannot
   get contrast given renal failure
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - consider diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis
   - obtaine echo
   .
   2.   Pancreatitis.  Elevated lipase in setting of cholecystitis with
   gallstones noted in GB is suggestive of gallstone pancreatitis.  Not on
   any clear offending meds and denies recent alcohol use.
   - trend lipase
   - NPO
   .
   3. Transaminitis.  Elevated LFTs but baseline LFTs unknnown.  [**Name (NI) **] sono
   raises the possibility of cholecystitis versus gallstone.  LFTs may be
   elevated most likely due to passed stone.  Normal T. bili with mildly
   elevated alk phos.
   - surgery following
   - Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
   - morphine for pain though not currently complaining of pain
   - NPO
   - consider MRCP per surgery
   .
   4.  Rash.  Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patietn was not on
   any antibiotics when the rash developed 3 days ago.  She was afebrile
   at rehab.  Rash is not pruritic.  Rash looks like drug rash, but there
   is not a clear offending medication.
   - follow rash
   - trend CBC with diff
   .
   4.  Renal failure.  Cr was reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**] and has
   been steadily rising over the past month and lasix has been gradually
   tapered off.  Her rising Cr at rehab was likely secondary to
   over-diuresis but may have lead to ATN.  Also multiple recent
   antibiotic exposures may have lead to AIN.
   - urine lytes, eos
   - renally dose all meds (Vanco by level)
   - follow UOP
   - IVF challenges
   .
   5.  Lower extremity edema.  Patient with right greater than left LE
   edema that per patient is new over the past few days in the setting of
   stopping lasix.
   - LENIs to r/o DVT
   - echo to evaluate cardiac function
   - hold lasix for now
   .
   6. Pleural effusion.  Persistent left sided pleural effusion.
   - consider thoracentesis for improvement of SOB
   .
   7. Anemia.  Patient has history of iron deficiency aneima.
   - trend Hct

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, and a recent admission for pneumonia (PNA). She presents with shortness of breath (SOB) and cholecystitis. The patient has a history of two recent admissions for PNA, with worsened cough and rising white blood cell count suggestive of PNA or pulmonary abscess. An echocardiogram reveals normal ejection fraction but the timing is unclear.

The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. SOB: The patient's shortness of breath is of unclear duration. She is obese and has significant left-sided effusion on chest X-ray. There is a history of two recent admissions for PNA, with worsening cough and rising WBC count. The patient is on vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl for PNA, and a CT chest may be considered if the patient is stable. Diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis and an echo are also planned.

2. Pancreatitis: Elevated lipase in the setting of cholecystitis with gallstones suggests gallstone pancreatitis. The patient denies recent alcohol use, and NPO status is recommended. Trending lipase levels is advised.

3. Transaminitis: Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) with mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase may be due to a passed stone. The patient may require surgery following, along with van"

   # SOB
 Patient with h/o recurrent PNA, significant L pleural effusion
   on CXR.  Persistently elevated WBC despite abx therapy with various
   agents.  Per OSH records, last echocardiogram shows EF 60% in [**2124-12-25**].

   # pancreatitis
 Elevated lipase in setting of cholelithiasis and
   dilated CBD ~ 10 mm.  Most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis.
   Patient pain free at this time.
   - continue NPO
   - trend lipase
   - consider MRCP and/or HIDA scan to better evaluate biliary anatomy
   # transaminitis
 Mildly elevated LFTs consistent with cholelithiasis;
   no significant elevation in Tbili or alk phos.
   - f/u surgery recs
   - abx as above
   - morphine PRN for pain
   # rash
 Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patient was not on any
   antibiotics when rash was first noticed 3 days prior to presentation,
   but at that time limited to back only.  Rash is nonpruritic.  Probably
   drug allergic reaction given this history and peripheral eosinophilia.
   # ARF
 Cr reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**]; has been steadily rising
   over the past month, in response to which lasix was tapered off.   Her
   rising Cr likely secondary to overdiuresis but could be now complicated
   by ATN.  Other possibility, especially given probably drug allergic
   reaction, is AIN.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, and a recent admission for pneumonia (PNA). She presents with shortness of breath (SOB) and cholecystitis. The patient has a history of recurrent PNA and significant left pleural effusion on chest X-ray. Her white blood cell count remains elevated despite antibiotic therapy.

The patient is currently receiving vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest is being considered to assess the pleural effusion and rule out an abscess. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is also recommended due to the patient's history of an ejection fraction (EF) of 60% from a previous echocardiogram.

The patient's elevated lipase levels suggest pancreatitis, likely caused by gallstone pancreatitis given the presence of cholelithiasis and a dilated common bile duct (CBD) of approximately 10 mm. The patient is being kept NPO (nothing by mouth) and her lipase levels are being monitored. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and/or hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan may be considered to further evaluate the biliary anatomy.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are mildly elevated, which is consistent"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for pneumonia (PNA), and now presenting with shortness of breath (SOB) and cholecystitis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/57 mmHg to 135/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. 

The patient has a history of recurrent pneumonia and significant left pleural effusion on chest X-ray. Her white blood cell count is persistently elevated despite antibiotic therapy with various agents, including moxifloxacin. The patient's last echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 60% from [**2124-12-25**].

The patient is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), as well as albuterol and atrovent nebulizers. An ultrasound chest is planned to look for fluid, with consideration for diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and computed tomography (CT) chest may be considered if the patient stabilizes to better assess the pleural effusion and rule out abscess formation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, and a recent admission for pneumonia (PNA). She is currently in the ICU due to shortness of breath (SOB) and cholecystitis. The patient has a history of recurrent PNA and significant left pleural effusion on chest X-ray. Her white blood cell count remains elevated despite antibiotic therapy. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 60%, as shown in her last echocardiogram from [**2124-12-25**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SOB - The patient's new oxygen requirement and significant L pleural effusion on CXR indicate the possibility of a worsening respiratory condition. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

2. Elevated WBC - The persistently elevated white blood cell count despite antibiotic therapy suggests an ongoing infection or the presence of another underlying condition. Additional diagnostic tests may be necessary to identify the source of infection and guide treatment.

3. Pancreatitis - The patient has elevated lipase levels, which, along with the presence of cholelithiasis and dilated common bile duct (CBD), suggests gallstone pancreatitis. Follow-up and consultation with a pancreas/GI specialist are recommended for further evaluation and management.

4. Transaminitis - Mildly elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are consistent with cholelithiasis/"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism and obesity. She was recently admitted for pneumonia (PNA) and is now presenting with shortness of breath (SOB), cholecystitis, and pancreatitis. The patient has a history of recurrent PNA, significant atelectasis with an undrainable pleural effusion on the left, and elevated white blood cell count (WBC) despite antibiotic therapy. The patient also has a history of iron deficiency anemia and is currently experiencing lower extremity edema, rash, and acute kidney injury (ARF). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SOB: The patient's shortness of breath may be due to her recent admission for pneumonia, which can cause respiratory distress. The presence of atelectasis and undrainable pleural effusion further contributes to her respiratory issues.
2. Cholecystitis: The patient has cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. This condition requires medical attention and can lead to complications if left untreated.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for
   PNA, here with SOB and cholecystitis.
   .
   # SOB
 New O2 requirement. Patient with h/o recurrent PNA, significant
   atelectasis with undrainable pleural effusion on the left.
   Persistently elevated WBC despite abx therapy with various agents, the
   last being moxifloxacin and vanc/zosyn.  Per OSH records, last
   echocardiogram shows EF 60% in [**2124-12-25**].
   - vanc/cefepime/flagyl D2/8 for HAP ; consider d/c if negative cultures
   and further evidence of allergy
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - ultrasound chest, looking for fluid, consider diagnostic/therapeutic
   thoracentesis
   - TTE today
   - consider CT chest if stable to better assess pleural effusion, assess
   for abscess.  Contrast study not possible given ARF.
   # pancreatitis
 Elevated lipase in setting of cholelithiasis and
   dilated CBD ~ 10 mm.  Most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis.
   CT shows diffuse calcifications.  Patient pain free at this time. Has
   follow up scheduled in [**Month (only) 349**].
   - continue NPO
   - trend lipase
   - Consult Pancreas/GI for input
 help with plan.
   # transaminitis
 Mildly elevated LFTs consistent with
   cholelithiasis/cholecystitis;  normal Tbili and borderline alk phos,
   ruling out significant infiltrative disease/congestive hepatopathy or
   obstruction
   - f/u surgery recs, GI consult
   - abx as above
   - morphine PRN for pain
   # ARF
 Cr reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**]; has trended from 2.8 to 3.0
   has been steadily rising over the past month, in response to which
   lasix was tapered off.   Her rising Cr likely secondary to overdiuresis
   but could be now complicated by ATN.  Other possibility, especially
   given probably drug allergic reaction, is AIN. No urine Eos. She is
   total body fluid overloaded
   - urine electrolytes pending
   - 24 hour urine
  Pending for protein
   - consider consulting Renal re: Proteinuria
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   # rash
 Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patient w as not on any
   antibiotics when rash was first noticed 3 days prior to presentation,
   but at that time limited to back only.  Rash is nonpruritic. Daughter
   says patient was on vanc/zosyn.  Probably drug allergic reaction given
   this history and peripheral eosinophilia.
   -serial exams
   # LE edema
 Patient with 3+ L>R LE edema that per patient is a
   relatively new development since stopping lasix.
   - LENIs to r/o DVT
   - TTE to evaluate cardiac function
   - holding lasix in setting of ARF

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism and obesity, admitted for pneumonia (PNA) and now presenting with shortness of breath (SOB), cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and other medical complications. The patient has a history of recurrent PNA and significant atelectasis with undrainable pleural effusion on the left. Despite antibiotic therapy, the patient's white blood cell count remains elevated. The patient also has a history of iron deficiency anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. SOB: The patient's shortness of breath may be attributed to recurrent PNA, significant atelectasis, and undrainable pleural effusion on the left. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.

2. Cholecystitis: The patient has evidence of cholecystitis, likely secondary to gallstones. Treatment options include pain management and potential surgical intervention.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated lipase levels suggest acute pancreatitis, possibly due to gallstone pancreatitis given the presence of cholelithiasis and dilated common bile duct. Follow-up with pancreas/GI consultation is recommended.

4. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate potential acute renal failure. Possible causes include overdiuresis and acute tubular necrosis. Renal consultation is advised, along with monitoring urine output and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old obese individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical issues. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. However, several significant findings and assessments have been made.

The patient underwent ERCP but the procedure was put on hold due to the need for CT imaging. The CT abdomen revealed large left pleural effusion, small right pleural effusion, atelectasis, diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with hypodensities scattered within it (most marked at the pancreatic head) and calcifications in the tail, which are consistent with pancreatitis. There are also possible fluid collections, small ascites in the abdomen, more moderate in the pelvis, fluid collection in the gastro-hepatic ligament, and a 3cm collection in the upper quadrant. These findings suggest possible subcapsular vs pseudo-cyst formation. Additionally, there is thickening of the cecum and the presence of gallstones.

The ultrasound read showed a densely shadowing anterior gallbladder wall, most likely large gallstone. There is a positive son sign, which is concerning for acute cholecystitis. Additional considerations include porcelain gallbladder and emphysematous cholecystitis. The common bile duct is dilated (10 mm). Four quadrant ascites was also observed.

Surgery has been signed off, and the patient's urine electrolytes showed a pre-renal picture, negative eosinoph"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for
   PNA, here with SOB and cholecystitis.
   .
   # SOB
 New O2 requirement. Patient with h/o recurrent PNA, significant
   atelectasis with undrainable pleural effusion on the left.
   Persistently elevated WBC despite abx therapy with various agents, the
   last being moxifloxacin and vanc/zosyn.  Per OSH records, last
   echocardiogram shows EF 60% in [**2124-12-25**].
   - vanc/cefepime/flagyl D2/8 for HAP ; consider d/c if negative cultures
   and further evidence of allergy
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - ultrasound chest, looking for fluid
   - TTE today
   - IP consult today for diagnostic thoracentesis
   # pancreatitis
 Elevated lipase in setting of cholelithiasis and
   dilated CBD ~ 10 mm.  Most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis.
   CT shows diffuse calcifications.  Patient pain free at this time. Has
   follow up scheduled in [**Month (only) 349**].
   - continue NPO
   - trend lipase
   - Consult Pancreas/GI for input
 help with plan.
   # transaminitis
 Mildly elevated LFTs consistent with
   cholelithiasis/cholecystitis;  normal Tbili and borderline alk phos,
   ruling out significant infiltrative disease/congestive hepatopathy or
   obstruction
   - f/u surgery recs, GI consult
   - abx as above
   - morphine PRN for pain
   # ARF
 Cr reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**]; has trended from 2.8 to 3.0
   has been steadily rising over the past month, in response to which
   lasix was tapered off.   Her rising Cr likely secondary to overdiuresis
   but could be now complicated by ATN.  Other possibility, especially
   given probably drug allergic reaction, is AIN. No urine Eos. She is
   total body fluid overloaded
   - urine electrolytes pending
   - 24 hour urine
  Pending for protein
   - Renal consult today re: proteinuria, rising Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   # rash
 Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patient w as not on any
   antibiotics when rash was first noticed 3 days prior to presentation,
   but at that time limited to back only.  Rash is nonpruritic. Daughter
   says patient was on vanc/zosyn.  Probably drug allergic reaction given
   this history and peripheral eosinophilia.
   -serial exams
   # LE edema
 Patient with 3+ L>R LE edema that per patient is a
   relatively new development since stopping lasix.
   - LENIs to r/o DVT
   - TTE to evaluate cardiac function
   - holding lasix in setting of ARF
   -  f/up recs from Renal regarding possible proteinuria contributing to
   edema
   -  will resume diet (ADAT) due to possible nutritional deficiencies/low
   albumin contributing to edema

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, and a history of recurrent pneumonia (PNA). She presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and cholecystitis. The patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia and has been admitted for pancreatitis. She also has elevated lipase levels, dilated common bile duct (CBD), and gallstones, indicating gallstone pancreatitis. The patient's renal function has been steadily declining over the past month, with a current creatinine level of 3.0 mg/dL. She has been experiencing a rash, possibly due to a drug allergic reaction. The patient also has lower extremity edema and is suspected to have fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complication: The patient's history of recurrent pneumonia and the presence of atelectasis with an undrainable pleural effusion on the left indicate a potential respiratory complication.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase levels, dilated CBD, and gallstones, which suggest gallstone pancreatitis. This condition can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels from 2.8 to 3.0 mg/dL indicate acute kidney injury (AKI). The cause could be overdiuresis or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
4. Allergic Reaction: The patient's rash and peripheral eosinophilia suggest a drug allergic reaction. It is important to review the patient's medication history to identify potential allergens.
5. Lower Extremity Edema: The patient's significant edema in both lower extremities may be due to fluid overload or possible proteinuria contributing to the edema.
6. Anemia: The patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia. It is important to monitor her hematocrit levels and maintain active supplementation.
7. Hypotension: The patient has low blood pressure but is currently asymptomatic. It is essential to review her baseline blood pressures to determine if there is a significant drop.
8. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has been experiencing fluid overload, which can lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and tests may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for
   PNA, here with SOB, cholecystitis and pancreatitis
   .
   # SOB
 New O2 requirement. Patient treated for reccurrent PNA, with
   persistently elevated WBC despite abx therapy with various agents, the
   last being moxifloxacin and, presently, vanc/zosyn. Patient has
   significant atelectasis with transudative pleural effusion on the left.
   A tap on [**2-21**] found transudative fluid by all criteria. Additionally it
   was amylase [**Doctor First Name **] (ARPE). The ddx of ARPE with amylase ratio of >/= 1 is
   overwhelmingly pancreatitis and, rarely, malignancy; hers is likely
   pancreatitis. TTE excludes cardiac cause.
   - vanc/cefepime/flagyl D3/8 for HAP ; consider d/c if negative cultures
   and further evidence of allergy
   - morphine for post-procedure pain
   - follow up cultures of pleural fluid
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   # pancreatitis
 Elevated lipase in setting of cholelithiasis and
   dilated CBD ~ 10 mm.  Most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis.
   CT shows diffuse calcifications.  Patient pain free at this time.
   Lipase and Amylase rising on [**2-22**] with advancement of diet. The
   inflammatory factors produced by her pancreatitis could be altering her
   splanchnic circulation resulting in the ARF (below) and the third
   spacing. However, the third spacing is further compounded by the
   hypoalbuminemia that is related not only to inflammation but also
   malnutrition x 1 month. TPN is likely to worsen the inflammatory
   process
   - consider Nasojejunal tube today.
   -Has follow up scheduled in [**Month (only) 349**].
   - trend lipase
   - Consult Pancreas/GI for input
 help with plan.
   # ARF
 Cr reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**]; peaked at 3.0 on on [**2-21**].
   Urine Lytes consistently pre-renal; Mild proteinuria.  Her rising Cr
   likely multifacatorial but mostly related to vascular depletion from
   overdiuresis and third spacing. The urine as spun on [**2-21**] to reveal
   profuse muddy brown casts (ATN) but also copious uric acid crystals of
   unknown significants. Still a possibility, given her drug allergic
   reaction, is AIN. No urine Eos. She partially responded to blood and
   fluid on [**2-22**].
   - transfuse another unit, avoid crystalloid without colloid
   - treat underlying condition
   - F/U UPEP
   - renal recs
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   # transaminitis
 Mildly elevated liver enzymes consistent with
   cholelithiasis/cholecystitis that have improved over the
   hospitalization; most likely from cholecystitis.  normal Tbili and
   borderline alk phos, ruling out significant infiltrative
   disease/congestive hepatopathy or obstruction
   - abx as above
   - morphine PRN for pain
   # rash
 Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patient w as not on any
   antibiotics when rash was first noticed 3 days prior to presentation,
   but at that time limited to back only.  Rash is nonpruritic. Daughter
   says patient was on vanc/zosyn.  Probably drug allergic reaction given
   this history and peripheral eosinophilia.
   -serial exams
   # LE edema
 Patient with 3+ L>R LE edema that per patient is a
   relatively new development since stopping lasix. Likely thirdspacing of
   pancreatitis and transudation from hypoalbuminemia
   -  holding lasix in setting of ARF
   -  will resume diet (ADAT) due to possible nutritional deficiencies/low
   albumin contributing to edema

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, obesity, and recent admission for pneumonia. She presents with shortness of breath, cholecystitis, and pancreatitis. She has been treated for recurrent pneumonia with various antibiotics, including moxifloxacin and vancomycin/cefepime. The patient has significant atelectasis with a transudative pleural effusion on the left, which was tapped and found to be transudative fluid by all criteria. The differential diagnosis for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with an amylase level of greater than or equal to 1 includes pancreatitis and rarely malignancy; pancreatitis is likely in this case. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) has excluded cardiac causes.

The patient also has acute kidney injury (AKI) with an elevated creatinine level from 1.1 to 3.0, consistent with pre-renal azotemia. The urine electrolytes show consistent pre-renal pattern, mild proteinuria, and the presence of muddy brown casts and uric acid crystals. This suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to vascular depletion from overdiuresis and third spacing. Another possibility is allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN), but no urine eosinophils were found. The patient partially responded to blood and fluid on [**2-22**].

The patient has mild transaminitis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for
   PNA, here with SOB, cholecystitis and pancreatitis
   .
   # SOB
 New O2 requirement. Patient treated for reccurrent PNA, with
   persistently elevated WBC despite abx therapy with various agents, the
   last being moxifloxacin and, presently, vanc/zosyn. Patient has
   significant atelectasis with exudative pleural effusion on the left. A
   tap on [**2-21**] found exudative fluid by Light
s criteria (protein ratio).
   Additionally it was amylase [**Doctor First Name **] (ARPE). The ddx of ARPE with amylase
   ratio of >/= 1 is overwhelmingly pancreatitis and, rarely, malignancy;
   hers is likely pancreatitis. TTE excludes cardiac cause.
   - vanc/cefepime/flagyl D4/8 for HAP ; consider d/c if negative cultures
   and further evidence of allergy
   - morphine for post-procedure pain
   - follow up cultures of pleural fluid
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   # pancreatitis
 Elevated lipase in setting of cholelithiasis and
   dilated CBD ~ 10 mm.  Most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis.
   CT shows diffuse calcifications.  Patient pain free at this time.
   Lipase and Amylase rising on [**2-22**] with advancement of diet. The
   inflammatory factors produced by her pancreatitis could be altering her
   splanchnic circulation resulting in the ARF (below) and the third
   spacing. However, the third spacing is further compounded by the
   hypoalbuminemia that is related not only to inflammation but also
   malnutrition x 1 month. TPN is likely to worsen the inflammatory
   process
   - consider Nasojejunal tube today.
   - has follow up scheduled in [**Month (only) 349**].
   - trend lipase
   - f/u GI recs
   # ARF
 Cr reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**]; peaked at 3.0 on on [**2-21**].
   Urine Lytes consistently pre-renal; Mild proteinuria.  Her rising Cr
   likely multifacatorial but mostly related to vascular depletion from
   overdiuresis and third spacing. The urine as spun on [**2-21**] to reveal
   profuse muddy brown casts (ATN) but also copious uric acid crystals of
   unknown significance. Still a possibility, given her drug allergic
   reaction, is AIN; however, no urine eos.  She partially responded to
   blood and fluid on [**2-22**].
   - transfuse another unit, avoid crystalloid without colloid
   - treat underlying condition
   - f/u UPEP
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   # transaminitis
 Mildly elevated liver enzymes consistent with
   cholelithiasis/cholecystitis that have improved over the
   hospitalization; most likely from cholecystitis.  normal Tbili and
   borderline alk phos, ruling out significant infiltrative
   disease/congestive hepatopathy or obstruction
   - abx as above
   - morphine PRN for pain
   # rash
 Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patient w as not on any
   antibiotics when rash was first noticed 3 days prior to presentation,
   but at that time limited to back only.  Rash is nonpruritic. Daughter
   says patient was on vanc/zosyn.  Probably drug allergic reaction given
   this history and peripheral eosinophilia.
   - serial exams
   # LE edema
 Patient with 3+ L>R LE edema that per patient is a
   relatively new development since stopping lasix. Likely thirdspacing of
   pancreatitis and transudation from hypoalbuminemia

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, obesity, and recent admission for pneumonia (PNA). She presents with shortness of breath (SOB), cholecystitis, and pancreatitis. The patient's recent medical history includes recurrent PNA, persistently elevated white blood cell count (WBC) despite antibiotic therapy, significant atelectasis with exudative pleural effusion on the left, and amylase-rich pleural fluid consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

Assessment and Plan:
1. SOB - New O2 requirement. The patient has been treated for recurrent PNA with various antibiotics, including moxifloxacin and vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Morphine has been administered for post-procedure pain. Follow-up cultures of pleural fluid are planned.
2. Pancreatitis - Elevated lipase levels in the setting of cholelithiasis and dilated common bile duct (CBD) suggest gallstone pancreatitis. A CT scan shows diffuse calcifications. The patient's pain has resolved, but lipase and amylase levels are rising with advancement of diet. Inflammatory factors produced by pancreatitis could be altering splanchnic circulation, resulting in acute renal failure (ARF) and third spacing. However, the third spacing is further compounded by hypoalbuminemia related to inflammation and malnutrition. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may worsen the inflammatory process. A nasojejunal tube is being considered today. Follow-up gastrointestinal recommendations are scheduled in 3 months.
3. ARF - The patient's creatinine level peaked at 3.0 on [**2-21**], with pre-renal azotemia indicated by consistent urine electrolytes. Mild proteinuria and profuse muddy brown casts (acute tubular necrosis, ATN) were observed, along with copious uric acid crystals. The patient partially responded to blood and fluid transfusion on [**2-22**]. Another unit of blood is recommended, and the use of crystalloid without colloid should be avoided. Underlying conditions should be treated, and follow-up urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) and renal recommendations are planned. Renal dosing of medications and follow-up urine output (UOP) monitoring are also advised.
4. Transaminitis - Mildly elevated liver enzymes are consistent with cholelithiasis/cholecystitis, which have improved over hospitalization. This is most likely related to cholecystitis. Normal total bilirubin (Tbili) and borderline alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) levels rule out significant infiltrative disease/congestive hepatopathy or obstruction. Antibiotic therapy as previously mentioned, along with morphine for pain management, is recommended.
5. Rash - The patient has a"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for
   PNA, here with SOB, cholecystitis and pancreatitis
   .
   # SOB
 New O2 requirement. Patient treated for reccurrent PNA, with
   persistently elevated WBC despite abx therapy with various agents, the
   last being moxifloxacin and, presently, vanc/zosyn. Patient has
   significant atelectasis with exudative pleural effusion on the left. A
   tap on [**2-21**] found exudative fluid by Light
s criteria (protein ratio).
   Additionally it was amylase [**Doctor First Name **] (ARPE). The ddx of ARPE with amylase
   ratio of >/= 1 is overwhelmingly pancreatitis and, rarely, malignancy;
   hers is likely pancreatitis. TTE excludes cardiac cause.
   - vanc/cefepime/flagyl D4/8 for HAP ; consider d/c if negative cultures
   and further evidence of allergy
   - morphine for post-procedure pain
   - follow up cultures of pleural fluid
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   # pancreatitis
 Elevated lipase in setting of cholelithiasis and
   dilated CBD ~ 10 mm.  Most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis.
   CT shows diffuse calcifications.  Patient pain free at this time.
   Lipase and Amylase rising on [**2-22**] with advancement of diet. The
   inflammatory factors produced by her pancreatitis could be altering her
   splanchnic circulation resulting in the ARF (below) and the third
   spacing. However, the third spacing is further compounded by the
   hypoalbuminemia that is related not only to inflammation but also
   malnutrition x 1 month. TPN is likely to worsen the inflammatory
   process
   - consider Nasojejunal tube today.
   - has follow up scheduled in [**Month (only) 349**].
   - trend lipase
   - f/u GI recs
   # ARF
 Cr reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**]; peaked at 3.0 on on [**2-21**].
   Urine Lytes consistently pre-renal; Mild proteinuria.  Her rising Cr
   likely multifacatorial but mostly related to vascular depletion from
   overdiuresis and third spacing. The urine as spun on [**2-21**] to reveal
   profuse muddy brown casts (ATN) but also copious uric acid crystals of
   unknown significance. Still a possibility, given her drug allergic
   reaction, is AIN; however, no urine eos.  She partially responded to
   blood and fluid on [**2-22**].
   - transfuse another unit, avoid crystalloid without colloid
   - treat underlying condition
   - f/u UPEP
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   # transaminitis
 Mildly elevated liver enzymes consistent with
   cholelithiasis/cholecystitis that have improved over the
   hospitalization; most likely from cholecystitis.  normal Tbili and
   borderline alk phos, ruling out significant infiltrative
   disease/congestive hepatopathy or obstruction
   - abx as above
   - morphine PRN for pain
   # rash
 Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patient w as not on any
   antibiotics when rash was first noticed 3 days prior to presentation,
   but at that time limited to back only.  Rash is nonpruritic. Daughter
   says patient was on vanc/zosyn.  Probably drug allergic reaction given
   this history and peripheral eosinophilia.
   - serial exams
   # LE edema
 Patient with 3+ L>R LE edema that per patient is a
   relatively new development since stopping lasix. Likely thirdspacing of
   pancreatitis and transudation from hypoalbuminemia
   -  holding lasix in setting of ARF
   -  will resume diet (ADAT) due to possible nutritional deficiencies/low
   albumin contributing to edema
   - f/u LENIs
   # anemia
 History of iron deficiency anemia. Has had chronic
   inflammation as well
   - transfuse with renal perfusion as goal, measured by creatinine
   - trend Hct
   - maintain active T+S
   # low blood pressure, asymptomatic
   - will review records for baseline blood pressures

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for pneumonia (PNA), and now presenting with shortness of breath (SOB), cholecystitis, and pancreatitis. The patient has significant atelectasis with exudative pleural effusion on the left side. A thoracentesis was performed on [**2125-2-21**] and revealed exudative fluid by Light criteria (protein ratio). The fluid analysis also showed amylase [**Doctor First Name **] (ARPE). The differential diagnosis for ARPE includes pancreatitis and rarely malignancy; however, pancreatitis is likely in this case. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) excluded cardiac causes.

The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and consideration is being given to discontinuing the antibiotics if cultures are negative and there is further evidence of allergy. Morphine is being administered for post-procedure pain, and follow-up cultures of pleural fluid are planned. Albuterol/atrovent nebs are also being used.

The patient has elevated lipase in the setting of cholelithiasis and a dilated common bile duct (CBD) of approximately 10 mm. This suggests gallstone pancreatitis. A computed tomography (CT) scan shows diffuse calcifications, and"
