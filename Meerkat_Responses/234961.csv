   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 y/o M hx HIV (last CD4 1080 [**2-7**]) now presents with fever,
   hypotension requiring pressors and GPC septic shock
   .
   # Septic Shock: His hypotension and positive blood cx (GPCs in
   pairs)are consistent with septic shock. Of note, he is asplenic and at
   high risk for encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae,
   Haemophilus influenza, and Neisseria meningitidis. Given very high
   fever, there was some concern for flu. No clinical signs to suggest
   cardiogenic shock. Also, not adrenally insufficient as cortisol is 38.
   - goal CVP>[**11-10**], MAP>65, mixed venous >70
   - trend lactate
   - goal UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - check LFTs given hypotension
   - continue levophed and neo and titrate to above parameters
   - if persistantly needs pressors, would add on vasopressin and
   preferentially wean down neo
   - f/u blood cx speciation and continue Vanc/Cefepime for broad coverage
   - urine/sputum cx, rapid viral screen in ED
   - consider ID consult (ID care at OSH)
   - current mental status is good, but if altered, would have low
   threshold for LP
   - echo to look for vegetations
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: CXR with no clear infiltrate, and by ED
   report, he only became SOB and hypoxic after aggressive fluid
   [**Last Name (LF) 5681**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] I suspect volume overload. No echo in OMR. he does
   have OSA with central and obstructive.
   - continue NRB and low threshold for intubation for resp failure
   - at this point, priority of treatment of septic physiology
   - echo as above
   .
   # Rash: he has a blanching erythematous macular rash over enitre back.
   Per pt, was initially full body in ED, but has since improved
   - continue to monitor for drug rash
   .
   # HIV: Currently not on HAART and CD4 count is 1080, so no need for
   ppx.
   - touch base with outpt

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of HIV and a current CD4 count of 1080 presenting with fever, hypotension requiring pressors, and GPC septic shock. The patient is asplenic and at high risk for encapsulated organisms. He also has hypoxic respiratory distress without clear infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient has a blanching erythematous macular rash over his entire back, which may be due to drug rash. The patient is currently not on HAART, and his HIV status needs to be addressed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and positive blood cultures (GPCs in pairs) indicate septic shock. The goal is to maintain CVP > 11 mmHg, MAP > 65, and mixed venous O2 saturation > 70. Close monitoring of lactate levels, urine output, and liver function tests is necessary. Pressors should be continued and titrated accordingly.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress with no clear infiltrate on chest X-ray suggests the possibility of fluid overload. Continuing non-rebreather therapy and having a low threshold for intubation if respiratory failure occurs is recommended. An echocardiogram should be performed to assess for vegetations.

3. Rash: The patient's blanching erythematous macular rash over his entire back may be a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of HIV (last CD4 count 1080) presenting with fever, hypotension requiring pressors, and GPC septic shock. He is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 94/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and no murmurs or rubs. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, high lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has a central venous pressure goal of greater than 11 mmHg, mean arterial pressure goal of greater than 65 mmHg, and mixed venous oxygen saturation goal of greater than 70%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and positive blood cultures suggest ongoing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and ongoing management of fluid and vasopressor requirements are essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and recent hypoxia may predispose him to respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and close observation for signs of worsening respiratory function are necessary"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 y/o M hx HIV (last CD4 1080 [**2-7**]) now presents with fever,
   hypotension requiring pressors and GPC septic shock
   .
   # Septic Shock: His hypotension and positive blood cx (GPCs in
   pairs)are consistent with septic shock. Of note, he is asplenic and at
   high risk for encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae,
   Haemophilus influenza, and Neisseria meningitidis. Given very high
   fever, there was some concern for flu. No clinical signs to suggest
   cardiogenic shock. Also, not adrenally insufficient as cortisol is 38.
   - still on pressure support, would continue for now for goals listed
   below.  In setting of fluid overload, would avoid large fluid boluses
   (f/u echo to assess [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have septic cardiomyopathy).  If needs
   extra inatropic support, add vasopressin
   - goal CVP>[**11-10**], MAP>65, mixed venous >70
   - lactate staying around 2.5, continue to trend
   - goal UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - check LFTs given hypotension
   - f/u blood cx speciation and continue Vanc/Cefepime for broad coverage
   - urine/sputum cx, rapid viral screen in ED
   - ID consulted today
   - current mental status is good, but if altered, would have low
   threshold for LP
   - echo to look for vegetations, evaluate heart function
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: CXR with no clear infiltrate, and by ED
   report, he only became SOB and hypoxic after aggressive fluid
   [**Last Name (LF) 5681**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] I suspect volume overload. No echo in OMR. he does
   have OSA with central and obstructive.
   - now with B pleural effusions
   - weaned from NRB to home cpap overnight, now on facemask this morning
   - avoid aggressive fluid resuccitation if possible, although at this
   point, priority of treatment of septic physiology
   - no diuresis
   - echo as above
   .
   # Rash: he has a blanching erythematous macular rash over enitre back.
   Per pt, was initially full body in ED, but has since improved
   -          continue to monitor for drug rash
   .
   # Transaminitis
 likely in setting of shock liver, continue to trend
   .
   # Heme
 falling platelets, increasing INR
   - f/u DIC labs
   .
   # HIV: Currently not on HAART and CD4 count is 1080, so no need for
   ppx.
   - touch base with outpt
   .
   # OSA:
   - continue home CPAP
   .
   # FEN:
   - IVF as above
   - replete electrolytes
   - advance diet as tolerated

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of HIV and a current CD4 count of 1080 presenting with fever, hypotension, and GPC septic shock. He is asplenic, putting him at high risk for encapsulated organisms. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 94/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. His physical examination reveals clear lungs except for dullness and crackles at the bases, regular heart rhythm, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm well-perfused extremities. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, liver enzymes, and lactic acid level. The patient's assessment includes septic shock, hypoxic respiratory distress, rash, transaminitis, heme disturbance, HIV, obstructive sleep apnea, and fluid/electrolyte imbalance. The plan involves continuing pressure support, avoiding large fluid boluses, adding vasopressin if needed, maintaining target CVP, MAP, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and urine output. Additional tests include blood culture speciation, urine/sputum cultures, rapid viral screen, and an echocardiogram to evaluate for vegetations and heart function."

   24 Hour Events:
   [**3-12**] Events:
   - cont on vanc/cefepime
   - ECHO:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal
   diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The ascending
   aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses
   or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no aortic valve
   stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
   valve. No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. No
   evidence of endocarditis or abscess but limited sensitivity due to
   suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular function is probably normal,
   a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
   ventricle is not well seen but may be slightly dilated/hypokinetic. No
   pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
   echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

   high risk for encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae,
   Haemophilus influenza, and Neisseria meningitidis. Given very high
   fever, there was some concern for flu. No clinical signs to suggest
   cardiogenic shock. Also, not adrenally insufficient as cortisol is 38.
   - still on pressure support, would continue for now for goals listed

   - goal UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - check LFTs given hypotension
   - f/u blood cx speciation and continue Vanc/Cefepime for broad coverage
   - urine/sputum cx, rapid viral screen in ED
   - ID consulted today
   - current mental status is good, but if altered, would have low
   threshold for LP
   - echo to look for vegetations, evaluate heart function

   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: CXR with no clear infiltrate, and by ED
   report, he only became SOB and hypoxic after aggressive fluid
   [**Last Name (LF) 5681**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] I suspect volume overload. No echo in OMR. he does
   have OSA with central and obstructive.
   - now with B pleural effusions

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of HIV and a current CD4 count of 1080 presenting with fever, hypotension requiring pressors, and GPC septic shock. He has been diagnosed with septic shock, hypoxic respiratory distress, rash, transaminitis, heme, and OSA. The patient's condition requires ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and positive blood cultures indicate an ongoing infection leading to septic shock. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can compromise oxygenation and ventilation, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an excess of IV fluid administration compared to urine output, indicating a risk of fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory distress.
4. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's laboratory results show elevated D-dimer levels and decreasing platelet count, indicating a potential coagulation disorder. If left untreated, DIC can result in widespread bleeding and organ damage.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes suggest liver dysfunction, which can be caused by sepsis, hypoperfusion, or direct viral infection. Further assessment is needed to determine the exact cause"

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal
   diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The ascending
   aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses
   or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no aortic valve
   stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears

   This is a 51 y/o M hx HIV (last CD4 1080 [**2-7**]) now presents with fever,
   hypotension requiring pressors and GPC septic shock
   .
   # Septic Shock: pneumococcal septic shock per culture data.  Lactates
   starting to improve, WBCs still increasing
   - per ID and new sensitivities with MICs, recommend ceftriaxone 2 gm q
   24 hrs; stopping vanc/cefepime
   - weaned off pressor support this morning, maintaining appropriate MAPs
   - goal CVP>[**11-10**], MAP>65, mixed venous >70
   - lactate 1.6 this morning after 3.0 yesterday
   - goal UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - urine/sputum cx neg, rapid viral screen in ED neg
   - echo to look for vegetations, evaluate heart function
 had normal EF
   with some mild R sided hypokinesis; no signs of vegetation; would
   recommend TEE in a few days to evaluate for vegetation to guide length
   of treatment
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: CXR with no clear infiltrate, and by ED
   report, he only became SOB and hypoxic after aggressive fluid
   [**Last Name (LF) 5681**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] I suspect volume overload.
   - now with B pleural effusions
   - on bipap throughout most of day and night yesterday, appropriate
   oxygenation, will try to wean O2 as tolerated today
   - avoid aggressive fluid resuccitation if possible, although at this
   point, priority of treatment of septic physiology
   - no diuresis for now, will likely autodiures once shock can resolves
   .
   # Rash: he has a blanching erythematous macular rash over enitre back.
   Per pt, was initially full body in ED, but has since improved, continue
   to monitor
   .
   # Transaminitis
 likely in setting of shock liver, continue to trend
   - LFTs improving
   .
   # Heme
 falling platelets, increasing INR
   - no signs of DIC
   - changing PPI to H2 blocker for possible PPI thrombocytopenia
   .
   # HIV: Currently not on HAART and CD4 count is 1080, so no need for
   ppx.
   - emailed outpt doctor, he is out of town and covering doctor is aware
   - CD4 count 500

   # OSA:
   - continue home CPAP
   .
   # FEN:
   - IVF as above
   - replete electrolytes
   - advance diet as tolerated

   # Prophylaxis:
   - Subcutaneous heparin
   - H2 blocker

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of HIV and a current CD4 count of 1080. He presents with fever, hypotension, and septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumococcal septic shock based on culture data. His lactates are improving, and white blood cell count is still increasing. The patient is currently on ceftriaxone for treatment and has been weaned off pressor support. 

The patient also has hypoxic respiratory distress, as indicated by shortness of breath and low oxygen saturation. There are no clear infiltrates on chest X-ray, and the patient's condition improved after reducing fluid resuscitation. The patient is being managed with bipap for oxygenation and will be monitored closely.

Additionally, the patient has a rash described as a blanching erythematous macular rash over his entire back. This rash was initially full-body in the emergency department but has since improved. 

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, indicating transaminitis, likely due to shock liver. The patient's platelet count is decreasing, and the INR is increasing, but there are no signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient is not currently on HAART for HIV management, but it is recommended due to his low CD4 count. 

The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of HIV, presenting with fever, hypotension requiring pressors, and Gram-positive cocci septic shock. The patient has been treated with ceftriaxone, and other antibiotics have been stopped. Vital signs are stable, and the patient is oxygenating well on room air with CPAP support at night. The patient has a blanching erythematous macular rash over his entire back, likely due to an allergic reaction. Laboratory results show improving white blood cell count and decreasing lactate levels. The patient's platelet count is low, but there are no signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). There is a concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and the patient is being evaluated for this condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient's low platelet count and recent exposure to heparin raise concerns for HIT. This condition can lead to the formation of blood clots and potentially life-threatening complications if not treated promptly.
2. Pneumococcal septic shock: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent treatment indicate pneumococcal septic shock. This condition can be life-threatening if not managed aggressively with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's hypoxic respiratory distress and bilateral pleural eff"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 51 y/o M hx HIV (last CD4 1080 [**2-7**]) now presents with fever,
   hypotension requiring pressors and GPC septic shock
   .
   # Septic Shock: pneumococcal septic shock per culture data.  Lactates
   starting to improve, WBCs still increasing
   - per ID and new sensitivities with MICs, recommend ceftriaxone 2 gm q
   24 hrs; stopping vanc/cefepime
   - weaned off pressor support this morning, maintaining appropriate MAPs
   - goal CVP>[**11-10**], MAP>65, mixed venous >70
   - lactate 1.6 this morning after 3.0 yesterday
   - goal UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - urine/sputum cx neg, rapid viral screen in ED neg
   - echo to look for vegetations, evaluate heart function
 had normal EF
   with some mild R sided hypokinesis; no signs of vegetation; would
   recommend TEE in a few days to evaluate for vegetation to guide length
   of treatment
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: CXR with no clear infiltrate, and by ED
   report, he only became SOB and hypoxic after aggressive fluid
   [**Last Name (LF) 5681**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] I suspect volume overload.
   - now with B pleural effusions
   - on bipap throughout most of day and night yesterday, appropriate
   oxygenation, will try to wean O2 as tolerated today
   - avoid aggressive fluid resuccitation if possible, although at this
   point, priority of treatment of septic physiology
   - no diuresis for now, will likely autodiures once shock can resolves
   .
   # Rash: he has a blanching erythematous macular rash over enitre back.
   Per pt, was initially full body in ED, but has since improved, continue
   to monitor
   .
   # Transaminitis
 likely in setting of shock liver, continue to trend
   - LFTs improving
   .
   # Heme
 falling platelets, increasing INR
   - no signs of DIC
   - changing PPI to H2 blocker for possible PPI thrombocytopenia
   .
   # HIV: Currently not on HAART and CD4 count is 1080, so no need for
   ppx.
   - emailed outpt doctor, he is out of town and covering doctor is aware
   - CD4 count 500
   .
   # OSA:
   - continue home CPAP
   .
   # FEN:
   - IVF as above
   - replete electrolytes
   - advance diet as tolerated
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   - Subcutaneous heparin
   - H2 blocker
   .
   # Access:
   - RIJ, discussed possibly changing it in setting of infection, but will
   keep for another day and likely place PICC after survelience blood
   cultures start to become negative

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of HIV (last CD4 count 1080) who presented with fever, hypotension requiring pressors, and GPC septic shock. He has been diagnosed with pneumococcal septic shock based on culture data, and his lactate levels are starting to improve. The patient's white blood cell count is still increasing. He has been weaned off pressor support and is maintaining appropriate mean arterial pressures. The goal for central venous pressure is above 11 mmHg, mean arterial pressure is above 65 mmHg, and mixed venous oxygen saturation is above 70%. The patient's urine output should be greater than 30 cc/hr. The patient's sputum and urine cultures are negative, and a rapid viral screen in the emergency department is negative. An echocardiogram has shown normal ejection fraction with mild right-sided hypokinesis, and no signs of vegetation were found. However, a transesophageal echocardiogram is recommended in a few days to evaluate for vegetation and guide the length of treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumococcal septic shock: The patient's presentation and culture data suggest pneumococcal septic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, is essential. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and the response to treatment should be closely"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of HIV and a low CD4 count of 1080. He presents with fever, hypotension requiring pressors, and GPC septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumococcal septic shock, as indicated by culture data. His lactate levels are improving, and white blood cell counts are still increasing.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 94/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on bipap support and is receiving appropriate oxygenation.

The patient has a history of allergies to Bactrim, Percocet, and Morphine, as well as a rash from Lipitor. He has also experienced myalgia with Lipitor. The last dose of antibiotics was cefepime on 03/12/2018 at 06:00 PM, followed by vancomycin at 08:00 PM on the same day, and ceftriaxone on 03/13/2018 at 04:00 PM.

Infusions include other ICU medications and fluids. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,023 mL and output of 1,530 mL since midnight, resulting in a balance of 1,493 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rate and rhythm, and warm, well-perfused extremities. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes, as well as decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Septic Shock: The patient has pneumococcal septic shock. The recommended antibiotic regimen is ceftriaxone 2 gm every 24 hours, stopping vanc/cefepime. The patient has been weaned off pressor support, maintaining appropriate mean arterial pressures (MAPs). The goal central venous pressure (CVP) is above 11-10, MAP above 65, and mixed venous oxygen saturation above 70. The patient's lactate level has improved from 3.0 to 1.6. The goal urine output is above 30 cc/hr. Cultures are negative, and an echocardiogram has shown no signs of vegetation. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed in a few days to evaluate for vegetation and guide treatment duration.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The"
