   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). The right ventricular cavity
   is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There is no aortic
   valve stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 y/o M who was found down after overdosing on several
   drugs with tox screen positive for opiates, benzos and cocaine with
   resultant respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal
   failure, intubated s/p PEA arrest which was likely caused by
   hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.
   - ARDS net protocol ventilation: 490/32/10/70%, still acidemic
   - b/l chest tubes: Right to sunction, left to water seal. IP is
   following
   - Sputum gram stain gram positive cocci and gram
 rods, will follow up
   speciation.
   - Broad spectrum coverage  with Cefepime, vanco, clindamycin and
   azithromycin, continue for now, pending cultures
   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: CK on admission 206,000, now
   trending down. Creatinine 4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or
   seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. Less likely, necrotizing
   faceitis in setting of trauma and redness overlying leg.
   - dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, will likely need
   for a while.
   - patient [**Last Name (LF) 1611**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will hold off on alkalanizing urine
   - check frequent potassium.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome, pressures not high enough to require [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Treat emirically for Nec fac with clindamycin
   - serial urine pH goal >7.
   Shock: likely cardiogenic in the setting of PEA arrest. also possible
   is sepsis from nec fac or lung process. Now off levophed. Can
   discontinue levophed.
   PEA Arrest: s/p epi, atropine and shock x1 to get back into sinus.
   Etiology of this are possibly Hyperkalemia vs hypercarbia, vs cardiac
   suppression with drugs vs hypoxia. Using Arctic Sun cooling system 24
   hours in the setting of PEA arrest, has been at goal temp now. ECHO
   with global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - will start warming today.
   Transaminitis: Likely secondary to Rhabdo. possibly shock liver in the
   setting of hypotension, patient with known
   leukocytosis: to 25 with 10% bands. possible sources are lungs with
   aspiration pna, left leg with possible
   - empiric broad spectrum coverage for now with Vanco, Clindamycin, and
   Zosyn, azithromycin
   - Gram stain in sputum positive, will await speciation.
   Overdose: supportive treatment as above. social work consult when he
   wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, femoral aline
   - attempt resiting aline.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found unconscious after overdosing on multiple drugs, resulting in respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and intubation following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes and bilateral effusions. He is currently on ARDS net ventilation and broad-spectrum antibiotics due to positive sputum gram stain showing gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. The patient also has rhabdomyolysis with elevated creatine kinase levels, acute renal failure, and hyperkalemia. He is being treated with dialysis and supportive care. The patient's condition is complicated by potential complications such as sepsis, shock, and compartment syndrome. Further investigations and management are ongoing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been on ARDS net ventilation due to marked hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates on imaging. This indicates the potential for ongoing respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Sepsis: The positive sputum gram stain showing gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods suggests a possible infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but close monitoring for signs of sepsis and appropriate management is necessary.
3. Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatine kinase levels indicate rhab"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 y/o M who was found down after overdosing on several
   drugs with tox screen positive for opiates, benzos and cocaine with
   resultant respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal
   failure, intubated s/p PEA arrest which was likely caused by
   hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.
   - ARDS net protocol ventilation: 490/32/10/70%, still acidemic
   - b/l chest tubes to sunction, IP now following
   - Sputum gram stain gram positive cocci and gram - rods
   - Broad spectrum coverage  with Cefepime, vanco, clindamycin and
   azithromycin
   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis: CK on admission 206,000, now trending down. Creatinine
   4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or
   prolonged stasis. Also possible is necrotizing faceitis in setting of
   trauma and redness overlying leg.
   - dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, will likely need
   for a while.
   - patient [**Last Name (LF) 1611**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will hold off on alkalanizing urine
   - check frequent lytes.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome, prssures not high enough to require [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Treat emirically for Nec fac with clindamycin
   - serial urine pH goal >7.
   Acute renal failure: with resultant hyperkalemia with peaked t waves.
   Likely etiology is rhabdomyolysis. Also contributing is prerenal
   failure from dehydration during drug use and possible emesis. Post
   renal also possible, but patient has foley now, and no hydro in CT. He
   recieved 2mg CaCl in the ED, as well is 10U IV insulin with an amp of
   D50. His femoral cordis was changed to a HD line over a wire in the ED
   prior to coming up to the MICU.
   - REnal consult called for emergent dialysis in setting of severe
   hyperkalemia.
   - Fluids with bicarb for treatment of rhabdomyolysis.
   - starting emergent dialysis on admission
   - recheck potassium
   Shock: likely cardiogenic in the setting of PEA arrest. also possible
   is sepsis from nec fac or lung process. previously on levophed and
   dopamine, the latter of which was weaned off prior to coming to the
   floor. Lactate >9 at max, now trending down
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - monitor CVP goal [**9-9**]
   - generous fluids
   - goal UO >30.
   - check mixed venous sat concurrently with ABG for estimation of
   Cardiac output.
   - consider using vigileo to assess volume status and CO
   - treat emirically broad spectrum for possible infection with vanco,
   cefepime and clindamycin.
   - follow lactate.
   - check concurrent VBG and ABG
   PEA Arrest: s/p epi, atropine and shock x1 to get back into sinus.
   Etiology of this are possibly Hyperkalemia vs hypercarbia, vs cardiac
   suppression with drugs vs hypoxia. Using arctic cooling system for
   12-24 hours in the setting of PEA arrest. will paralyze with vecuronium
   to prevent shivering since patient has rhabdomyolysis.
   - ECHO
   Transaminitis: possibly shock liver in the setting of hypotension,
   acute hep b/c given patient is known drug user, or other [**Last Name (un) **] toxic
   ingestion (negative other than opiods, benzo and cocaine). patient has
   anion gap, but no osmolar gap. Also coagulopathy
   - hep panel
   - f/u liver on CT scan
   Anion gap metabolic acidosis: possible etiologies include lactic
   acidosis, rhabdo, may be DKA. will treat possible sources
   - fluids, bicarb drip, consider treating DKA with insulin
   leukocytosis: to 25 with 10% bands. possible sources are lungs with
   aspiration pna, left leg with possible
   - empiric broad spectrum coverage for now with Vanco, Clindamycin, and
   Zosyn
   Hypergylcemia: in setting of stress, insulin sliding scale
   Overdose: supportive treatment as above. social work consult when he

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found unresponsive after overdosing on multiple drugs. He has been intubated and admitted to the ICU due to respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and cardiac arrest. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, bilateral pneumothoraces, and effusions. He is on ARDS net ventilation and broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected necrotizing fasciitis. The patient also has rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and septic shock. He underwent emergent dialysis and received multiple blood products. His femoral cordis was changed to a HD line over a wire in the ED. The patient's medical team is concerned about compartment syndrome or seizure activity, as well as possible necrotizing fasciitis. They are also monitoring for acute hepatic injury, anion gap metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, and overdose complications. The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line, and is on various medications for prophylaxis and treatment. His code status is full code, and his disposition is still in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory depression and bilateral pneumothoraces put him at risk for ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis/Necrotizing Fasciitis: The presence of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 y/o M who was found down after overdosing on several
   drugs with tox screen positive for opiates, benzos and cocaine with
   resultant respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal
   failure, intubated s/p PEA arrest which was likely caused by
   hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.
   - ARDS net protocol ventilation: 490/28/8/50%, Gas looks good, will try
   SBT today.
   - b/l chest tubes: Right to sunction, left to water seal. IP is
   following
   - Sputum gram stain gram positive cocci and gram
 rods, will follow up
   speciation.
   - Broad spectrum coverage  with Cefepime, vanco, and azithromycin,
   continue for now, pending cultures, discontinue clindamycin
   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: CK on admission 206,000, now
   trending down. Creatinine 4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or
   seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. Less likely, necrotizing
   faceitis in setting of trauma and redness overlying leg.
   - dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, will dialyze
   tomorrow
   - patient making small amount of urine today.
   - check frequent potassium.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome, pressures not high enough to require [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   Leukocytosis: to 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized.
   possible sources are lungs with aspiration pna, left leg with possible
   - empiric broad spectrum coverage for now with Vanco, clindamycin
   azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   - discontinue clindamycin.
   - Gram stain in sputum positive, will await speciation.
   PEA Arrest: s/p Arctic Sun cooling system x24 hours, now rewarmed. ECHO
   with global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   Transaminitis: Likely secondary to Rhabdo. possibly shock liver in the
   setting of hypotension, patient with known Hep C. s/p 21 hours of NAC
   for repleating glutathione stores. Will recheck LFTs after NAC
   Shock: Resolved
   Overdose: supportive treatment as above. social work consult when he

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 y/o M who was found down after overdosing on several
   drugs with tox screen positive for opiates, benzos and cocaine with
   resultant respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal
   failure, intubated s/p PEA arrest which was likely caused by
   hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.
   - ARDS net protocol ventilation: 490/32/10/70%, still acidemic ----
   Fio2 down to 50 %
   - b/l chest tubes: Right to sunction, left to water seal. IP is
   following
   - Sputum gram stain gram positive cocci and gram
 rods, will follow up
   speciation.
   - Broad spectrum coverage  with Cefepime, vanco, clindamycin and
   azithromycin, continue for now, pending cultures
   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: CK on admission 206,000, now
   trending down. Creatinine 4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or
   seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. Less likely, necrotizing
   faceitis in setting of trauma and redness overlying leg.
   - dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, will likely need
   for a while.
   - patient [**Last Name (LF) 1611**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will hold off on alkalanizing urine
   - check frequent potassium.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome, pressures not high enough to require [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Treat emirically for Nec fac with clindamycin
   - serial urine pH goal >7.
   Shock: likely cardiogenic in the setting of PEA arrest. also possible
   is sepsis from nec fac or lung process. Now off levophed. Can
   discontinue levophed.
   PEA Arrest: s/p epi, atropine and shock x1 to get back into sinus.
   Etiology of this are possibly Hyperkalemia vs hypercarbia, vs cardiac
   suppression with drugs vs hypoxia. Using Arctic Sun cooling system 24
   hours in the setting of PEA arrest, has been at goal temp now. ECHO
   with global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - will start warming today.
   Transaminitis: Likely secondary to Rhabdo. possibly shock liver in the
   setting of hypotension, patient with known
   leukocytosis: to 25 with 10% bands. possible sources are lungs with
   aspiration pna, left leg with possible
   - empiric broad spectrum coverage for now with Vanco, Clindamycin, and

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found unresponsive after overdosing on multiple drugs. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory depression. The patient has several medical complications including hypercarbic respiratory failure, bilateral pneumothoracies, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, shock, and transaminitis. He also has positive tox screens for opiates, benzodiazepines, and cocaine. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging reveals no drainable collection in the leg but shows generalized edema and inflammation of the lateral subcutaneous tissues. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, sedation, dialysis, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed (HOB), performing regular mouth care, and maintaining a respiratory system infection (RSBI) score will be important in preventing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to a life-threatening PE. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous low molecular weight he"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down after overdosing on several drugs. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and intubated following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. 

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This is likely secondary to respiratory depression caused by drug overdose (tox positive for cocaine, benzos, opioids) or aspiration. The patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes and bilateral effusions.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 4.5, and potassium levels are high at 7s. This could be due to rhabdomyolysis, which is indicated by a very high CK level on admission.

3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK level on admission was 206,000 and is now trending down. This condition can lead to acute renal failure and compartment syndrome.

4. Possible Necrotizing Fasciitis: There is redness overlying the leg, and the patient has leukocytosis with 25% bands on admission. However, the possibility of necrotizing fasciitis seems less likely.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   #) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This has been felt to likely
   secondary to respiratory depression in setting of drugs use (toxicology
   screen positive for cocaine, benzos, opoids) versus aspiration from
   being down. Patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of
   right middle and lower lobes and b/l effusions.
   - Given infiltrates on exam, patient had been switched over to
   ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net. We have been weaning his
   oxygen as tolerated. His ABG
s have been satisfactory.
   - Patient was agitated, so [**Month/Day (4) 1324**] was not tolerated, will try again to
   change to pressure support and another [**Month/Day (4) 1324**].
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance.
   - Sputum culture with gram positive cocci, will follow up speciation.
   - Given patient was found down, history of drug use, was on pressors,
   will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for another day ( Cefepime,
   vanco, and azithromycin), and plan to narrow tomorrow pending further
   culture data
   - Versed and fentanyl for sedation, weaning as tolerated.
   #) Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine, but he is unlikely to make enough to correct his
   fluid balance in the next few days. His electrolytes today are WNL.
   Will likely receive ultrafiltrate today to remove fluid.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures have been measured and do not require intervention,
   continuing to monitor.
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   #) Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission,
   now normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   (Lungs with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -          Continue broad spectrum coverage for next 24 hours Vanco,
   cefepime, azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   -          Following culture data
   .
   #) PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   -          Continuing to monitor mental status, will attempt to lighten
   sedation to further assess, but appears to be responding appropriately
   to commands.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   .
   #) Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleating glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   .
   #) Shock: Resolved
   #) Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   #)Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with positive toxicology screens for opiates, benzos, and cocaine. He experienced respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and was intubated after a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency room. The patient is currently in the ICU, sedated and intubated, but showing signs of improvement. He is responsive to simple commands and has started to make urine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure likely secondary to respiratory depression caused by drug use or aspiration. He has been placed on a ventilator with ARDS net settings and his oxygen levels are being weaned as tolerated.
2) Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially had extremely high levels of creatine kinase (CK) on admission, indicating muscle breakdown. His creatinine level was elevated, and potassium levels were above 7. The rhabdomyolysis may have been caused by possible compartment syndrome, seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. He is currently on dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia.
3) Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count was initially high, possibly due to acute stress or infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been administered.
4) PEA Arrest: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with a positive toxicology screen for opiates, benzos, and cocaine. He presented with respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and was intubated after a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency room. The patient is currently sedated and on mechanical ventilation with ARDS net protocol ventilation. He has bilateral pneumothoraces with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes and bilateral effusions. The patient's sputum gram stain shows gram-positive cocci and gram rods, and he is receiving broad-spectrum coverage with cefepime, vancomycin, and azithromycin. His CK level on admission was 206,000, now trending down. Creatinine is 4.5, and potassium is elevated at 7s. The patient is making small amounts of urine today. He has leukocytosis with 25 WBCs and 10% bands, which has normalized. There are possible sources of infection in the lungs with aspiration pneumonia and the left leg with possible necrotizing fasciitis. The patient had a PEA arrest that was likely caused by hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia. He also has transaminitis likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis. The patient's condition remains critical, and he requires ongoing supportive treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 y/o M who was found down after overdosing on several
   drugs with tox screen positive for opiates, benzos and cocaine with
   resultant respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal
   failure, intubated s/p PEA arrest which was likely caused by
   hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.

   - Broad spectrum coverage  with Cefepime, vanco, and azithromycin,
   continue for now, pending cultures, discontinue clindamycin
   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: CK on admission 206,000, now
   trending down. Creatinine 4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or
   seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. Less likely, necrotizing

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found unresponsive after overdosing on several drugs. He tested positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine. He was intubated and resuscitated from a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, likely caused by hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, or acidemia. The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure due to respiratory depression caused by the drugs or possible aspiration. He also has bilateral pneumothoraces with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes and bilateral effusions. ARDSnet protocol ventilation was initiated, and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be attempted today.

The patient has rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, with a high creatine kinase level on admission, now trending down. His creatinine level is elevated at 4.5, and potassium is high at 7. He may have compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. Less likely, necrotizing fasciitis in the setting of trauma and redness overlying the leg. Dialysis will be done for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 y/o M who was found down after overdosing on several
   drugs with tox screen positive for opiates, benzos and cocaine with
   resultant respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal
   failure, intubated s/p PEA arrest which was likely caused by
   hyperkalemia vs hypoxia vs hypercarbia vs acidemia.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to respiratory
   depression in setting of drugs (tox positive for cocaine, benzos,
   opoids) vs aspiration being down. Patient also has bilateral
   pneumothoracies with collapse of right middle and lower lobes and b/l
   effusions.
   - ARDS net protocol ventilation: 490/28/8/50%, Gas looks good, will try
   SBT again today.
   -Okay to switch to PS today, now that he is alert
   - b/l chest tubes: Right to sunction, left to water seal. IP is
   following
   - Sputum gram stain gram positive cocci and gram
 rods, will follow up
   speciation.
   - Broad spectrum coverage  with Cefepime, vanco, and azithromycin,
   continue for now, pending cultures, discontinue clindamycin
   - versed and fentanyl for sedation.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: CK on admission 206,000, now
   trending down. Creatinine 4.5, K 7s. [**Month (only) 8**] have compartment syndrome or
   seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. Less likely, necrotizing
   fasciitis in setting of trauma and redness overlying leg.
   - dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, will dialyze
   tomorrow
   - patient making small amount of urine today.
   - check frequent potassium.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome, pressures not high enough to require [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   Leukocytosis: to 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized.
   possible sources are lungs with aspiration pna, left leg with possible
   - empiric broad spectrum coverage for now with Vanco, clindamycin
   azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   - discontinue clindamycin.
   - Gram stain in sputum positive, will await speciation.
   PEA Arrest: s/p Arctic Sun cooling system x24 hours, now rewarmed. ECHO
   with global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   Transaminitis: Likely secondary to Rhabdo. possibly shock liver in the
   setting of hypotension, patient with known Hep C. s/p 21 hours of NAC
   for repleating glutathione stores. Will recheck LFTs after NAC
   Shock: Resolved
   Overdose: supportive treatment as above. social work consult when he
   wakes up.

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old man with a history of polysubstance abuse and Hepatitis C who experienced a PEA arrest in the emergency department. He was intubated and resuscitated, and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's tox screen is positive for opiates, benzodiazepines, and cocaine. He has been treated for hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis, and has developed acute renal failure. The patient's current conditions include ARDS, bilateral pneumothoraces with effusions, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, possible sources of infection in the lungs and left leg, PEA arrest, transaminitis, shock, overdose, and access issues with multiple lines and catheters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation and immobility, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing mouth care, and implementing daily weaning trials should be taken to prevent this complication.
2. Line-related infections: With multiple lines and catheters in place, there is an increased risk of line-related infections, such as bloodstream infections. Proper care and maintenance of these lines are crucial to minimize this risk.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and hypercoagul"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   #) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This has been felt to likely
   secondary to respiratory depression in setting of drugs use (toxicology
   screen positive for cocaine, benzos, opoids) versus aspiration from
   being down. Patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of
   right middle and lower lobes and b/l effusions.
   - Given infiltrates on exam, patient had been switched over to
   ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net. We have been weaning his
   oxygen as tolerated. His ABG
s have been satisfactory.
   - Patient was agitated, so SBT was not tolerated, will try again to
   change to pressure support and another SBT.
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance.
   - Thick sputum today, Sputum culture with gram positive cocci, will
   follow up speciation.
   - Given patient was found down, history of drug use, was on pressors,
   will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for another day ( Cefepime,
   vanco, and azithromycin), and plan to narrow tomorrow pending further
   culture data
   - Versed and fentanyl for sedation, weaning as tolerated.
   - Will try to extubate today as tolerating SBT well today
   #) Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine, but he is unlikely to make enough to correct his
   fluid balance in the next few days. His electrolytes today are WNL.
   - No HD today
   - Plan for tunneled line given projected course
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures have been measured and do not require intervention,
   continuing to monitor, Ortho signing off, will call with issues prn.
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   #) Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission,
   now normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   (Lungs with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -          Continue broad spectrum coverage for next 24 hours Vanco,
   cefepime, azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   -          Following culture data
   .
   #) PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   -          Continuing to monitor mental status, will attempt to lighten
   sedation to further assess, but appears to be responding appropriately
   to commands.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   .
   #) Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleating glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   .
   #) Shock: Resolved
   #) Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   #)Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He presented to the emergency department after being found unresponsive in his vehicle. Initial assessment revealed a pulse of 112 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. He was intubated due to respiratory distress and subsequent cardiac arrest. The patient was resuscitated successfully and admitted to the ICU.

24-hour events:
- The patient's minute volume was low, so he was changed to pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tidal volume of 490 mL. His minute volume remained stable at 6-6 breaths per minute.
- His hemoglobin concentration (HCT) remained stable at 30.8%. Fibrinogen levels were within normal range, as were haptoglobin levels. FDP levels were between 10-40. Peripheral smear is pending. LDH levels are trending down.
- The patient's leg remained stable, and the orthopedic team signed off. They recommended calling with any questions.
- Renal ultrafiltration (UF) was attempted, but the patient's blood pressure dipped at times. A total of 1.7 kg of fluid was removed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   #) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This has been felt to likely
   secondary to respiratory depression in setting of drugs use (toxicology
   screen positive for cocaine, benzos, opoids) versus aspiration from
   being down. Patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of
   right middle and lower lobes and b/l effusions.
   - Given infiltrates on exam, patient had been switched over to
   ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net. We have been weaning his
   oxygen as tolerated. His ABG
s have been satisfactory.
   - Patient was agitated, so [**Numeric Identifier 1324**] was not tolerated, will try again to
   change to pressure support and another [**Numeric Identifier 1324**].
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance.
   - Sputum culture with gram positive cocci, will follow up speciation.
   - Given patient was found down, history of drug use, was on pressors,
   will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for another day ( Cefepime,
   vanco, and azithromycin), and plan to narrow tomorrow pending further
   culture data
   - Versed and fentanyl for sedation, weaning as tolerated.
   #) Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine, but he is unlikely to make enough to correct his
   fluid balance in the next few days. His electrolytes today are WNL.
   Will likely receive ultrafiltrate today to remove fluid.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures have been measured and do not require intervention,
   continuing to monitor, Ortho signing off, will call with issues prn.
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   #) Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission,
   now normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   (Lungs with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -          Continue broad spectrum coverage for next 24 hours Vanco,
   cefepime, azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   -          Following culture data
   .
   #) PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   -          Continuing to monitor mental status, will attempt to lighten
   sedation to further assess, but appears to be responding appropriately
   to commands.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   .
   #) Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleating glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   .
   #) Shock: Resolved
   #) Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   #)Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with a positive toxicology screen for opiates, benzos, and cocaine. He was intubated after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency room. The patient has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure, bilateral pneumothoracies with collapsed right middle and lower lobes, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and leukocytosis. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is currently receiving dialysis. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and further assessments and interventions are planned based on culture data and other test results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory depression due to drug use or aspiration could lead to further respiratory failure. Monitoring ABG values and ensuring adequate ventilation and oxygenation is crucial.
2. Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated CK levels indicate ongoing muscle breakdown. Continued dialysis may be necessary to treat rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia. Monitoring urine output and electrolyte balance is essential.
3. Infection: Given the patient's leukocytosis and positive sputum culture, there is a risk of infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the need for speciation and continuation of antibiotics will depend on culture data.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   #) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This has been felt to likely
   secondary to respiratory depression in setting of drugs use (toxicology
   screen positive for cocaine, benzos, opoids) versus aspiration from
   being down. Patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of
   right middle and lower lobes and b/l effusions.
   - Given infiltrates on exam, patient had been switched over to
   ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net. We have been weaning his
   oxygen as tolerated. His ABG
s have been satisfactory.
   - Patient was agitated, SBT going well this AM. Might need to rapidly
   taper sedation and extubate if he continues to do well.
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance.Self d/c'd
   left chest tube
   - Sputum culture with gram positive cocci, will follow up speciation.
   - Given patient was found down, history of drug use, was on pressors,
   will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for another day ( Cefepime,
   vanco, and azithromycin), and plan to narrow tomorrow pending further
   culture data
   - Versed and fentanyl for sedation, weaning well.
   #) Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine, but he is unlikely to make enough to correct his
   fluid balance in the next few days. His electrolytes today are WNL.
   Will likely receive ultrafiltrate today to remove fluid.
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures have been measured and do not require intervention,
   continuing to monitor, Ortho signing off, will call with issues prn.
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   #) Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission,
   now normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   (Lungs with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -          Continue broad spectrum coverage for next 24 hours Vanco,
   cefepime, azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   -          Following culture data
   .
   #) PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   -          Continuing to monitor mental status, will attempt to lighten
   sedation to further assess, but appears to be responding appropriately
   to commands.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   .
   #) Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleating glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   .
   #) Shock: Resolved
   #) Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   #)Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with a toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine. He experienced respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and was intubated after a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency room. The patient is currently in the ICU and showing signs of improvement, including responding to commands and starting to make urine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely secondary to respiratory depression caused by drug use or aspiration. He has been placed on ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net and his ABG values have been satisfactory. The plan is to continue weaning his oxygen as tolerated.
2) Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: The patient was found to have significantly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels on admission, which have now trended down. His initial creatinine was 4.5, with a potassium level over 7. He is being treated with dialysis for rhabdo and hyperkalemia, as well as volume management. The patient has started to make urine, but is unlikely to correct his fluid balance in the next few days.
3) Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count was initially elevated, possibly due to acute stress or infection (aspiration pneumonia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: This has been felt to likely secondary
   to respiratory depression in setting of drugs use (toxicology screen
   positive for cocaine, benzos, opoids) versus aspiration from being
   down. Patient also has bilateral pneumothoracies with collapse of right
   middle and lower lobes and b/l effusions.
   - Given infiltrates on exam, patient had been switched over to
   ventilator settings consistent with ARDS net. We have been weaning his
   oxygen as tolerated. His ABG
s have been satisfactory.
   - Patient was agitated, so SBT was not tolerated, will try again to
   change to pressure support and another SBT.
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance.
   - Thick sputum today, Sputum culture with gram positive cocci, will
   follow up speciation.
   - Given patient was found down, history of drug use, was on pressors,
   will continue broad spectrum antibiotics for another day ( Cefepime,
   vanco, and azithromycin), and plan to narrow tomorrow pending further
   culture data
   - Versed and fentanyl for sedation, weaning as tolerated.
   - Will try to extubate today as tolerating SBT well today
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine, but he is unlikely to make enough to correct his
   fluid balance in the next few days. His electrolytes today are WNL.
   - No HD today
   - Plan for tunneled line given projected course
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures have been measured and do not require intervention,
   continuing to monitor, Ortho signing off, will call with issues prn.
   - Discontinue clindamycin, very unlikely Necrotizing faciitis.
   Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission, now
   normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection (Lungs
   with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -  Continue broad spectrum coverage for next 24 hours Vanco, cefepime,
   azithromycin until Speciation is done.
   -  Following culture data
   PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   -  Continuing to monitor mental status, will attempt to lighten
   sedation to further assess, but appears to be responding appropriately
   to commands.
   Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleating glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   Shock: Resolved
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will
   need right femoral HD line removed soon, as this was exchanged over
   initial line placed on night of admission. Further HD access will be
   determined by how patient does over weekend and anticipated need for
   further dialysis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient now extubted ([**11-9**]). Patient
   has persistent bilateral pneumothoracies  with DART on left side with
   reexpansion of lung and chest tube on left.
   - Hypoxic overnight, improved with nasal trumpet
   - Chest tubes x2, IP following. Yesterday self discontinued left side
   with worsening of PTX, put in DART with resoluation.
   - Staph aureus from sputum culture Pan sensitive. Got vanc x 7 days,
   will discontinue antibiotics, vanc still in system until HD tomorrow.
   Will give a dose of levoflox if gets dialyzed tday.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down. Creatinine increasing quickly
   without dialysis.  His rhabo was felt to be secondary to possible
   compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   - Plan for tunneled line given projected course, in for one, will call
   IR first thing in AM to ensure that he gets this early([**Numeric Identifier 1728**])
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures low, no [**Doctor First Name 91**]. Ortho signed off.
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection (Lungs with aspiration
   pneumonia, left leg)
   -  as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 6 days of
   vanco, 7^th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
   PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
   Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
   Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   Shock: Resolved
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, left radial aline. In for new tunneled HD cath
   for future HD.

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with a toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine. He presented with respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency room. The patient was intubated and received dialysis. He has since been extubated but continues to have bilateral pneumothoracies with a Dart on the left side. He also has chest tubes in place. The patient's condition is being managed for hypercarbic respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis/acute renal failure, leukocytosis, PEA arrest, anemia, transaminitis, shock, substance abuse, and access for hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient has persistent bilateral pneumothoracies despite the placement of a Dart on the left side. There is a risk of recurrence or worsening of the pneumothorax.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised due to rhabdomyolysis and requires ongoing dialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
3. Infection: The patient has an increased white blood cell count, suggesting an infection. The sputum culture revealed Staphylococcus aureus, which is sensitive to vancomycin. There is a risk of developing"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   #) Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Now extubated and doing well but
   still very lethargic
   - Bilateral chest tubes: Given concern that right tube may be near lung
   [**Last Name (LF) 1683**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] leave in place until after extubation. Right
   to sunction, left to water seal. Appreciate IP assistance. Needed to
   replace left chest tube for enlarged PTX after tube was self-d/c'd
   #) Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 44,140. His initial creatinine
   was 4.5, with a potassium over 7. His rhabo was felt to be secondary to
   possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   Necrotizing faciitis was also a consideration, but CT of his leg was
   not consistent with this. It was felt that his large right thigh could
   be secondary to possible trauma.
   -  Will continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state. It is encouraging that patient has
   started to make urine.
   #) Leukocytosis: On admission, WBC was 25 with 10% bands on admission,
   now normalized. Could be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   (Lungs with aspiration pneumonia, left leg)
   -          Vanco, d/c cefepime, azithromycin with pan sensitive Staph
   #) PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He is status post
   Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed. A transthoracic
   echocardiogram demonstrated global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**]
   months.  Transaminitis could also be effect of shock liver from PEA
   arrest.
   #) Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning, but
   will re-check DIC labs, PM HCT, B12/Folate, iron studies, and guaiac
   stools.
   #) Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C.
   #) Shock: Resolved
   #) Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   #)Access: left Subclavian, Rt femoral HD line, left radial aline. Will

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found unresponsive with a toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine. He had respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency room. The patient was intubated and received treatment for various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but has now been extubated. He remains lethargic and may require further respiratory support.
2. Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially had extremely high levels of creatine kinase (CK) and elevated creatinine, indicating kidney damage. He is currently receiving dialysis to manage rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia, and his urine output has improved.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient had an elevated white blood cell count on admission, which has since normalized. This could be due to acute stress or an underlying infection.
4. PEA Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest likely caused by hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia. He received therapeutic cooling and an echocardiogram showed global hypoperfusion. Further evaluation is needed.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has decreased, indicating a possible ongoing bleeding or hem"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient now extubted ([**11-9**]). Patient
   has persistent bilateral pneumothoracies  with DART on left side with
   reexpansion of lung and chest tube on left.
   - Hypoxic overnight, improved with nasal trumpet
   - Chest tubes x2, IP following. Yesterday self discontinued left side
   with worsening of PTX, put in DART with resoluation.
   - Staph aureus from sputum culture Pan sensitive. Got vanc x 7 days,
   will discontinue antibiotics, vanc still in system until HD tomorrow.
   Will give a dose of levoflox if gets dialyzed tday.
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down. Creatinine increasing quickly
   without dialysis.  His rhabo was felt to be secondary to possible
   compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   - Plan for tunneled line given projected course, in for one, will call
   IR first thing in AM to ensure that he gets this early([**Numeric Identifier 1728**])
   - Appreciate orthopedic surgery input for possible compartment
   syndrome
pressures low, no [**Doctor First Name 91**]. Ortho signed off.
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection (Lungs with aspiration
   pneumonia, left leg)
   -  as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 6 days of
   vanco, 7th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
    PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
    Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
    Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
    Shock: Resolved
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine. He had respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency room. The patient was intubated and received dialysis. He is now extubated but has persistent bilateral pneumothoracies with a drain on the left side. The patient also has staphylococcus aureus infection in his sputum culture, which is pan-sensitive. He has been treated with vancomycin for 6 days and will continue with another day of antibiotics. The patient's rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure are being managed with ongoing dialysis. He has leukocytosis, anemia, transaminitis, and a history of substance abuse. The patient's condition is stable, but he requires ongoing ICU care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient has persistent bilateral pneumothoracies with a drain on the left side. There is a risk of recurrence or worsening of the pneumothorax if the drain becomes dislodged or if there are any complications related to the chest tube.
2. Infection: The patient has a staphylococcus aureus infection in his sputum culture, which is pan-sensitive. There is a"

   - Getting IR guided tunneled line today
   - HD today
   Hypertension: Has been trending high since last HD. Likely volume
   related. Planned to get dialyzed today, but in the interim, will treat
   with IV hydralazine PRN
   Altered Mental Status: Likely still has sedation on board, since has
   not been dialyzed since Saturday. Also contributing is uremia.
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection (Lungs with aspiration
   pneumonia, left leg)
   -  as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 7 days of
   vanco, 7th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
    PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
    Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
    Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure,  intubated
   after PEA arrest in emergency room, extubated [**11-9**], with respiratory
   alkalosis.
   Respiratory alkalosis: extubted ([**11-9**]). Patient has persistent
   bilateral pneumothoracies with DART on left side with reexpansion of
   lung. s/p chest tube on right, discontinued on [**11-11**]. Now hypoxic, 94%
   on 5L NC. Concern for possible pna in setting of low grade temp, vs.
   aspiration.
   - chest CT today without contrast.
   -sputum cx.
   - Staph aureus from sputum culture Pan sensitive. Got vanc x 7 days
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 28,000. His rhabdo was felt to
   be secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or
   prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   -follow left lower extremity clinically. If increasing pain re-consult
   ortho to assess for compartment syndrome.
   Hypertension:. Likely volume related. Planned to get dialyzed today,
   but in the interim, will treat with IV hydralazine PRN
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   -as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 7 days of vanco,
   7th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
   -resend sputum cx, urine cx, blood cx.
   PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
    Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
   Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, left radial aline. In for new tunneled HD cath
   for future HD.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine. He presented with respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency room. The patient was intubated, extubated on 11-9, and had persistent bilateral pneumothoraces with a DART on the left side. A chest tube was placed on the right and discontinued on 11-11. The patient is now hypoxic at 94% on 5L NC, and there is concern for possible pneumonia in the setting of low-grade fever versus aspiration. A chest CT without contrast has been ordered today, along with sputum cultures.

The patient has been diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, with initial creatine kinase (CK) levels of 206,000, which are now trending down to 28,000. The rhabdomyolysis was believed to be secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. The plan is to continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, and to monitor urine output. If increasing pain is observed, reconsult orthopedics should be considered to assess for compartment syndrome.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and
   intubated after PEA arrest in emergency room, now with following simple
   commands and starting to make urine.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient now extubted ([**11-9**]). Patient
   has persistent bilateral pneumothoracies with DART on left side with
   reexpansion of lung and chest tube on left.
   - Patient satting well, weaned fro 40% to 4L NC overnight.
   - Chest tubes x2, IP following. Right chest tube to water seal, can
   likely pull today. Left still on wall suction.
   - Staph aureus from sputum culture Pan sensitive. Got vanc x 7 days
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down. His rhabdo was felt to be
   secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or
   prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   - Getting IR guided tunneled line today
   - HD today
   Hypertension: Has been trending high since last HD. Likely volume
   related. Planned to get dialyzed today, but in the interim, will treat
   with IV hydralazine PRN
   Altered Mental Status: Likely still has sedation on board, since has
   not been dialyzed since Saturday. Also contributing is uremia.
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection (Lungs with aspiration
   pneumonia, left leg)
   -  as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 7 days of
   vanco, 7th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
    PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
    Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
    Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
    Shock: Resolved
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
   Access: left Subclavian, left radial aline. In for new tunneled HD cath
   for future HD.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with a toxicology screen positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine. He presented with respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency room. The patient is currently in the ICU with several ongoing medical complications.

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated after experiencing respiratory depression and was extubated on 11/9. He has persistent bilateral pneumothoracies with a DART on the left side, and the right chest tube is expected to be pulled today.

2. Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: The patient had a very high creatine kinase (CK) level of 206,000 on admission, which is now trending down. This indicates ongoing muscle breakdown. The rhabdomyolysis is believed to be secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. The patient will continue with dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, and volume state.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been trending high since the last hemodialysis session. This is likely volume-related. To manage this, the patient will be treated with intravenous hydralazine as needed.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient"

   1. Compared to the CT of [**2177-11-4**], there is interval essential
   resolution of
   bilateral pneumothoraces. Tiny left pleural effusion is seen. Presumed
   left
   apical DART catheter terminates in the subcutaneous soft tissues.
   2. Ill-defined ground-glass and peribronchiolar opacities in the right
   upper
   lobe are decreased in number and extensiveness, consistent with
   improving
   inflammatory or infectious process. Few opacities in the left upper and
   left
   lower lobe, which may have been present previously but are difficult to
   compare due to previously collapsed left lower lobe.
   3. Subsegmental atelectasis persists in the reexpanded left lower
   lobe.
   There is mucous plugging of the bronchus intermedius on the right, with
   continued collapse of the right lower lobe and new partial atelectasis
   of the
   right middle lobe.
   4. New pneumomediastinum.
   5. Dialysis catheter terminating in the region of the inferior
   cavoatrial
   junction.

   after PEA arrest in emergency room, extubated [**11-9**], with respiratory
   alkalosis.
   Respiratory alkalosis: extubted ([**11-9**]). Patient has persistent
   bilateral pneumothoracies with DART on left side with reexpansion of
   lung. s/p chest tube on right, discontinued on [**11-11**]. Now hypoxic, 94%
   on 5L NC. Concern for possible pna in setting of low grade temp, vs.
   aspiration.
   - chest CT today without contrast.
   -sputum cx.
   - Staph aureus from sputum culture Pan sensitive. Got vanc x 7 days
   Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 28,000. His rhabdo was felt to
   be secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or
   prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   -follow left lower extremity clinically. If increasing pain re-consult
   ortho to assess for compartment syndrome.
   Hypertension:. Likely volume related. Planned to get dialyzed today,
   but in the interim, will treat with IV hydralazine PRN
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   -as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 7 days of vanco,
   7th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
   -resend sputum cx, urine cx, blood cx.
   PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
     Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
   Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.

   Imaging: Chest CT [**2177-11-12**]: Provisional Findings Impression: AGLc WED
   [**2177-11-12**] 7:43 PM
   1. Compared to the CT of [**2177-11-4**], there is interval essential
   resolution of
   bilateral pneumothoraces. Tiny left pleural effusion is seen. Presumed
   left
   apical DART catheter terminates in the subcutaneous soft tissues.
   2. Ill-defined ground-glass and peribronchiolar opacities in the right
   upper
   lobe are decreased in number and extensiveness, consistent with
   improving
   inflammatory or infectious process. Few opacities in the left upper and
   left
   lower lobe, which may have been present previously but are difficult to
   compare due to previously collapsed left lower lobe.
   3. Subsegmental atelectasis persists in the reexpanded left lower
   lobe.
   There is mucous plugging of the bronchus intermedius on the right, with
   continued collapse of the right lower lobe and new partial atelectasis
   of the
   right middle lobe.
   4. New pneumomediastinum.
   5. Dialysis catheter terminating in the region of the inferior
   cavoatrial
   junction.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 29 year old male who was found down with toxicology screen
   positive for opiates, benzos, and cocaine with resultant respiratory
   depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure,  intubated
   after PEA arrest in emergency room, extubated [**11-9**], with respiratory
   alkalosis.
   Respiratory status: extubted ([**11-9**]). No longer with respiratory
   alkalosis. b/l pneumothoraces rersolved per chest CT [**2177-11-12**]. Also
   with RML, RLL collapse with right bronchus intermedius mucus plug.
   Still with O2 requirement
   -          f/u sputum cx
   -          Chest PT
    Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: Patient was found to have CK on
   admission 206,000, now trending down to 12,000. His rhabdo was felt to
   be secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or
   prolonged stasis.
   -  Continue dialysis as needed for treatment of rhabdo and
   hyperkalemia, and volume state.
   - making minimal urine
   -follow right lower extremity clinically. Reporting increased pain.
   -ortho following, not concerned
    Hypertension:. Likely volume related. Planned to get dialyzed today,
   but in the interim, will treat with IV hydralazine PRN
   Leukocytosis: WBC 25 with 10% bands on admission, now normalized. Could
   be secondary to acute stress, versus infection
   -as above, sputum with pan sensitive staph aureus, s/p 7 days of vanco,
   7th day [**11-11**], will still be in system since no dialysis today.
   -resend sputum cx, urine cx, blood cx.
   -checking C. diff
   -started flagyl
   PEA Arrest: His arrest was felt to likely be a combination of
   hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and/or acidemia.
   s/p  Arctic Sun cooling system for 24 hours, now re-warmed.
   TTE: global hypoperfusion, will need f/u in [**1-29**] months.
   - f/u TTE in 4 weeks.
     Anemia: Patient
s HCT this morning noted to be 31, down from 35
   yesterday. No active bleeding noted, but with large right thigh, will
   need to continue to monitor for hematoma there or other possible
   bleeding. Has not had evidence of DIC during cooling or re-warning.
   Transaminitis: This is likely secondary to muscle breakdown from
   rhabdo, but also could be from shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, or hepatitis C. He is now s/p 21 hours of NAC for
   repleting glutathione stores, and his LFTs are trending downward.
   Substance abuse: Supportive treatment as above. social work consult
   when he wakes up.
    Access: left Subclavian, left radial aline. In for new tunneled HD
   cath for future HD.
   -DC subclavian line.

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old male who was found down with positive toxicology screens for opiates, benzos, and cocaine. He experienced respiratory depression, acidemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest in the emergency room. The patient was intubated but later extubated on [**11-9**]. He has resolved bilateral pneumothoraces and continues to have oxygen requirements. The patient is also experiencing right lower extremity swelling and pain.

Medical Complications:
1. Rhabdomyolysis/Acute Renal Failure: The patient had a very high creatine kinase (CK) level on admission, which is now trending down. His rhabdomyolysis may be secondary to possible compartment syndrome or seizure activity, or prolonged stasis. The patient requires ongoing dialysis for treatment of rhabdo and hyperkalemia, and volume management.
2. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure is likely volume-related. He will be treated with intravenous hydralazine as needed.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient initially had an elevated white blood cell count with 10% bands on admission, which has now normalized. This could be secondary to acute stress or infection.
4. PEA Arrest: The patient's arrest was likely caused by a combination of hyperkalemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia,"
