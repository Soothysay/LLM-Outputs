 CARDIAC ARREST - At [**2125-2-6**] 07:32 PM
   -patient with ectopy and multiple short runs of torsades throughout the
   day that were self resolving. She got about 8mg Mag. Because of long
   run in the afternoon EP recommended lidocaine bolus and q4mag. Around
   8pm team called to bedside, had broken out of torsades after shock from
   nurses. Patient again degenerated into torsades despite 4mg Mag. This
   time went into Asystole and code blue was called. Patient received
   chest compressions, 1 shock, epi, atropine and was started on lidocaine
   gtt after bolus. She was also intubated and had return of spontaneous
   circulation. Aline was placed by anesthesia and CVL was placed in
   femoral vein. Levophed was started for low BP.
   -EP came and recommended isoproteronal to target HR>80

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   and CVA on warfarin was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes
   after disopyramide initiation and now s/p cardiac arrest in the setting
   of sustained VT.
   s/p Code Blue and Intubation
   Patient had episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and
   now stable on levophed and isoproterenol.
   - continue isoproterenol to target HR > 80 and carvedilol to increase
   membrane stability and decrease PVCs
   - wean levophed
   - obtain repeat ECG
   - will need to pull femoral line and place right IJ or subclavian line
   - wean sedation and extubate as soon as possible after right IJ line
   placement
   Torsades
   Patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is a known
   complication of this medication. Last dose of disopyramide was on [**2-6**]
   AM. Half life of disopyramide is 4-8 hours; so would expect
   disopyramide to be metabolized and at minimal concentrations within 24
   hours of last dose. Patient now back in sinus.
   - daily ECGs
   - continue magnesium q4h
   - continue to hold disopyramide
   - if torsades continues, recommend magnesium push, consideration of
   lidocaine
   - monitor on telemetry
   - appreciate EP recs
   Atrial fibrillation:
   New onset, with rapid ventricular rate, and patient now in sinus. Has
   been asymptomatic.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to afib
   with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease:
   This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO. patient needs MV
   replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They will do this
   pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**] but will be delayed in the acute
   setting.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: Patient has a history of hypertension, although currently on
   levophed after the cardiac arrest.
   - holding anti-hypertensives
   - will restart anti-hypertensives as needed
   - wean levophed
   Fluid overload: Likely secondary to MVR. got lasix earlier this
   admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO
   - lasix as needed
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now
   Glycemic Control: Regular insulin sliding scale
   Lines:  Right femoral line
   - will pull femoral line and place right subclavian line
   Prophylaxis:
   DVT: (Systemic anticoagulation: Heparin gtt)

","The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CVA who was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes after disopyramide initiation. She experienced a cardiac arrest in the setting of sustained VT and is now stable on levophed and isoproterenol. 

The patient had an episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and is currently stable. She is also experiencing new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has been asymptomatic so far. 

The patient has a history of rheumatic heart disease, diagnosed on this admission via echo, and requires MV replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. She is currently on heparin gtt and pending preop workup, including breast biopsy and cardiac catheterization. 

The patient also has a breast mass as seen on recent mammogram, for which a biopsy is planned. Additionally, she has a history of CVA and is currently on heparin gtt instead of warfarin. 

Other medical conditions include type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and fluid overload, likely secondary to mitral valve replacement. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's labs show"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   another episode of TdP last night, re-loaded with magnesium, and
   started on Isuprel.  This morning, she is intubated, but no further
   arrhythmia overnight.  QTc still ~540 ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] 90
   Physical Examination
   Intubated, sedated, responsive
   Loud MR murmur at apex
   Lungs clear
   No edema
   Warm extremities
   Medical Decision Making
   - femoral line out, place RIK triple-lumen
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**]
   - continue MgSO4 and Isuprel
   - wean off norepinephrine
   - extubate later today
   - breast biopsy, and (if negative for CA), cath for preop MVR/TV repair
   - eventually

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient experienced a cardiac arrest at 07:32 PM and was successfully resuscitated. The patient had ongoing episodes of ectopy and short runs of torsades throughout the day. A magnesium bolus was given, and later an EP recommended a lidocaine bolus and continuous infusion. Despite this, the patient again degenerated into torsades and went into asystole, prompting a code blue. The patient received chest compressions, one shock, epinephrine, atropine, and was intubated. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved, and the patient was started on lidocaine infusion. A central venous line (CVL) was placed in the femoral vein, and levophed was initiated for low blood pressure.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has arterial and multi-lumen lines in place. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is currently sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (15.0 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin level (12.4 g/dL), normal potassium levels (3.6 mEq/L), low magnesium level (1.5 mg/dL), slightly low sodium level (138 mEq/L), and normal glucose"

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with h/o DM2, HTN, HL, CVA on warfarin with new onset
   atrial fibrillation, started on disopyramide with torsades this morning
   Torsades: patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is
   a known complication of this medication. Patient back in sinus with
   magnesium. Half life of disopyramide is 4.5-8 hours, but this may be
   delayed given the patients renal failure
   - discontinue disopyramide
   - give magnesiun as needed for torsades
   - if torsades continues despite magnesium, shock if unstable, overdrive
   pace at 100 if stable.
   - monitor on telemetry
   Atrial fibrillation: new onset, with rapid ventricular rate, patient
   now in sinus. Has been asymptomatic. some pulmonary edema on admission.
   History of hypothyroidism, on replacement, TSH normal in [**2124-10-23**]. No
   excessive alcohol or caffeine.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to
   afib with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease: This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO.
   patient needs MV replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They
   will do this pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**], but may have to be delayed given
   torsades.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: currently slightly hypertensive 140/96. will monitor for now.
   Fluid overload: Likely secondary to MVR. got lasix earlier this
   admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO
   - lasix as needed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and rheumatic heart disease. She was admitted for new onset atrial fibrillation and pulmonary edema. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest due to torsades de pointes, a type of ventricular tachycardia, which was unresponsive to magnesium and required defibrillation. She was resuscitated and intubated, with return of spontaneous circulation. The patient has been on invasive ventilation and has had arterial and multi-lumen lines placed. She is currently being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Torsades de pointes: The patient experienced a life-threatening arrhythmia that required resuscitation. It is important to monitor her cardiac rhythm and continue with appropriate antiarrhythmic management.
2. Hypotension: The patient has low blood pressure requiring Levophed support. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and adjustment of medications and fluids are necessary.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.1 to 1.5, indicating possible renal failure. Renal labs should be trended, and medications should be dosed appropriately considering the renal function.
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient's diabetes needs to be managed with insulin sliding scale due to the hold on oral hypoglycemics.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation and was started on disopyramide, which led to episodes of torsades de pointes. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, received cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and was intubated. She has been placed on mechanical ventilation and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Torsades de pointes: The patient's episodes of torsades de pointes indicate a risk for recurrent life-threatening arrhythmias. Close monitoring on telemetry is necessary, and magnesium may be administered as needed.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response needs to be controlled, and rate-lowering medications like metoprolol or diltiazem should be used as needed.
3. Renal failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 1.5, indicating renal dysfunction. Renal labs should be trended, and medications should be adjusted accordingly based on renal function.
4. Rheumatic heart disease: The patient requires mitral valve replacement and tricuspid repair due to rheumatic heart disease. Cardiac surgery is planned pending preoperative workup, including a breast biopsy.
5. Breast mass: A breast biopsy is needed for the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation and was started on disopyramide, which resulted in torsades de pointes. She experienced a cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. She is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of rheumatic heart disease and is awaiting mitral valve replacement and tricuspid repair surgery. She also has a breast mass that requires biopsy. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits. She is on multiple medications, including heparin, fentanyl, norepinephrine, midazolam, isuprel, and insulin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous cerebrovascular accident. She was admitted to the ICU due to cardiac arrest, which occurred after experiencing torsades de pointes, a type of abnormal heart rhythm. The patient underwent resuscitation, including chest compressions, defibrillation, administration of epinephrine and atropine, and intubation. She was successfully resuscitated and returned to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Torsades de pointes: The patient experienced multiple episodes of torsades de pointes, a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia that can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Continuous monitoring of the heart rhythm is essential to detect any further episodes. If torsades de pointes recurs, additional interventions such as magnesium supplementation, overdrive pacing, or defibrillation may be required.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Carvedilol, a beta-blocker, has been initiated to control the heart rate. Frequent monitoring of the heart rate and electrolyte imbalances is necessary to prevent further complications. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin will be continued until the breast biopsy and planned cardiac catheterization procedures are organized or completed.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   and CVA on warfarin was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes
   after disopyramide initiation and now s/p cardiac arrest in the setting
   of sustained VT.
   s/p Code Blue and Intubation
   Patient had episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and
   now stable on levophed and isoproterenol.
   - continue isoproterenol to target HR > 80 and carvedilol to increase
   membrane stability and decrease PVCs
   - wean levophed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on warfarin. She was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes after initiation of disopyramide and now experienced cardiac arrest in the setting of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Torsades de pointes: The patient had an episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and is now stable on levophed and isoproterenol. The plan is to continue isoproterenol to target a heart rate >80 bpm and carvedilol to increase membrane stability and decrease premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Levophed weaning should be considered, and a repeat ECG should be obtained.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. She is now in sinus rhythm and asymptomatic. Telemetry monitoring, continued carvedilol, and heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cardiac catheterization and mitral valve replacement (MVR) are recommended. Hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done, and IV metoprolol or diltiazem can be used as needed for rapid rates.

   Doing much better.  No further TdP.  WEnt back into an atrial
   arrhythmia.  Afib--> atrial tachycardia.  Slightly volume o/l, diuresed
   with improvement in oxygenation.  Slightly nauseous today, o/w feels
   well.
   Physical Examination
   Bibasilar crackles
   Regular tachycardia
   MR murmur
   No edema
   Medical Decision Making
   - Breast biopsy in the next 24 hours
   - Eventual inpatient coronary angiography unless has BrCA with poor
   prognosis
   - titrate beta blockers up as tolerated for AT
   - diurese gently, as BP allows
    -eventual plans for MVR+/-CABG+AF surgery

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CVA on warfarin. She was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes after disopyramide initiation and experienced cardiac arrest due to sustained VT. She underwent resuscitation and intubation. She is now extubated, and her condition is improving. She has atrial fibrillation with high heart rates, and her medications have been adjusted accordingly. She also has rheumatic heart disease with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation, and cardiac surgery is being considered. Additionally, she has a breast mass that requires a biopsy, and she has a history of CVA and diabetes mellitus type 2. She is currently being managed for fluid overload, and her ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with high heart rates: The patient's heart rate is still elevated, which can lead to complications such as poor tissue perfusion and cardiac ischemia.
2. Fluid overload: The patient is volume overloaded, which can increase the risk of congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema.
3. Breast mass: The presence of a breast mass requires further evaluation to determine if it is malignant or benign. If it is determined to be malignant, the patient may"

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   and CVA on warfarin was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes
   after disopyramide initiation and now s/p cardiac arrest in the setting
   of sustained VT.
   s/p Code Blue and Intubation
   Patient had episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and
   now stable on levophed and isoproterenol.
   - continue isoproterenol to target HR > 80 and carvedilol to increase
   membrane stability and decrease PVCs
   - wean levophed
   - obtain repeat ECG
   - will need to pull femoral line and place right IJ or subclavian line
   - wean sedation and extubate as soon as possible after right IJ line
   placement
   Torsades
   Patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is a known
   complication of this medication. Last dose of disopyramide was on [**2-6**]
   AM. Half life of disopyramide is 4-8 hours; so would expect
   disopyramide to be metabolized and at minimal concentrations within 24
   hours of last dose. Patient now back in sinus.
   - daily ECGs
   - continue magnesium q4h
   - continue to hold disopyramide
   - if torsades continues, recommend magnesium push, consideration of
   lidocaine
   - monitor on telemetry
   - appreciate EP recs
   Atrial fibrillation:
   New onset, with rapid ventricular rate, and patient now in sinus. Has
   been asymptomatic.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to afib
   with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease:
   This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO. patient needs MV
   replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They will do this
   pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**] but will be delayed in the acute
   setting.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: Patient has a history of hypertension, although currently on
   levophed after the cardiac arrest.
   - holding anti-hypertensives
   - will restart anti-hypertensives as needed
   - wean levophed
   Fluid overload: Likely secondary to MVR. got lasix earlier this
   admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO
   - lasix as needed
   - consider repeat echo

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on warfarin. She was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes after initiation of disopyramide and now survived a cardiac arrest in the setting of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient had an episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and was stable on levophed and isoproterenol.

Medical Complications:
1. Torsades de pointes: The patient started on disopyramide, which is known to cause torsades as a complication. The last dose of disopyramide was on [**2-6**] AM. The half-life of disopyramide is 4-8 hours, so it would be expected to be metabolized and at minimal concentrations within 24 hours of the last dose. The patient is now back in sinus rhythm.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. She has been asymptomatic, but it needs to be monitored closely.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased from baseline of 1.1 to 1.5, likely due to poor forward flow secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate"

The note details the patient's health progress over time, including events that occurred on 02/07/2125. The patient has a history of mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, breast mass, and sustained ventricular tachycardia.

The patient was weaned off levophed and had increased ectopy, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) around noon, followed by sustained ventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a heart rate of 160s down to 130s, consistent with atrial fibrillation/flutter. Isoproterenol was stopped, and the patient was started on metoprolol at a dose of 12.5 mcg IV every 12 hours, which was later uptitrated to 25 mcg TID as blood pressure tolerated. The patient was also extubated, discontinued magnesium sulfate, and decreased oxygen saturation with evidence of volume overload on examination and chest X-ray. Lasix 20 IV was given with decreased O2 requirement.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) after experiencing torsade de pointes due to initiation of disopyramide and subsequently had a cardiac arrest caused by sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient was resuscitated and intubated but was later extubated.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Torsades de pointes: This is a type of abnormal heart rhythm that can lead to serious complications. The patient is currently on disopyrimide washout and being closely monitored with telemetry and hospital pads. QT prolonging agents are being avoided, and magnesium levels are being kept at high normal levels.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has an increased heart rate, and her metoprolol dosage has been uptitrated as tolerated. Digoxin therapy is being considered if the heart rate remains high. Anticoagulation is being held in anticipation of procedures, and possible pulmonary isolation and maze procedure during surgery are being considered.

3. Rheumatic Heart Disease: The patient has significant mitral regurgitation (4+ MR) and tricuspid regurgitation (3+ TR). Cardiac surgery is following up on this condition, and it is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on warfarin. She was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) with torsade de pointes after the initiation of disopyramide and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest due to sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), rheumatic heart disease with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR), and breast calcifications. She is currently on multiple medications including metoprolol, digoxin, and Lasix. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she requires close monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient has experienced torsade de pointes and cardiac arrest due to sustained VT. Close monitoring and avoidance of QT prolonging agents are necessary.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of AF, which is currently uncontrolled. Titration of metoprolol, addition of digoxin, and possible pulmonary isolation and maze procedure during surgery may be required.
3. Rheumatic heart disease with moderate-to-severe MR: The patient's dilated left atrium and presence of CHF and AF warrant valve repair. Anticipation of CT surgery, need for catheterization before surgery, and management of CHF are important"

   - hold anticoagulation for anticipation for procedures
   - possible pulm isolation and maze during surgery
   Rheumatic heart disease with 3+MR:
   Dilated left atrium.  Presence of CHF and afib warrents valve repair.
   - Anticipate CT surgery

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Feels better.  Nausea is gone, post-CPR ribcage pain also better.  No
   dyspnea or precordial pain.
   Physical Examination
   JVP flat
   irregular tachycardia, (+)faint MR murmur
   lungs clear
   abdomen nontender
   no pedal edema
   Medical Decision Making
   - breast biopsy today
   - start digoxin for HR control, give small doses of IV diltiazem, as BP
   tolerates
   - tentatively plan for coronary angiography on Monday
   - surgery later next week, or (if hemodynamics stabilize) - as
   outpatient in the very near future
   - resume IV heparin following biopsy
   - no warfarin for now given upcoming procedures

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on warfarin. She was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes after disopyramide initiation and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest due to sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). 

The patient's current condition is stable, with no symptoms of shortness of breath or chest pain. However, she has mild to moderate chest pain from chest compressions. 

The patient underwent a breast biopsy and received vitamin K for an elevated INR of 2.5. She is also taking metoprolol for rapid atrial fibrillation (AF) and digoxin for rate control. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 125 bpm with AF rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 109/58 mmHg to 83/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's lungs are clear, and her abdomen is non-tender. There is no pedal edema or jugular venous distention (JVD). 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and elevated platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation (AFib). She underwent a breast biopsy and received diltiazem for rate control. The patient has a history of mitral regurgitation (MR) and is currently experiencing acute renal failure (ARF). She also has ventricular tachycardia, which is sustained. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/58 mmHg to 119/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature of 36.7°C.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her creatinine levels are slightly elevated, and her glucose level is within normal range. Other lab values, such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, lactic acid, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. This could lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, potentially causing complications like hyperkalemia or hypokalemia, acid-base disturbances, and uremia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly woman who was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment. She underwent a breast biopsy and was found to have mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, breast mass, and sustained ventricular tachycardia.

Medical Complications:
1. Mitral Regurgitation (Mitral Insufficiency): This condition occurs when the mitral valve does not close properly, causing blood to flow backward into the left atrium when the left ventricle contracts. Symptoms may include shortness of breath, fatigue, and heart palpitations.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): AFib is a type of arrhythmia characterized by rapid and irregular heartbeats. It can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure. Symptoms may include palpitations, dizziness, and fatigue.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): ARF is a sudden loss of kidney function, which can be caused by various factors such as dehydration, infection, or medication side effects. Symptoms may include decreased urine output, swelling, and fatigue.

4. Breast Mass: The presence of a breast mass requires further investigation to determine its nature, such as whether it is benign or malignant. Additional imaging studies or a biopsy may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

5. Ventricular Tachycardia, Sustained: Sustained ventricular tachycardia is"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on warfarin. She was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) with torsade de pointes after initiation of disopyramide and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest due to sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient underwent a breast biopsy and is currently being treated for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, rheumatic heart disease with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR), congestive heart failure (CHF), and dilated left atrium. She also has breast calcifications for which a biopsy is planned.

1. Torsades de pointes: The patient experienced torsades de pointes, a type of ventricular tachycardia that can be life-threatening. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and avoid QT prolonging agents.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. This condition can lead to symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and fatigue. It also increases the risk of blood clots and stroke. The patient is currently being treated with medications such as metoprolol and digoxin, but close monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure is necessary.

","The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on warfarin. She was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes after initiation of disopyramide and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest in the setting of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). She has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), rheumatic heart disease with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR), dilated left atrium, congestive heart failure (CHF), and a planned cardiac catheterization on Monday. The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF), breast mass, and rib pain from CPR. She is currently on systemic anticoagulation with heparin, and her code status is full code. The patient's medical plan includes rate control for AF, valve repair, and possibly isolation and maze procedure during surgery, as well as close monitoring for torsades/polymorphic VT, breast calcifications, and diabetes mellitus type 2."

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   and CVA on warfarin was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes
   after disopyramide initiation and now s/p cardiac arrest in the setting
   of sustained VT.
   Atrial fibrillation: rate controlling, still in RVR.
   - continue diltiazem 60mg QID, goal HR <100
   - 250mL NS bolus this morning
   - no longer on Metoprolol
   - cont digoxin
   - cont hep gtt, hold off on starting coumadin since procedures are
   pending
   - possible pulm isolation and maze during surgery
   - would consider starting amiodarone
   Rheumatic heart disease with 3+MR:
   Dilated left atrium.  Presence of CHF and afib warrents valve repair.
   - Anticipate CT surgery
   - plan for cardiac catherization Monday
   - Goal I/O: even
   Torsades/polymorphic VT
s/p asystolic arrest and intubation now
   extubated. Arrythmia  resolved with disopyrimide washing out.
   - avoid QT prolonging agents
   - daily EKG
   - keep magnesium high normal

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CVA who was admitted to the CCU for torsade de pointes after disopyramide initiation and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest in the setting of sustained VT. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease with 3+MR, and torsades/polymorphic VT. The patient underwent a breast biopsy and is awaiting surgery for valve repair. She also has rib pains possibly due to CPR earlier in the week, and there is a need for further evaluation with rib x-rays. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 is being managed with insulin. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 101/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ongoing rate control and need for anticoagulation due to atrial fibrillation indicate the possibility of complications related to this arrhythmia.
2. Rheumatic Heart Disease with 3+MR: The patient's rheumatic heart disease with significant mitral regurgitation warrants valve repair surgery, which carries its own set of potential complications.
3. Torsades/polymorphic VT: The"
