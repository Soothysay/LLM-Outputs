   Microbiology: Blood culture [**7-3**]: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.
   In the setting of hypothermia, tachypnea, elevated lactate, and
   coagulopathy, septic shock is on the differential.  Unclear source at
   this time, with no localizing symptoms.  Unclear how to interpret the
   elevated lactate and coagulopathy in the setting of hepatic failure.
   No old culture data to base abx choice on.  Also may be cardiogenic
   given junctional bradyarrhythmia with elevated cardiac enzymes,
   consistent with a possible inferior MI.  Hypovolemic shock is also on
   the differential, given HCT drop and dry appearance on exam.
   -Right femoral line in place, will give levophed to keep MAPs >65, will
   replace this line for an IJ in the AM
   -Attempted to place A line without success.  Will use non-invasive cuff
   pressures for now and retry later
   -Will cover broadly with vanc, zosyn, and flagyl
   -Blood cultures pending, will send stool for C. diff
   -Three sets of cardiac enzymes for a formal rule-out
   -Will transfuse one unit of pRBCs for HCT drop, and guaiac all stools
   -Echo on Monday to assess RV function/focal wall motion abnormalities
   -No indication for heparin at this time, given systemic coagulopathy.
   Will give PR aspirin
   .
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure shock
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer d50 prn
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.  Admission ABG
   7.55/24/267, likely over-ventilated on 480x14 with a PEEP of 5 and an
   FiO2 of 100%.  Decreased to 7.38/42 with coming down on the tital
   volume
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #. Elevated cardiac enzymes: In the setting of junctional
   bradyarrhythmia, and hypotension, concerned for IMI
   -Spoke with cardiology, no indication for heparin in the setting of
   coagulopathy
   -ASA
   -Follow up cards recs
   -Echo on monday
   .
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, and decreased fibrinogen.
   Likely DIC in the setting of sepsis vs. poor synthetic function from
   hepatic failure
   -Will check fibrin split products
   -Treat underlying sepsis as indicated above
   .
   #. New junctional bradycardia: DDX includes dig toxicity vs. acute MI
   (possibly an inferior MI)
   -S/p digibind in the ED
   -Will cycle enzymes
   -Daily 12 lead
   -Will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin per cardiology recs
   -Holding metoprolol for current hypotension/bradycardia
   .
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure,
   s/p three amps of D50 in the ED, FS now in the 200s
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip vs D50 if continues to be low.
   .
   #. Anemia: baseline HCT 27-29, now 21.  In the setting of a history of
   UGIB
   -We can guaiac all stools
   -Type and cross and transfuse one  units
   -recheck HCT after transfusion
   .
   #. ESRD: On HD MWF
   -Will alert neprhology of the admission

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation/flutter on digoxin. She was found unresponsive at a nursing home with hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has a right femoral line in place. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, AMS, coagulopathy, rhythm abnormalities, hypoglycemia, anemia, ESRD, and a seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be secondary to an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) or septic shock due to an infection. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid resuscitation or vasopressor support is necessary.
2. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient's unresponsiveness could be attributed to reduced cerebral perfusion secondary to hypotension or bradycardia. It is crucial to maintain adequate blood pressure and heart rate to ensure proper brain perfusion.
3. Coagulopathy: The elevated PT, PTT, and INR, along with decreased fibrinogen, indicate a coagulopathy likely secondary to hepatic failure. Administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.
   -No anticoagulation at this time, given coagulopathy
   -Daily full strength asa
   -F/u cards recs
   -Levophed on to keep MAP >65, using non-invasive cuff as we were unable
   to place an A line
   -Will bolus 500cc NS for dry appearing patient with low BP
   -Right femoral line in place
   -Will cover empirically with vanc/zosyn, despite low suspicion for
   infxn given patient
s low reserve.  Vanc will need to be dosed by
   levels.
   -Follow up cultures- blood, c.diff, and sputum
   -AM cortisol +/- [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim test today
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.
   -Check a VBG this AM to evaluate current ventilation/oxygenation and
   adjust prn
   -Attempt to wean sedation and vent settings to extubate as soon as
   possible
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, decreased fibrinogen.  FDP
   normal, likely secondary to hepatic failure rather than DIC
   -Can give FFP and vitamin K for any active bleeds
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia, ?digoxin toxicity s/p digibind in the ED, also may be
   secondary to MI.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   -Holding metoprolol for hypotension, will add it back once her pressure
   is stable.
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with
   current HCT 28.9, and back to her baseline
   -We can guaiac all stools
   -active type and cross

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 72 yr old woman with ESRD, severe right sided
   heart failure and congestive hepatopathy,
   found hypotensive and bradycardic at NH, intubated and transferred with
   pressor requiring shock.

   Hypotension: etiology still unclear whether primary cardiac event with
   hypotensive bradycardic arrest versus sepsis that led to cardiac
   compromise.
        In terms of sepsis: will Rx with Vanco, Zosyn, follow up cultures
   - add on LFTs as she had rising bili at          discharge last time
   but common bile duct stable on admit CT, send stool culture
        Regarding cardiac event: Appreciate cardiology input, continue
   medical management
        Adrenal Insuuficiency: certainly a possibility with low K and
   chronic illness - check cortisol, give   empiric stress dose steroids.
   Resp Failure: due to poor mental status. Able to switch to PSV. Will
   SBT and potential for extubation this afternoon.
   Anemia: likely due to chronic GI blood loss, responded to transfusion
   Renal: alert team - possible HD tommorow

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, atrial fibrillation with flutter on digoxin, and anemia. She was found unresponsive at the nursing home with hypotension and junctional bradycardia. The patient was intubated for airway protection and transferred to the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 98/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. The patient also has coagulopathy with prolonged PT, PTT, and INR, likely secondary to hepatic failure. Other lab findings include elevated white blood cell count, low potassium levels, and elevated troponin T levels, suggesting myocardial injury.

The patient's imaging shows an endotracheal tube extending into the right main stem bronchus, a large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, and a possible small right pleural effusion.

The assessment and plan include hypotension possibly due to an inferior myocardial infarction, hypothermia, elevated lactate levels, and coagulopathy. The patient is being treated with norepine"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy, and
   afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found unresponsive today at her NH,
   with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia,
   elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   .
   #. Hypotension: In the setting of hypothermia, tachypnea, elevated
   lactate, and coagulopathy, septic shock is on the differential.
   Unclear source at this time, with no localizing symptoms.  Unclear how
   to interpret the elevated lactate and coagulopathy in the setting of
   hepatic failure.  No old culture data to base abx choice on.  Also may
   be cardiogenic given junctional bradyarrhythmia with elevated cardiac
   enzymes, consistent with a possible inferior MI.  Hypovolemic shock is
   also on the differential, given HCT drop and dry appearance on exam.
   -Right femoral line in place, will give levophed to keep MAPs >65, will
   replace this line for an IJ in the AM
   -Attempted to place A line without success.  Will use non-invasive cuff
   pressures for now and retry later
   -Will cover broadly with vanc, zosyn, and flagyl
   -Blood cultures pending, will send stool for C. diff
   -Three sets of cardiac enzymes for a formal rule-out
   -Will transfuse one unit of pRBCs for HCT drop, and guaiac all stools
   -Echo on Monday to assess RV function/focal wall motion abnormalities
   -No indication for heparin at this time, given systemic coagulopathy.
   Will give PR aspirin
   .
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure shock
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer d50 prn
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.  Admission ABG
   7.55/24/267, likely over-ventilated on 480x14 with a PEEP of 5 and an
   FiO2 of 100%.  Decreased to 7.38/42 with coming down on the tital
   volume
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #. Elevated cardiac enzymes: In the setting of junctional
   bradyarrhythmia, and hypotension, concerned for IMI
   -Spoke with cardiology, no indication for heparin in the setting of
   coagulopathy
   -ASA
   -Follow up cards recs
   -Echo on monday
   .
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, and decreased fibrinogen.
   Likely DIC in the setting of sepsis vs. poor synthetic function from
   hepatic failure
   -Will check fibrin split products
   -Treat underlying sepsis as indicated above
   .
   #. New junctional bradycardia: DDX includes dig toxicity vs. acute MI
   (possibly an inferior MI)
   -S/p digibind in the ED
   -Will cycle enzymes
   -Daily 12 lead
   -Will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin per cardiology recs
   -Holding metoprolol for current hypotension/bradycardia
   .
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure,
   s/p three amps of D50 in the ED, FS now in the 200s
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip vs D50 if continues to be low.
   .
   #. Anemia: baseline HCT 27-29, now 21.  In the setting of a history of

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms [Known Lastname 4091], a 72-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy, and atrial fibrillation (afib/aflutter) on digoxin, was found unresponsive at her nursing home with new onset junctional bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy. She has been admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which could be due to septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or hypovolemic shock. Further assessment is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

2. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient was found down at the nursing home with hypotension and bradycardia. It is unclear whether this is due to reduced cerebral perfusion, hypoglycemic seizure, or other causes. Treatment for AMS includes treating underlying conditions such as shock, monitoring blood glucose levels, and administering dextrose as needed.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to respiratory failure. Initial ABG showed pH 7.55, likely over-ventilated on a tidal volume of 480 mL with PEEP of 5 and FiO2 of 100%. Ventilation parameters have been adjusted to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient, a 72-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation/flutter on digoxin, was found unresponsive at a nursing home. The patient has been diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and is currently in the ICU.

24-hour events include ruling in for an MI, cardiology consultation with no anticoagulation indicated due to systemic anticoagulation from coagulopathy. The patient has received a transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) to address anemia. Potassium levels remain low, and additional potassium supplementation has been administered. Hypoglycemia was treated with dextrose 50%. The patient is currently on levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65, as an arterial line could not be placed. Empirical coverage with vancomycin and zosyn has been initiated, despite low suspicion for infection. Follow-up cultures have been ordered, including blood, C. difficile, and sputum. An AM cortisol test is planned.

Assessment and Plan:

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy, and hepatic failure. She was found unresponsive at her nursing home, with symptoms including hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate levels, and coagulopathy. The patient has a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, ruling her in for myocardial infarction (MI) with elevated cardiac enzymes. Her hypothermia could be due to an infectious cause, but the elevated lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to her underlying hepatic failure. FDP negative, which supports that disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is unlikely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate a possible inferior MI. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is below normal, which can be caused by an infectious process. This may increase the risk of further infections or complications.
3. Elevated Lactate: High lactate levels suggest inadequate tissue oxygenation and perfusion, which can be secondary to hepatic failure or another underlying condition. It indicates a possible risk for multiorgan dysfunction.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has abnormal coagulation parameters, including elevated PT, PTT, and INR, along with decreased fibrinogen"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.
   -No anticoagulation at this time, given coagulopathy
   -Daily full strength asa
   -F/u cards recs
   -Levophed on to keep MAP >65, using non-invasive cuff as we were unable
   to place an A line
   -Will bolus 500cc NS for dry appearing patient with low BP
   -Right femoral line in place
   -Will cover empirically with vanc/zosyn, despite low suspicion for
   infxn given patient
s low reserve.  Vanc will need to be dosed by
   levels.
   -Follow up cultures- blood, c.diff, and sputum
   -AM cortisol +/- [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim test today
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, decreased fibrinogen.  FDP
   normal, likely secondary to hepatic failure rather than DIC
   -Can give FFP and vitamin K for any active bleeds
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia, ?digoxin toxicity s/p digibind in the ED, also may be
   secondary to MI.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   -Holding metoprolol for hypotension, will add it back once her pressure
   is stable.
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure
   -q2H fingersticks
   -D10 drip
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with
   current HCT 28.9, and back to her baseline
   -We can guaiac all stools
   -active type and cross
   #. ESRD: On HD MWF
   -Will alert neprhology of the admission
   #. Seizure disorder

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 4091], a 72-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation/flutter on digoxin, was found unresponsive today at her nursing home with new-onset junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure raises suspicion for an inferior myocardial infarction (MI). The presence of a junctional rhythm and hypotension further supports this suspicion. Hypothermia may point to a possible infectious cause, while elevated lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic failure. Fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) are negative, suggesting that disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is unlikely.

2. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient was found down at the nursing home with hypotension and bradycardia. Reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting of hypotension or bradycardia could have led to altered mental status, which could be due to shock or hypoglycemic seizure.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT, PTT, and INR levels, along with decreased fibrinogen. This coagulopathy is"

   Ms [**Known lastname 4091**] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD, congestive hepatopathy with
   hepatic failure, and afib/aflutter on digoxin who was found
   unresponsive today at her NH, with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm,
   hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.
   #. Hypotension:  Patient ruled in for MI with enzymes.  Presence of
   junctional rhythm and hypotension raises suspicion for an inferior MI.
   Hypothermia points to a possible infectious cause, however, elevated
   lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic
   failure.  FDP negative, supporting that this is unlikely DIC.   AM
   cortisol in the thirties, so unlikely adrenal insufficiency.
   -No anticoagulation at this time, given coagulopathy
   -Daily full strength asa
   -F/u cards recs
   -Levophed on to keep MAP >65, using non-invasive cuff as we were unable
   to place an A line
   -Right femoral line in place
   -Will cover empirically with vanc/zosyn, despite low suspicion for
   infxn given patient
s low reserve.  Vanc will need to be dosed by
   levels.
   -Follow up cultures- blood, c.diff, and sputum
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: elevated PT, PTT, INR, decreased fibrinogen.  FDP
   normal, likely secondary to hepatic failure rather than DIC
   -Can give FFP and vitamin K for any active bleeds
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia, ?digoxin toxicity s/p digibind in the ED, also may be
   secondary to MI.
   -Monitor on telemetry
   -F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation (afib/aflutter) on digoxin. She was found unresponsive today at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to an inferior myocardial infarction (MI), possibly indicated by the presence of a junctional rhythm and elevated cardiac enzymes. This raises suspicion for an inferior MI. Hypothermia may point to a possible infectious cause, but elevated lactate and coagulopathy are likely secondary to underlying hepatic failure. FDP negative, which supports that disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is unlikely.

2. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient was found down at the nursing home with hypotension and bradycardia, which could have resulted in reduced cerebral perfusion. This could be due to hypotension or bradycardia, or possibly a hypoglycemic seizure. Treatment should include addressing shock, monitoring blood glucose levels every two hours, and administering D10 gtt (dextrose 50% in water) for hypoglycemia.

3. Coagulopathy"

   n        No new lines
   n        No escalation of care
   n        DNR/DNI
   #. Hypotension:  No clear source of infection at this time to suggest
   sepsis. Troponin leak mild, unlikely to represent new event leading to
   cardiogenic shock.
   -- No anticoagulation at this time, given worsening coagulopathy
   -- Daily full strength asa
   -- Levophed on for now, will not restart once weaned.
   -- Right femoral line in place
   -- Contineu to cover empirically with vanc/zosyn, despite low suspicion
   for infxn given patient
s low reserve.  Vanc will need to be dosed by
   levels.
   -Follow up cultures- blood, c.diff, and sputum
   #. AMS: The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and
   bradycardia.  Could have been reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting
   of hypotension or bradycardia, vs hypoglycemic seizure
   -Treat shock as indicated above
   -Will monitor q2H fingersticks and administer D10 gtt
   #. Coagulopathy: Worsening INR, suggesting fulminant hepatic failure.
   #. Rhythm abnormalities: Initial presenting rhythm junctional
   bradycardia,  ddx of digoxin toxicity vs IMI.
   -- s/p digibind in the ED
   -- Monitor on telemetry
   -- F/u cards recs, will discontinue amiodarone and digoxin
   #. Hypoglycemia: chronic and secondary to underlying hepatic failure

   -D10 drip
   #. Anemia: PMH GAVE, HCT 21 on admission, s/p one unit of pRBCs with
   appropriate bump, and back to her baseline
   -- Would hold off on tranfusions
   #. ESRD: On HD MWF
   -- Patient too unstable for HD now, also without significant uremia or
   electrolyte abnormality.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation/aflutter on digoxin. She was found unresponsive today at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy. The goals of care include comfort and minimizing painful procedures, with no new lines or escalation of care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which may be due to sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or other causes. This could lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient's worsening INR indicates fulminant hepatic failure, which increases the risk of bleeding. This could result in internal bleeding or hemorrhage.

3. Rhythm abnormalities: The patient initially presented with junctional bradycardia, and the differential diagnosis includes digoxin toxicity versus intracranial injury. Monitoring on telemetry is recommended, and the discontinuation of amiodarone and digoxin is advised.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient has chronic hypoglycemia secondary to underlying hepatic failure. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels and administration of D10 drip are necessary to prevent further episodes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old female admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. She has been receiving antibiotic therapy and supportive care. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 90/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient is hemodynamically stable on norepinephrine infusion. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,810 mL and output of 518 mL over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to indwelling lines and immunosuppression from multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Hemodynamic instability: Despite being hemodynamically stable at present, there is a potential risk for decompensation and further hypotension.
3. Kidney injury: Elevated serum creatinine levels indicate possible acute kidney injury, which can worsen if fluid balance is not maintained properly.
4. Liver dysfunction: Elevated liver enzymes suggest potential liver dysfunction, which may require close monitoring and intervention if necessary.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is low, indicating a risk of respiratory depression or failure.
6. Coagulopathy: Elevated PT/PTT/INR values indicate a bleeding risk, necessitating careful monitoring of any"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation/flutter on digoxin. The patient was found unresponsive at her nursing home with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy.

The family has been informed about the patient's condition, and a comfort measures-only plan has been initiated. This means that there will be no escalation of care, and the patient will not receive aggressive treatment. The goals include providing pain control with low doses of IV Dilaudid (holding morphine due to renal failure), maintaining comfort measures, and ensuring no active treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent low blood pressure, which may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

2. Bradycardia: The patient's slow heart rate could potentially result in reduced cardiac output and insufficient delivery of oxygen and nutrients to vital organs.

3. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient was found unresponsive, indicating a possible alteration in mental status. This could be due to various factors such as hypotension, bradycardia, or hypoglycemia.

4. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is currently on home ke"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Last Name] is a 72-year-old female with a medical history significant for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive hepatopathy with hepatic failure, and atrial fibrillation/flutter on digoxin. She was found unresponsive today at her nursing home (NH) with a new junctional bradycardic rhythm, hypotension, hypothermia, elevated lactate, and coagulopathy. The family meeting held yesterday emphasized comfort and minimizing painful procedures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis, but no clear source of infection has been identified. There is also a possibility of cardiogenic shock, but the troponin leak is mild and unlikely to represent a new event.
   - No anticoagulation at this time due to worsening coagulopathy.
   - Daily full-strength aspirin.
   - Levophed on for now, will not restart once weaned.
   - Right femoral line in place.
   - Discontinue Vanc/Zosyn, given low suspicion for infection.
   - Follow-up cultures.

2. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient was found down at the NH with hypotension and bradycardia. This could have resulted from reduced cerebral perfusion in the setting of hypotension or bradycardia, or a hypoglycemic"
