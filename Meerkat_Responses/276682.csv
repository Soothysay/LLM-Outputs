","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, who was recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and presented to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with an infectious source and is suspected to have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She is being covered for both community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and PCP with broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and Bactrim. The plan is to await the results of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to guide further treatment. The patient's plateau pressures are not consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and there is no evidence of bleeding which would suggest diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The care team will also evaluate for eosinophilic pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The care team is implementing measures to prevent VAP, such as elevating the head of bed, providing mouth care, and performing daily readiness to extubate (RTU) assessments. 
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness are risk factors for DVT. The patient is receiving prophylactic measures including boots and subcutaneous"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who was recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and returned to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's presentation is concerning for an infectious source, and she is currently being covered with Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. The patient's CD4 count is 900, and her HIV status is unknown. 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 30 breaths per minute, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an oxygen delivery device of an endotracheal tube. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, lactate levels, and lactic acidosis. The patient's creatinine levels have doubled over the past 24 hours, which may suggest renal toxicity or bactrim toxicity as the patient was receiving bactrim. 

The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, PaO2 of 86 mmHg, HCO3- of 22 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, warm skin without rash, and normal neurologic examination.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who was recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and returned to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's presentation is concerning for an infectious source, and her PCP on BAL was negative. The initial BAL eosinophilia has decreased from 12% to 1% on repeat. The patient's plateau pressures are not consistent with ARDS, and there is no evidence of bleeding which would suggest DAH. The cell count now shows a neutrophil predominance. The BAL has been negative on gram stain and clx as have been blood clx. A viral process is possible, and urine legionella was negative. This may be consistent with an acute eosinophilic PNA process.

The patient's lactic acidosis and increased renal failure are concerning. Lactate levels are elevated at 3.7, and creatinine has doubled over the past 24 hours. Possible etiologies include bactrim toxicity or renal toxicity. Bactrim has been stopped, and the physician plans to check vancomycin levels and urine electrolytes and osmolarity. 

The patient is receiving empiric antibiotic coverage as above, with plans to follow up with viral studies. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation will be continued, and a chest CT will be performed to further evaluate the patient's condition.

   CXR today: poor qualitiy, but appears to show significant improvement
   in bilat opacities.
   BAL: notable for 12% eos on first BAL; second with !% eos.
   Assessment and Plan
   41 F with history of asthma (no controller meds) admit to MICU with
   respiratory distress and failure requiring intubation with severe
   pneumonia on CXR and high O2 requirements on vent; now improving
   significantly.
   # Acute pneumonia.  Initiated treatment for pneumonia 2 days PTA with
   azithromycin but did not improve.  widespread pulmonary infiltrates,
   leukocytosis, mildly elevated temps, significant O2 requirement and
   vent support.  Now clinically improving with requirement for less vent
   and oxygenation support and dramatic improvement in chest Xray.
   Consistent with noninfectious cause, also high eosinophil presence on
   BAL fluid suggest AEP.  PCP and legionella negative.
   - Continue steroids (initially on for PCP treatment with bactrim, will
   continue for presumptive diagnosis of AEP.
   - follow BAL cultures.
   - check chest CT today; still with abnormal exam
   - rapid viral insufficient; will resend with ETT aspirate.
   - For now will continue coverage for severe CAP coverage (levoflox +
   cephalosporin and vancomycin).  D/c bactrim, as BAL fluid negative.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Requiring intubation for pneumonia/pneumonitis
   as above.  Initially requiring 80-100% FiO2 and PEEP [**7-24**]; now
   significantly improved and comfortable of [**4-23**] with 0.40 fiO2.
   - Try decrease PEEP to 10 this AM, can go down to 8 if PaO2 tolerates.
   - versed/fent with daily wake up
   - CXR daily
   - VAP precautions.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and failure. She required intubation due to severe pneumonia, but is now showing significant improvement. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.9°F, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/62 to 134/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient has been on various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, famotidine, heparin, and antibiotics such as ceftriaxone, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Bactrim. She is also receiving nutritional support through Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 20 mL/hour and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and hyponatremia. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 218.

Radiology findings show poor quality chest X-ray, but significant improvement in bilateral opacities. BAL fluid analysis reveals a high eosinophil presence, suggesting allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). PC"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 F with history of asthma (no controller meds) admit to MICU with
   respiratory distress and failure requiring intubation with severe
   pneumonia on CXR and high O2 requirements on vent.
   #Community acquired pneumonia.  Initiated treatment for pneumonia 2
   days PTA with azithromycin but did not improve.  Patient with
   widespread pulmonary infiltrates, leukocytosis, mildly elevated temps.
   Significant O2 requirement as below.  Patient with history of asthma,
   no on steroids or other known immunosuppressants; no known risk factors
   for unusual organisms (fungals: histo/blasto, coccidio; PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) 1981**] have
   elevated LDH) though little is known about her history and risk factors
   for these diseases.  Also consider usual CAP organisms, staph,
   legionella.  Noninfectious pneumonia also a possibility (AEP, AIP),
   alveolar hemorrhage less likely given appearance of BAL fluid.
   - BAL for cell count pending.
   - Also checking PCP stain, fungal cultures, AFB, rapid respiratory
   viral, legionella, cytology of BAL.
   - urine legionella Ag.
   - Cover for severe CAP coverage (levoflox + cephalosporin).  Will
   continue vanc in addition empirically until data from BAL returns;
   Bactrim for PCP treatment plus steroids (pred 40 [**Hospital1 **])
   - Monitor hemodynamics, no evidence of hypotension/shock thus far.  If
   so, definitely needs CVL.
   - Collateral info from family.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Requiring intubation.  Now on ARDSnet volumes,
   currently at FiO2 0.7-1.0 and PEEP 8.
   - ARDSnet ventilation.  Increase PEEP (start with 12) and try to
   decrease FiO2.
   - versed/fent
   - CXR daily
   - VAP precautions.
   - Daily wake up.
   .
   # Depression.  continue home prozac dose.

   #Community acquired pneumonia.  Initiated treatment for pneumonia 2
   days PTA with azithromycin but did not improve.  Patient with
   widespread pulmonary infiltrates, leukocytosis, mildly elevated temps.
   Significant O2 requirement as below.  Patient with history of asthma,
   no on steroids or other known immunosuppressants; no known risk factors
   for unusual organisms (fungals: histo/blasto, coccidio; PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) 1981**] have
   elevated LDH) though little is known about her history and risk factors
   for these diseases.  Also consider usual CAP organisms, staph,
   legionella.  Noninfectious pneumonia also a possibility (AEP, AIP),
   alveolar hemorrhage less likely given appearance of BAL fluid.
   - BAL for cell count pending.
   - Also checking PCP stain, fungal cultures, AFB, rapid respiratory
   viral, legionella, cytology of BAL.
   - urine legionella Ag.
   - Cover for severe CAP coverage (levoflox + cephalosporin).  Will
   continue vanc in addition empirically until data from BAL returns;
   Bactrim for PCP treatment plus steroids (pred 40 [**Hospital1 **])
   - Monitor hemodynamics, no evidence of hypotension/shock thus far.  If
   so, definitely needs CVL.
   - Collateral info from family.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Requiring intubation.  Now on ARDSnet volumes,
   currently at FiO2 0.7-1.0 and PEEP 8.
   - ARDSnet ventilation.  Increase PEEP (start with 12) and try to
   decrease FiO2.
   - versed/fent
   - CXR daily
   - VAP precautions.
   - Daily wake up.
   .
   # Depression.  continue home prozac dose.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who was admitted to the MICU with respiratory distress and failure. She required intubation due to severe pneumonia, as indicated by widespread pulmonary infiltrates, leukocytosis, and high oxygen requirements on ventilation. The patient's fever has been persistent, and she has not improved with initial antibiotic therapy. She is currently on ARDSnet volumes and receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management. The patient's condition remains critical, and she requires close monitoring and further diagnostic testing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures are in place to prevent VAP, such as elevating the head of bed, daily wake-up trials, and regular mouth care.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and the presence of widespread pulmonary infiltrates suggest the possibility of ARDS. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
3. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and leukocytosis raise concerns for an ongoing infection, potentially leading to sepsis. Cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
4. Drug-induced side effects: Some medications, particularly sedatives and pain management drugs, may cause respiratory depression or other adverse effects. Monitoring the patient's response to medications is"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo with hx of asthma (by report) who was recently treated for PNA
   with abx and returned to the ED several days later with hypoxemic
   respiratory failure  which based on BAL eosinophilia and rpaid
   radiographic improvement is compatible at least in part with acute
   eosinophilic  PNA with possible superinfection.
    Hypoxemic resp failure: Her presentation is concerning for an
   infectious  source. we do not know her HIV status (although her CD4
   count is 900). Notably, her plateau pressures are not consistent with
   ARDS, there is no evidence of bleeding which would go for DAH, the cell
   count now has a  neutrophil predominance, but initially she had 12%
   eosinophilia which has subsequently decreased to 1% on repeat. BAL has
   been neg on gram stain and clx as have been blood clx, a viral process
   is possible (the Ag was cancelled) and urine legionella was neg. This
   may be consistent with acute eosinophilic PNA process, there does not
   appear to be an infectious component (BAL neg and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]) and her WBC
   conts to rise in the setting of broad spectrum coverage. The Chest CT
   from [**10-24**] shows a dramatic GGO and consolidation pattern in the upper
   lobes predominantly which could be consistent with AEP,PAP and possibly
   some volume overload (increased BNP on admission)
   - Empiric coverage as above
   - F/u viral studies: Ag pending
   - Cont PS ventilation
   - increase methylpred to 125 mg IV q 6h
   - Net neg fluid balance
   - Check IgE (add on to admit)
    Lactic acidosis/Increased renal failure:  improvement in renal
   function and lactate. Will cont to trend.
    ETOH withdrawl: on midazolam, may need CIWA and haldol in the
   extubation setting.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who was recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and returned to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her condition is concerning for an infectious source, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious complications: Given the patient's presentation and history of asthma, there is a possibility of an infectious etiology contributing to her respiratory failure. The note mentions the possibility of acute eosinophilic PNA or a viral process. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, or changes in sputum color and quantity, is essential.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure requires close monitoring of oxygenation parameters, including oxygen saturation (SpO2) and PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Adjustments to ventilator settings may be necessary to optimize gas exchange.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The note mentions improvement in renal function, but the patient's initial laboratory results show elevated serum lactate levels. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is important to prevent or manage AKI.

4. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient is receiving midazolam, which may contribute to ethanol withdrawal symptoms upon extubation. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal, such as agitation, tremors,"

   41 yo with hx of asthma (by report) who was recently treated for PNA
   with abx and returned to the ED several days later with hypoxemic
   respiratory failure  which based on BAL eosinophilia and rpaid
   radiographic improvement is compatible at least in part with acute
   eosinophilic  PNA with possible superinfection.
    Hypoxemic resp failure: Her presentation is concerning for an
   infectious  source. we do not know her HIV status (although her CD4
   count is 900). Notably, her plateau pressures are not consistent with
   ARDS, there is no evidence of bleeding which would go for DAH, the cell
   count now has a  neutrophil predominance, but initially she had 12%
   eosinophilia which has subsequently decreased to 1% on repeat. BAL has
   been neg on gram stain and clx as have been blood clx, a viral process
   is possible (the Ag was cancelled) and urine legionella was neg. This
   may be consistent with acute eosinophilic PNA process, there does not
   appear to be an infectious component (BAL neg and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]) and her WBC
   conts to rise in the setting of broad spectrum coverage. The Chest CT
   from [**10-24**] shows a dramatic GGO and consolidation pattern in the upper
   lobes predominantly which could be consistent with AEP,PAP and possibly
   some volume overload (increased BNP on admission)

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, who was recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and returned to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with acute eosinophilic PNA and possibly a superinfection. Her current condition is concerning for an infectious source. She has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics and is receiving ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing respiratory support indicate a risk of continued respiratory failure.
2. Infectious Complications: The presence of eosinophilia and superinfection suggests a risk of further infectious complications, which could include bacterial, viral, or fungal infections.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output indicate a potential risk of AKI, possibly due to volume overload or sepsis.
4. Eosinophilic Pneumonia: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute eosinophilic PNA, which can be associated with allergic reactions and respiratory distress.
5. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient's history of ETOH use and current sedation with midazolam suggest a risk of withdrawal symptoms upon extubation.
6. Lactic Acidosis/Increased Renal Failure: The patient's initial elevated lactate levels and signs of renal dysfunction require close monitoring and management to prevent worsening of these conditions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who was recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and returned to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's presentation is concerning for an infectious source, although her HIV status is unknown. Her CD4 count is 900. The patient does not exhibit signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The cell count shows an initial eosinophilia of 12% which has decreased to 1% on repeat. BAL, blood cultures, and urine legionella tests have all been negative. The patient's WBC count continues to rise despite broad-spectrum coverage. A chest CT shows a pattern consistent with acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and possible volume overload. 

The patient is currently receiving empiric antibiotic coverage, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation, increased methylprednisolone, and a negative fluid balance. IgE levels are being checked, and follow-up blood cultures are pending. The patient's lactic acidosis and renal function are improving, and she is receiving appropriate ICU care including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who was recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and returned to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's presentation is concerning for an infectious source, and she has been covered with antibiotics (Vanco, CTX, Azithro). Her BAL was negative for PCP, and there is a marked increase in LDH. There is no evidence of bleeding or ARDS, but the cell count shows an initial eosinophilia that has decreased on repeat. The BAL and blood cultures are negative. The patient's lactic acid levels are elevated, and her creatinine has doubled over the past 24 hours, raising suspicion of lactic acidosis and increased renal failure, possibly due to bactrim toxicity or renal toxicity. The bactrim has been stopped, and further investigations are planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute eosinophilic PNA with possible superinfection.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure.
3. Lactic acidosis.
4. Increased renal failure.
5. Potential bactrim toxicity or renal toxicity.
6. Viral process (cancelled sputum analysis).
7. Possible superinfection due to immunocompromised state (unknown HIV status with a CD4 count of 900)."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and failure requiring intubation due to severe pneumonia. She was initially treated with azithromycin but did not improve. The patient now shows significant improvement with reduced ventilator and oxygen support. The chest X-ray also indicates improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Exacerbation of Asthma (AEP): The presence of high eosinophil levels in the BAL fluid suggests a possible diagnosis of AEP. The patient's upper lobe predominance on CT and lack of peripheral eosinophilia support this possibility.

2. Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP): Although the PCP test was negative, it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of PCP infection.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to her prolonged intubation. Daily CXR and VAP precautions will be implemented to minimize this risk.

4. Renal Function: The patient's creatinine levels have shown a significant bump but have improved. Close monitoring of renal function is essential, especially considering the recent use of nephrotoxic drugs.

5. Ethanol Withdrawal: There is a concern for ethanol abuse based on the family's report and imaging findings of chronic pancreatitis. Monitoring for withdrawal symptoms once extubated is crucial.

6. Depression: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and failure. She required intubation due to severe pneumonia, which initially did not respond to azithromycin treatment. The patient's condition has shown significant improvement over time, with decreasing ventilator and oxygen support. Chest X-rays have demonstrated a dramatic improvement as well.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Exacerbation of Asthma (AEP): The patient's history of asthma and the presence of eosinophils in the BAL fluid suggest the possibility of AEP. Steroids have been initiated for presumptive diagnosis of AEP, and follow-up BAL cultures are planned.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): As the patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. VAP precautions have been implemented, and daily chest X-rays will be performed to monitor for any changes.

3. Ethanol Withdrawal: The family reported concern for ethanol withdrawal, which may be associated with chronic pancreatitis seen on CT scan. Close monitoring for symptoms of withdrawal is necessary.

4. Renal Function: There was a significant bump in creatinine levels yesterday, but it has improved. The patient's renal function will need to be closely monitored.

5. Depression: The patient is currently taking home dose of prozac for depression and will continue with this medication.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who was admitted to the MICU with respiratory distress and failure requiring intubation. The patient has severe pneumonia and was initially on high oxygen requirements but is now showing significant improvement. The patient's chest X-ray also shows improvement. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute exacerbation of asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, which can be triggered by infections and may lead to respiratory distress and failure.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia. The patient is currently on ventilatory support, and measures are being taken to prevent VAP.

3. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse, and once extubated and off versed, monitoring for withdrawal symptoms will be necessary.

4. Chronic pancreatitis: Imaging shows evidence of chronic pancreatitis, likely related to the patient's history of alcohol abuse.

5. Renal cyst: A renal ultrasound is recommended to evaluate a complex cyst incidentally found.

6. Depression: The patient is on home prozac for depression, and it should be continued.

7. Fluid overload: The patient has had a significant fluid balance, with a negative balance overnight. Monitoring for fluid overload and adjusting diuretic therapy as needed is important.

8. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required high levels of FiO2 and P"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 F with history of asthma (no controller meds) admit to MICU with
   respiratory distress and failure requiring intubation with severe
   pneumonia on CXR and high O2 requirements on vent; now improving
   significantly.
   # Acute pneumoniaNow clinically improving with requirement for less
   vent and oxygenation support and dramatic improvement in chest Xray.
   Consistent with noninfectious cause, also high eosinophil presence on
   BAL fluid suggest ?AEP.  No peripheral eosinophilia.  Does have upper
   lobe predominance on CT.
   - Continue solumedrol 125 Q6 hours.
   - checking IgE (can be suggestive of AEP), ANCA (? vasculitis)
   - follow final BAL cultures.
   - For now will continue coverage for severe CAP coverage (levoflox +
   cephalosporin and vancomycin).
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Requiring intubation for pneumonia/pneumonitis
   as above.  Initially requiring 80-100% FiO2 and PEEP [**7-24**]; now
   significantly improved and comfortable of [**4-16**] with 0.40 fiO2.  Diuresed
   overnight.
   - Extubate today.
   - Diurese today to optimize pulmonary function
 20 IV lasix now and
   goal negative 1+ liter.
   .
   # Depression.  continue home prozac dose
   # Concern for EtOH abuse.  Per family.  Chronic pancreatitis per
   imaging.  Last drink thought to be [**10-20**] or [**10-21**].
   - Monitor for withdrawal once extubated and off versed.
   # Renal cyst.  Will need followup renal ultrasound to evaluate.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and failure requiring intubation due to severe pneumonia. The patient is now clinically improving with reduced ventilation and oxygenation support, and there has been a significant improvement in the chest X-ray.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Acute Exacerbation of Asthma (AEP): The presence of high eosinophil levels on BAL fluid suggests a possible AEP. This condition can cause respiratory distress and may require additional treatment.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient was intubated and required mechanical ventilation. VAP is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy would be necessary to prevent or treat VAP.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots, which can lead to DVT and potentially PE. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be initiated to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events.

4. Stress ulcers: Critical illness can increase the risk of stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Prophylactic therapy with an H2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor"

   41 yo with hx of asthma (by report) who was recently treated for PNA
   with abx and returned to the ED several days later with hypoxemic
   respiratory failure  which based on BAL eosinophilia and rpaid
   radiographic improvement is compatible at least in part with acute
   eosinophilic  PNA with possible superinfection.
   > Hypoxemic resp failure: Her presentation is concerning for an
   infectious source. we do not know her HIV status (although her CD4
   count is 900). Notably, her plateau pressures are not consistent with
   ARDS, there is no evidence of bleeding which would go for DAH, the cell
   count now has a  neutrophil predominance, but initially she had 12%
   eosinophilia which has subsequently decreased to 1% on repeat. BAL has
   been neg on gram stain and clx as have been blood clx, a viral process
   is possible (the Ag was cancelled) and urine legionella was neg. This
   may be consistent with acute eosinophilic PNA process, there does not
   appear to be an infectious component (BAL neg and PCP neg, viral
   studies neg) and her WBC conts to rise in the setting of broad spectrum
   coverage. The Chest CT from [**10-24**] shows a dramatic GGO and
   consolidation pattern in the upper lobes predominantly which could be
   consistent with AEP,PAP and possibly some volume overload (increased
   BNP on admission), over the last 24 hrs her WHC has improved and she
   has been Afebrile on high dose steroids (125 mg solumedrol q 6h since
   [**10-24**]).  Hopefuil
   -  Will stop Vancomycin today, cont ceftriax/levaquin.
   - Cont PS ventilation: SBT today.
   - increase methylpred to 125 mg IV q 6h  [**10-24**] and will decrease on

   - Let her set I/O
   - Check IgE (add on to admit): pending.
   >ETOH withdrawl / altered: on midazolam, may need CIWA and haldol in

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who was recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and presented to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's CD4 count is 900, but her HIV status is unknown. She has been diagnosed with acute eosinophilic PNA with possible superinfection. The patient's respiratory status has improved with high-dose steroids, and she is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support (PS) ventilation. She has shown improvement in her white blood cell count over the past 24 hours. The chest CT from October 24th shows ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation in the upper lobes, which could be consistent with acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), and possibly some volume overload. The patient's blood cultures, urine Legionella test, and rapid respiratory viral antigen test have all been negative. The patient's condition is critical, and she is currently being managed in the ICU with appropriate prophylactic measures in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's presentation is concerning for an infectious source, and there is no evidence of bleeding which would indicate diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). However, the plateau pressures are not consistent with ARDS. 
2. Drug-Induced Hypersensitivity: The patient's eos"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who was recently treated for pneumonia and presented to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia with possible superinfection. Her current condition is concerning for an infectious source, but further tests are needed to confirm. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and intensive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's presentation suggests an infectious process, and further investigation is necessary to identify the specific pathogen causing her symptoms. Possible complications include sepsis, bacterial superinfection, or viral pneumonia.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure raises concerns for ARDS, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory parameters is essential to prevent or manage ARDS.

3. Lactic Acidosis/Increased Renal Failure: The patient's elevated lactate levels indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and potential lactic acidosis. This condition requires prompt investigation and management to improve renal function and prevent further complications.

4. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient is receiving midazolam for sedation, which may mask symptoms of ethanol withdrawal. Upon extubation, close monitoring for signs of withdrawal is necessary, and appropriate management with CIWA and haloperidol should be considered.

5. Nosocomial Infections:"

   41 yo with hx of asthma (by report) who was recently treated for PNA
   with abx and returned to the ED several days later with hypoxemic
   respiratory failure  which based on BAL eosinophilia and rpaid
   radiographic improvement is compatible at least in part with acute
   eosinophilic  PNA with possible superinfection.
   > Hypoxemic resp failure: Her presentation is concerning for an
   infectious source. we do not know her HIV status (although her CD4
   count is 900). Notably, her plateau pressures are not consistent with
   ARDS, there is no evidence of bleeding which would go for DAH, the cell
   count now has a  neutrophil predominance, but initially she had 12%
   eosinophilia which has subsequently decreased to 1% on repeat. BAL has
   been neg on gram stain and clx as have been blood clx, a viral process
   is possible (the Ag was cancelled) and urine legionella was neg. This
   may be consistent with acute eosinophilic PNA process, there does not
   appear to be an infectious component (BAL neg and PCP neg, viral
   studies neg) and her WBC conts to rise in the setting of broad spectrum
   coverage. The Chest CT from [**10-24**] shows a dramatic GGO and
   consolidation pattern in the upper lobes predominantly which could be
   consistent with AEP,PAP and possibly some volume overload (increased
   BNP on admission), over the last 24 hrs her WHC has improved and she
   has been Afebrile on high dose steroids (125 mg solumedrol q 6h since
   [**10-24**]) and we are going to wean steroids further [**10-26**] as well as abx

   -  D/c ceftriaxone today, cont levaquin (and plan stop tomorrow)
   - Cont PS ventilation: SBT today.
   - Decrease to methylprednisolone 60 mg IV q 6h [**10-26**]
   - Let her set I/O
   - Check IgE (add on to admit): pending.
   - Goal net negative today (500 cc) she seems to be concentrated by labs
   - Hopeful for extubation today.
   >ETOH withdrawl / altered mental: she is less responsive this morning
   then previously although there is no focality to her exam. We will hold
   all sedating medications, would check head CT to r/o any interval
   change, there is no clear metabolic precipitant and we can check a ABG
   to rule out CO2 retention. Sub-clinincal status is also on the
   differential in the setting of her EtOH withdrawl and we can also check
   B12, TSH, RPR.
   - Will trial Haldol prior to extubation. Obtain ECG to check Qt
   - Hopeful for improved for mental status
    Coagulopathy: elevated INR, probably related in some part to cirrhosis
   and nutritional deficiency. We will trial three days of Vitamin K.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old woman with a history of asthma who was recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and returned to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Her presentation is consistent with acute eosinophilic PNA with possible superinfection. She has been on high-dose steroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her white blood cell count continues to rise despite coverage. The chest CT shows a dramatic ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation pattern in the upper lobes predominantly. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The infectious source is still a concern, with initial eosinophilia decreasing to 1% on repeat. BAL has been negative on gram stain and culture, as have been blood cultures. Viral process is possible, and urine Legionella was negative. This may be consistent with acute eosinophilic PNA process. The patient's WBC count has improved, and she has been afebrile on high-dose steroids. Steroids will be weaned further on [10-26], and the antibiotic regimen will be continued.
2. ETOH withdrawal/altered mental status: The patient is less responsive this morning, but there is no focal exam finding. All sedating medications will be held, and a head CT will be done to rule out any interval changes. Sub-clinical status is also on the differential in the setting of her ETOH withdrawal, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who was recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and presented to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's presentation suggests an infectious source, but further testing has ruled out common pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and Legionella.

The patient's condition is concerning for acute eosinophilic PNA with possible superinfection. The initial BAL eosinophilia has decreased from 12% to 1% on repeat, and imaging shows an improving pattern. The patient's plateau pressures are not consistent with ARDS, and there is no evidence of bleeding or other causes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and her white blood cell count (WBC) continues to rise. She has also been on high-dose steroids (125 mg solumedrol q 6h) since October 24th, and the plan is to wean the steroids further on October 26th.

The patient is also being evaluated for ETOH withdrawal/altered mental status, and all sedating medications have been held. A head CT has been ordered to rule out any interval changes. Sub-clinical status is also on the differential, and additional tests including B12, TSH, and RPR will be performed.

The patient's coagulopathy is likely related to cirrhosis and nutritional deficiency"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo with hx of asthma (by report) who was recently treated for PNA
   with abx and returned to the ED several days later with hypoxemic
   respiratory failure  which based on BAL eosinophilia and rpaid
   radiographic improvement is compatible at least in part with acute
   eosinophilic  PNA with possible superinfection.
   > Hypoxemic resp failure: Her presentation is concerning for an
   infectious source. we do not know her HIV status (although her CD4
   count is 900). Notably, her plateau pressures are not consistent with
   ARDS, there is no evidence of bleeding which would go for DAH, the cell
   count now has a  neutrophil predominance, but initially she had 12%
   eosinophilia which has subsequently decreased to 1% on repeat. BAL has
   been neg on gram stain and clx as have been blood clx, a viral process
   is possible (the Ag was cancelled) and urine legionella was neg. This
   may be consistent with acute eosinophilic PNA process, there does not
   appear to be an infectious component (BAL neg and PCP neg, viral
   studies neg) and her WBC conts to rise in the setting of broad spectrum
   coverage. The Chest CT from [**10-24**] shows a dramatic GGO and
   consolidation pattern in the upper lobes predominantly which could be
   consistent with AEP,PAP and possibly some volume overload (increased
   BNP on admission), over the last 24 hrs her WHC has improved and she
   has been Afebrile on high dose steroids (125 mg solumedrol q 6h since
   [**10-24**]).  Hopefuil
   -  Will stop Vancomycin today, cont ceftriax/levaquin.
   - Cont PS ventilation: SBT today.
   - increase methylpred to 125 mg IV q 6h  [**10-24**] and will decrease on
   [**10-26**]
   - Let her set I/O
   - Check IgE (add on to admit): pending.
   >ETOH withdrawl / altered: on midazolam, may need CIWA and haldol in
   the extubation setting as her mental status is likely to be worsened in
   the setting of high dose steroids.
   - Will trial Haldol prior to extubation. Obtain ECG to check Qt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and failure. She required intubation due to severe pneumonia and high oxygen requirements. Currently, she is improving significantly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pneumonia: The patient has severe pneumonia, which is clinically improving. However, there may be a non-infectious cause associated with eosinophilia and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (AEP). Further investigations, such as IgE levels, ANCA testing, and follow-up chest X-rays, are needed.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation for pneumonia and pneumonitis. Her weaning and extubation are limited by secretions and mental status changes. A post-CT head is planned for extubation consideration.

3. Mental Status Changes: The patient is experiencing epilepticus, although no specific findings or hemodynamic changes are observed. A CT head is performed to rule out any bleeding, and other investigations like B12, folate, TSH, and RPR are pending.

4. Ethanol Abuse: The patient has a history of chronic pancreatitis per imaging, and her last drink was either on [**10-20**] or [**10-21**]. Withdrawal symptoms should be monitored once extubated and off versed.

5. Renal Cyst: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 F with history of asthma (no controller meds) admit to MICU with
   respiratory distress and failure requiring intubation with severe
   pneumonia on CXR and high O2 requirements on vent; now improving
   significantly.
   # Acute pneumoniaNow clinically improving with requirement for less
   vent and oxygenation support and dramatic improvement in chest Xray.
   Consistent with noninfectious cause, also high eosinophil presence on
   BAL fluid suggest ?AEP.  No peripheral eosinophilia.  Does have upper
   lobe predominance on CT.
   - Continue solumedrol 125 Q6 hours today.
   - checking IgE (can be suggestive of AEP), ANCA (? vasculitis)
   - follow final BAL cultures.
   - continue coverage with levoflox + cephalosporin; d/c vancomycin.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Requiring intubation for pneumonia/pneumonitis
   as above.  Initially requiring 80-100% FiO2 and PEEP [**7-24**]; now
   significantly improved and comfortable of [**4-16**] with 0.40 fiO2.  Diuresed
   overnight.  Weaning sedation to hopefully allow extubation today.
   - Extubate today if can wean off sedation and secretions manageable.
   SBT.  Give haldol 5 mg x 1 to decrease agitation, may need some
   continued benzos given high EtOH use.
   - Negative 1.8 liters overnight
 should not need further diuresis.
   .
   # Depression.  continue home prozac dose
   # Concern for EtOH abuse.  Per family.  Chronic pancreatitis per
   imaging.  Last drink thought to be [**10-20**] or [**10-21**].
   - Monitor for withdrawal once extubated and off versed.  Benzos prn.
   # Renal cyst.  Will need followup renal ultrasound to evaluate.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, who was admitted to the MICU with respiratory distress and failure requiring intubation. The patient had severe pneumonia on chest X-ray and high oxygen requirements on the ventilator. The patient is now clinically improving, with a requirement for less ventilator support and oxygenation. There is a presence of eosinophils on the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, suggesting a possible allergic eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP). The patient does not have peripheral eosinophilia and has an upper lobe predominance on the CT scan.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with severe pneumonia that required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient is now improving significantly, but further evaluation and management are needed, including final BAL cultures, checking IgE levels, ANCA testing, and continuing coverage with levofloxacin and cephalosporin while discontinuing vancomycin.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation for pneumonia/pneumonitis and initially needed high levels of FiO2 and PEEP. However, the patient has significantly improved and is now comfortable with a lower FiO2. The patient's sedation is being weaned off to allow for extubation today, provided that secretions are manageable during spontaneous breathing trials (SBT).

3. Depression: The patient has a diagnosis of depression,"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo with hx of asthma (by report) who was recently treated for PNA
   with abx and returned to the ED several days later with hypoxemic
   respiratory failure  which based on BAL eosinophilia and rpaid
   radiographic improvement is compatible at least in part with acute
   eosinophilic  PNA with possible superinfection.
   > Hypoxemic resp failure: Her presentation is concerning for an
   infectious source. we do not know her HIV status (although her CD4
   count is 900). Notably, her plateau pressures are not consistent with
   ARDS, there is no evidence of bleeding which would go for DAH, the cell
   count now has a  neutrophil predominance, but initially she had 12%
   eosinophilia which has subsequently decreased to 1% on repeat. BAL has
   been neg on gram stain and clx as have been blood clx, a viral process
   is possible (the Ag was cancelled) and urine legionella was neg. This
   may be consistent with acute eosinophilic PNA process, there does not
   appear to be an infectious component (BAL neg and PCP neg, viral
   studies neg) and her WBC conts to rise in the setting of broad spectrum
   coverage. The Chest CT from [**10-24**] shows a dramatic GGO and
   consolidation pattern in the upper lobes predominantly which could be
   consistent with AEP,PAP and possibly some volume overload (increased
   BNP on admission), over the last 24 hrs her WHC has improved and she
   has been Afebrile on high dose steroids (125 mg solumedrol q 6h since
   [**10-24**]) and we are going to wean steroids further [**10-26**] as well as abx
   regiment
   -  D/c ceftriaxone today, cont levaquin (and plan stop tomorrow)
   - Cont PS ventilation: SBT today.
   - Decrease to methylprednisolone 60 mg IV q 6h [**10-26**]
   - Let her set I/O
   - Check IgE (add on to admit): pending.
   - Goal net negative today (500 cc) she seems to be concentrated by labs
   - Hopeful for extubation today.
   >ETOH withdrawl / altered mental: she is less responsive this morning
   then previously although there is no focality to her exam. We will hold
   all sedating medications, would check head CT to r/o any interval
   change, there is no clear metabolic precipitant and we can check a ABG
   to rule out CO2 retention. Sub-clinincal status is also on the
   differential in the setting of her EtOH withdrawl and we can also check
   B12, TSH, RPR.
   - Will trial Haldol prior to extubation. Obtain ECG to check Qt
   - Hopeful for improved for mental status
    Coagulopathy: elevated INR, probably related in some part to cirrhosis
   and nutritional deficiency. We will trial three days of Vitamin K.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented to the emergency department for severe pneumonia and respiratory failure requiring intubation.
- She was initially treated for atypical pneumonia but did not improve and returned to the ED with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
- The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in her condition.
- Her blood tests show elevated white blood cell count, eosinophilia, and elevated lactate levels.
- The patient's chest X-ray and CT scan showed a pattern consistent with acute eosinophilic pneumonia with possible superinfection.
- She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids, and other supportive treatments.
- The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and she may be experiencing alcohol withdrawal.
- She also has a coagulopathy likely related to cirrhosis and nutritional deficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with this condition and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for an infectious source, but further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP): The patient's presentation and lab results suggest a possible diagnosis of AEP, which is characterized by eosinophilia and respiratory failure. This condition requires prompt recognition and treatment.
3. Possible superinfection: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, there is a concern for a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented to the emergency department for severe pneumonia and respiratory failure requiring intubation. She was recently treated for atypical pneumonia but did not improve at home. Upon arrival, her oxygen saturation was 65%. She was given various medications including antibiotics, and her condition improved gradually. The patient is now extubated and on supplemental oxygen. She is being weaned off high-dose steroids and antibiotic therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, which indicates a low level of oxygen in the blood. This could be due to an infectious source, and further investigations are needed to determine the cause.
2. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia: The patient's presentation and laboratory findings suggest a possible diagnosis of acute eosinophilic pneumonia. This condition is characterized by inflammation and eosinophilic infiltration in the lungs, leading to respiratory symptoms.
3. Superinfection: The patient's initial improvement followed by a rise in white blood cell count suggests the possibility of a superinfection despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. Further evaluation and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
4. Ethanol withdrawal/altered mental status: The patient showed signs of altered mental status, which could be related to ethanol withdrawal. Monitoring and appropriate management are required.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, recently treated for atypical pneumonia. She presented to the emergency department with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She was given various antibiotics and medications, including midazolam, haloperidol, furosemide, famotidine, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole. Her vitals are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 167/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 3L NC. Her physical examination shows no acute distress and her neurologic status is improving. Her laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct and Plt, slightly low Cr, and normal electrolyte levels. The assessment and plan indicate hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to acute eosinophilic pneumonia with a superinfection. The patient is being weaned off high-dose steroids and antibiotic therapy.

   41 yo with hx of asthma (by report) who was recently treated for PNA
   with abx and returned to the ED several days later with hypoxemic
   respiratory failure  which based on BAL eosinophilia and rapid
   radiographic improvement is compatible at least in part with acute
   eosinophilic  PNA with possible superinfection.
   > Hypoxemic resp failure: s/p extubation, tolerated well. Her
   presentation is concerning for acute eosinophilic PNA, +/- infectious
   source . BAL has been neg on gram stain and clx as have been blood clx,
   a viral process is possible (the Ag was cancelled) and urine legionella
   was neg..
   -Continue steroid taper: goal to get down to 60 of prednisone (or
   equivalent) w/n one week
   -Bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who was recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and returned to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with acute eosinophilic PNA and possibly a superinfection. She underwent invasive ventilation and tolerated it well after extubation.

The patient's current assessment includes:
- Hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to acute eosinophilic PNA with possible superinfection.
- ETOH withdrawal/altered mental status, improving slowly, with no evidence of withdrawal at this time.
- Coffee-ground emesis, resolved.

The plan for the patient includes:
- Continue steroid taper to get down to 60% of prednisone within one week.
- Administer Bactrim for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) for 10 days.
- Provide supplemental oxygen.
- Use an out-of-bed chair.
- Monitor for ETOH withdrawal and altered mental status.
- Continue lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy.
- Continue proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for coffee-ground emesis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Prolonged or recurrent respiratory failure.
- Worsening superinfection due to immunosuppressive therapy.
- Development of gastrointestinal bleeding due to continued coffee-ground emesis.
- Hepatic encephalopathy exacerbation.
- ETOH withdrawal symptoms"

   picture consistent with global deleriumt (med effect,  infections,
   steroids etc).  CT without contrast negative for bleed.  B12, folate,
   TSH negative.  More concerning was lack of withdrawal to pain on exam
   yesterday/today, though this likely due to baseline peripheral
   neuropathy per daughter.

- She was admitted to the MICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation due to severe pneumonia.
- The patient's condition has been improving significantly.
- She was successfully extubated.
- The patient has a history of anoxic brain injury and peripheral neuropathy due to alcohol use.
- She exhibits global delirium with mental status changes.
- Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in blood pressure.
- The patient's respiratory support has been reduced from CPAP/PSV to high flow nasal cannula.
- She has trace edema in her extremities.
- Neurologic examination shows that she follows simple commands and can state her name, but is not oriented to place or date. She responds poorly to painful stimuli in her fingers/hands, but responds to pain in her upper and lower extremities.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count.
- The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level.
- Imaging studies reveal a renal cyst.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and failure. She required intubation due to severe pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly, and she is showing signs of neurological improvement as well.

However, the patient still has difficulty following commands and experienced a coffee ground emesis episode. She was given flumazenil post-extubation for somnolence.

The patient's vital signs show a stable heart rate and blood pressure, with a slight elevation in temperature. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is maintained at 95% on high flow nasal cannula.

Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 2780 mL, indicating fluid loss. The patient received a total of 565 mL of fluids, including 445 mL of IV fluids, while losing 3345 mL of fluids through various routes. Blood products were also transfused.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). Renal function tests show normal creatinine (Cr) levels. Liver function tests are within normal limits, with slightly elevated lactic acid levels. Electrolytes are also within normal range.

The patient's asthma is being treated with controller medications. She has a history of depression and ethanol abuse, and her last drink was on [**10-20"

   steroids etc).  CT without contrast negative for bleed.  B12, folate,
   TSH negative.  More concerning was lack of withdrawal to pain on exam
   yesterday/today, though this likely due to baseline peripheral
   neuropathy per daughter.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, EtOH abuse, and psychiatric history. She was admitted to the MICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation due to severe pneumonia on chest X-ray and high oxygen requirements on the ventilator. Since then, she has been improving significantly and has been successfully extubated. 

The patient has several medical complications that need attention. Firstly, she has acute pneumonia and respiratory failure, which is improving. Secondly, she exhibits mental status changes, possibly due to a global delirium caused by medications, infections, and steroids. Her history of anoxic brain injury and peripheral neuropathy may contribute to these changes. Thirdly, she experiences coffee ground emesis, likely due to gastritis, esophagitis, or peptic ulcer disease. Lastly, she has chronic pancreatitis on imaging and a history of ethanol abuse.

Plan:
1. Continue solumedrol at 60 mg every 6 hours for one more day, then decrease to 60 mg every 8 or 12 hours.
2. Start bactrim due to the anticipated prolonged steroid course.
3. Continue levofloxacin to complete a tentative 10-day course.
4. Allow metabolic alkalosis to continue today and let the patient autodiurese some on her own.
5. Follow up with RPR and check ammonia levels.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's exam and consider further imaging or neuro"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of asthma, EtOH abuse, and psych history. He was admitted to the MICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation due to severe pneumonia on chest X-ray and high O2 requirements on the ventilator. The patient's condition has been improving significantly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Exacerbation of Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with severe pneumonia, which required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Although the patient is currently improving, there is still a risk of complications such as respiratory failure or further deterioration in lung function.

2. Mental Status Changes: The patient has a history of anoxic brain injury and peripheral neuropathy due to alcohol use. He is currently experiencing global delirium, which could be attributed to various factors such as medication effects, infections, or steroids. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further cognitive decline.

3. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient developed a fever, and further investigation is needed to identify the underlying cause. Possible sources include infections (such as urinary tract infection, bloodstream infection, or other sources), atelectasis, or non-infectious causes.

4. Coffee Ground Emesis: The patient experienced an episode of coffee ground emesis, which could be related to gastrointestinal bleeding. It is important to assess the patient's gastrointestinal tract for any potential sources of bleeding and manage accordingly.

5. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient has a history"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, EtOH abuse, and psychiatric history. She was admitted to the MICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation due to severe pneumonia on CXR and high O2 requirements on the ventilator. The patient is currently clinically improving and has been successfully extubated. She has been diagnosed with acute pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient also has a history of anoxic brain injury and peripheral neuropathy due to alcohol use. She is experiencing mental status changes, which are believed to be caused by a combination of medication effects, infections, and steroids. The patient's coffee ground emesis is likely self-limited and may be related to previous gastrointestinal trauma or medication side effects. She has a history of chronic pancreatitis and depression. Additionally, the patient has a renal cyst that requires follow-up renal ultrasound evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged steroid course with potential side effects such as diabetes, osteoporosis, hypertension, and mood changes.
2. Risk of infection due to immunosuppression from chronic steroid use.
3. Further deterioration in mental status or development of delirium.
4. Potential withdrawal symptoms from alcohol.
5. Complications related to chronic pancreatitis, such as pancreatic enzyme insufficiency or pseudocysts.
6. Renal cyst progression or complications.
7. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of altered mental status, airway protection issues, alcohol withdrawal, asthma, depression, and a recent upper gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 93/84 to 146/77 mmHg, heart rate between 59-114 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 13-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and is on antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. Cultures were taken from blood, urine, and sputum to identify the causative organism. Close monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and low oxygen saturation despite being on high flow nasal cannula suggest the possibility of ARDS. Monitoring of oxygenation and lung function, as well as implementing appropriate supportive measures, is crucial.
3. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of hematemesis (vomiting blood) and may still be at risk for further bleeding. Monitoring of vital signs, coagulation parameters, and ongoing assessment"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old individual with a history of asthma, who presented to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient had recently been treated for pneumonia (PNA) with antibiotics but returned to the ED with worsening symptoms. The patient's condition improved dramatically with steroid treatment and is now showing signs of improvement, including an ability to cough, take deep breaths, and even get out of bed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Exacerbation of Asthma (AEP): The patient's presentation is concerning for acute eosinophilic PNA, which may have been triggered by an AEP. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide supplemental oxygen as needed.
2. Infectious Source: Despite negative cultures so far, there is a possibility of an infectious source causing the fever. The patient's fever should be closely monitored, and further investigations may be required.
3. Atelectasis: The patient still requires supplemental oxygen, likely due to atelectasis. Chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises may help resolve the atelectasis.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on prophylaxis for DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Regular monitoring for signs of DVT should be done, and appropriate measures should be taken if any symptoms arise.
5. Neurological Issues: The patient has a history of brain injury and peripheral neuropathy"

","The patient is a 41-year-old with a history of asthma who presented to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure. They were recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and returned to the emergency department with worsening symptoms. The patient's presentation is concerning for acute eosinophilic PNA, possibly with a superinfection. BAL and blood cultures have been negative, and viral processes are still possible.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/81 to 126/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient is on a steroid taper, Bactrim for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), and supplemental oxygen as needed.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 15.7 to 16.5 thousand cells per microliter. Other lab values show slightly elevated creatinine, blood glucose levels around 180 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.3 mmol/L.

Assessment and plan include continuing the steroid taper, finishing the course of Bactrim, providing supplemental oxygen, and monitoring for any further changes. The patient's neurological status has improved, but they will continue to be monitored. No additional antibiotics have been prescribed at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was treated for pneumonia (PNA) and returned to the ED with worsening symptoms. The patient was diagnosed with acute eosinophilic PNA and possibly a superinfection, as indicated by BAL eosinophilia and rapid radiographic improvement. She was started on steroids, which led to a dramatic improvement in her condition. The patient still requires supplemental oxygen, likely due to atelectasis. Her mental status is improving, and she is able to cough, take deep breaths, and get out of bed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is a condition characterized by low oxygen levels in the blood. This can be life-threatening and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute eosinophilic PNA: The patient has been diagnosed with acute eosinophilic PNA, which is a type of lung infection. It is important to monitor for any worsening of symptoms or complications related to the infection.
3. Superinfection: There is a possibility of a superinfection due to the combination of the initial PNA and the use of immunosuppressive steroids. Monitoring for signs of secondary infections is essential.
4. Atelectasis: The patient's continued need for supplemental oxygen suggests the presence of atelectasis,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, who was recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and returned to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with acute eosinophilic PNA with possible superinfection. The patient's condition improved dramatically with steroids and she is now tolerating extubation well. She still requires supplemental oxygen, likely due to atelectasis, but her mental status is improving and she is able to cough, take deep breaths, and get out of bed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure due to acute eosinophilic PNA with possible superinfection.
2. Atelectasis, which may contribute to ongoing oxygen requirement.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization.
4. Neurological issues related to previous brain injury and peripheral neuropathy.

Plan:
1. Continue steroid treatment with Solumedrol and transition to oral prednisone.
2. Administer Bactrim for possible Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).
3. Provide supplemental oxygen as needed.
4. Encourage ambulation and deep breathing exercises.
5. Consult pulmonologist for further evaluation and management.
6. Monitor neurologic status closely.
7. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent DVT."

The patient is a 41-year-old woman with a history of asthma, who was recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and returned to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP): The patient's presentation is concerning for AEP, which can cause severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia.
2. Superinfection: Although all cultures have been negative so far, there is still a possibility of a superinfection due to the underlying AEP.
3. Atelectasis: The patient still has some oxygen requirement likely due to atelectasis, which may need to be addressed with chest physiotherapy or bronchodilators.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been on prophylaxis for DVT, so it is important to monitor for any signs or symptoms of DVT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, who was recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and returned to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's presentation is concerning for acute eosinophilic PNA, possibly with a superimposed infection. All cultures are negative to date. The patient improved dramatically with steroids and is currently on Solumedrol 60 mg IV q12hr, with a planned transition to oral prednisone tomorrow. She is also receiving Bactrim for Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis. The patient's oxygen requirement is decreasing as her mental status continues to improve and she is able to cough, take deep breaths, and get out of bed to a chair.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atelectasis: The patient may still have some residual atelectasis, as indicated by her ongoing need for supplemental oxygen. This could potentially lead to further respiratory compromise if not addressed.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on prophylaxis for DVT due to her prolonged immobilization in the ICU. If she develops symptoms such as swelling, warmth, or pain in her legs, it may indicate the presence of a DVT, which can be a serious complication.
3. Neurological issues: The patient has a history of brain injury and peripheral neuropathy. Monitoring her neurological status and mental state will be important to identify any potential"

 clinically improving,
   though still requiring O2 with intermittent desaturations.  Picture C/w

   - IS and pulmonary toilet as tolerated.
   # mental status changes
 per daughter, has history of anoxic brain
   injury as well as peripheral neuropathy due to alcohol.
   Lives/functions at home alone.  Current picture consistent with global
   delerium (med effect,  infections, steroids etc).  Improving overnight
   and today.
   - f/u RPR
   - continue to monitor exam
   - hold benzos, though monitor for withdrawal.
   # Fever.  To [**Age over 90 2224**] yesterday.  No e/o infiltrate on CXR.  UA with few
   WBCs, will follow culture.  Could also be atelectasis given positioning
   and lethargy at times.  Also consider other infectious sources (biliary
   disease, c.diff) or other sources of fever (pancreatitis, VTE).
   -          follow urine and blood cultures.  Hold off on further abx
   for now.
   # Coffee ground emesis.  One episode 2 nights ago after dry heaving;
   likely [**Doctor First Name 331**] [**Doctor Last Name **] vs. past OGT trauma. Seems to have been self
   limited with subsequent stable Hct.
   -          Change back to H2 blocker
   -          If no further episodes and hct stable, would hold off on GI
   consult/scope
   # depression - cont home prozac dose
   # ethanol abuse - per family, chronic pancreatitis per imaging.  Last

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, EtOH abuse, and psych history. She was admitted to the MICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation due to severe pneumonia on CXR and high O2 requirements on vent. The patient has been improving significantly, though still requiring O2 with intermittent desaturations. A picture consistent with eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is suspected, as indicated by eosinophilia in BAL and elevated serum IgE, while ANCA and infection workup are negative.

The patient's mental status changes are attributed to global delirium, potentially caused by medication effects, infections, and steroids. There is also a history of anoxic brain injury and peripheral neuropathy due to alcohol. The patient lives independently at home and has shown improvement overnight and today.

The patient presented with fever yesterday without any e/o infiltrate on CXR. Urine analysis with few WBCs has been conducted, and blood cultures are pending. The fever could be attributed to atelectasis, given positioning and lethargy, or other infectious sources (biliary disease, c.diff) or non-infectious causes (VTE, pancreatitis).

The patient experienced one episode of coffee ground emesis two nights ago, which was likely self-limited. This may be related to previous OGT trauma or gastric irritation from medications. If there are no further episodes and hemoglobin levels remain stable, a GI consult"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old overweight/obese male with hypoxic respiratory failure. He has a history of hematemesis (upper gastrointestinal bleed), altered mental status (not delirium), risk for aspiration, alcohol withdrawal, fever of unknown origin, asthma, depression, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently on regular nutrition, insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code and he is being considered for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged ventilator dependence: The patient's condition may lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of ventilator-associated complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system, he is at an increased risk of developing infections, including hospital-acquired infections like VAP or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may progress to severe respiratory failure, potentially requiring more advanced respiratory support like extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
4. Organ dysfunction: Prolonged hypoxia and respiratory failure can result in organ dysfunction, particularly affecting the lungs, heart, and kidneys. Close monitoring of vital signs and organ function is essential"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 F with history of asthma, EtOH abuse, psych history; admit to MICU
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation with severe pneumonia on
   CXR and high O2 requirements on vent; now improving significantly.
   Picture consistent with acute eosinophilic pneumonia.
   # Acute eosinophilic pneumonia and respiratory failure.
 clinically
   improving, though still requiring O2 now at 2L.  +eos in BAL and
   elevated serum IgE suggest AEP.   ANCA and infection workup negative.
   s/p 7 day course of levofloxacin in addition, though suspicion for CAP
   low.
   - decrease solumedrol 60 Q12hrs for today, then to PO prednisone 60
   starting tomorrow AM.
   - started bactrim given anticipated prolonged steroid course.
   - goal even today
   - IS and pulmonary toilet as tolerated.
   - wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Pulmonary consult to continue on floor after callout.
   - Smoking cessation
   # mental status changes
 per daughter, has history of anoxic brain
   injury as well as peripheral neuropathy due to alcohol.
   Lives/functions at home alone.  Delerium post extubation but now doing
   well and appears at baseline.
   - hold benzos.
   # Fever.  To 101 on [**10-27**].  No e/o infiltrate on CXR.  Urines and
   bloods negative.  Could be atelectasis given positioning and lethargy
   at that time.  Afebrile since.
   -          Followup fever curve.
   # Coffee ground emesis.  One episode on [**10-26**] after dry heaving; likely
   [**Doctor First Name 331**] [**Doctor Last Name **] vs. past OGT trauma. Seems to have been self limited with
   subsequent stable Hct.
   # depression - cont home prozac dose
   # ethanol abuse - per family, also chronic pancreatitis per imaging.
   Last drink thought to be [**10-20**] or [**10-21**].
   - SW consult on floor.
   # Renal cyst.  Will need followup renal ultrasound to evaluate.

   41 yo with hx of asthma (by report) who was recently treated for PNA
   with abx and returned to the ED several days later with hypoxemic
   respiratory failure  which based on BAL eosinophilia and rapid
   radiographic improvement is compatible at least in part with acute
   eosinophilic  PNA with possible superinfection.
   > Hypoxemic resp failure likely d/t AEP: s/p extubation, tolerated
   well. Her presentation is concerning for acute eosinophilic PNA, +/-
   infectious source . All Cx are neg to date. She improved dramatically
   with steroids. Currently, still has some O2 requirment, likely [**1-13**]
   atelectasis, but as her mental status is continuing to improve and she
   is able to cough, take deep breaths and get OOB to chair, her O2
   requirement has been coming down to the point of room air.
   -Change to Solumedrol 60 mg IV q12hr with change to PO prednisone
   tomorrow.
   -Bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who was recently treated for pneumonia and returned to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. This condition is believed to be caused by acute eosinophilic pneumonia with possible superinfection. The patient has shown significant improvement with the use of steroids and is no longer requiring supplemental oxygen. She is able to cough, take deep breaths, and even get out of bed to a chair. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atelectasis: The patient still has some oxygen requirements, likely due to atelectasis.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on prophylaxis for DVT.
3. Brain Injury: The patient has a history of brain injury, but her neurologic exam and mental status have improved.
4. Peripheral Neuropathy: The patient has a history of peripheral neuropathy, but her neurologic exam has improved.
5. Infection: Although the patient's fever has resolved, there is still a possibility of infection due to pending cultures and the presence of atelectasis.

Note: The patient's overall condition appears to be improving, but ongoing monitoring and care are necessary to address these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma who was recently treated for pneumonia (PNA) and returned to the emergency department with hypoxemic respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with acute eosinophilic PNA with possible superinfection. The patient's condition has improved significantly with the use of steroids and she is now able to cough, take deep breaths, and get out of bed to a chair. She still requires supplemental oxygen but her requirement is decreasing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atelectasis: The patient's ongoing oxygen requirement may be due to atelectasis, which is the collapse of part or all of a lung.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on prophylaxis for DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU.
3. Infection: Although all cultures are currently negative, there is still a concern for possible infection, especially with the history of acute eosinophilic PNA and superinfection.
4. Neurological issues: The patient has a history of brain injury and peripheral neuropathy. While her neurological exam and mental status have improved, they will continue to be monitored.
5. Glycemic control: The patient's glycemic control will be managed with regular insulin sliding scale.
6. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis with a PPI.

   Assessment and Plan
   41 F with history of asthma, EtOH abuse, psych history; admit to MICU
   with respiratory failure requiring intubation with severe pneumonia on
   CXR and high O2 requirements on vent; now improving significantly.
   Picture consistent with acute eosinophilic pneumonia.
   # Acute eosinophilic pneumonia and respiratory failure.
 clinically
   improving, though still requiring O2 now at 2L.  +eos in BAL and
   elevated serum IgE suggest AEP.   ANCA and infection workup negative.
    s/p 7 day course of levofloxacin in addition, though suspicion for CAP
   low.
   - decrease solumedrol 60 Q12hrs for today, then to PO prednisone 60
   starting tomorrow AM.
   - started bactrim given anticipated prolonged steroid course.
   - goal even today
   - IS and pulmonary toilet as tolerated.
   - wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Pulmonary consult to continue on floor after callout.
   - Smoking cessation
   # mental status changes
 per daughter, has history of anoxic brain
   injury as well as peripheral neuropathy due to alcohol.
   Lives/functions at home alone.  Delerium post extubation but now doing
   well and appears at baseline.
   - hold benzos.
   # Fever.  To 101 on [**10-27**].  No e/o infiltrate on CXR.  Urines and
   bloods negative.  Could be atelectasis given positioning and lethargy
   at that time.  Afebrile since.
   -          Followup fever curve.
   # Coffee ground emesis.  One episode on [**10-26**] after dry heaving; likely
   [**Doctor First Name 331**] [**Doctor Last Name **] vs. past OGT trauma. Seems to have been self limited with
   subsequent stable Hct.
   # depression - cont home prozac dose
   # ethanol abuse - per family, also chronic pancreatitis per imaging.
   Last drink thought to be [**10-20**] or [**10-21**].
   - SW consult on floor.
   # Renal cyst.  Will need followup renal ultrasound to evaluate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, EtOH abuse, and psych history. She was admitted to the MICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation due to severe pneumonia on CXR and high O2 requirements on vent. The patient is now improving significantly and is suspected to have acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP). ANCA and infection workup are negative. The patient has received a 7-day course of levofloxacin, and the suspicion for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is low. The patient's steroids will be decreased, and she will be transitioned to PO prednisone starting tomorrow AM. Bactrim has been started due to the anticipated prolonged steroid course. The goals for the patient include weaning off O2 as tolerated, pulmonary toilet as tolerated, and IS as tolerated. A pulmonary consult has been requested to continue care on the floor after callout. Smoking cessation will also be addressed. The patient has a history of mental status changes, anoxic brain injury, and peripheral neuropathy due to alcohol. She was delirious post-extubation but is now doing well and appears at baseline. Benzodiazepines will be held. The patient had a fever on [**10-27**] but is now afebrile. Followup fever curve will be monitored. The patient experienced coffee ground emesis on [**10-26**] but seems to have been self-limited"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, EtOH abuse, and psych history. She was admitted to the MICU with respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia and required intubation. She is now improving significantly and the CXR shows a picture consistent with acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP). The patient has elevated serum IgE and eosinophils in the BAL, suggesting AEP. Other workups such as ANCA and infection tests are negative. She received a 7-day course of levofloxacin, and there is suspicion for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). 

The patient also has a history of anoxic brain injury and peripheral neuropathy due to alcohol use. She was delirious post-extubation but is now doing well. It is recommended to hold benzodiazepines. 

The patient had a fever on 10/27 without any signs of infiltrate on CXR, and subsequent blood and urine tests were negative. It could be due to atelectasis given her positioning and lethargy at that time. 

She experienced one episode of coffee ground emesis on 10/26 after dry heaving, which may have been self-limited and related to past OGT trauma. 

The patient has depression and is currently taking Prozac. She has a history of ethanol abuse and chronic pancreatitis per imaging. Her last drink was on 10/20 or 10/21. A social"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of asthma, alcohol abuse, and psychiatric issues. She was admitted to the MICU with respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia and required intubation. She is now improving significantly, and a picture consistent with acute eosinophilic pneumonia has been identified. The patient has been off oxygen for some time. The assessment plan includes changing to oral prednisone, starting bactrim, consulting a pulmonary specialist for floor care, and promoting smoking cessation. The patient also has a history of mental status changes, anoxic brain injury, peripheral neuropathy due to alcohol, fever without infiltrates, leukocytosis, coffee ground emesis, depression, ethanol abuse, chronic pancreatitis, and a renal cyst. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and she is tolerating PO feeds with improved mental status. She is expected to be transferred to the floor after the callout.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation. Although she is now improving, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if her condition deteriorates.
2. Acute Eosinophilic Pneumonia (AEP): The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest AEP, which is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by respiratory failure, fever, and an increase in eosinophils in the lungs.
3. Infection: Despite"
