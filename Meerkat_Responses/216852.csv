   Pt stable throughout day after arrival to floor.  Called to bedside at
   MN for acute distress. Pt found to be tachypneic, 02 sats high 90s.
   Very cold and clammy.  Slightly altered. BP initially stable. Unable to
   get oral temperature, rectal temp 98. Given Nebs, 02. c/o chest pain.
   Given 0.5mg morphine. ECG unchanged/uninterpretable in setting of known
   LBBB.  CXR unchanged. BPs erratic, unable to measure pressure or 02 sat
   as pt became more clamped down.  Became more obtunded.  Initial labs
   notable for neg CEs, Hct increased to 50, persistent leukocytosis.
   Right femoral access was obtained. Initial attempts to place a-line
   unsuccsesful due to absence of peripheral pulses. Pt bolused 3L,
   started on pressors, initially dopamine, then levo added once CVL
   placed.   Due to obtundation, inability to monitor 02 sat and
   difficulty acquiring information from arterial blood gas, anaesthesia
   was called and emergent intubation was performed with etomidate.
   Anaesthesia able to place femoral arterial line.  Pt had emergent TTE
   that showed new global hypokinesis with EF ~10% (last [**3-23**] was
   40-50%).  Initial ABG after intubation: 7.12/42/341, lactate 7.7 up
   from 2.8 at time of admission.  Pt transitioned to dobutamine, RR
   increased.  Skin perfusion improved, however repeat ABG worse at
   7.06/44/251 lactate 8.  Vent settings changed to CPAP.  Zosyn started.
   Bicarb gtt started.  Pt hyperkalemic to 6, given insulin/D5, ca
   gluconate. [**Name (NI) **] brother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4803**] was called and notified of
   patient's status.  Dopamine added back on.  LFTs continue to rise.  Pt
   headed to CT for CT with gastrograffin contrast only.  Oliguric.

   Assessment and Plan
   70M with h/o COPD with recent hospitalization for COPD exacerbation on
   steroid taper, AAA s/p repair presenting with fall and hematemesis on
   aspirin found with transaminitis, RUQ tenderness, gallbladder swelling
   and leukocytosis
   .
   <I>PLAN:</I>
   .
   <I>## Hematemesis:</I>Per report pt had single episode of maroon
   hematemesis, unclear volume. Is guaiac negative so if GI source, has
   not been significant or of prolonged duration. Ddx is broad  GI vs oral
   vs pulmonary source. Pt has history of lung ca s/p resection, has
   history of acute cough/possible bronchitis.  He had GIB in [**Month (only) 2605**] at OSH,
   unclear etiology, per PCP was [**Name Initial (PRE) **] duodenal bleed.  Another more ominous
   possibility is an aorto-enteric fistula from his graft, however the
   patient has had no other symptoms such as chest pain and is currently
   hemodynamically stable.
   -GI aware, no plans for emergent/urgent scope.  NPO after MN for
   possibly EGD
   -2PIV
   -IV PPI, may switch back to home dose when taking PO
   -Active T+S
   -Check HCT in am, if stable may move to Q24.
   -switch asa to 81mg
   -decrease BB, hold other anti-hypertensives overnight, if HD stable,
   may restart in am.
   .
   <I>## RUQ pain:</I>Unclear picture with transaminitis without ductal
   dilatation and some gall bladder swelling. Pt is on steroids, reports
   vague history of poor appetite with 25lb wt loss over 3 months, at risk
   for acalculous cholecystitis.
   -HIDA scan
   -f/u blood cx
   .
   <I>## COPD:</I>Continue steroid taper, advair, duonebs
   .
   <I>## HTN:</I>Decreased dose of BB, holding other antihypertensives
   until am, may restart HCTZ or ACEI in am if stable, no further bleeding
   overnight.
   .
   <I>## HL:</I>Continue statin
   .
   <I>## Cardiomyopathy:</I>Restart ACEI in am
   .
   <I>## Leukocytosis:</I>Ddx includes steroid induced leukocytosis,
   recent URI, cholecystits.  UA bland, unlikely source.
   -Continue to trend
   -f/u blood cultures
   .
   <I>## Falls:</I>Head CT read pending. On prelim look no overt bleed. No
   focal neuron deficits.
   -f/u final read CT
   -Fall precautions
   -PT c/s

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, recent hospitalization for COPD exacerbation, and AAA repair presenting with fall and hematemesis. The patient's condition has been unstable throughout the day with multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hematemesis: The patient had a single episode of maroon hematemesis, but it is unclear whether it is significant or of prolonged duration. The differential diagnosis includes gastrointestinal bleeding, oral bleeding, or pulmonary source. The patient's history of lung cancer and previous gastrointestinal bleeding should be considered.

2. RUQ pain: The patient presents with transaminitis without ductal dilatation and some gallbladder swelling. Given the patient's use of steroids and vague history of poor appetite with significant weight loss, he is at risk for acalculous cholecystitis.

3. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and it is mentioned that he was recently hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation. His respiratory support includes invasive ventilation and CPAP.

4. Hypotension and unstable blood pressure: The patient's blood pressure has been erratic, making it difficult to measure pressure or oxygen saturation accurately.

5. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has shown signs of global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 10% (down from 40-50%), indicating a significant decline in cardiac function."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain and subsequent invasive ventilation. The patient's condition has been unstable throughout the day, with episodes of tachypnea, altered mental status, and cold/clammy skin. The patient's blood pressure has been erratic, and there have been difficulties in measuring oxygen saturation due to the patient's increased agitation.

Initial labs showed a negative troponin level, increased hematocrit (Hct) of 50, and persistent leukocytosis. The patient required right femoral access and was started on pressors, initially dopamine, then levo added once a central venous line (CVL) was placed. Due to the patient's obtundation and inability to monitor oxygen saturation and acquire information from arterial blood gas, emergent intubation was performed with etomidate.

A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed new global hypokinesis with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 10% (last EF was 40-50%). The initial arterial blood gas (ABG) after intubation indicated respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.12, low oxygen levels (PaO2), high carbon dioxide levels (PCO2), and elevated lactate levels. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, with worsening ABG results and hyperkalemia.

The patient has multiple comor"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with severe peripheral vascular disease, complicated graft anatomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent admission for exacerbation currently on steroids. He presented with hematemesis, shock, and lactic acidosis overnight. The patient is intubated and sedated, with a low oxygen saturation level. He is receiving multiple medications including dobutamine, dopamine, fentanyl, and midazolam. His vital signs are unstable, with erratic blood pressure readings and increased heart rate. The patient has elevated lactate levels, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. His arterial blood gas shows respiratory acidosis with an elevated carbon dioxide level. Imaging studies reveal global hypokinesis of the heart with an ejection fraction of approximately 10%. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting an infection or inflammatory process. His liver enzymes are significantly elevated, indicating possible liver dysfunction or injury. The patient's potassium level is high, and he has an elevated blood glucose level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low oxygen saturation and increased respiratory rate may suggest the development of ARDS, which is characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
2. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count, combined with signs of systemic inflammation and potential organ dysfunction (e.g., liver dysfunction indicated by elevated liver enzymes), raise concerns for sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with severe peripheral vascular disease, complicated graft anatomy, COPD with FEV1 of 40%, and recent admission for exacerbation currently on steroids. He presented with hematemesis, shock, and lactic acidosis overnight. The patient is intubated and sedated, showing signs of respiratory distress, tachypnea, and hypoxia. He has cold and clammy skin, slightly altered mental status, and elevated leukocyte count. The patient's cardiac status has significantly deteriorated with a decrease in ejection fraction from 40-50% to 10%, indicating a possible metabolic cause. His liver function tests are elevated, and there are concerns about possible cholangitis or bowel ischemia. The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and he requires vasopressors. Imaging studies reveal patent grafts and no evidence of air in the bowel wall.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/lactic acidosis: The patient's presentation of shock and lactic acidosis suggests a critical condition. The differential diagnosis includes acalculous cholecystitis or atypical cholangitis versus bowel ischemia. Further evaluation with HIDA scan and consideration of decompression if positive or indeterminate is necessary. Given the elevated INR and possible need for proceduralization, monitoring of coagulation status is essential.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to unknown respiratory status and obtundation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of severe COPD, hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), lung cancer (s/p chemo), and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. He presents with hematemesis, which is vomiting blood. The patient has experienced recent falls and head trauma. He also has abnormal gallbladder findings on ultrasound, including a thickened wall with edema. Overnight, he became hypotensive, tachypneic, and experienced chest pain. Cardiac enzymes were negative, and he received femoral arterial and venous access, along with dopamine and dobutamine infusions. A cardiac troponin T level was obtained. His vital signs include a temperature of 98°F, blood pressure ranging from 103/54 mmHg to 160/101 mmHg, heart rate between 69-106 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, lactate level, liver enzymes, amylase, lipase, lactic acid, and LDH. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and high phosphorus levels. His blood glucose level is elevated.

   Assessment and Plan
   Complicated yr old gentleman presents with fall and possible UGIB, abd
   US showed GB wall edema
   1.       Shock: likely mixed septic and cardiogenic. Doing well on
   combo dobutamine/dopa. Resite CVL to get CVP and follow SCvo2, lactate.
   Sepsis: Concerning etiology would be bowel ischemia with profound
   lactate and complex vascular anatomy. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4822**] consulting- stat ABD US
   with dopplers to see if grafts are open, if cannot assess will need abd
   CT with contrast to clarify.
           Gen [**Doctor First Name **] consult in light of abnl gall bladder and now shock-
   could this be nectrotic gallbladder
 get HIDA. Discuss with
            GI team as well role of GB decompression versus ERCP or PTC
   drain in even t of ascecing cholangitis.
           Cardiogenic Shock: etiologies would be massive MI but no acute
   ST T changes on EC (but is LBBB) and nothing focal by
            Echo
 though was more acidotic). PE would be another
   possibility with new RV dysfunction
 presently anuric and CTA
            would be dangerous. Unfortunately in light of GIB empiric
   anticoag would entail significant risk but we may be forced to
           commit and manage expectantly.
   2.            Resp Failure: currently on CPAP 10/5 because was
   dysnchronous in light of met acidodid and dirve to breathe. Attempt
   sedation and conversion back to AC with a move towards ARDSNET vent.
   3.           ARF: likely acute on chronic due to shock ATN, trying to
   now maintain MAPS greater than 65, goal UOP > 30 cc/hr ,   check urine
   lytes, renally does all meds

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of GI bleed. The patient is currently in the ICU and has experienced several medical complications.

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing mixed septic and cardiogenic shock. The use of dobutamine and dopamine indicates an attempt to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) at 10/5, suggesting respiratory support due to respiratory failure.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is likely suffering from ARF, which is likely acute on chronic due to shock-associated acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65, achieve urine output (UOP) greater than 30 cc/hr, check urine electrolytes, and ensure renal clearance of medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of shock, progression of respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, and potential development of other organ dysfunctions such as hepatic or cardiovascular complications.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's hemodynamic status, respiratory function, urine output, and laboratory parameters, especially considering the ongoing use of vasopressors and the presence of ARF. Timely intervention and appropriate management are essential to prevent further deterioration and optimize the patient's chances of recovery."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing several medical complications.

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing mixed septic and cardiogenic shock. He is receiving dobutamine and dopamine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65. The healthcare team plans to re-site the central venous line (CVL) to measure central venous pressure (CVP) and follow serum central venous oxygen saturation (Scvo2) and lactate levels. The possible etiology of shock could be bowel ischemia with profound lactate and complex vascular anatomy.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 10/5. This indicates that the patient is having difficulty maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient likely has acute-on-chronic renal failure due to shock-associated acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The goal is to maintain a MAP greater than 65, achieve urine output (UOP) greater than 30 cc/hr, check urine electrolytes, and ensure that medications are renally dosed correctly.

The patient's allergies include Univasc (moexipril HCl), Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium), leg cramps, Vitamin E, epistaxis, Ambien (zol"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Shock: The patient presented with a mixed septic and cardiogenic picture. The possible causes of sepsis include bowel ischemia and biliary source due to chronic cholecystitis. The patient is currently on multiple pressors and has profound lactate elevation.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The etiologies of cardiogenic shock could be massive MI, but no acute ST T changes on ECG were observed, and there was no focal abnormality by Echo. The patient's central exam suggests MI. TEE did not show aortic dissection. PE would be another possibility with new RV dysfunction, but a CTA would be dangerous at this time. Therefore, the patient has been started on heparin for MI and possible PE.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on CPAP 10/5 because they were dysynchronous in light of metabolic acidosis and driving to breathe. An attempt at sedation and conversion back to AC with a move towards ARDSNET vent has been made.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient likely has acute on chronic ARF due to shock ATN. The goal is to maintain MAPS greater than 65, aim for UOP > 30 cc/hr, check urine lytes, and ensure renally dosed all meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, lung cancer, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. He presented with a question of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and was initially stable but then developed sudden shock. There is uncertainty regarding the cause of the shock, with possibilities including myocardial infarction (MI), pulmonary embolism (PE), sepsis, or a mixed cardiogenic and septic picture. The patient is currently on dobutamine and has been weaned off dopamine. Heparin has been started for possible PE vs MI, but the patient is experiencing hemoptysis.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Shock: The patient likely has a mixed septic and cardiogenic shock picture. Echocardiogram (Echo) suggests an infarction but did not reveal any focal abnormalities. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) did not show aortic dissection. The patient is still on dobutamine and has been started on heparin for MI and possible PE. However, the patient is now experiencing hemoptysis.

2. Sepsis: The primary culprits for sepsis would likely be a bowel source versus biliary source versus pneumonia (PNA). Bowel ischemia is possible given the patient's profound lactate elevation. However, an abdominal ultrasound ("

The patient's vascular grafts appeared patent on ultrasound, and a nuclear medicine scan showed lack of flow into the duodenum, which was thought to be due to fentanyl the patient is on. The HIDA scan also revealed delayed filling of the gallbladder, likely from chronic cholecystitis.

The patient has been on multiple medications, including dobutamine, dopamine, fentanyl, heparin, midazolam, and pantoprazole. He is currently on dobutamine and dopa, and his pressors were weaned.

The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/60 mmHg to 137/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 9 mmHg, fluid intake of 6,799 mL, fluid output of 5,649 mL, blood product transfusion of 548 mL, urine output of 98 mL, and NG tube output of 450 mL.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. 

The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. However, the HPI (History of Present Illness) section is empty, indicating that there is no specific information available regarding the patient's current symptoms or complaints.

The 24-hour events section shows that several diagnostic tests and procedures were performed on October 11th, including an ultrasound, nuclear medicine test, sputum culture, EKG, transesophageal echo, and multi-lumen insertion. These tests indicate that the patient may have been experiencing cardiovascular or respiratory issues.

The allergies section lists medications that the patient is allergic to, including Univasc (moexipril Hcl) causing cough, Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium) causing leg cramps, Vitamin E causing epistaxis, and Ambien (zolpidem tartrate) causing disorientation.

The last dose of antibiotics section indicates that the patient received vancomycin on October 11th, metronidazole on October 12th, and piperacillin on October 12th. This suggests that the patient may have an infection.

Infusions of fentanyl, dobutamine, and dopamine are ongoing, indicating that the patient is likely experiencing pain and may have heart or cardiac issues.

Other ICU medications include midazolam, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), pantoprazole ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with severe COPD, hypertension, congestive heart failure, a history of chemotherapy, lung cancer, and an aortic aneurysm. He presents with hematemesis and has developed acute lactic acidosis and global cardiac depression overnight. The etiology of the decompensation is unclear, but possible causes include gallbladder issues, C. diff colitis, or sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensation related to lactic acidosis and global cardiac depression.
2. Gallbladder/chronic cholecystitis with development of necrotic cholecystitis and subsequent ascending cholangitis.
3. C. diff colitis with sepsis.
4. Sepsis secondary to other infections.
5. Respiratory complications due to COPD exacerbation and atelectasis.
6. Cardiac complications due to global hypokinesis.
7. Complications related to prolonged high-dose steroid use.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be necessary to determine the exact cause of the patient's condition and potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, hypertension, congestive heart failure, lung cancer, and an aortic aneurysm. He presents with hematemesis and has been experiencing vomiting blood since the previous night. The patient also has a history of falls and head trauma. Upon initial evaluation, he was found to have an elevated lactate level and abnormal gallbladder on ultrasound with thickened wall and edema. He became hypotensive and tachypneic, and chest pain was noted. Cardiac enzymes were negative, and he received femoral arterial and venous access, started on dopamine and dobutamine, and received 3 liters of fluid. A cardiac trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed global hypokinesis, and gas exchange was 7.12/42 with lactate at 7.7. A CT scan of the abdomen showed an edematous gallbladder but no other significant findings.

Overnight, the patient developed bright red blood per endotracheal tube, and dopamine was weaned. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) screen was positive. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 C (100.6 F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 121/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF) after chemotherapy, lung cancer surgery, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and hematemesis. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected septic shock and has been receiving various medications including steroids, azithromycin, and antibiotics. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with symptoms including hypotension, tachypnea, chest pain, and vomiting blood. He has been on mechanical ventilation and has had multiple arterial lines and central venous access placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with suspected septic shock, which can lead to hypotension, organ dysfunction, and potentially death if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening respiratory status and the need for mechanical ventilation raise concerns for ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and impaired oxygenation.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated D-dimer levels and prolonged PT/INR suggest a possible coagulopathy, which could increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum lactate, increased creatinine, and urea levels indicate possible AKI, which may occur due to hypoperfusion, sepsis, or other factors.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old man with severe COPD, hypertension, congestive heart failure, lung cancer status post resection, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and is currently in the ICU. The patient presents with hematemesis and a history of head trauma from a fall. Initial evaluation shows abnormal gallbladder findings on US, along with elevated lactate levels. Overnight, the patient became hypotensive with tachypnea and chest pain, leading to the placement of a femoral arterial line, venous access, and initiation of dopamine and dobutamine infusions. The patient's cardiac TTE revealed global hypokinesis, and gas exchange values were within normal limits. A CT scan of the abdomen showed an edematous gallbladder but no other significant findings. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was unremarkable for dissection, and empirically, heparin was started due to concern for primary cardiac etiology versus pulmonary embolism (PE). This morning, the patient developed bright red blood per ETT tube, and the dopamine infusion was able to be weaned. The patient's DIC screen is positive. Clinically, he has had a significant hemodynamic improvement.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from the provided information. These include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's presentation of hypotension, tachypnea, and chest pain"

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for leg cramps. The patient has allergies to Univasc, Lipitor, Ambien, and epistaxis. The patient has received antibiotics including vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin. The patient is also on midazolam and pantoprazole. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, troponin-T, CK, CKMB, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, amylase, lipase, D-dimer, lactic acid, LDH, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 39 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 220, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 21 mEq/L, and base excess (-4). The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg, and the fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,471 mL, total output of 301 mL, and a urine output of 251 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV mode ventilation, and supplemental oxygen delivery through a face mask. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is still pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and barotrauma.

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's low blood pressure and altered vital signs may indicate cardiovascular instability, which can lead to septic shock, arrhythmias, or cardiac dysfunction.

3. Renal Complications: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, renal insufficiency, or the need for renal replacement therapy.

4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and troponin-T levels indicate possible ongoing infection or myocardial injury. There is a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, including VAP, catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), or other infections due to immunosuppression.

5. Thromboembolic Complications: The patient is at an increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization, underlying hypercoagulability, and potential endothelial injury.

6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient is at risk for stress ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding, especially given the use of pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

7. Neurological Complications: The patient's disorientation and leg cramps may indicate neurological complications such as delirium or peripheral neuropathy.

8. Metabolic Complications: The patient's altered lab values, including electrolyte imbalances and elevated lact"

   Assessment and Plan\
   70 yr old man with severe COPD on (steroids high dose), HTN, CHF, lung
   Ca s/p resection, AAA with extensive AA graft who developed acute
   cardiogenic shock and hemoptysis.
   1)       Shock: Unclear initial etiology
 PE vs primary cardiac
   process. No e/o DVT in LEs. Cannot pursue CTA given renal failure and
   V/Q scan would be difficult to perform and interpret in the setting of
   critical illness and severe COPD. He is currently off pressors and his
   cardiac enzymes are trending down. He is not on anticoagulation [**3-17**]
   significant hemoptysis. Hold on aspirin. Can consider beta-blocker
   given he is off pressors; consider low dose metoprolol. Continue
   statin.
   2)       Respiratory: Intubated initially for airway protection in the
   setting of altered mental status. CO2 is low in setting of mechanical
   ventilation; tolerating pressure support [**1-21**] with great tidal volumes.
   Aim to decrease support today and decrease Fentanyl
 dailys SAT and
   SBT. Would treat the GNRs in his sputum with continued Zosyn.
   3)       ID: Only positive micro data is GNRs in sputum. Can d/c Vanc
   and Flagyl but would continue Zosyn. Follow cultures and clinical
   status.
   4)       Renal: His creatinine is worsening and he
s been oliguric for
   almost two days now. Mild metabolic acidosis. Would involve the Renal
   service given he has not demonstrated any meaningful improvement in
   renal function or urine output over the past two days.
   5)       Cardiac: Continue to cycle enzymes. Low dose beta-blocker as
   above. Continue statin. Off dobutamine.
   6)       Heme: Positive DIC panel that likely explains
   thrombocytopenia. No e/o active bleeding (just mild bloody secretions
   in the ETT suction.) Follow H/H, transfusion goal > 30% in setting of
   CAD / possible cardiogenic shock.
   7)       F/E/N: TFs to start today. Follow / replete
lytes in setting
   of renal failure.
   8)       Liver: Transaminases improving. Likely shock liver.
   9)       Endo: RSSI, follow sugars. Continue Hydrocortisone for one
   more day, if maintaining his pressure then can consider d/c
ing and
   changing to Prednisone tomorrow.
   10)   Code: full; Access: D/c art line; Dispo: MICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old male with severe COPD, hypertension, congestive heart failure, lung cancer post resection, and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).
- He presented with hematemesis and a history of head trauma from a fall.
- Initial evaluation showed abnormal gallbladder on ultrasound with thickened wall and edema.
- Overnight, the patient became hypotensive, tachypneic, and developed chest pain, leading to the suspicion of cardiogenic shock.
- He was given femoral arterial line, venous access, started on dopamine peripheral, then switched to levophed due to tachycardia and subsequently to dopamine and dobutamine.
- The patient received 3 liters of fluid, and a cardiac trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed global hypokinesis.
- Gas exchange revealed respiratory acidosis, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed an edematous gallbladder without significant findings.
- A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was unremarkable for dissection, and empirically, heparin was started for concern of primary cardiac etiology vs pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The next day, bright red blood per endotracheal tube (ETT) was noted.
- Over the last 24 hours, the patient was able to wean off dopamine and decrease dobutamine"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient remains in the ICU and is off of dopamine and dobutamine. They are still off of heparin but continue to have a small amount of bright red blood on suctioning. The patient's Hct has increased from 32 to 34. The repeat TTE shows an EF of 20%, which is up from 10%. The RV remains dilated and severely hypokinetic with no focal WMA seen. CE is trending down, and RUQ US shows improvement in GB wall edema. There is no portal vein thrombosis seen. LENIs are negative for DVT. The patient is still on vent support with an ETT advanced approximately 6 cm from the carina. Poor urine output yesterday with only 5-15 cc/hr. A 500cc NS bolus was given without significant change in urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient continues to have a small amount of bright red blood on suctioning despite being off heparin. This may indicate ongoing bleeding or a possible infection.
2. Heart failure: The patient's EF has improved from 10% to 20%, but it is still significantly low, indicating reduced heart function. The dilated and hypokinetic RV suggests possible right-sided heart failure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, with readings of 65,000 and 61,000. This may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's urine output remains low, which can be indicative of renal dysfunction.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient is still on ventilator support, and there is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient remained off dopamine and dobutamine, but continued to show signs of hemodynamic instability with a low blood pressure of 101/59 mmHg. The patient's heart function has improved slightly, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, compared to 10% previously. There is still severe right ventricular hypokinesis. The patient's condition remains critical, and they are still dependent on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability. This could lead to organ perfusion issues and potential organ failure.
2. Right ventricular failure: The patient's right ventricle is severely hypokinetic, which suggests the possibility of right ventricular failure. This can result in decreased cardiac output and hypotension.
3. Mitral regurgitation: The patient has mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, which can contribute to heart failure symptoms and further compromise cardiac function.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a high D-dimer level, indicating a possible risk for thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting a potential infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis or other infections is crucial.
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating possible liver dysfunction. This could be related to the patient's underlying condition or complications from critical illness.
7. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, suggesting potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are essential.

Please note that this is a summary of the progress note and potential medical complications. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional are necessary to confirm these findings and guide appropriate management."

   is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). No masses
   or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity
   is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The
   aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
   ([**2-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   70yo man w/ severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN, who presented w/
   question of GI bleed was stable, then developed sudden shock.  Question
   of MI vs PE +/- sepsis.  Pt slightly improved, pressors being weaned.
   # Shock: likely mixed septic and cardiogenic picture. On dobutamine
   (off dopa).  Re: Cardiogenic Shock: etiologies suspect MI vs PE.  CE
   suggest infarction has occurred.  However,  nothing focal by Echo, just
   global depression of LV & RV function.  PE also quite possible as
   cause,  Unable to eval w/ CTA given renal failure & V/Q felt to be
   minimally usefully given pt
s lung disease (resection & severe COPD).
   TEE did not show aortic dissection.  Pt started on heparin (for MI &
   possible PE), which was discontinued in setting of hemoptysis.   While
   pt Afebrile and CXR unrevealing, does have GNR in sputum.
   -continue zosyn, monitor clinically and by CXR, if decompensates
   consider broadening to double coverage for GNRs. Current plan is 7 day
   course of zosyn, currently day 2.
   - d/c flagyl/vancomycin as no other sources of sepsis have revealed
   themselves.
   - ? consider swan for more accurate hemodynamic monitoring.
   - follow up cards recs
   - restart BB for cardiac protection in setting of possible MI.
   - Continue IV hydrocort today, depending on clinical status, consider
   decreasing tomorrow if stable
   #Respiratory failure
 Pt has c/o severe COPD, recently hospitalized
   for exacerbation, however initially during presentation ventilation was
   not a factor.  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   obtundation.  Had been oxygenating well, minute ventilation increased
   in setting of acidosis.
   -attempt to wean down PEEP and Fi02 as tolerated.
   -SBT and daily wake ups.
   -minimize sedation
   #  ARF: likely acute on chronic due to shock/ATN, trying to now
   maintain MAPS greater than 65.  UOP has dropped off.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] try bolus for UOP, though if minimal response would not push
   further fluid as pt may be in anuric/oliguric stage of ATN
   - renally does all meds
   -renal consult
   <I>## Elevated LFTs:</I> Suspect shock liver
   -continue to trend.
   # Coagulopathy: suspect [**3-17**] liver dysfunction plus pt now on hep gtt
   - hold anticoagulation given pt w/ hemoptytis
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Labs c/w DIC.
   -daily DIC labs
   -Transfuse for <50K if still with hemoptysis
   <I>## COPD:</I>Continue steroids, advair, duonebs

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, lung cancer, congestive heart failure (CHF), and hypertension (HTN). He presented with a question of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and was initially stable, but then developed sudden shock. The question remains whether it was due to myocardial infarction (MI) versus pulmonary embolism (PE) possibly compounded by sepsis. The patient has shown slight improvement, and pressors are being weaned.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing mixed septic and cardiogenic shock. He is on dobutamine (off dopa) and requires careful monitoring. The etiology of cardiogenic shock could be either MI or PE. The echocardiogram suggests infarction, but no focal abnormalities were found. PE is also a possibility, and it cannot be evaluated using computed tomography angiography (CTA) due to renal failure and the patient's severe lung disease. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) did not show aortic dissection. The patient was started on heparin for MI and possible PE but was discontinued due to hemoptysis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe COPD and was intubated for airway protection in the setting of obtundation. He has been oxygenating well, and minute ventilation has increased in response to acidosis. The"

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old man with severe COPD, history of lung cancer, CHF, and hypertension. He presented with a question of GI bleed and was initially stable but then developed sudden shock. The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 20%, indicating poor cardiac function. This could be a contributing factor to the shock state.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings suggest the possibility of a PE. However, further evaluation with CT angiography is difficult due to renal failure and the patient's severe lung disease.

3. Myocardial infarction (MI): The patient has elevated troponin levels, which may indicate an MI. However, there are no focal abnormalities noted on the echocardiogram.

4. Sepsis: The patient's profound lactate elevation suggests possible sepsis. Bowel ischemia is a potential source of infection, but abdominal ultrasound with dopplers did not reveal any compromised grafts. Chronic cholecystitis with acalculous cholecystitis is another possible source of infection.

5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's current renal function is impaired, likely due to shock/acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of urine output and"

   Assessment and Plan
   70yo man w/ severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN, who presented w/
   question of GI bleed was stable, then developed sudden shock.  Question
   of MI vs PE +/- sepsis.
   # Shock: At this point presuming primary insult precipitating
   cardiogenic shock was major MI.  [**Month (only) 60**] at this point be clouded picture
   with possible component of a septic picture.  Pt still requiring
   pressors, may be indicative of increased ventricular stretch in setting
   of fluid overload from oliguria, placing patient outside of starling
   curve.
   -continue zosyn, monitor clinically and by CXR, if decompensates
   consider broadening to double coverage for GNRs. Current plan is 7 day
   course of zosyn, currently day3.
   - follow up cards recs
   - Hold BB, (started yesterday) as pt requiring B-agonist based
   pressors.
   - Taper steroids to PO prednisone 60 day for planned 2 week taper.
   -d/w renal when to do HD, may need on pressors for optimal fluid
   removal.
   -d/w cards med optimization at this point and when to re-echo.
   #Respiratory failure
 Pt has c/o severe COPD, recently hospitalized
   for exacerbation, however initially during presentation ventilation was
   not a factor.  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   obtundation.  Had been oxygenating well, minute ventilation increased
   in setting of acidosis.  Tried to decrease Fi02 yesterday, increased
   A-a gradient, likely fluid overload.
   -SBT and daily wake ups.
   -minimize sedation
   -Fluid removal as below.
   -will tolerate relative hypoxemia given pt
s known severe COPD.
   -trend ABGs
   #  ARF: likely acute on chronic due to shock/ATN, trying to now
   maintain MAPS greater than 65.  Oliguric with persistently climbing
   BUN/cr, with non-gap metabolic acidosis. Urine sediment with  muddy
   brown casts consistent with ATN. Unclear if pt would regain much renal
   function at this point.  Pt currently up 11L this admission.
   -Appreciate renal involvement
   -tx 2 units FFP today, renal fellow to place temporary HD catheter for
   HD today or tomorrow.
   -Monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes, treat K as needed.
   -minimize IVF given
   -renally dose meds.
   <I>## Elevated LFTs:</I> Suspect shock liver
   -transaminases trending down, bili trending up, continue to follow
   bili.
   # Coagulopathy: suspect [**3-17**] liver dysfunction plus pt now on hep gtt
   - hold anticoagulation given pt w/ hemoptytis
   -FFP as above for HD line placement
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Labs c/w DIC.
   -daily DIC labs
   -Transfuse for <50K if still with hemoptysis
   <I>## COPD:</I>Continue steroids (tapering down today),  duonebs

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with severe COPD, a history of lung cancer, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and recent presentation with a possible gastrointestinal bleed. He was initially stable but then developed sudden shock. The differential diagnosis includes myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, or a combination of these conditions. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and requires pressors to maintain blood pressure. He has hemoptysis and his chest x-ray has not changed. Renal consultation recommends hemodialysis due to acute kidney injury likely caused by shock and acute tubular necrosis. There are multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe COPD and was intubated for airway protection. He requires assistance in oxygenation and ventilation, and there is a concern about fluid overload.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient is oliguric with persistently climbing BUN/Cr levels, indicating a decrease in kidney function. The presence of muddy brown casts suggests acute tubular necrosis.
3. Elevated liver function tests: The patient has elevated transaminases and bilirubin, which could be due to shock liver or liver dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70yo man w/ severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN, who presented w/
   question of GI bleed was stable, then developed sudden shock.  Question
   of MI vs PE +/- sepsis.  Pt slightly improved, pressors being weaned.
   # Shock: likely mixed septic and cardiogenic picture. On dobutamine
   (off dopa).  Re: Cardiogenic Shock: etiologies suspect MI vs PE.  CE
   suggest infarction has occurred.  However,  nothing focal by Echo, just
   global depression of LV & RV function.  PE also quite possible as
   cause,  Unable to eval w/ CTA given renal failure & V/Q felt to be
   minimally usefully given pt
s lung disease (resection & severe COPD).
   TEE did not show aortic dissection.  Pt started on heparin (for MI &
   possible PE), which was discontinued in setting of hemoptysis.   While
   pt Afebrile and CXR unrevealing, does have GNR in sputum.
   -continue zosyn, monitor clinically and by CXR, if decompensates
   consider broadening to double coverage for GNRs. Current plan is 7 day
   course of zosyn, currently day 2.
   - d/c flagyl/vancomycin as no other sources of sepsis have revealed
   themselves.
   - ? consider swan for more accurate hemodynamic monitoring.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with severe COPD, history of lung cancer, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and recent hospitalization for exacerbation of COPD. He presented with a question of gastrointestinal bleed but was initially stable. However, he then developed sudden shock and is currently in the ICU.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: likely mixed septic and cardiogenic picture. The patient is on dobutamine (off dopa). Re: Cardiogenic Shock: etiologies suspect MI vs PE. CE suggest infarction has occurred. However, nothing focal by Echo, just global depression of LV & RV function. PE also quite possible as cause, Unable to eval w/ CTA given renal failure & V/Q felt to be minimally usefully given pt's lung disease (resection & severe COPD).
2. TEE did not show aortic dissection. Pt started on heparin (for MI & possible PE), which was discontinued in setting of hemoptysis.
3. While pt Afebrile and CXR unrevealing, does have GNR in sputum. -continue zosyn, monitor clinically and by CXR, if decompensates consider broadening to double coverage for GNRs. Current plan is 7 day course of zosyn, currently day 2.
4. d/c flagyl/vancomycin as no other sources of sepsis have revealed themselves.
5.? consider swan for more accurate hemodynamic monitoring.
6. follow up cards recs
7. restart BB for cardiac protection in setting of possible MI.
8. Continue IV hydrocort today, depending on clinical status, consider decreasing tomorrow if stable

   Assessment and Plan
   70yo man w/ severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN, who presented w/
   question of GI bleed was stable, then developed sudden shock.  Question
   of MI vs PE +/- sepsis.
   # Shock: At this point presuming primary insult precipitating
   cardiogenic shock was major MI.  [**Month (only) 60**] at this point be clouded picture
   with possible component of a septic picture.  Pt still requiring
   pressors, may be indicative of increased ventricular stretch in setting
   of fluid overload from oliguria, placing patient outside of starling
   curve.
   -continue zosyn, monitor clinically and by CXR, if decompensates
   consider broadening to double coverage for GNRs. Current plan is 7 day
   course of zosyn, currently day 4.
   - follow up cards recs, will discuss with them today recommendations
   regarding when to start aspirin, increasing statin in setting of
   recovering shock liver and guidance with starting BB and possibly ACEI
   in setting of depressed EF, ? when to repeat TTE.
   - Continue to hold BB while on dopamine
   - Taper steroids to PO solumedrol (currently 20mg Q8)
   -fluid removal with HD per renal, see below.
   -wean pressors as tolerated after dialysis.
   #Respiratory failure
 Pt has c/o severe COPD, recently hospitalized
   for exacerbation, however initially during presentation ventilation was
   not a factor.  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   obtundation.  Had been oxygenating well, minute ventilation increased
   in setting of acidosis.  Tried to decrease Fi02, increased A-a
   gradient, likely fluid overload.  Better oxygenation on gas this
   morning.
   -continue daily wake ups, response this morning encouraging in terms of
   mental status.
   -minimize sedation
   -Fluid removal as below.
   -will tolerate relative hypoxemia given pt
s known severe COPD.
   -Will decrease Fi02 after dialysis, SBT, consider extubation in am,
   will need to hold TF
   #  ARF: likely acute on chronic due to shock/ATN, trying to now
   maintain MAPS greater than 65.  Oliguric with persistently climbing
   BUN/cr, with non-gap metabolic acidosis. Urine sediment with  muddy
   brown casts consistent with ATN. Unclear if pt would regain much renal
   function at this point.  Pt currently up 11L this admission.
   -Appreciate renal involvement, goal to remove as much fluid as possible
   using pressors as necessary to make this possible.
   -tx 3 units FFP yesterday, had LIJ HD catheter place, required
   transfusion of blood and platelets in this setting with significant
   bleeding and hematoma formation.
   -Monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes, treat K as needed.
   -minimize IVF given
   -renally dose meds.
   <I>## Elevated LFTs:</I> Suspect shock liver
   -transaminases trending down, bili trending up, continue to follow
   bili.
   -caution with increasing statin.
   # Coagulopathy: suspect [**3-17**] liver dysfunction and DIC
   - d/w cards when to start asa again,
   -monitor INR/CBC, give products when necessary for procedures or
   bleeding.
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Labs c/w DIC.
   -Tx for platelets <50 or active bleeding.
   <I>## COPD:</I>Continue steroids (tapering down today),  duonebs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, lung cancer, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), who presented with a question of gastrointestinal bleed. The patient was initially stable but then developed sudden shock. There is a clouded picture with possible components of a septic picture, cardiogenic shock, or pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's current condition includes persistent pressor requirement, development of a hematoma at the left HD line site with associated drop in hematocrit (HCT), and an ongoing need for mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's renal function is compromised, with acute renal failure (ARF) likely acute on chronic due to shock/acute tubular necrosis (ATN). 

The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). There is also evidence of a central line infection and an active infection in the respiratory tract.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's presentation suggests the possibility of cardiogenic shock, which could be secondary to a major myocardial infarction (MI). This condition requires immediate management with appropriate pressors and fluid resuscitation.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD exacerbation has led to respiratory failure, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of arterial line stop and development of a hematoma at the left HD line site. The patient has a history of allergies to Univasc (cough), Lipitor (leg cramps), Vitamin E (epistaxis), and Ambien (disorientation). The patient was previously on antibiotics including Vancomycin, Metronidazole, and Piperacillin.

Currently, the patient is receiving infusions of Fentanyl and Dopamine, as well as other ICU medications such as Pantoprazole and Insulin. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent development of a hematoma.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/77mmHg to 157/86mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,377 mL and output of 102 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,275 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, set at a tidal volume of 728 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.28, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 404, and respiratory rate of 11.3 L/min.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.8 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 31.9%, decreased platelet count (Plt) of 51 K/uL, increased creatinine (Cr) of 5.7 mg/dL, and elevated troponin-T level of 7.67. Other labs are within normal range or show no significant abnormalities.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition with Nutren Renal, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a code status of full code and the disposition is not specified.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the hematoma, infection due to the presence of lines and catheters, worsening renal function, development of stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding, and complications related to mechanical ventilation."

   Assessment and Plan
   70yo man w/ severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN, who presented w/
   question of GI bleed was stable, then developed sudden shock.  Question
   of MI vs PE +/- sepsis.
   # Shock: At this point presuming primary insult precipitating
   cardiogenic shock was major MI.  [**Month (only) 60**] at this point be clouded picture
   with possible component of a septic picture.  Pt still requiring
   pressors, may be indicative of increased ventricular stretch in setting
   of fluid overload from oliguria, placing patient outside of starling
   curve.
   -continue zosyn, monitor clinically and by CXR, if decompensates
   consider broadening to double coverage for GNRs. Current plan is 7 day
   course of zosyn, currently day3.
   - follow up cards recs
   - Hold BB, (started yesterday) as pt requiring B-agonist based
   pressors.
   - Taper steroids to PO prednisone 60 day for planned 2 week taper.
   -d/w renal when to do HD, may need on pressors for optimal fluid
   removal.
   -d/w cards med optimization at this point and when to re-echo.
   #Respiratory failure
 Pt has c/o severe COPD, recently hospitalized
   for exacerbation, however initially during presentation ventilation was
   not a factor.  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   obtundation.  Had been oxygenating well, minute ventilation increased
   in setting of acidosis.  Tried to decrease Fi02 yesterday, increased
   A-a gradient, likely fluid overload.
   -SBT and daily wake ups.
   -minimize sedation
   -Fluid removal as below.
   -will tolerate relative hypoxemia given pt
s known severe COPD.
   -trend ABGs
   #  ARF: likely acute on chronic due to shock/ATN, trying to now
   maintain MAPS greater than 65.  Oliguric with persistently climbing
   BUN/cr, with non-gap metabolic acidosis. Urine sediment with  muddy
   brown casts consistent with ATN. Unclear if pt would regain much renal
   function at this point.  Pt currently up 11L this admission.
   -Appreciate renal involvement
   -tx 2 units FFP today, renal fellow to place temporary HD catheter for
   HD today or tomorrow.
   -Monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes, treat K as needed.
   -minimize IVF given
   -renally dose meds.
   <I>## Elevated LFTs:</I> Suspect shock liver
   -transaminases trending down, bili trending up, continue to follow
   bili.
   # Coagulopathy: suspect [**3-17**] liver dysfunction plus pt now on hep gtt
   - hold anticoagulation given pt w/ hemoptytis
   -FFP as above for HD line placement
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Labs c/w DIC.
   -daily DIC labs
   -Transfuse for <50K if still with hemoptysis

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old man with severe COPD, a history of lung cancer, CHF, and HTN.
- He presented with a question of GI bleed but was initially stable.
- He then developed sudden shock, and the differential diagnosis includes MI, PE, or sepsis.
- The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, likely due to a major MI, but there may also be a component of septic shock.
- He is still requiring pressors and may have fluid overload from oliguria, causing increased ventricular stretch.
- The patient's respiratory failure is due to severe COPD exacerbation, and he was intubated for airway protection.
- There is a concern for acute renal failure (ARF) due to shock and acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- The patient's liver function tests are elevated, indicating possible shock liver.
- There is also a concern for coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- The patient has thrush and requires treatment with nystatin.
- The patient's nutritional needs are being met through total parenteral nutrition (TF).
- The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored and managed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure if not managed appropriately.

   Assessment and Plan
   70yo man w/ severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN, who presented w/
   question of GI bleed was stable, then developed sudden shock.  Question
   of MI vs PE +/- sepsis.
   # Shock: At this point presuming primary insult precipitating
   cardiogenic shock was major MI.  [**Month (only) 60**] at this point be clouded picture
   with possible component of a septic picture.  Now weaned off
   pressors.
   -continue Zosyn for GNRs in sputum, monitor clinically and by CXR, if
   decompensates consider broadening to double coverage for GNRs. Current
   plan is 7 day course of zosyn, currently day 5.
   -check CTA today to evaluate for evidence of PE
   - follow up cards recs, will discuss with them today recommendations
   regarding when to start aspirin, increasing statin in setting of
   recovering shock liver and guidance with starting BB and possibly ACEI
   in setting of depressed EF, ? when to repeat TTE.
   - Taper steroids to PO solumedrol (currently 20mg Q8)
   -fluid removal with HD per renal, see below.
   -have weaned dopamine after HD
   #Respiratory failure: Pt has c/o severe COPD, recently hospitalized for
   exacerbation, however initially during presentation ventilation was not
   a factor.  Intubated for airway protection in setting of obtundation.
   Currently oxygenating and ventilating well on SBT.
   -check CO2 on VBG and consider extubation this morning
   -continue fluid removal as below
   -will tolerate relative hypoxemia given pt
s known severe COPD.
   #  ARF: likely acute on chronic due to shock/ATN, trying to now
   maintain MAPS greater than 65.  Oliguric with persistently climbing
   BUN/cr, with non-gap metabolic acidosis. Urine sediment with  muddy
   brown casts consistent with ATN. Unclear if pt would regain much renal
   function at this point.  Pt currently up 11L this admission.
   -Appreciate renal involvement, goal to remove as much fluid as possible
   using pressors as necessary to make this possible.
   -Monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes, treat K as needed.
   -minimize IVF given
   -renally dose meds.
   ## Elevated LFTs: Suspect shock liver
   -transaminases trending down, bili trending up, continue to follow
   bili.
   -caution with increasing statin.
   # Coagulopathy: suspect second to liver dysfunction and DIC
   - d/w cards when to start asa again,
   -monitor INR/CBC, give products when necessary for procedures or
   bleeding.
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Labs c/w DIC.
   -Tx for platelets <50 or active bleeding.
   ## COPD: Continue steroids (tapering down as above),  Duonebs
   .
   ## HTN: Continue to hold all antihypertensives though will start to
   re-add as tolerated and per cards recs
   .
   ## HL: Continue statin, consider increasing
   #Thrush: continue nystatin

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with severe COPD, history of lung cancer, CHF, and HTN. He presented with a question of GI bleed and was initially stable but then developed sudden shock. The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Shock: The patient is presumed to have cardiogenic shock due to a major myocardial infarction (MI). However, there is a possibility of septic shock as well. The patient has been weaned off pressors but will continue to be monitored closely.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe COPD and was intubated for airway protection. He is currently oxygenating and ventilating well on spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The plan is to check CO2 on arterial blood gas (VBG) and consider extubation this morning. Fluid removal will continue as well.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient likely has acute renal failure on chronic due to shock/acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAPS) greater than 65 and remove as much fluid as possible using pressors if necessary. Monitoring of electrolytes will be appreciated, and treatment for hyperkalemia will be done as needed. Minimizing intravenous fluids and renally dosing medications will also be considered.

4. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): The patient has elevated LFTs, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   70yo man w/ severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN, who presented w/
   question of GI bleed was stable, then developed sudden shock.  Question
   of MI vs PE +/- sepsis.
   # Shock: At this point presuming primary insult precipitating
   cardiogenic shock was major MI.  [**Month (only) 60**] at this point be clouded picture
   with possible component of a septic picture.  Pt still requiring
   pressors, may be indicative of increased ventricular stretch in setting
   of fluid overload from oliguria, placing patient outside of starling
   curve.
   -continue Zosyn, monitor clinically and by CXR, if decompensates
   consider broadening to double coverage for GNRs. Current plan is 7 day
   course of zosyn, currently day 5.
   - follow up cards recs, will discuss with them today recommendations
   regarding when to start aspirin, increasing statin in setting of
   recovering shock liver and guidance with starting BB and possibly ACEI
   in setting of depressed EF, ? when to repeat TTE.
   - Continue to hold BB while on dopamine
   - Taper steroids to PO solumedrol (currently 20mg Q8)
   -fluid removal with HD per renal, see below.
   -have weaned dopamine after HD
   #Respiratory failure: Pt has c/o severe COPD, recently hospitalized for
   exacerbation, however initially during presentation ventilation was not
   a factor.  Intubated for airway protection in setting of obtundation.
   Had been oxygenating well, minute ventilation increased in setting of
   acidosis.  Tried to decrease Fi02, increased A-a gradient, likely fluid
   overload.
   -continue daily wake ups, response this morning encouraging in terms of
   mental status.
   -minimize sedation
   -Fluid removal as below.
   -will tolerate relative hypoxemia given pt
s known severe COPD.
   -Will decrease FiO2 after dialysis, SBT, consider extubation today,
   will need to hold TF
   #  ARF: likely acute on chronic due to shock/ATN, trying to now
   maintain MAPS greater than 65.  Oliguric with persistently climbing
   BUN/cr, with non-gap metabolic acidosis. Urine sediment with  muddy
   brown casts consistent with ATN. Unclear if pt would regain much renal
   function at this point.  Pt currently up 11L this admission.
   -Appreciate renal involvement, goal to remove as much fluid as possible
   using pressors as necessary to make this possible.
   -tx 3 units FFP yesterday, had LIJ HD catheter place, required
   transfusion of blood and platelets in this setting with significant
   bleeding and hematoma formation.
   -Monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes, treat K as needed.
   -minimize IVF given
   -renally dose meds.
   ## Elevated LFTs: Suspect shock liver
   -transaminases trending down, bili trending up, continue to follow
   bili.
   -caution with increasing statin.
   # Coagulopathy: suspect second to liver dysfunction and DIC
   - d/w cards when to start asa again,
   -monitor INR/CBC, give products when necessary for procedures or
   bleeding.
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Labs c/w DIC.
   -Tx for platelets <50 or active bleeding.
   ## COPD: Continue steroids (tapering down today),  duonebs
   .
   ## HTN: Continue to hold all antihypertensives
   .
   ## HL: Continue statin, consider increasing
   #Thrush: continue nystatin

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with severe COPD, a history of lung cancer, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. He presented with questions of myocardial infarction (MI) versus pulmonary embolism (PE) with possible sepsis. The patient was initially stable but then developed sudden shock. At this point, the primary insult precipitating cardiogenic shock is presumed to be a major MI. However, there may also be components of septic shock.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving pressors, and has oliguria with persistent BUN/Cr climbing, non-gap metabolic acidosis, and muddy brown casts in urine sediment, which are consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient has also shown thrombocytopenia and elevated liver function tests (LFTs), suggesting a potential coagulopathy secondary to liver dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, elevated LFTs, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. The plan includes continuing the current antibiotic therapy, monitoring clinically and by chest X-ray, considering broadening to double coverage for Gram-negative rods if the patient decompensates. The patient's condition will be discussed with the cardiology team regarding when to start aspirin, increasing statin therapy in the setting of recovering shock liver, and guidance"

His oxygen saturation dropped to 88% on FiO2 0.4, and he had a spontaneous breathing trial in the 30s this morning. The patient has been off total parenteral nutrition since Monday for possible extubation. 

The patient's allergies include Univasc (oral), Lipitor (oral), Vitamin E, epistaxis, and Ambien (oral). The last dose of antibiotics was metronidazole on October 13th at 10:00 AM, followed by piperacillin on October 16th at 6:04 AM. 

Infusions include fentanyl at 50 mcg/hour, and other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) since October 15th at 8:16 PM. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. 

Flow sheet data shows vital signs with a maximum temperature of 36.3 C (97.4 F), current temperature of 36 C (96.8 F), heart rate of 96 bpm (69-98 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 159/82 mmHg to 126/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute (10-21 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure of 15 mmHg (4-19 mmHg), fluid intake of 2066 mL (200 mL), fluid output of 1686 mL (30 mL), urine output of 186 mL (30 mL), and a balance of 380 mL (170 mL). 

Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, tidal volume of 922 mL (341-967 mL), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 35, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 17 cmH2O, and arterial blood gas (ABG) of ///21/. 

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic status. 

Laboratory results show white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 19.0 to 21.6 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 31.9% to 33.6%, platelet (Plt) count ranging from 65 to 119 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) ranging"

   Assessment and Plan   70 yr old man with severe COPD on (steroids high
   dose), HTN, diastolic CHF, lung cancer s/p resection, severe PVC with
   AAA with extensive AA graft who developed acute cardiogenic shock and
   hemoptysis; etiology unclear but most likely etiology is cardiogenic
   shock most likely [**3-17**] MI. Course has been complicated by acute
   respiratory failure and acute renal failure.
   1)       Shock: Initially unclear etiology
 PE vs primary cardiac
   process. No e/o DVT in LEs. No initial CTA (renal failure) No
   anticoagulation or aspirin [**3-17**] significant hemoptysis. Continue statin,
   consider increasing dose given transaminases improving. Suspect that
   his persistent current hypotension may be exacerbated by his
   significant volume overload and increased afterload
 will follow with
   HD / some volume removal. Hydrocort changed to methylprednisone given
   critically ill status.
   2)       Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection
   in the setting of altered mental status.  Passing SBT will extubate
   today pending VBG.  Will also check CTPA given dialysis as this will
   change overall management goal.  Anticoagulation vrs primary cardiac
   management. Continue to treat the GNRs in his sputum with Zosyn.
   Titrate steroids.
   3)       ID: Await speciation of GNRs in sputum. Off Vanc and Flagyl
   but would continue Zosyn. Follow cultures and clinical status.
   4)       Renal: Appreciate Renal assistance for oliguric ATN; now ~11
   liters up during this hospitalization. Undergoing dialysis today.
   Calcium acetate for elevated calcium / phos product.
   5)       Cardiac: Not cycling enzymes now that infarct appears to have
   completed. Will restart low dose beta-blocker as pressure allows.
   Continue statin, consider increasing dose but would request Cardiology
   to re-evaluate and comment on this. Off dobutamine. Will ask Cardiology
   regarding timing of next TTE to follow EF, global hypokinesis.
   6)       Heme: Positive DIC panel but improving. INR remains elevated
   but improving. Thrombocytopenia persists. No e/o active bleeding
   (minimal bloody secretions in the ETT suction.) Follow H/H, transfusion
   goal > 30% in setting of CAD / cardiogenic shock.
   7)       F/E/N: Had been tolerating TFs. Consider increasing bowel
   regimen to include Lactulose. Follow / replete
lytes in setting of
   renal failure. Continue Calcium Acetate.
   8)       Liver: Transaminases improving as his shock liver resolves.
   Monitor LFTs, bili, INR.  Will consider repeat RUQ ultrasound when more
   stable if any clinical change.
   9)       Endo: RSSI, follow sugars. Changed Hydrocortisone to
   Prednisone [**10-14**]; Will continue methylpred above.
   10)   Code: full; Access: L IJ dialysis cath, R IJ triple lumen, hold
   on replacing A-line; Dispo: MICU.

","The patient is a 70-year-old man with severe COPD, hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), lung cancer status post resection, and an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) who presented with hematemesis and a fall with head trauma. In the emergency room, his lactate levels were elevated, and an ultrasound revealed a thickened wall with edema in his gallbladder. On hospital day (HD) 1, he became cold, clammy, hypotensive, and developed tachypnea and chest pain, which was later ruled in as a positive cardiac enzyme indicating a myocardial infarction (MI). He received femoral arterial line, venous access, started dopamine peripheral, and subsequently developed tachycardia. The patient was switched to dopamine and dobutamine. He received 3 liters of fluid, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed no dissection. Heparin was started empirically for concern of primary cardiac etiology versus pulmonary embolism (PE). The next morning, he developed bright red blood per endotracheal tube. Currently, he is off all pressors and now on HD.

The patient's allergies include Univas (oral), Lipitor (oral), Vitamin E, epistaxis, Ambien (oral), and disorientation. His last doses of antibiotics were metronidazole on 10/13/2103 at 10:00 AM and piperacillin on 10/16/2103 at 06:04 AM. The patient is currently on fentanyl infusion at 50 mcg/hour. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) on 10/15/2103 at 08:16 PM, and other medications include protonix, fluoxetine, simvastatin, MVI, Neurontin, Nystatin, RISS, MDI (atrovent/albuterol Q4), foslo, and methylprednisolone 20 mg three times a day.

The patient's vital signs on 10/16/2103 at 08:45 AM were as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
- Heart rate: 91 bpm (69-99 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 143/91 mmHg (100/126-160/98 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (10-19 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's height is 68 inches, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg (4-19 mmHg). Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,066 mL and total output of 1,686 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 380 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on 50% FiO2 with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 35.

Physical examination findings include an intubated patient with opening eyes to voice and following some commands. The endotracheal tube (ETT) is in place, and there is a left neck hematoma that is stable. Cardiac examination reveals S1S2 soft HS, no murmurs, or heaves. Lung examination shows clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly without crackles/wheezing. Abdominal examination is positive for bowel sounds, normal tone, and no masses. Extremity examination shows peripheral edema in upper and"

   Assessment and Plan   70 yr old man with severe COPD on (steroids high
   dose), HTN, diastolic CHF, lung cancer s/p resection, severe PVC with
   AAA with extensive AA graft who developed acute cardiogenic shock and
   hemoptysis; etiology unclear but most likely etiology is cardiogenic
   shock most likely [**3-17**] MI. Course has been complicated by acute
   respiratory failure and acute renal failure.
   1)       Shock: Initially unclear etiology
 PE vs primary cardiac
   process. No e/o DVT in LEs. No initial CTA (renal failure) No
   anticoagulation or aspirin [**3-17**] significant hemoptysis. Continue statin,
   consider increasing dose given transaminases improving. Suspect that
   his persistent current hypotension may be exacerbated by his
   significant volume overload and increased afterload
 will follow with
   HD / some volume removal. Hydrocort changed to methylprednisone given
   critically ill status.
   2)       Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection
   in the setting of altered mental status.  Passing SBT will extubate
   today pending VBG.  Will also check CTPA given dialysis as this will
   change overall management goal.  Anticoagulation vrs primary cardiac
   management. Continue to treat the GNRs in his sputum with Zosyn.
   Titrate steroids.
   3)       ID: Await speciation of GNRs in sputum. Off Vanc and Flagyl
   but would continue Zosyn. Follow cultures and clinical status.
   4)       Renal: Appreciate Renal assistance for oliguric ATN; now ~11
   liters up during this hospitalization. Undergoing dialysis today.
   Calcium acetate for elevated calcium / phos product.
   5)       Cardiac: Not cycling enzymes now that infarct appears to have
   completed. Will restart low dose beta-blocker as pressure allows.
   Continue statin, consider increasing dose but would request Cardiology
   to re-evaluate and comment on this. Off dobutamine. Will ask Cardiology
   regarding timing of next TTE to follow EF, global hypokinesis.
   6)       Heme: Positive DIC panel but improving. INR remains elevated
   but improving. Thrombocytopenia persists. No e/o active bleeding
   (minimal bloody secretions in the ETT suction.) Follow H/H, transfusion
   goal > 30% in setting of CAD / cardiogenic shock.
   7)       F/E/N: Had been tolerating TFs. Consider increasing bowel
   regimen to include Lactulose. Follow / replete
lytes in setting of
   renal failure. Continue Calcium Acetate.
   8)       Liver: Transaminases improving as his shock liver resolves.
   Monitor LFTs, bili, INR.  Will consider repeat RUQ ultrasound when more
   stable if any clinical change.
   9)       Endo: RSSI, follow sugars. Changed Hydrocortisone to
   Prednisone [**10-14**]; Will continue methylpred above.
   10)   Code: full; Access: L IJ dialysis cath, R IJ triple lumen, hold
   on replacing A-line; Dispo: MICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:

A 70-year-old male patient with a history of severe COPD, hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), lung cancer post resection, and an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) presented with hematemesis and a fall resulting in head trauma. In the Emergency Room, the patient had an abnormal gallbladder on ultrasound with a thickened wall and edema. The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, leading to cardiogenic shock and acute respiratory failure. The etiology of the shock is unclear, but it is likely due to a primary cardiac process or pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient required intubation for airway protection and was started on dopamine and dobutamine for hemodynamic support.

The patient's course has been complicated by acute renal failure, and he is currently undergoing dialysis. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but he still requires supplemental oxygen. His neurological status is improving, as he is now following some commands. The patient's blood pressure remains unstable, and he has evidence of positive blood cultures for gram-negative rods (GNRs), which are being treated with Zosyn.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, suggesting myocardial infarction (MI). He is being treated with statins, and the dosage may be increased. The patient has a history of allergies to several medications, including Uvasc, Lipitor, Vitamin E, Ambien, and Fluoxetine."

   Assessment and Plan   70 yr old man with severe COPD on (steroids high
   dose), HTN, diastolic CHF, lung cancer s/p resection, severe PVC with
   AAA with extensive AA graft who developed acute cardiogenic shock and
   hemoptysis; etiology unclear but most likely etiology is cardiogenic
   shock most likely [**3-17**] MI. Course has been complicated by acute
   respiratory failure and acute renal failure.
   1)       Shock: Initially unclear etiology
 PE vs primary cardiac
   process. No e/o DVT in LEs. No CTA (renal failure) No anticoagulation
   or aspirin [**3-17**] significant hemoptysis. Continue statin, consider
   increasing dose given transaminases improving. Suspect that his
   persistent current hypotension may be exacerbated by his significant
   volume overload and increased afterload
 will follow with HD / some
   volume removal. Hydrocort changed to Prednisone on [**10-15**], will change
   this to methylprednisone given critically ill status (and perhaps
   inefficient metabolism of prednisone to methylprednisone.)
   2)       Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection
   in the setting of altered mental status.  Passing SBT will extubate
   today pending VBG.  Will also check CTPA given dialysis as this will
   change overall management goal.  Anticoagulation vrs primary cardiac
   management. Continue to treat the GNRs in his sputum with Zosyn.
   3)       ID: Await speciation of GNRs in sputum. Off Vanc and Flagyl
   but would continue Zosyn. Follow cultures and clinical status.
   4)       Renal: Appreciate Renal assistance for oliguric ATN; now ~11
   liters up during this hospitalization. Undergoing dialysis today.
   Calcium acetate for elevated calcium / phos product.
   5)       Cardiac: Not cycling enzymes now that infarct appears to have
   completed. Will restart low dose beta-blocker as pressure allows.
   Continue statin, consider increasing dose but would request Cardiology
   to re-evaluate and comment on this. Off dobutamine. Will ask Cardiology
   regarding timing of next TTE to follow EF, global hypokinesis.
   6)       Heme: Positive DIC panel but improving. INR remains elevated
   but improving. Thrombocytopenia persists. No e/o active bleeding
   (minimal bloody secretions in the ETT suction.) Follow H/H, transfusion
   goal > 30% in setting of CAD / cardiogenic shock.
   7)       F/E/N: Had been tolerating TFs but high residuals today.
   Consider increasing bowel regimen to include Lactulose. Follow /
   replete
lytes in setting of renal failure. Continue Calcium Acetate.
   8)       Liver: Transaminases improving as his shock liver resolves.
   Monitor LFTs, bili, INR.  Will consider repeat RUQ ultrasound when more
   stable if any clinical change.
   9)       Endo: RSSI, follow sugars. Changed Hydrocortisone to
   Prednisone [**10-14**]; will change to methylpred above.
   10)   Code: full; Access: L IJ dialysis cath, R IJ triple lumen, hold
   on replacing A-line; Dispo: MICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with severe COPD, hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF) due to cardiomyopathy after chemotherapy, lung cancer surgery, and an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) scheduled for repair. He presented with hematemesis and a fall with head trauma. In the emergency room, his lactate level was elevated, and an ultrasound revealed an abnormal gallbladder with a thickened wall and edema. He was admitted to the ICU and initially required femoral arterial and venous access, as well as dopamine and dobutamine infusions due to hypotension and tachypnea. He received 3 liters of fluids and had a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which showed global hypokinesis but no dissection. Heparin was started for concern of primary cardiac etiology versus pulmonary embolism (PE). The next day, he developed bright red blood per endotracheal tube, and his condition deteriorated, leading to the suspicion of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) as the likely cause of cardiogenic shock.

The patient's allergies include Univasc, Lipitor, Vitamin E, Ambien, and epistaxis. His last doses of antibiotics were metronidazole on 10/13/2103 at 10:00 AM and piperacillin on 10/16/2103 at 06:04 AM. He is currently on fentanyl infusion and pantoprazole (Protonix). Other medications include protonix, fluoxetine, simvastatin, MVI, neurontin, nystatin, RISS, MDI (atrovent/albuterol q4), foslo, and methylprednisolone 20mg tid.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 143/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and his CVP is 12 mmHg. He has received a total of 2,066 mL of fluids, with an output of 1,686 mL. His respiratory support includes being on 50% FiO2 and in CPAP/PSV mode with a respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) of 35. His physical examination shows that he is intubated, opening his eyes to voice, and following some commands. There is a left neck hematoma present.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), with decreased troponin-T and TCO2 levels. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of epistaxis. He has a history of allergies to Univas (moexipril Hcl), Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium), and Ambien (zolpidem tartrate). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various medications, including fentanyl for pain management, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and other ICU medications. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/91 mmHg to 160/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 467 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 35. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.21, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 90%.

   -continue Zosyn for GNRs in sputum, monitor clinically and by CXR, if
   decompensates consider broadening to double coverage for GNRs. Current
   plan is 7 day course of zosyn, currently day 5.
   -check CTA today to evaluate for evidence of PE
   - follow up cards recs, will discuss with them today recommendations
   regarding when to start aspirin, increasing statin in setting of
   recovering shock liver and guidance with starting BB and possibly [**Month (only) 3253**]

   #Respiratory failure: Pt has c/o severe COPD, recently hospitalized for
   exacerbation, however initially during presentation ventilation was not
   a factor.  Intubated for airway protection in setting of obtundation.
   Currently oxygenating and ventilating well on SBT.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), complicated aortic grafts, lung cancer, parotid gland cancer, and chemically induced cardiomyopathy. He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and initially presented with vital signs within normal limits. However, he became acutely hypotensive and developed signs of cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to a major myocardial infarction (MI). The patient also had recurrent upper GI bleeding and was found to have severe lactic acidosis. A bedside transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed global akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of less than 10%. 

Further evaluation ruled out sepsis and bowel ischemia, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the absence of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's shock was complicated by acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with persistent renal failure, for which he required hemodialysis (HD). He also had an enterobacter infection in his sputum.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 117/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. Physical examination findings include a small tender pink swelling on the occiput, thrush, and a distant heart sound. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal anasarca, small pleural effusion, and ascites in the upper abdomen, as well as improvement in consolidation of the right lower lobe but slight worsening of the left lower lobe consolidation.

The patient's current plan includes continuing Zosyn for GNRs in sputum, monitoring clinically and by chest X-ray, and considering broadening antibiotic coverage if decompensates. Fluid removal with HD is ongoing, and the patient is being weaned off pressors. The plan is to check CTA today to evaluate for evidence of PE, follow up on cardiology recommendations regarding starting aspirin, increasing statin in the setting of recovering shock liver, and guidance with starting beta-blockers and possibly [**Month (only) 3253**] in the setting of depressed EF. Tapering steroids to PO solumedrol and considering extubation this morning are also part of the plan."

   grafts, h/o lung cancer and parotid gland cancer with associated chemo
   induced cardiomyopathy (prior to this admission EF 40-50%).  Admitted
   with UGIB, initially VSS, hemodynamically stable with HCT >40.  On
   evening of admission became acutely hypotensive, clamped down and
   cyanotic, had chest pain and respiratory distress, intubated and
   lined.  Found to have severe lactic acidosis, stat bedside TEE with
   global akinesis, EF <10%.  Transient heparin
 recurrent upper GI bleed.
   Initial thought was sepsis vs bowel ischemia which were both ruled out,
   had CTA yesterday which ruled out PE.  Current theory is that pt had
   large MI precipitating cardiogenic shock.  His shock was complicated by
   ATN with persistent renal failure, now on HD, has temporary left IJ
   dialysis line.   Of note, the patient was also found to have
   enterobacter in his sputum for which he is being treated.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, severe peripheral vascular disease, complicated aortic grafts, lung cancer, parotid gland cancer, and chemically induced cardiomyopathy. He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and initially presented well, but then became hypotensive and developed shock. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues, including a possible large myocardial infarction (MI), cardiogenic shock, acute kidney injury (ATN), enterobacter in sputum, and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications:
1. Shock: The patient experienced cardiogenic shock, which is a potentially life-threatening condition where the heart fails to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient has signs of ATN, which can occur due to low blood flow to the kidneys during shock. This can lead to renal failure and the need for dialysis.
3. Enterobacter in sputum: The presence of enterobacter in the patient's sputum indicates an infection, which may require antibiotic treatment.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe COPD and was intubated for airway protection. There is a concern for respiratory failure, but the patient is currently oxygenating and ventilating well on spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).
5. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, severe peripheral vascular disease, complicated aortic grafts, previous lung cancer, and parotid gland cancer. He has been admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and initially presented with vital signs within normal limits. However, on the evening of admission, the patient became acutely hypotensive, clamped down, and turned cyanotic. He experienced chest pain and respiratory distress, required intubation and mechanical ventilation, and developed severe lactic acidosis. A bedside transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed global akinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of less than 10%. The initial differential diagnosis included sepsis and bowel ischemia, but both were ruled out. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) performed the previous day ruled out pulmonary embolism (PE). The current theory is that the patient had a large myocardial infarction (MI) precipitating cardiogenic shock. The patient's condition was further complicated by acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with persistent renal failure, necessitating hemodialysis (HD). Medications were initiated, including low-dose aspirin, carvedilol, statin, ACE inhibitor, and metoprolol for heart rate control. The patient's oxygen saturation improved with the use of hydralazine and nitroglycerin infusions. The patient has allergies to various medications"

   of MI +/- sepsis.
   # Shock: Thought to  be cardiogenic shock [**3-17**] massive MI on [**2103-10-10**].
   The picture may be clouded at this point with possible component of a
   septic picture.  Now weaned off pressors.   CTA negative for PE.
   -Monitor clinically and by CXR, if decompensates consider broadening to
   double coverage for GNRs
   -Continue ASA, betablocker, statin.
   -Most recent EF = 20%, will repeat TTE in few days.
   - appreciate cardiology input
   continue Ceftrixone for enterobacter in sputum.  (day [**7-21**])
   - Taper steroids to PO solumedrol (currently 20mg Q8)
   - fluid removal with HD per renal, see below.
   #Respiratory failure: Pt has history of moderate to severe COPD, with
   an FEV1 of 42%, with a recent hospitalization for COPD exacerbation. He
   was initially intubated for airway protection in setting of
   obtundation. Currently oxygenating and ventilating well on SBT,
   however, today has increased work of breathing.  CT concerning for
   ongoing PNA., no evidence of PE.
   -Will lighten sedation and check SBT after HD today.
   -check CO2 on VBG and consider extubation later today
   -will tolerate relative hypoxemia given pt
s known severe COPD.
   -concern for diaphragmatic paralysis and pontential need for
   reintubation if extubated today.
   #Leukocytosis: Increasing. Unclear etiology. Afebrile.
   -Resend c diff, UA/UCx, sputum cx.
   -blood cultures if spikes or develops hypothermia.
   #  ARF: likely acute on chronic due to shock/ATN.  HD dependent.
   Unclear if pt would regain much renal function at this point.
   -Appreciate renal involvement
   -Continue HD
   -follow electrolytes ,
   -maintain MAP >65
   -minimize IVF given
   -renally dose meds.
   # Elevated LFTs: Suspect shock liver.  Currently improving.
   Transaminases trending down.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with complicated aortic grafts, previous lung and parotid gland cancer treated with chemotherapy, and cardiomyopathy (prior ejection fraction 40-50%).
- He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), initially stable, but then developed acute hypotension, became clammy and cyanotic, experienced chest pain and respiratory distress, and required intubation.
- The patient had severe lactic acidosis and a bedside transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed global akinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) less than 10%.
- He also had a recurrent upper GI bleed while on heparin.
- The initial thought was sepsis versus bowel ischemia, but these were ruled out through further investigations.
- A computed tomography angiography (CTA) performed yesterday ruled out pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The current theory is that the patient had a large myocardial infarction (MI) precipitating cardiogenic shock.
- His shock was complicated by acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with persistent renal failure, for which he is now on hemodialysis (HD) with a temporary left internal jugular (LIJ) dialysis line.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, severe peripheral vascular disease, complicated aortic grafts, lung cancer, parotid gland cancer, and chemically induced cardiomyopathy. He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and initially presented with vital signs within normal limits. However, he became acutely hypotensive, clamp down, and cyanotic with chest pain and respiratory distress. He was intubated and ventilated. Severe lactic acidosis was observed, and bedside transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed global akinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of less than 10%. The initial thoughts were sepsis versus bowel ischemia, but both were ruled out. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, ruling out pulmonary embolism (PE). The current theory is that the patient experienced a large myocardial infarction (MI) precipitating cardiogenic shock. The shock was complicated by acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with persistent renal failure, and the patient is now on hemodialysis (HD) with a temporary left internal jugular (IJ) dialysis line.

24-hour events:
- CTA ruled out PE.
- Had HD.
- Cardiac consultation: recommended low-dose aspirin, carvedilol titrated up, metoprolol, statin, and ACE inhibitor.
- TTE prior to discharge.
- Decreased oxygen saturation (O2 sats) to high 80s, started hydralazine and nitroglycerin for afterload reduction with improvement in O2 sats.

Assessment and Plan:
- 70yo man with severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN, who presented with question of GI bleed was stable, then developed sudden shock. Question of MI vs PE +/- sepsis.
- # Shock: At this point presuming primary insult precipitating cardiogenic shock was major MI. [**Month (only) 60**] at this point be clouded picture with possible component of a septic picture. Now weaned off pressors.
- -continue Zosyn for GNRs in sputum, monitor clinically and by CXR, if decompensates consider broadening to double coverage for GNRs. Current plan is 7 day course of zosyn, currently day 5.
- -check CTA today to evaluate for evidence of PE
- - follow up cards recs, will discuss with them today recommendations regarding when to start aspirin, increasing statin in setting of recovering shock liver and guidance with starting BB and possibly ACEI in setting of depressed EF,? when to repeat TTE.
- - Taper steroids to PO solumedrol (currently 20mg Q8)
- -fluid removal with HD per renal, see below.
- -have weaned dopamine after HD
- #Respiratory failure: Pt has c/o severe COPD, recently hospitalized for exacerbation, however initially during presentation ventilation was not a factor. Intubated for airway protection in setting of obtundation. Currently oxygenating and ventilating well on SBT.
- -check CO2 on VBG and consider extubation this morning
- -continue fluid removal as below
- -will tolerate relative hypoxemia given pt's known severe COPD.
- # ARF: likely acute on chronic due to shock/ATN, trying to now maintain MAPS greater than 65. Oliguric with persistently climbing BUN/cr, with non-gap metabolic acidosis. Urine sediment with muddy brown casts consistent with ATN. Unclear if pt would regain much renal function at this point. Pt currently up 11L this admission.
- -Appreciate renal involvement, goal to remove as much fluid as possible using pressors as necessary to make this possible.
- -Monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes, treat K as needed.
- -minimize IVF given
- -renally dose meds.
- ## Elevated LFTs: Suspect shock liver
- -transaminases trending down, bili trending up, continue to follow bili.
- -caution with increasing statin.
- # Coagulopathy: suspect second to liver dysfunction and DIC
- - d/w cards when to start asa again,
- -monitor INR/CBC, give products when necessary for procedures or bleeding.
- # Thrombocytopenia.  Labs c/w DIC.
- -Tx for platelets <50 or active bleeding.
- ## COPD: Continue steroids (tapering down as above), Duonebs
 .
- ## HTN: Continue to hold all antihypertensives though will start to re-add as tolerated and per cards recs
 .
- ## HL: Continue statin, consider increasing
- #Thrush: continue nystatin

   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely due to pneumonia superimposed on
   underlying COPD.  Currently tidal volumes are in the mid 100's but is
   still sedated on fentanyl.
   - wean fentanyl to off
   - once he's more awake and finished with dialysis run for today,
   perform SBT
   - ABG
   - Continue prednisone at current dose for now, inhalers
   2. ARF: Felt due to ATN, now on HD.
   3. Elevated transaminases:  Felt due to shock liver, now trending
   down.  Continue to follow, esp given initiation of statin.
   4. Coagulopathy:  Liver dysfxn +/- DIC.  Now improving.
   5. thrombocytopenia:  Also felt due to DIC.  Continue to follow.
   Holding SQ heparin.

   Total time spent:
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, AAA, HTN, CHF, who was admitted with a GI bleed and developed respiratory arrest and cardiogenic shock. The patient also required dialysis for acute renal failure (ARF).

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD may worsen due to pneumonia, and there is a need to wean off sedatives and perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with ABG monitoring.

2. ARF: The patient's renal function is compromised, and ongoing monitoring and management of fluid balance, electrolytes, and medication dosages are necessary.

3. Elevated transaminases: These elevated liver enzymes indicate a ""shock liver,"" which is expected to improve over time. However, close observation is required, especially considering the initiation of a statin.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulation disorder, possibly due to liver dysfunction or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This condition needs ongoing evaluation and management.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count could be related to DIC. Continuous monitoring is essential to prevent bleeding complications.

6. CHF: The patient's congestive heart failure requires ongoing management with medications such as nitroglycerin and hydralazine for afterload reduction. Additionally,"

   respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock.
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely due to pneumonia superimposed on
   underlying COPD.  Currently tidal volumes are in the mid 100's but is
   still sedated on fentanyl.
   - wean fentanyl to off
   - once he's more awake and finished with dialysis run for today,
   perform SBT
   - ABG
   - Continue prednisone at current dose for now, inhalers
   2. ARF: Felt due to ATN, now on HD.
   3. Elevated transaminases:  Felt due to shock liver, now trending
   down.  Continue to follow, esp given initiation of statin.
   4. Coagulopathy:  Liver dysfxn +/- DIC.  Now improving.
   5. thrombocytopenia:  Also felt due to DIC.  Continue to follow.
   Holding SQ heparin.
   6. CHF:  Nitro gtt, hydral for afterload reduction.  On aspirin,
   statin, beta-blocker.  Holding ace given reported allergy.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, AAA, HTN, CHF, and previous admission for GI bleed. He developed respiratory arrest and cardiogenic shock, requiring dialysis for acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia superimposed on underlying COPD, elevated transaminases possibly due to shock liver, coagulopathy possibly due to liver dysfunction or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombocytopenia also felt due to DIC, and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is currently on various medications including fentanyl, nitroglycerin, metoprolol, pantoprazole, and aspirin. He is also receiving prophylactic treatments for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs are stable, but his condition remains critically ill.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia or ventilator dependency if extubation fails.
2. Kidney injury: The patient has already experienced acute renal failure, and there is a possibility of further kidney damage if the underlying causes are not adequately addressed.
3. Cardiac complications: With a history of CHF and ongoing management for cardiogenic shock"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple comorbidities. The patient has been experiencing a decline in health status over the past few days, including new-onset left groin hematoma at the site of a previously placed femoral line, decreased hemoglobin concentration (Hct), and stopped tube feeds. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but they show some fluctuations. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 26, indicating the need for intubation. The patient's laboratory results reveal abnormalities such as elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased platelet count (Plt), elevated creatinine (Cr), and liver enzyme levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These may include:
1. Hemodynamic instability due to the presence of a large hematoma and decreased Hct levels.
2. Respiratory distress or failure due to the patient's RSBI of 26 and dependence on mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection, as indicated by the elevated WBC count and the need for antibiotics.
4. Renal dysfunction or failure, as suggested by the elevated Cr levels.
5. Liver dysfunction, as indicated by the elevated liver enzyme levels (AST/ALT).
6. Coagulopathy, given the decreased platelet count and the presence of a hematoma.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4803**] is a 70yo man w/ severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN admitted
   with GI bleed complicated by massive MI on [**10-10**], cardiogenic shock, and
   vent-associated pneumonia, on cefepime.
   1.       NSTEMI.  Patient was in cardiogenic shock secondary to massive
   MI on [**2103-10-10**].  Patient is not requiring pressors and in fact was
   requiring nitroglycerin for hypertension/afterload reduction until this
   morning.   EF 20% on recent echo.
   -          fluid removal with HD
   -          aspirin/ statin/ BB
   -          appreciate cards recs
   2.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has vent-associated pneumonia with
   elevated WBC and new infiltrate on CXR.  Respiratory failure also
   likely secondary to severe COPD (FEV1 of 42%).   CTA negative for PE.
   Initial intubation was actually for airway protection.  After family
   discussion, they would like patient to be do-not re-intubate, so will
   be cautious with plans for extubation.  Patient tolerating SBT well,
   however given altered mental status and new infiltrate, will postpone
   extubation for now.
   - lighten sedation
   - continue PS at 5/5 for now
   - Cefepime for vent-associated pneumonia (until culture data returns)
   - f/u sputum cultures
   He was initially intubated for airway protection in setting of
   obtundation. Currently oxygenating and ventilating well on SBT,
   however, today has increased work of breathing.  CT concerning for
   ongoing PNA., no evidence of PE.
   -Will lighten sedation and check SBT after HD today.
   -check CO2 on VBG and consider extubation later today
   -will tolerate relative hypoxemia given pt
s known severe COPD.
   -concern for diaphragmatic paralysis and pontential need for
   reintubation if extubated today.
   The picture may be clouded at this point with possible component of a
   septic picture.  Now weaned off pressors.   CTA negative for PE.
   -Monitor clinically and by CXR, if decompensates consider broadening to
   double coverage for GNRs
   -Continue ASA, betablocker, statin.
   -Most recent EF = 20%, will repeat TTE in few days.
   - appreciate cardiology input
   continue Ceftrixone for enterobacter in sputum.  (day [**7-21**])
   - Taper steroids to PO solumedrol (currently 20mg Q8)
   - fluid removal with HD per renal, see below.
   #
   #Leukocytosis: Increasing. Unclear etiology. Afebrile.
   -Resend c diff, UA/UCx, sputum cx.
   -blood cultures if spikes or develops hypothermia.
   #  ARF: likely acute on chronic due to shock/ATN.  HD dependent.
   Unclear if pt would regain much renal function at this point.
   -Appreciate renal involvement
   -Continue HD
   -follow electrolytes ,
   -maintain MAP >65
   -minimize IVF given
   -renally dose meds.
   # Elevated LFTs: Suspect shock liver.  Currently improving.
   Transaminases trending down.
   -Continue to trend LFTs, bili.
   -Will continue low dose statin for now
   # Coagulopathy: suspect second to DIC, liver dysfunction.  Improving.
   -ASA restarted [**10-16**]
   -monitor INR/CBC, give products when necessary for procedures or
   bleeding.
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Labs c/w DIC.
   -Tx for platelets <50 or active bleeding.
   # COPD: Continue steroids (tapering down as above),  Duonebs
   .
   # HTN: Titrate BB as tolerate.
   .
   # HL: Continue statin
   #Thrush: continue nystatin

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of severe COPD, lung cancer, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), who presented with a question of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He was initially stable but then developed sudden shock. The medical team is uncertain about the cause of the shock, suspecting either cardiogenic shock due to a massive myocardial infarction (MI) or sepsis. The patient has been weaned off pressors and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 20%, and a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed in a few days.

The patient also has respiratory failure, with a history of moderate to severe COPD and an FEV1 of 42%. He was intubated for airway protection due to obtundation. Currently, he is oxygenating and ventilating well on spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), but today he has increased work of breathing. A CT scan shows concern for ongoing pneumonia (PNA), but no evidence of PE. The medical team plans to lighten sedation and check SBT after hemodialysis (HD) today, considering extubation later today while tolerating relative hypoxemia due to the patient's known severe COPD. There is concern for diaphragmatic paralysis and potential need for reint"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4803**] is a 70yo man w/ severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN admitted
   with GI bleed complicated by massive MI on [**10-10**], cardiogenic shock, and
   vent-associated pneumonia, on cefepime.
   1.       NSTEMI.  Patient was in cardiogenic shock secondary to massive
   MI on [**2103-10-10**].  Patient is not requiring pressors and in fact was
   requiring nitroglycerin for hypertension/afterload reduction until this
   morning.   EF 20% on recent echo.
   -          fluid removal with HD
   -          aspirin/ statin/ BB
   -          appreciate cards recs
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Patient has vent-associated pneumonia
   with elevated WBC and new infiltrate on CXR.  Will start cefepime to
   cover pseudomonas given new infiltrate while on ceftriaxone.  No
   evidence of gram positive infection so will hold off on vancomycin for
   now.  Respiratory failure also likely secondary to severe COPD (FEV1 of
   42%).   CTA negative for PE.  Initial intubation was actually for
   airway protection.  After family discussion, they would like patient to
   be do-not re-intubate, so will be cautious with plans for extubation.
   Patient tolerating SBT well, however given altered mental status and
   new infiltrate, will postpone extubation for now.
                     - lighten sedation
                     - continue PS at 5/5 for now
                             - Cefepime for vent-associated pneumonia
   (until culture data returns)
                             - f/u sputum cultures
                             - continue steroids for COPD at current dose
   3.       Groin hematoma.  Patient has new left groin hematoma in
   setting of thromobocytopenia, hepatic coagulopathy and uremia.  Will
   monitor site clinicially and follow Hct.
   -          follow [**Hospital1 **] Hct for now
   -          transfuse PRBCs given recent NSTEMI
   -          Vitamin K PO to reverse elevated INR if possible
   -          Plt transfusion for thromobotycopenia
   4.       Leukocytosis.   Patient found to have new infiltrate on CXR
   today suggesting vent associated PNA.  Patient has dirty UA, though is
   HD dependent so unclear significance.
   -          f/u c. difff, urine culture, sputum culture
   -          continue cefepime for VAP
   5.       ARF.  Patient has acute on chronic due to shock/ATN.  HD
   dependent. Unclear if pt would regain much renal function at this
   point.
   -          Appreciate renal involvement
   -          Continue HD
   -          follow electrolytes
   -          maintain MAP >65
   -          minimize IVF given
   -          renally dose meds
   6.       Elevated LFTs: Suspect shock liver.  Currently improving.
   Transaminases trending down.
   -          Continue to trend LFTs, bili.
   -          Will continue low dose statin for now
   7.       Coagulopathy: suspect second to DIC and hepatic dysfunction.
   -          ASA restarted [**10-16**]
   -          oral Vit K today
   8.       Thrombocytopenia.  Labs consistent with DIC, but will check
   HIT.
   -          transfer for platelets <50 or active bleeding
   -          transfuse platelets today
   9.       COPD: Continue steroids at present dose.  Will not taper at
   present given the new infiltrate.  Duonebs
   10.    HTN. Titrate BB as tolerate.
   11.    HL: Continue statin
   12.    Thrush: continue nystatin

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with severe COPD, a history of lung cancer, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. He was admitted with a gastrointestinal bleed that complicated a massive myocardial infarction (MI) on October 10th, cardiogenic shock, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current condition includes NSTEMI, respiratory failure, groin hematoma, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and hypertension. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient experienced cardiogenic shock secondary to a massive MI. It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's hemodynamics and ensuring adequate cardiac output.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which requires prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics, such as cefepime. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures is necessary.
3. Groin hematoma: The patient has a new left groin hematoma in the setting of thrombocytopenia, hepatic coagulopathy, and uremia. Monitoring the site clinically and following hemoglobin levels is crucial.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Cultures should be obtained to identify the"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y/o M w/COPD, HTN, CHF, AAA, adm with GI bleed and developed
   respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock.
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely due to pneumonia superimposed on
   underlying COPD.  Now with evidence of new infiltrate on CXR with good
   sputum sample showing GNRs.  However, RSBI looks good and getting good
   tidal volumes on [**6-18**].
   - d/c ceftriaxone and start cefepime for new VAP.  No GPCs on gram
   stain so will hold off on starting vancomycin.
   - wean fentanyl to off
   - once he's more awake and finished with dialysis run for today,
   perform SBT
   - Continue prednisone at current dose for now, inhalers
   2. ARF: Felt due to ATN, now on HD.
   3. Elevated transaminases:  Felt due to shock liver, now trending
   down.  Continue to follow, esp given initiation of statin.
   4. Coagulopathy:  Liver dysfxn +/- DIC.  Now improving.
   5. thrombocytopenia:  Also felt due to DIC.  Continue to follow.
   Holding SQ heparin.
   6. CHF:  BP dropped a little with HD today so will decrease dose of
   carvedilol today.  On aspirin, statin.  Holding ace given reported
   allergy.
   7. L groin hematoma:  Likely due to femoral line (now out).  Repeat Hct
   pending but dropped 5 points overnight.  Will transfuse 1 unit PRBCs
   and platelets.  If continues to bleed would give ddavp.  Will follow
   groin exam.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, congestive heart failure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, who was admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding and developed respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock.
- The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has had multiple complications including pneumonia, acute kidney injury, elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and a groin hematoma.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, suggesting a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, prolonged clotting times, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and there have been concerns about his heart failure, for which he is receiving medications such as carvedilol and aspirin.
- The patient has an allergy to Univasc (moexipril HCl), which is why it is being held.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate), and his disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has pneumonia superimposed on underlying COPD, leading to respiratory failure. The new infiltrate on chest X-ray indicates a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia"

- The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, congestive heart failure, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), who was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding and developed respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock.
- The patient has a large hematoma in the right groin area, which is believed to be caused by a femoral line that has been removed.
- The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia superimposed on underlying COPD. There is evidence of new infiltrate on the chest X-ray, and sputum samples show growth of gram-negative rods (GNRs).
- The patient's renal function is impaired, with acute kidney injury (ARF) secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and he is currently undergoing hemodialysis (HD).
- The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may be due to shock liver, but they are trending down. The coagulation profile is also abnormal, suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but it is improving.
- The patient's platelet count is low, which may also be due to DIC. He has been held on subcutaneous heparin.
- The patient has congestive heart failure (CHF) and has experienced a drop in blood pressure during hemodialysis, so the dose of carvedilol will be decreased. The patient is currently on aspirin and statin therapy and has an allergy"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4803**] is a 70yo man w/ severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN admitted
   with GI bleed complicated by massive MI on [**10-10**], cardiogenic shock, and
   vent-associated pneumonia, on cefepime day 2.
   1.       NSTEMI.  Patient was in cardiogenic shock secondary to massive
   MI on [**2103-10-10**].  Patient is not requiring pressors.  EF 20% on recent
   echo.  Stable fluid status. BP also stable today after reduction of
   carvedilol.
   -          aspirin/ statin/ BB (carvedilol)
   -          appreciate cards recs
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Patient has vent-associated pneumonia
   with elevated WBC and new infiltrate on CXR on [**10-18**].  Now on day 2 of
   cefepime while awaiting sputum cultures and sensitivies though has been
   afebrile and WBC is stable.  Previous sputum was enterobacter
   sensistive to ceftriaxone.   No evidence of gram positive infection so
   will hold off on vancomycin for now.  Respiratory failure also likely
   secondary to severe COPD (FEV1 of 42%).   CTA negative for PE.  After
   family discussion, they would like patient to be do-not re-intubate.
   Patient has improved mental status and is tolerating SBT well, so is
   optimized for extubation and this is consistent with patient
s goals of
   care, so will give trial of extubation today with no plans to
   re-intubated.
                     - extubate today
                             - Cefepime for vent-associated pneumonia
   (until culture data returns)
                             - f/u sputum cultures
                             - continue steroids for COPD at current dose;
   will consider tapering tomorrow if tolerating extubation
   3.       Groin hematoma.  Patient noted to have left groin hematoma  on
   [**10-18**] in setting of thromobocytopenia, hepatic coagulopathy and uremia.
   Patient received platelets, PRBCs, and Vit K yesterday.  Hct responded
   to blood transfusion and currently stable.
   -          Daily crits
   -          Monitor hematoma clinically
   4.       Leukocytosis.   Patient found to have new infiltrate on CXR on
   [**10-18**]  suggesting vent associated PNA.  Patient is C. diff negative and
   UCx showed yeast.  Blood cultures are negative to date.
   -          continue cefepime for VAP
          -         f/u blood, sputum cultures
   5.       ARF.  Patient has acute on chronic due to shock/ATN.  HD
   dependent. Unclear if pt would regain much renal function at this
   point.
   -          Appreciate renal involvement
   -          Continue HD
   -          follow electrolytes
   -          maintain MAP >65
   -          minimize IVF given

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with severe COPD, history of lung cancer, congestive heart failure (CHF), and hypertension (HTN). He was admitted with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, complicated by a massive myocardial infarction (MI) on October 10th, cardiogenic shock, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on day 2 of cefepime therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI: The patient had a massive MI on October 10th, leading to cardiogenic shock. Although the patient's blood pressure is stable after reducing carvedilol dosage, there may still be a risk of further cardiac complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has VAP with elevated white blood cell count and new infiltrate on chest X-ray on October 18th. He is currently on cefepime therapy, awaiting sputum cultures and sensitivities.
3. Groin Hematoma: The patient has a left groin hematoma on October 18th, in the setting of thrombocytopenia, hepatic coagulopathy, and uremia. The patient received platelets, PRBCs, and Vitamin K yesterday.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has new infiltrates on CXR on October 18th, suggesting VAP. The patient is C. difficile negative, and UCx showed yeast.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4803**] is a 70yo man w/ severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN admitted
   with GI bleed complicated by massive MI on [**10-10**], cardiogenic shock, and
   vent-associated pneumonia, on cefepime day 2.
   1.       NSTEMI.  Patient was in cardiogenic shock secondary to massive
   MI on [**2103-10-10**].  Patient is not requiring pressors.  EF 20% on recent
   echo.  Stable fluid status. BP also stable today after reduction of
   carvedilol.
   -          aspirin/ statin/ BB (carvedilol)
   -          appreciate cards recs
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Patient has vent-associated pneumonia
   with elevated WBC and new infiltrate on CXR on [**10-18**].  Now on day 2 of
   cefepime while awaiting sputum cultures and sensitivies though has been
   afebrile and WBC is stable.  Previous sputum was enterobacter
   sensistive to ceftriaxone.   No evidence of gram positive infection so
   will hold off on vancomycin for now.  Respiratory failure also likely
   secondary to severe COPD (FEV1 of 42%).   CTA negative for PE.  After
   family discussion, they would like patient to be do-not re-intubate.
   Patient has improved mental status and is tolerating SBT well, so is
   optimized for extubation and this is consistent with patient
s goals of
   care, so will give trial of extubation today with no plans to
   re-intubated.
                     - extubate today
                             - Cefepime for vent-associated pneumonia
   (until culture data returns)
                             - f/u sputum cultures
                             - continue steroids for COPD at current dose;
   will consider tapering tomorrow if tolerating extubation
   3.       Groin hematoma.  Patient noted to have left groin hematoma  on
   [**10-18**] in setting of thromobocytopenia, hepatic coagulopathy and uremia.
   Patient received platelets, PRBCs, and Vit K yesterday.
   -          Daily crits
   -          Monitor hematoma clinically
   4.       Leukocytosis.   Patient found to have new infiltrate on CXR on
   [**10-18**]  suggesting vent associated PNA.  Patient is C. diff negative and
   UCx showed yeast.  Blood cultures are negative to date.
   -          continue cefepime for VAP
          -         f/u blood, sputum cultures
   5.       ARF.  Patient has acute on chronic due to shock/ATN.  HD
   dependent. Unclear if pt would regain much renal function at this
   point.
   -          Appreciate renal involvement
   -          Continue HD
   -          follow electrolytes
   -          maintain MAP >65
   -          minimize IVF given
   -          renally dose meds
   -          nephrocaps
   6.       Elevated LFTs: Suspect shock liver.  Currently improving.
   Transaminases continue to improve.
   -          Will continue low dose statin for now
   7.       Coagulopathy: suspect second to DIC and hepatic dysfunction.
    INR improved with Vitamin K.
   -          ASA restarted [**10-16**]
   -          oral Vit K
   8.       Thrombocytopenia.  Labs consistent with DIC, but will check
   HIT.
   -          transfer for platelets <50 or active bleeding
   -          f/u HIT
   9.       COPD: Continue steroids at present dose.  Will not taper at
   present given plans for extubation today.  Duonebs
   10.    HTN. Titrate carvedilol as tolerate.
   11.    HL: Continue statin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with severe COPD, a history of lung cancer, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. He was admitted with a gastrointestinal bleed, massive myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has been on cefepime for two days and is currently stable. He has improved mental status and is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials well, so he will be given a trial of extubation today with no plans for re-intubation. The patient has several medical complications, including NSTEMI, respiratory failure, groin hematoma, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and COPD. These conditions require ongoing management and monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI: The patient experienced a massive myocardial infarction and has reduced ejection fraction. Ongoing cardiac monitoring and management are essential to prevent further complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe COPD and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Continued respiratory support and treatment of pneumonia are crucial to improve lung function.
3. Groin Hematoma: The patient developed a left groin hematoma due to thrombocytopenia, hepatic coagulopathy, and uremia. Close monitoring of the hematoma and appropriate management are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4803**] is a 70yo man w/ severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN admitted
   with GI bleed complicated by massive MI on [**10-10**], cardiogenic shock, and
   vent-associated pneumonia, on cefepime.
   1.       NSTEMI.  Patient was in cardiogenic shock secondary to massive
   MI on [**2103-10-10**].  Patient is not requiring pressors and in fact was
   requiring nitroglycerin for hypertension/afterload reduction until this
   morning.   EF 20% on recent echo.
   -          fluid removal with HD
   -          aspirin/ statin/ BB
   -          appreciate cards recs
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Patient has vent-associated pneumonia
   with elevated WBC and new infiltrate on CXR.  Will start cefepime to
   cover pseudomonas given new infiltrate while on ceftriaxone.  No
   evidence of gram positive infection so will hold off on vancomycin for
   now.  Respiratory failure also likely secondary to severe COPD (FEV1 of
   42%).   CTA negative for PE.  Initial intubation was actually for
   airway protection.  After family discussion, they would like patient to
   be do-not re-intubate, so will be cautious with plans for extubation.
   Patient tolerating SBT well, however given altered mental status and
   new infiltrate, will postpone extubation for now.
                     - lighten sedation
                     - continue PS at 5/5 for now
                             - Cefepime for vent-associated pneumonia
   (until culture data returns)
                             - f/u sputum cultures
                             - continue steroids for COPD at current dose
   3.       Groin hematoma.  Patient has new left groin hematoma in
   setting of thromobocytopenia, hepatic coagulopathy and uremia.  Will
   monitor site clinicially and follow Hct.
   -          follow [**Hospital1 **] Hct for now
   -          transfuse PRBCs given recent NSTEMI
   -          Vitamin K PO to reverse elevated INR if possible
   -          Plt transfusion for thromobotycopenia
   4.       Leukocytosis.   Patient found to have new infiltrate on CXR
   today suggesting vent associated PNA.  Patient has dirty UA, though is
   HD dependent so unclear significance.
   -          f/u c. difff, urine culture, sputum culture
   -          continue cefepime for VAP
   5.       ARF.  Patient has acute on chronic due to shock/ATN.  HD
   dependent. Unclear if pt would regain much renal function at this
   point.
   -          Appreciate renal involvement
   -          Continue HD
   -          follow electrolytes
   -          maintain MAP >65
   -          minimize IVF given
   -          renally dose meds
   6.       Elevated LFTs: Suspect shock liver.  Currently improving.
   Transaminases trending down.
   -          Continue to trend LFTs, bili.
   -          Will continue low dose statin for now
   7.       Coagulopathy: suspect second to DIC and hepatic dysfunction.
   -          ASA restarted [**10-16**]
   -          oral Vit K today
   8.       Thrombocytopenia.  Labs consistent with DIC, but will check
   HIT.
   -          transfer for platelets <50 or active bleeding
   -          transfuse platelets today
   9.       COPD: Continue steroids at present dose.  Will not taper at
   present given the new infiltrate.  Duonebs
   10.    HTN. Titrate BB as tolerate.
   11.    HL: Continue statin
   12.    Thrush: continue nystatin

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old man with severe COPD, history of lung cancer, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. He was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding, massive myocardial infarction (MI), cardiogenic shock, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on cefepime.

Medical Complications:

1. NSTEMI: The patient had a massive MI on October 10th, leading to cardiogenic shock. His ejection fraction is 20% on recent echocardiogram. The plan includes fluid removal with hemodialysis (HD), aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker therapy. Cardiac recommendations will be appreciated.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has VAP with elevated white blood cell count and new infiltrate on chest X-ray. Cefepime will be started to cover Pseudomonas, given the new infiltrate while on ceftriaxone. No evidence of gram-positive infection, so vancomycin will be held off for now. Respiratory failure is also likely secondary to severe COPD (FEV1 of 42%). A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). Initial intubation was for airway protection. The family has expressed a desire for the patient to be do-not re-intubate (DNR), so plans for extubation will be cautious. The patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with severe COPD, history of lung cancer, CHF, and HTN. He was admitted with GI bleed complicated by massive MI on 10/10, cardiogenic shock, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently on cefepime and other medications. The patient's current conditions include NSTEMI, respiratory failure, groin hematoma, leukocytosis, acute renal failure (ARF), elevated liver function tests (LFTs), coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, COPD, HTN, hyperlipidemia (HL), and thrush. The patient is unable to provide history as he is sedated and unresponsive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient had cardiogenic shock secondary to massive MI. The patient is not requiring pressors and is stable with lowered carvedilol dose. However, the patient's EF is only 20% on recent echo, indicating reduced heart function.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has VAP with elevated WBC and new infiltrate on CXR. Cefepime has been started to cover pseudomonas given the new infiltrate while on ceftriaxone.
3. Groin Hematoma: The patient has a new left groin hematoma in the setting of thrombocytopenia, hepatic co"

   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely due to pneumonia superimposed on
   underlying COPD.  Now with evidence of new infiltrate on CXR with good
   sputum sample showing GNRs.  However, RSBI looks good and getting good
   tidal volumes on [**6-18**].
   - d/c'ed ceftriaxone and start cefepime for new VAP.  No GPCs on gram
   stain so will hold off on starting vancomycin.
   - wean fentanyl to off
   - SBT ->extubate
   - Continue prednisone at current dose for now, inhalers
   2. ARF: Felt due to ATN, now on HD.
   3. Elevated transaminases:  Felt due to shock liver, now trending
   down.  No need to continue following.
   4. Coagulopathy:  Liver dysfxn +/- DIC.  Now improving.
   - vitamin K x3 days
   5. thrombocytopenia:  Also felt due to DIC.  Continue to follow.
   Holding SQ heparin.  PF4 pending.
   6. CHF:  BP stable on decreased dose of carvedilol.  On aspirin,
   statin.  Holding ace given reported allergy.
   7. L groin hematoma:  Likely due to femoral line (now out).  Hct stable
   s/p transfusion.  Exam unchanged.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, congestive heart failure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding and developed respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, blood transfusions, and supportive care. His vital signs are stable, but he remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia superimposed on underlying COPD. There is evidence of new infiltrate on chest X-ray with good sputum sample showing Gram-negative rods (GNRs). The patient's respiratory support is adequate, but there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan is to change antibiotics to cefepime for new VAP and wean off fentanyl. Extubation may be considered after a successful spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient is experiencing acute renal failure (ARF), which could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He is currently on hemodialysis (HD).

3. Elevated Transaminases: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, possibly due to shock liver. However, they are trending down and no further intervention is needed.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, likely due to liver dysfunction or disseminated intrav"

   respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock.
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely due to pneumonia superimposed on
   underlying COPD.  Now with evidence of new infiltrate on CXR with good
   sputum sample showing GNRs.  However, RSBI looks good and getting good
   tidal volumes on [**6-18**].
   - d/c'ed ceftriaxone and start cefepime for new VAP.  No GPCs on gram
   stain so will hold off on starting vancomycin.
   - wean fentanyl to off
   - SBT ->extubate
   - Continue prednisone at current dose for now, inhalers
   2. ARF: Felt due to ATN, now on HD.
   3. Elevated transaminases:  Felt due to shock liver, now trending
   down.  No need to continue following.
   4. Coagulopathy:  Liver dysfxn +/- DIC.  Now improving.
   - vitamin K x3 days
   5. thrombocytopenia:  Also felt due to DIC.  Continue to follow.
   Holding SQ heparin.  PF4 pending.
   6. CHF:  BP stable on decreased dose of carvedilol.  On aspirin,
   statin.  Holding ace given reported allergy.
   7. L groin hematoma:  Likely due to femoral line (now out).  Hct stable
   s/p transfusion.  Exam unchanged.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. He was admitted with respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock.

The patient has received several interventions and treatments, including blood transfusions, antibiotics (cefepime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin), and supportive care for various conditions. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and has a tracheostomy tube in place.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 85/38 mmHg, heart rate of 66 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His temperature is within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and prolonged coagulation profile. Imaging shows a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating pneumonia.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), elevated transaminases, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, CHF, and a groin hematoma. The respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia superimposed on underlying COPD. The ARF is suspected to be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The elevated transaminases are likely"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 4803**] is a 70yo man w/ severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN admitted
   with GI bleed complicated by massive MI on [**10-10**], cardiogenic shock, and
   vent-associated pneumonia on antibiotics now extubated and
   hemodynamically stable but tenuous, with poor prognosis who was made
   CMO today.
   1.       NSTEMI.  Patient was in cardiogenic shock secondary to massive
   MI on [**2103-10-10**].  Patient is not requiring pressors.  EF 20% on recent
   echo.  Stable fluid status. Patient not taking PO meds, hemodynamically
   stable.
   - discontinue cardiology medications
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Patient extubated successfully
   yesterday. On nasal cannula but with tachypnea and tenuous respiratory
   status when moved. Patient found to have VAP treated with IV cefepime.
   No culture data, GNR in sputum sparse growth in culture. As antibiotic
   treatment unlikely to affect overall prognosis, will discontinue
   antibiotics
   - continue nasal cannula to keep patient comfortable. No reintubation
   - discontinue antibiotics and steroids
   3.       Groin hematoma.  Patient noted to have left groin hematoma  on
   [**10-18**] in setting of thromobocytopenia, hepatic coagulopathy and uremia.
   Patient received platelets, PRBCs, and Vit K yesterday.  Hct responded
   to blood transfusion and currently stable. Hematoma increasing but no
   overt bleeding
   4.       ARF.  Patient has acute on chronic due to shock/ATN.  HD
   dependent. Unclear if pt would regain much renal function at this
   point.  Per discussion with HCP, decision was made to discontinue
   hemodialysis
   5.       Pain control/comfort care
 decision was made to change
   patient
s code status to CMO. Will discontinue all PO medications as
   patient not taking PO.
          - discontinue monitoring, labs
          - start IV morphine prn, can titrate up to gtt if patient
   uncomfortable

   MI on [**2103-10-10**].  Patient is not requiring pressors.  EF 20% on recent
   echo.  Stable fluid status. BP also stable today after reduction of
   carvedilol.
   -          aspirin/ statin/ BB (carvedilol)
   -          appreciate cards recs
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Patient has vent-associated pneumonia
   with elevated WBC and new infiltrate on CXR on [**10-18**].  Now on day 2 of
   cefepime while awaiting sputum cultures and sensitivies though has been
   afebrile and WBC is stable.  Previous sputum was enterobacter
   sensistive to ceftriaxone.   No evidence of gram positive infection so
   will hold off on vancomycin for now.  Respiratory failure also likely
   secondary to severe COPD (FEV1 of 42%).   CTA negative for PE.  After
   family discussion, they would like patient to be do-not re-intubate.
   Patient has improved mental status and is tolerating SBT well, so is
   optimized for extubation and this is consistent with patient
s goals of
   care, so will give trial of extubation today with no plans to
   re-intubated.
                     - extubate today
                             - Cefepime for vent-associated pneumonia
   (until culture data returns)
                             - f/u sputum cultures
                             - continue steroids for COPD at current dose;
   will consider tapering tomorrow if tolerating extubation
   3.       Groin hematoma.  Patient noted to have left groin hematoma  on
   [**10-18**] in setting of thromobocytopenia, hepatic coagulopathy and uremia.
   Patient received platelets, PRBCs, and Vit K yesterday.  Hct responded
   to blood transfusion and currently stable.
   -          Daily crits
   -          Monitor hematoma clinically
   4.       Leukocytosis.   Patient found to have new infiltrate on CXR on
   [**10-18**]  suggesting vent associated PNA.  Patient is C. diff negative and
   UCx showed yeast.  Blood cultures are negative to date.
   -          continue cefepime for VAP
          -         f/u blood, sputum cultures
   5.       ARF.  Patient has acute on chronic due to shock/ATN.  HD
   dependent. Unclear if pt would regain much renal function at this
   point.
   -          Appreciate renal involvement
   -          Continue HD
   -          follow electrolytes
   -          maintain MAP >65
   -          minimize IVF given
   -          renally dose meds
   -          nephrocaps
   6.       Elevated LFTs: Suspect shock liver.  Currently improving.
   Transaminases continue to improve.
   -          Will continue low dose statin for now
   7.       Coagulopathy: suspect second to DIC and hepatic dysfunction.
   INR improved with Vitamin K.
   -          ASA restarted [**10-16**]
   -          oral Vit K
   8.       Thrombocytopenia.  Labs consistent with DIC, but will check
   HIT.
   -          transfer for platelets <50 or active bleeding
   -          f/u HIT
   9.       COPD: Continue steroids at present dose.  Will not taper at
   present given plans for extubation today.  Duonebs
   10.    HTN. Titrate carvedilol as tolerate.
   11.    HL: Continue statin
   Thrush: continue nystatin

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with severe COPD, a history of lung cancer, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. He was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding, complicated by a massive myocardial infarction on 10/10, cardiogenic shock, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has been extubated and is being weaned off the ventilator, but requires intermittent suctioning due to difficulty clearing secretions. He is also on dialysis and receiving various medications for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe COPD and a recent ventilator-associated pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the pneumonia worsens or if the patient is unable to clear secretions effectively.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient had a massive myocardial infarction and is experiencing cardiogenic shock. There is a risk of ongoing cardiac dysfunction and potential arrhythmias.
3. Renal failure: The patient is on dialysis and has acute kidney injury on top of chronic kidney disease. There is a risk of worsening renal function and the need for continued dialysis.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT/INR and low platelet count, which may be indicative of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or liver dysfunction. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4803**] is a 70yo man w/ severe COPD, h/o lung ca, CHF, HTN admitted
   with GI bleed complicated by massive MI on [**10-10**], cardiogenic shock, and
   vent-associated pneumonia, on cefepime day 2.
   1.       NSTEMI.  Patient was in cardiogenic shock secondary to massive
   MI on [**2103-10-10**].  Patient is not requiring pressors.  EF 20% on recent
   echo.  Stable fluid status. BP also stable today after reduction of
   carvedilol.
   -          aspirin/ statin/ BB (carvedilol)
   -          appreciate cards recs
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Patient has vent-associated pneumonia
   with elevated WBC and new infiltrate on CXR on [**10-18**].  Now on day 2 of
   cefepime while awaiting sputum cultures and sensitivies though has been
   afebrile and WBC is stable.  Previous sputum was enterobacter
   sensistive to ceftriaxone.   No evidence of gram positive infection so
   will hold off on vancomycin for now.  Respiratory failure also likely
   secondary to severe COPD (FEV1 of 42%).   CTA negative for PE.  After
   family discussion, they would like patient to be do-not re-intubate.
   Patient has improved mental status and is tolerating SBT well, so is
   optimized for extubation and this is consistent with patient
s goals of
   care, so will give trial of extubation today with no plans to
   re-intubated.
                     - extubate today
                             - Cefepime for vent-associated pneumonia
   (until culture data returns)
                             - f/u sputum cultures
                             - continue steroids for COPD at current dose;
   will consider tapering tomorrow if tolerating extubation
   3.       Groin hematoma.  Patient noted to have left groin hematoma  on
   [**10-18**] in setting of thromobocytopenia, hepatic coagulopathy and uremia.
   Patient received platelets, PRBCs, and Vit K yesterday.  Hct responded
   to blood transfusion and currently stable.
   -          Daily crits
   -          Monitor hematoma clinically
   4.       Leukocytosis.   Patient found to have new infiltrate on CXR on
   [**10-18**]  suggesting vent associated PNA.  Patient is C. diff negative and
   UCx showed yeast.  Blood cultures are negative to date.
   -          continue cefepime for VAP
          -         f/u blood, sputum cultures
   5.       ARF.  Patient has acute on chronic due to shock/ATN.  HD
   dependent. Unclear if pt would regain much renal function at this
   point.
   -          Appreciate renal involvement
   -          Continue HD
   -          follow electrolytes
   -          maintain MAP >65
   -          minimize IVF given
   -          renally dose meds
   -          nephrocaps
   6.       Elevated LFTs: Suspect shock liver.  Currently improving.
   Transaminases continue to improve.
   -          Will continue low dose statin for now
   7.       Coagulopathy: suspect second to DIC and hepatic dysfunction.
   INR improved with Vitamin K.
   -          ASA restarted [**10-16**]
   -          oral Vit K
   8.       Thrombocytopenia.  Labs consistent with DIC, but will check
   HIT.
   -          transfer for platelets <50 or active bleeding
   -          f/u HIT
   9.       COPD: Continue steroids at present dose.  Will not taper at
   present given plans for extubation today.  Duonebs
   10.    HTN. Titrate carvedilol as tolerate.
   11.    HL: Continue statin
   Thrush: continue nystatin

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He was admitted with respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. The patient developed worsening hypoxemia after being extubated, but it improved with nasal high-flow therapy (NRB) and is now on 6L NC with intermittent suctioning. He received hemodialysis (HD) yesterday with removal of 1 kg.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient likely experienced respiratory failure due to severe COPD and developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently mildly improved but still tachypneic.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient developed acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and is now on hemodialysis.
3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a history of CHF and is unable to take oral medications. He is being treated with prn hydralazine.
