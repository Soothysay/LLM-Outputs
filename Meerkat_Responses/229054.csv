   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Restart heparin drip
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Plan for cardiac cath when INR less, however trending up, gave Vit K
   yesterday
   - Trend CE's until peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal UOP 100cc/hr
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE today to evaluate for fixed wall motion abnormalities and EF
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is in rapid ventricular rate
   currently.  The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs.
   v tach earlier today at OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 50mg PO BID
   - Continue diltiazem drip
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin, continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'
   - CXR on admission
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**]
   - Will add vancomycin and ceftaz to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation (a fib), hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). He was transferred to the ICU for treatment of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient has 38-year-old bypass grafts, suggesting a high likelihood of restenosis, which may have precipitated the NSTEMI event. He also has pneumonia, possibly hospital-acquired given recent hospitalization. Other medical conditions include systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, transaminitis, chronic thrombocytopenia, and type 2 DM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI: The patient's history of CABG and restenosis increases the risk of NSTEMI recurrence. It is important to monitor cardiac enzymes and continue antiplatelet therapy.
2. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's EF of 20-25% indicates significant systolic dysfunction. Close monitoring of fluid status and diuretic therapy is necessary to manage volume overload.
3. Pneumonia: Hospital-acquired pneumonia should be treated promptly to prevent worsening respiratory status. Antibiotic coverage should be adjusted based on culture results.
4. Atrial Fibr"

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was transferred for treatment of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's current medications include metoprolol, diltiazem, heparin, Plavix, aspirin, and a statin, which has been temporarily held due to transaminitis. He is also on sliding scale insulin for his diabetes.

The patient's recent medical history includes hospitalization last week for weakness, and he now presents with symptoms suggestive of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). His chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates, which are worse on the left upper lobe. He is currently being treated with levofloxacin and will also receive vancomycin and cefazolin to cover for HAP.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25% documented during his previous hospitalization. His recent troponin levels are elevated, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. He has been receiving diuretics for volume management, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) has been ordered to evaluate for fixed wall motion abnormalities and assess his EF.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Restart heparin drip
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Plan for cardiac cath when INR less, however trending up, gave Vit K
   yesterday
   - Trend CE's until peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal UOP 100cc/hr
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE today to evaluate for fixed wall motion abnormalities and EF
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is in rapid ventricular rate
   currently.  The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs.
   v tach earlier today at OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 50mg PO BID
   - Continue diltiazem drip
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin, continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'
   - CXR on admission
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**]
   - Will add vancomycin and ceftaz to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, atrial fibrillation (a fib), hypertension (HTN), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted for treatment of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and rapid ventricular rate (RVR). The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including systolic heart failure, pneumonia, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, chronic thrombocytopenia, and type 2 DM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI: The patient's 38-year-old bypass grafts may have restenosed, leading to the current event. There is a high likelihood of this due to the patient's history of type 2 DM.
2. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is documented to be 20-25% at the outside hospital (OSH), indicating severe global hypokinesis. There is a likely worsening EF secondary to the large NSTEMI.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in rapid ventricular rate and had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. ventricular tachycardia earlier today at OSH.
4. Pneumonia: The patient may have hospital-acquired pneumonia given his recent hospitalization last week for"

   Imaging: TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). The estimated
   cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta
   is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There may be aortic stenosis with
   restricted leaflet opening but the overall transvalvular velocity is
   preserved (which may be secondary to poor ventricular contractile
   function). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
   moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
   elevated left atrial pressure. There is (at least) mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   .
   IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
   Moderate right ventricular hypokinesis. Elevated estimated left
   ventricular filling pressures. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
   At least mild pulmonary hypertension. Thoracic aortic dilation.
   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Discontinued heparin drip given supratherapeutic INR
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Pt may undergo cardiac cath today given INR 2.0 today
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal to remain even throughout the day
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE yesterday showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and
   diastolic dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO TID for rapid A fib
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin for likely cath today and restart heparin gtt for
   prophylaxis
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis

   systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). The estimated
   cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta
   is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There may be aortic stenosis with
   restricted leaflet opening but the overall transvalvular velocity is
   preserved (which may be secondary to poor ventricular contractile
   function). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
   moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
   elevated left atrial pressure. There is (at least) mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and community-acquired pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU due to severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.9°C (102.1°F), heart rate of 92 bpm with a range of 75-138 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/50 mmHg to 129/160 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute with a range of 18-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving multiple medications including coreg, lopressor, and Lasix. He has an elevated INR of 3, so another dose of PO Vit K was given. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, troponin-T levels, and several other abnormal values. The patient underwent a TTE which revealed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate right ventricular hypokinesis, elevated left ventricular filling pressures, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension. The patient's condition remains unstable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction puts him at risk for developing"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Discontinued heparin drip given supratherapeutic INR
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Pt may undergo cardiac cath today given INR 2.0 today
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal to remain even throughout the day
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE yesterday showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and
   diastolic dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO TID for rapid A fib
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin for likely cath today and restart heparin gtt for
   prophylaxis
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation (AF), hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted for treatment of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient has severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, moderate right ventricular hypokinesis, elevated estimated left ventricular filling pressures, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and at least mild pulmonary hypertension. He also has thoracic aortic dilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD, previous CABG, and severe left ventricular dysfunction, there is a risk of recurrent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias (such as AF), and cardiovascular events.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's pneumonia and pulmonary hypertension can lead to respiratory distress, acute respiratory failure, and ventilatory support may be required.
3. Renal complications: The patient's acute on chronic renal insufficiency may worsen due to low cardiac output state, medications (such as ACE inhibitors), and potential use of nephrotoxic drugs.
4. Hepatic complications: The patient's transaminitis could progress to acute liver failure, especially if related to low cardiac output or seps"

   Imaging: TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). The estimated
   cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta
   is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. There may be aortic stenosis with
   restricted leaflet opening but the overall transvalvular velocity is
   preserved (which may be secondary to poor ventricular contractile
   function). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
   moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
   elevated left atrial pressure. There is (at least) mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   .
   IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
   Moderate right ventricular hypokinesis. Elevated estimated left
   ventricular filling pressures. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
   At least mild pulmonary hypertension. Thoracic aortic dilation.
   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Restart heparin drip
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Plan for cardiac cath when INR less, however trending up, gave Vit K
   yesterday
   - Trend CE's until peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal UOP 100cc/hr
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE today to evaluate for fixed wall motion abnormalities and EF
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is in rapid ventricular rate
   currently.  The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs.
   v tach earlier today at OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 50mg PO BID
   - Continue diltiazem drip
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin, continue heparin drip for now
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'
   - CXR on admission
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**]
   - Will add vancomycin and ceftaz to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Discontinued heparin drip given supratherapeutic INR
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal failure and adverse
   reaction to lisinopril (hyperkalemia)
   - Pt may undergo cardiac cath today given INR 2.0 today
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.
   - Lasix boluses for diuresis, goal to remain even throughout the day
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE yesterday showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and
   diastolic dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO TID for rapid A fib
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin for likely cath today and restart heparin gtt for
   prophylaxis
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, atrial fibrillation (AF), hypertension (HTN), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted for treatment of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. NSTEMI: The patient has 38-year-old bypass grafts with a high likelihood of restenosis due to type 2 DM. The stress of having pneumonia with AF may have precipitated this event.

2. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a documented ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25% at the other hospital (OSH) with severe global hypokinesis. There is likely worsening EF secondary to a large NSTEMI.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had a run of possible AF with aberrancy vs. ventricular tachycardia (VT) at OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.

4. Pneumonia: The patient possibly has hospital-acquired pneumonia given recent hospitalization last week for 'weakness.' The patient continues to spike temperatures overnight.

5. Type 2 DM: The patient's home glyburide is held, and sliding scale insulin is used.

   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - Discontinued heparin drip given supratherapeutic INR
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   - Hold ACE-I given his acute on chronic renal 1.5 today
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.  New flush edema, likely [**1-5**] to not taking daily lasix.
   - Lasix boluse daily for diuresis, goal -2 lt today
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider
   increasing to 100 mg QID.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin for likely cath today and restart heparin gtt for
   prophylaxis
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, atrial fibrillation (A fib), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM). He was admitted for treatment of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and A fib with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient has ongoing symptoms of pneumonia, including intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, increased pulse oxygen (PO2) metoprolol, and scheduled for catheterization (cath) in the morning. Chest X-ray (CXR) shows improvement in edema. This morning, the patient developed crackles on examination, so he received 40 IV Lasix, 2 mg IV morphine, 5 mg IV metoprolol, and another CXR was done due to his blood pressure being in the 90s and not giving nitro yet. The patient's allergies include penicillins, and he has had recent antibiotic usage including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and ceftazidime. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion, metoprolol, furosemide (Lasix), and morphine sulfate. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening systolic heart failure: The patient has a documented ejection fraction (EF) of 20"

   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  Cath showed 3VD with occlusion of LAD (80%) LCx and RCA as
   well as SVG.
   - CABG next week
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Considers starting on statin if transaminitis is better
   - No Plavix
   - Continue beta blockers
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.  New flush edema yesterday.
   - Lasix boluse daily for diuresis, goal -1 lt today
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider
   increasing to 100 mg QID.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - On heparin gtt , transition to warfarin post CABG
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  Improving.
   - Continue to trend LFTs (trending down over last few days)
   - Hold statins for now
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted to the ICU for treatment of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed triple vessel disease with occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), left circumflex artery (LCx), and right coronary artery (RCA), as well as stenosed venous grafts. The plan is for revision CABG next week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a severely reduced ejection fraction (20-25%) with severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction. This puts him at risk for worsening heart failure symptoms such as fluid retention, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to irregular heart rhythm and potential complications like stroke or thromboembolism if not properly managed.
3. Pneumonia: The patient may have hospital-acquired pneumonia given recent hospitalization and elevated temperatures overnight. He is currently on antibiotics, but close monitoring and further treatment may be necessary.
4. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes needs to be managed"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  Cath showed 3VD with occlusion of LAD (80%) LCx and RCA as
   well as SVG.
   - CABG next week
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Considers starting on statin if transaminitis is better
   - No Plavix
   - Continue beta blockers
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.  New flush edema yesterday.
   - Lasix boluse daily for diuresis, goal -1 lt today
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider
   increasing to 100 mg QID.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - On heparin gtt , transition to warfarin post CABG
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  Improving.
   - Continue to trend LFTs (trending down over last few days)
   - Hold statins for now
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypertension (HTN), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient was transferred for treatment of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's recent events include cardiac catheterization, arterial line placement, and pulmonary artery catheterization. The patient's current condition includes systolic heart failure with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%, severe global hypokinesis, and moderate right ventricular (RV) hypokinesis. The patient also has pneumonia, likely hospital-acquired, and acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency. The patient's medical management includes high-dose aspirin, consideration for statin therapy, beta-blockers, diuretics, and anticoagulation with heparin and warfarin. The patient's labs show elevated cardiac markers and liver enzymes, with a white blood cell count within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's EF of 20-25% indicates severe systolic dysfunction, which can lead to worsening heart failure symptoms and complications such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, and renal dysfunction.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and atrial fibrillation. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which revealed triple vessel disease and stenosed venous grafts. As a result, the plan is to perform a revision coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery on Tuesday. Dental consultation has been requested, and imaging studies such as a Panorex, CT chest, and carotids have been ordered.

During the catheterization, the patient received intravenous lasix for pulmonary edema. His pulmonary artery (PA) pressures were found to be low, so normal saline (NS) was added at a rate of 50cc/hr. The patient's blood glucose levels were elevated, likely due to stress and infection, leading to an increase in the sliding scale by 2 units. Heparin was restarted at 7:30 pm.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and has received various antibiotics, including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and ceftazidime. He is currently on heparin sodium infusion and furosemide (Lasix).

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events. Vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  The patient has 38 year old bypass grafts, with no more
   recent interventions.  In the setting of Type 2 DM, the likelihood that
   these grafts have restenosed is very high.  Most likely the stress of
   having a pneumonia with a fib precipitated this event.
   - cath today
   - Continue plavix 75mg daily (s/p 600mg loading at OSH)
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Hold high dose statin given transaminitis
   - Continue beta blockers
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.  New flush edema, likely [**1-5**] to not taking daily lasix.
   - Lasix boluse daily for diuresis, goal -2 lt today
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider
   increasing to 100 mg QID.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold coumadin for likely cath today and restart heparin gtt for
   prophylaxis
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Will use metoprolol instead of home propranolol in the attempt to
   rate control
   - Will restart home amlodipine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  At OSH, T bili 2.6, direct
   0.6, AST 288, ALT 170, AP 106.  Trending up AST now 458, INR 3.9
   - Continue to trend LFTs (trending down over last few days)
   - Hold statins for now
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   .
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted for treatment of NSTEMI and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed 3VD (three-vessel disease) and stenosed venous grafts. The patient will need revision CABG. He also has pneumonia and acute on chronic renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Revision CABG surgery: The patient's 3VD and stenosed venous grafts indicate the need for revision CABG surgery. This procedure carries its own risks such as bleeding, infection, blood clots, damage to nearby structures, and adverse reactions to anesthesia or medications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which may lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of infection, sepsis, and respiratory failure.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation increases the risk of blood clots, stroke, heart failure, and rapid heart rate.
4. Hypotension and fluid balance: The patient's low PA pressures and the need for diuresis indicate potential issues with blood pressure regulation and fluid balance. Hypotension can lead to organ hypoperfusion and dysfunction.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's acute on chronic renal insufficiency"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**39**] years ago, a fib, HTN, DM
   Type 2, transferred for treatment of NSTEMI and A fib with RVR.
   # NSTEMI:  Cath showed 3VD with occlusion of LAD (80%) LCx and RCA as
   well as SVG.
   - CABG next week
   - Continue high dose aspirin
   - Considers starting on statin if transaminitis is better
   - No Plavix
   - Continue beta blockers
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure:  EF documented to be 20-25% at OSH with
   severe global hypokinesis.  Likely worsening EF secondary to large
   NSTEMI.  New flush edema yesterday.
   - Lasix boluse daily for diuresis, goal -1 lt today
   - Monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - TTE showed EF 20-25% (same as OSH) with severe systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, moderate RV hypokinesis.
   - Unable to give ACE-I given adverse reaction
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient is better rate controlled currently.
   The patient had a run of possible a fib with aberrancy vs. v tach at
   OSH, likely caused by NSTEMI.
   - Continue metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO QID for rapid A fib, consider
   increasing to 100 mg QID.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - On heparin gtt , transition to warfarin post CABG
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Possibly hospital acquired pneumonia given recent
   hospitalization last week for 'weakness.'   Pt continues to spike temps
   overnight up to 102.1 yesterday
   - Will continue levaquin started [**2111-3-15**], and vancomycin and ceftaz
   started [**2111-3-16**] to cover HAP
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - Hold home glyburide
   - Sliding scale insulin
   # Transaminitis:  Likely secondary to low cardiac output in the setting
   of a large NSTEMI, or relative hypotension.  Improving.
   - Continue to trend LFTs (trending down over last few days)
   - Hold statins for now
   # Acute on chronic renal insuficiency:  At OSH, Crn on presentation
   1.2, with diuresis increased to 1.5.  This could also be secondary to
   low output state.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   # Chronic Thrombocytopenia:
   - Monitor closely with heparin IV

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the hospital for treatment of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and rapid ventricular response (RVR) associated with atrial fibrillation. Upon admission, he had an elevated temperature and was found to have pneumonia, likely hospital-acquired. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed triple vessel disease and occluded venous grafts. It was decided to proceed with revision CABG surgery. The patient also has systolic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (20-25%), and a transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction. He has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation, which are currently better rate-controlled. His blood glucose levels have been running high, possibly secondary to stress and infection, and his renal function has worsened. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including heparin, lasix, metoprolol tartrate, levaquin, vancomycin, and ceftazidime. He has allergies to penicillins and has experienced adverse reactions to ACE inhibitors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Revision CABG surgery: The patient requires a revision CABG surgery due to the occluded venous grafts. This procedure carries the"
