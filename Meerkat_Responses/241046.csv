   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old male with a history of pAF, s/p radical
   cystectomy and neobladder.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Patient had been weaned off diltiazem drip but
   then had to be restarted due to hypotension and inability to tolerate
   boluses of metoprolol.  Currently, BP
s are improved but IV metoprolol
   doses aren
t ideal management given short half life.  Realistically,
   patient is likely to need IV drips until he can be given PO meds.
   Diltiazem is nearly maxed and not effective so we will switch him to an
   esmolol drip today.
   -esmolol titrated to HR 60-80
   - No anticoagulation for now given recent procedure (CHADS-2 score = 1)
   - daily ECG
   - Resume oral BB when able to take PO
   - F/U TSH
   -Patient has ruled out for MI
   # Hypotension: Afebrile, no e/o infection.  Minimal blood loss during
   procedure.  Iatrogenic etiology  seems most likely in setting of nodal
   agents with hypovolemia probably worsening.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of persistent atrial fibrillation, who underwent a radical cystectomy and neobladder construction. He is currently in the ICU for post-operative care. The patient presented with rapid atrial fibrillation in the operating room and has been on a diltiazem drip. His blood pressure is stable but still requires intravenous metoprolol, which is not ideal due to its short half-life. The plan is to switch to an esmolol drip to control heart rate between 60-80 beats per minute. Anticoagulation is not necessary at this time due to the recent procedure (CHADS-2 score = 1), and he will be monitored with daily ECG. The patient will resume oral beta-blockers when able to take oral medications. Additionally, follow-up thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are needed, and the patient has been ruled out for myocardial infarction.

The patient also has hypotension, which is likely iatrogenic in origin, possibly worsened by hypovolemia. Cultures should be obtained if there is any indication of infection, and telemetry monitoring should continue.

The patient has a history of transitional cell carcinoma, for which he underwent cystectomy and neobladder construction. He is on morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), and prophylactic antibiotics (CTX and Flagyl) have been prescribed per urology orders."

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), who has undergone radical cystectomy and neobladder formation. He presented to the ICU with rapid AF in the operating room. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/62 mmHg to 111/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving diltiazem infusion for rate control and has been weaned off it. Metoprolol is being given intravenously every 6 hours once his blood pressure improves, aiming for a heart rate below 100 bpm. No anticoagulation is planned due to the recent procedure (CHADS-2 score = 1). An ECG will be obtained in the morning, and oral beta-blockers will be resumed when the patient can take oral medications. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels will be checked. The patient is expected to remain on intravenous medications until he can tolerate oral intake.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension, which is being investigated as a possible iatrogenic cause related to nodal agents or hypovolemia. A 500cc intravenous fluid bolus has been given, and further assessment will be done. Blood cultures will be obtained if there is a fever. A stat hematoc"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old male with a history of pAF, s/p radical
   cystectomy and neobladder.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Patient had been weaned off diltiazem drip but
   then had to be restarted due to hypotension and inability to tolerate
   boluses of metoprolol.  Was then tried on IV metoprolol with poor rate
   control.  Both drips were d/c
d and patient was started on esmolol drip
   with improvement of HR to 100s.   Will ultimately need po medications
   for rate control.
   - d/c esmolol; start po metoprolol and uptitrate for rate control as
   tolerated by BP
   - No anticoagulation for now given recent procedure (CHADS-2 score = 1)
   but would anticipate initiating ASA 81 po qd soon
   - daily ECG
   # Hypotension: Afebrile, no e/o infection.  Minimal blood loss during
   procedure.  Iatrogenic etiology  seems most likely in setting of nodal
   agents with hypovolemia probably worsening.
   - Culture if spikes
   - telemetry .
   # Transitional cell carcinoma: s/p cystectomy and neobladder
   construction
   - Morphine PCA per urology team
   - Was on CTX, flagyl as infection prophylaxis per urology but will d/c
   today
   - STRICT NPO except for cardiac meds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of pAF, who underwent a radical cystectomy and neobladder construction. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and transitional cell carcinoma. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to an irregular heartbeat and potential complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, indicating hypotension. This can result in inadequate perfusion of vital organs and may lead to organ damage or shock.
3. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the recent surgical procedure, making him susceptible to infections. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and take appropriate measures to prevent or treat them.
4. Blood Clots: The patient is at risk of developing blood clots due to immobility and the use of heparin prophylaxis. Monitoring for signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) is essential.
5. Nutritional Status: The patient has been on NPO status, meaning he is not allowed to eat or drink anything orally. This can lead to malnutrition and dehydration if not properly managed.
6. Medication Management: The patient requires close monitoring of his medications, particularly those for rate control"

s are improved but IV metoprolol
   doses aren
t ideal management given short half life.  Realistically,
   patient is likely to need IV drips until he can be given PO meds.
   Diltiazem is nearly maxed and not effective so we will switch him to an
   esmolol drip today.
