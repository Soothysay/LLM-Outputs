","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of chronic systolic heart failure and acute respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a worsening condition. The patient underwent extubation but became increasingly somnolent and was unable to protect her airway, leading to reintubation. She received azithromycin and ceftriaxone antibiotics. Heparin sodium and propofol infusions were also administered. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 111/70 to 138/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter. The patient has gained 0.3 kg since admission. Fluid balance shows a total input of 374 mL and output of 455 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates normal readings. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with ventilator settings adjusted to decrease FiO2, decrease TV, and increase RR. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 49, PaO2 of 444, and HCO3- of 36. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds with scattered wheezes, and symmetric chest expansion. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds"

   78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD, known AAA who
   presented to OSH with hypoxia and reduced EF, now intubated.
   .
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation,
   community acquired pneumonia, vs. pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia
   or HTN. Patient currently appears euvolemic.  Lungs clear to
   auscultation bilaterally. CXR not grossly overloaded. Chem 7 appears to
   be contraction alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   -obtain sputum cultures, blood cultures
   -continue nebs, solumedrol for presumed COPD exacerbation (Given IV
   solumedrol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.)
   -continue azithromycin for 5 day course empiric atypical pna given
   increased WBC count this AM; although no infiltrate on OSH chest CT,
   thick secretions yesterday.  Will stop ceftriaxone
   - will wean sedation and attempt t extubated today
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p multiple MIs. We do not have
   these records in our system. Outpatient cardiologist at [**Hospital 9079**] clinic.
   -rule out MI
 has had 2 neg troponins
   -continue ASA and statin
   -hold lisinopril and BB in the setting of hypotension
 will restart if
   BP stable later today
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has known systolic heart failure with baseline EF of
   30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   -held lisinopril [**3-8**] hypotension
 could restart today
   -follow I/Os, with goal even
   .
   # RHYTHM:  currently in atrial fibrillation, rate well controlled. Afib
   with RVR induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded
   with IV amiodarone. Most recent INR 1.4.
   -continue to anticoagulate with warfarin, recheck INR, heparin drip.
   CHAD2 score is 3
 6% annual stroke risk from age, chf, dm so benefits
   from continued anticoagulation
   -do not continue amiodarone started at OSH
   -continue digoxin, per outpatient regimen
   .
   # Neuro deficits by history, most likely TIA.
   - consider carotid dopplers, likely as outpatient.
   - full neuro exam when off sedation
   .
   # DM2: Unclear outpatient regimen. However with steroids, sugars have
   been elevated. Has been getting Lantus 40 units daily at OSH.
   -continue lantus 40u daily, plus SSI
   -qid fingersticks
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer. Appears euvolemic. Patient
   has new lung nodule, concerning for malignancy. If this is the case,
   this may be SIADH.
   -send urine lytes, serum osms
 fena < 1%
   .
   # Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  resolving.  She underwent an
   abdominal ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC
   likely representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
   4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
   -trend LFTs
   .
   #.  Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment concerning
   for malignancy:  This will need a biopsy and further workup once acute
   issues have resolved.
       .
   FEN:  NPO. No IV fluids. Replete lytes PRN.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and known abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). She presented to the hospital with hypoxia and reduced EF, was intubated, and currently has a ventilator in place. The patient's recent ABG showed a pH of 7.46, indicating respiratory alkalosis. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 111/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has edema in her lower extremities and clear breath sounds bilaterally on lung auscultation. Her labs indicate an elevated white blood cell count, troponin T level, and liver enzymes. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including known coronary artery disease (CAD) with multiple myocardial infarctions (MIs), systolic heart failure with a baseline EF of 30%, and COPD. She also has a new lung nodule concerning for malignancy.

   # PUMP:  Patient has known systolic heart failure with baseline EF of
   30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function, but should have TTE as an outpatient once
   her acute issues have resolved. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   - Continue Lisinopril
   - Follow I/Os, with goal even

   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD, known AAA who
   presented to OSH with hypoxia and reduced EF, now extubated.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation,
   community acquired pneumonia, vs. pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia
   or HTN. Patient currently appears euvolemic.  Lungs clear to
   auscultation bilaterally. CXR not grossly overloaded. Chem 7 appears to
   be contraction alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   -f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures (negative to date)
   -Continue nebs, solumedrol for presumed COPD exacerbation (Given IV
   solumedrol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.)
   -Continue Azithromycin for 5 day course empiric atypical PNA given
   increased WBC count this AM; although no infiltrate on OSH chest CT,
   thick secretions yesterday.  Will stop ceftriaxone
   - Extubated today
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p multiple MIs. We do not have
   these records in our system. Outpatient cardiologist at [**Hospital 9079**] clinic.
    Ruled out for MI during this admission.
   -Continue ASA, statin, Lisinopril
   -Hold BB in the setting of recent hypotension
 will consider
   restarting in the future if BP stable
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has known systolic heart failure with baseline EF of
   30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function, but should have TTE as an outpatient once
   her acute issues have resolved. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   - Continue Lisinopril
   - Follow I/Os, with goal even
   - Continue home Digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  currently in atrial fibrillation, rate well controlled. Afib
   with RVR induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded
   with IV amiodarone. Most recent INR 1.4.
   - Adjust Heparin sliding scale per correct weight.
   -Continue to anticoagulate with Warfarin, recheck INR.  CHAD2 score is
   3
 6% annual stroke risk from age, chf, dm so benefits from continued
   anticoagulation
   - Initiate Diltiazem 30mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Neuro deficits by history, most likely TIA.
   - consider carotid dopplers, likely as outpatient.
   - full neuro exam when off sedation
   .
   # DM2: Unclear outpatient regimen. However with steroids, sugars have
   been elevated. Question of Lantus dose at OSH, currently adequate sugar
   control on SSI without need for long acting insulin.
   -Discontinue Glargine as pt not requiring, and not on Glargine at home
   - Continue SSI
   -qid fingersticks
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer, currently resolved. Appears
   euvolemic. Patient has new lung nodule, concerning for malignancy, but
   given resolution of Na, unlikely to be SIADH.
   .
   # Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  Resolving.  She underwent an
   abdominal ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC
   likely representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
   4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
   .
   #.  Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment concerning
   for malignancy:
   - This will need a biopsy and further workup once acute issues have
   resolved.
   - Will notify pt and family once patient stabilized and out of the ICU
       .
   FEN:  Diabetic, heart healthy, low sodium diet. No IV fluids. Replete
   lytes PRN.
   .
   ACCESS: L IJ, may be pulled once pt stable after extubation.  PIV in
   place.
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip
   -Pain management with
   -Bowel regimen with  Miralax
   - GI PPx for high dose steroid use
   .
   CODE: DNR, confirmed with HCP at OSH. Patient already intubated. Okay

   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD, known AAA who
   presented to OSH with hypoxia and reduced EF, now intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation,
   community acquired pneumonia, vs. pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia
   or HTN. Patient currently appears euvolemic.  Lungs clear to
   auscultation bilaterally. CXR not grossly overloaded. Chem 7 appears to
   be contraction alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   -obtain sputum cultures, blood cultures
   -continue nebs, solumedrol for presumed COPD exacerbation (Given IV
   solumedrol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.)
   -continue azithromycin for 5 day course empiric atypical pna given
   increased WBC count this AM; although no infiltrate on OSH chest CT,
   thick secretions yesterday.  Will stop ceftriaxone
   - will wean sedation and attempt t extubated today
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p multiple MIs. We do not have
   these records in our system. Outpatient cardiologist at [**Hospital 9079**] clinic.
   -rule out MI
 has had 2 neg troponins
   -continue ASA and statin lisinopril
   -hold BB in the setting of hypotension
 will restart if BP stable
   later today
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has known systolic heart failure with baseline EF of
   30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   -held lisinopril [**3-8**] hypotension
 could restart today
   -follow I/Os, with goal even
   .
   # RHYTHM:  currently in atrial fibrillation, rate well controlled. Afib
   with RVR induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded
   with IV amiodarone. Most recent INR 1.4.
   -continue to anticoagulate with warfarin, recheck INR, heparin drip.
   CHAD2 score is 3
 6% annual stroke risk from age, chf, dm so benefits
   from continued anticoagulation
   -do not continue amiodarone started at OSH
   -continue digoxin, per outpatient regimen
   .
   # Neuro deficits by history, most likely TIA.
   - consider carotid dopplers, likely as outpatient.
   - full neuro exam when off sedation
   .
   # DM2: Unclear outpatient regimen. However with steroids, sugars have
   been elevated. Has been getting Lantus 40 units daily at OSH.
   -continue lantus 40u daily, plus SSI
   -qid fingersticks
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer. Appears euvolemic. Patient
   has new lung nodule, concerning for malignancy. If this is the case,
   this may be SIADH.
   -send urine lytes, serum osms
 fena < 1%
   .
   # Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  resolving.  She underwent an
   abdominal ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC
   likely representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
   4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
   -trend LFTs
   .
   #.  Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment concerning
   for malignancy:  This will need a biopsy and further workup once acute
   issues have resolved.
       .
   FEN:  NPO. No IV fluids. Replete lytes PRN.

- The patient is receiving various ICU care interventions including nutrition support, glycemic control, multi-lumen lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
- The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), indicating that they do not want to be resuscitated in case of cardiac or respiratory arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged immobilization leading to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and possible pulmonary embolism.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Wound infections or pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity and prolonged immobility.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening of renal failure due to hypoperfusion and fluid overload.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, in addition to the already present atrial fibrillation.
6. Sepsis or septic shock secondary to an underlying infection, especially considering the presence of fever and elevated white blood cell"

   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD, known AAA who
   presented to OSH with hypoxia and reduced EF, now extubated.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation,
   community acquired pneumonia, vs. pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia
   or HTN. Patient currently appears euvolemic.  Lungs clear to
   auscultation bilaterally. CXR not grossly overloaded. Chem 7 appears to
   be contraction alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   -f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures (negative to date)
   -Continue nebs, solumedrol for presumed COPD exacerbation (Given IV
   solumedrol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.)
   -Continue Azithromycin for 5 day course empiric atypical PNA given
   increased WBC count this AM; although no infiltrate on OSH chest CT,
   thick secretions yesterday.  Will stop ceftriaxone
   - Extubated yesterday
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p multiple MIs. We do not have
   these records in our system. Outpatient cardiologist at [**Hospital 9079**]
   clinic.  Ruled out for MI during this admission.
   -Continue ASA, statin, Lisinopril
   -Hold BB in the setting of recent hypotension
 will consider
   restarting in the future if BP stable
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has known systolic heart failure with baseline EF of
   30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function, but should have TTE as an outpatient once
   her acute issues have resolved. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   - Continue Lisinopril
   - Follow I/Os, with goal even
   - Continue home Digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  currently in atrial fibrillation, rate well controlled. Afib
   with RVR induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded
   with IV amiodarone. Most recent INR 1.4.
   - Adjust Heparin sliding scale per correct weight.
   -Continue to anticoagulate with Warfarin, recheck INR.  CHAD2 score is
   3
 6% annual stroke risk from age, chf, dm so benefits from continued
   anticoagulation
   - Initiate Diltiazem 30mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Neuro deficits by history, most likely TIA.
   - consider carotid dopplers, likely as outpatient.
   - full neuro exam when off sedation
   .
   # DM2: Unclear outpatient regimen. However with steroids, sugars have
   been elevated. Question of Lantus dose at OSH, currently adequate sugar
   control on SSI without need for long acting insulin.
   -Discontinue Glargine as pt not requiring, and not on Glargine at home
   - Continue SSI
   -qid fingersticks
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer, currently resolved. Appears
   euvolemic. Patient has new lung nodule, concerning for malignancy, but
   given resolution of hyponatremia, unlikely to be SIADH.
   .
   # Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  Resolving.  She underwent an
   abdominal ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC
   likely representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
   4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
   .
   #.  Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment concerning
   for malignancy:
   - This will need a biopsy and further workup once acute issues have
   resolved.
   - Will notify pt and family once patient stabilized and out of the ICU
       .
   FEN:  Diabetic, heart healthy, low sodium diet. No IV fluids. Replete
   lytes PRN.
   .
   ACCESS: L IJ, may be pulled once pt stable after extubation.  PIV in
   place.
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip
   -Pain management
   -Bowel regimen with  Miralax
   - GI PPx for high dose steroid use
   .
   CODE: DNR, confirmed with HCP at OSH. Patient already intubated. Okay
   with central lines and pressors.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and known abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient presented to the hospital with hypoxia and reduced ejection fraction, and is now extubated.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The differential includes COPD exacerbation, community-acquired pneumonia, and pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia or hypertension. The patient appears euvolemic, and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The chest X-ray does not show signs of gross overload. The patient is being treated with nebs and solumedrol for presumed COPD exacerbation, as well as Azithromycin for a 5-day course of empiric atypical pneumonia.

2. Coronaries: The patient has known coronary artery disease (CAD) with multiple myocardial infarctions. There are no records of these events available in the system, and the patient's outpatient cardiologist is at Hospital 9079. The patient is currently on ASA, statin, and Lisinopril. The use of beta-blockers is being held due to recent hypotension but may be restarted in the future if blood pressure stabilizes.

   # Respiratory Failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation,
   community acquired pneumonia, vs. pulmonary edema secondary to HTN.
   Ruled out for ischemia.  Patient currently appears euvolemic, CXR not
   grossly overloaded.  Rales on LLL possibly [**3-8**] fluid overload.
   Respiratory culture [**11-1**] grew out rare yeast, gram stain >25 PMN but no
   bacteria. Still with leukocytosis 12.1.  Ucx negative.  Chem 7 appears
   to be contraction alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.  Extubated
   yesterday, breathing well on 3L NC.
   - Continue Azithromycin for 5 day course for COPD flare
   - Taper steroids
   - Continue nebs
   - f/u blood cultures (negative to date)

   yesterday at home dose.
   -Continue ASA, statin, Lisinopril
   -Continue Metoprolol, uptitrate as needed to optimize HR control
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has known chronic systolic heart failure with baseline
   EF of 30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function, but should have TTE as an outpatient once
   her acute issues have resolved. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time unless patient becomes
   dyspneic or hypoxic.  Postive ~0.3 over 24 hours, initiated on 20mg po
   Lasix to start this morning.  Will monitor I/O today and diurese with
   additional Lasix to keep even if necessary.
   - Continue Lasix 20mg po daily
   - Lasix IV as needed to keep I/O even
   - Continue Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Currently in atrial fibrillation, rate well controlled. Afib
   with RVR induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded
   with IV Amiodarone. Most recent INR 1.4.   Initiated on Metoprolol at
   12.5mg daily (home dose) yesterday for tachycardia in 100
s.  Currently
   with HR 80
s with Metoprolol with SBP high 80
s, will transition to
   long acting Metoprolol today.  Will increase Diltiazem as needed for
   rate control to avoid risk of bronchospasm in pt with COPD.  PTT 150 on
   Heparin sliding scale.
   - Change Metoprolol to Metoprolol XR at same dose of 12.5 mg daily
   - Continue Diltiazem 30mg qid, increase as needed for rate control
   - Continue Coumadin, as INR 1.4, slowly increasing following
   administration of Vitamin K at OSH.  CHAD2 score is 3
 6% annual
   stroke risk from age, CHF, DM so benefits from continued
   anticoagulation
   .
 Neuro deficits by history, most likely TIA, no residual deficits.
   - Consider carotid dopplers, likely as outpatient.
   - full neuro exam when off sedation
   .
 DM2: Unclear outpatient regimen. However with steroids, sugars have
   been elevated. Question of Lantus dose at OSH, currently adequate sugar
   control on SSI without need for long acting insulin, will hold
   initiating Glargine if possible.
   - Continue SSI, adjust as needed
   - qid fingersticks
   .
 Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer, currently resolved. Appears
   euvolemic. Patient has new lung nodule, concerning for malignancy, but
   given resolution of hyponatremia, unlikely to be SIADH.
   .
 Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  Resolving.  She underwent an
   abdominal ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC
   likely representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
   4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
   .
 Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment concerning
   for malignancy:  In-house radiology will re-read CT images to confirm
   mass consistent with malignancy.  Patient notified this morning.
   - Obtain OSH imaging and f/u in-house read
   - Consult pulm pending in-house radiology read of CT; biopsy and
   further workup once acute issues have resolved.
       .
   FEN:  Diabetic, heart healthy, low sodium diet. No IV fluids. Replete
   lytes PRN.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented to the hospital with hypoxia and reduced ejection fraction and is currently extubated and breathing well on 3L NC.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes COPD exacerbation, community-acquired pneumonia, and pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension. However, these conditions have been ruled out, and the patient is now breathing well on a nasal cannula.

2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has known CAD with multiple previous myocardial infarctions (MIs). She was ruled out for MI during this admission, and her beta-blocker medication was re-initiated at home dose.

3. Pump Dysfunction: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with a baseline ejection fraction of 30%. Her most recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15-20%. The cause of her worsening systolic function is unclear, but she should undergo a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) as an outpatient once her acute issues have resolved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). She presented to the hospital with hypoxia and reduced ejection fraction. She was extubated yesterday and is currently breathing well on 3 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD exacerbation, community-acquired pneumonia, and pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension puts her at risk for respiratory failure. Rales on the left lower lobe could indicate fluid overload. The patient's recent respiratory culture grew rare yeast, suggesting a possible fungal infection.
2. Coronaries: The patient has known coronary artery disease (CAD) with multiple myocardial infarctions (MIs). It is important to rule out ongoing ischemia and optimize her cardiac care.
3. Pump Dysfunction: The patient has known systolic heart failure with a baseline ejection fraction of 30%. Her most recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15-20%. She may require further evaluation with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) as an outpatient. Her worsening systolic function should be investigated.

   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD, known AAA who
   presented to OSH with hypoxia and reduced EF, now extubated breathing
   well.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation,
   community acquired pneumonia, vs. pulmonary edema secondary to HTN.
   Ruled out for ischemia.  Patient currently appears euvolemic, CXR not
   grossly overloaded.  Rales on LLL possibly [**3-8**] PNA, as respiratory
   culture [**11-1**] grew out rare yeast, gram stain >25 PMN but no bacteria.
   Still with leukocytosis 12.1.  Ucx negative.  Chem 7 appears to be
   contraction alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.  Extubated
   yesterday, breathing well on 3L NC.
   - Continue Azithromycin for 5 day course empiric atypical PNA given
   increased WBC count this AM; although no infiltrate on OSH chest CT,
   thick secretions yesterday.
   - f/u blood cultures (negative to date)
   - Continue nebs, solumedrol for presumed COPD exacerbation (Given IV
   solumedrol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.)
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p multiple MIs. We do not have
   these records in our system. Outpatient cardiologist at [**Hospital 9079**]
   clinic.  Ruled out for MI during this admission.  Re-initiated on BB
   yesterday at home dose.
   -Continue ASA, statin, Lisinopril
   -Continue Metoprolol, uptitrate as needed to optimize HR control
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has known systolic heart failure with baseline EF of
   30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function, but should have TTE as an outpatient once
   her acute issues have resolved. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time unless patient becomes
   dyspneic or hypoxic.  Postive ~0.3 over 24 hours, initiated on 20mg po
   Lasix to start this morning.  Will monitor I/O today and diurese with
   additional Lasix to keep even.
   - Continue Lasix 20mg po daily
   - Lasix 20mg IV as needed to keep I/O even
   - Continue Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  currently in atrial fibrillation, rate well controlled. Afib
   with RVR induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded
   with IV Amiodarone. Most recent INR 1.4.   Initiated on Metoprolol at
   12.5mg daily (home dose) yesterday for tachycardia in 100
s.  Currently
   with continued HR 80
s-100
s, in need of up-titration of Metoprolol.
   PTT 150 on Heparin sliding scale.
   - Increase Metoprolol to 25mg daily
   - Continue Diltiazem 30mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider increasing Warfarin dose, as INR 1.4 four days after
   re-initiation.  CHAD2 score is 3
 6% annual stroke risk from age, chf,
   dm so benefits from continued anticoagulation
   .
   # Neuro deficits by history, most likely TIA.
   - consider carotid dopplers, likely as outpatient.
   - full neuro exam when off sedation
   .
   # DM2: Unclear outpatient regimen. However with steroids, sugars have
   been elevated. Question of Lantus dose at OSH, currently adequate sugar
   control on SSI without need for long acting insulin.
   - Discontinue Glargine as pt not requiring, and not on Glargine at home
   - Continue SSI
   -qid fingersticks
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer, currently resolved. Appears
   euvolemic. Patient has new lung nodule, concerning for malignancy, but
   given resolution of hyponatremia, unlikely to be SIADH.
   .
   # Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  Resolving.  She underwent an
   abdominal ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC
   likely representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
   4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
   .
   #.  Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment concerning
   for malignancy:
   - This will need a biopsy and further workup once acute issues have
   resolved.
   - Will notify pt and family once patient stabilized and out of the ICU
       .
   FEN:  Diabetic, heart healthy, low sodium diet. No IV fluids. Replete
   lytes PRN.
   .
   ACCESS: L IJ, may be pulled once pt stable after extubation.  PIV in
   place.
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip
   -Pain management
   -Bowel regimen with  Miralax
   - GI PPx for high dose steroid use
   .
   CODE: DNR, confirmed with HCP at OSH. Patient already intubated. Okay
   with central lines and pressors.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a known abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). She presented to the hospital with hypoxia and reduced EF and is now extubated and breathing well on 3L NC.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to a history of COPD and the possibility of pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension. Rales on the left lower lobe may indicate pneumonia.
2. Coronaries: The patient has known coronary artery disease (CAD) with multiple myocardial infarctions (MIs). It is important to continue optimizing her heart rate control and ensure appropriate management of her CAD.
3. Pump Dysfunction: The patient's systolic heart failure with a baseline EF of 30% has worsened, with the most recent echo showing an EF of 15-20%. Further investigation into the cause of the worsening systolic function is needed.
4. Neuro Deficits: The patient has a history of neurologic deficits, likely due to transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Carotid doppler studies may be considered as an outpatient.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (DM2): The patient's diabetic"
