","Chief Complaint: Epistaxis, BRBPR, thrombocytopenia

Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 93-year-old female with a history of CAD who presented to the emergency department with epistaxis that was difficult to control, as well as BRBPR. Her evaluation revealed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 3. She received 2 units of PRBC and 2 bags of platelets and was admitted to the ICU. In the ICU, her anti-platelet medications were held and a head CT was unremarkable.

The patient's condition has worsened, with new leukopenia, worsening anemia (hct 19 from 23%), and persistent thrombocytopenia. She is pancytopenic this morning. The peripheral smear was negative for schistocytes with normal cell morphology, raising concern for ITP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of spontaneous bleeding. Despite transfusions of platelets and PRBC, she remains pancytopenic. The differential diagnosis includes Plavix, viral syndrome, ITP, myelodysplasia, and TTP. No evidence of DIC is observed. The goal is to maintain platelet count above 30K. Repeat fibrinogen and LDH tests are pending, and hematology follow-up is planned. Prednisone"

","Summary:
The patient is a 93-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the emergency department with epistaxis (nosebleed) and bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. She has been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), anemia (low red blood cell count), and leukopenia (low white blood cell count). The initial evaluation at another hospital raised concerns about immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), but her peripheral smear showed normal cell morphology. She received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and two bags of platelets. She was admitted to the ICU and her antiplatelet medications were held. A head CT scan was unremarkable.

The patient's condition has worsened, with worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia. Her platelet count has decreased further. She is pancytopenic, meaning all three blood cell types (red cells, white cells, and platelets) are low. The peripheral smear did not show schistocytes, which are fragmented red blood cells often seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Her fibrinogen level is low, and her D-dimer is elevated, which may indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, there is no evidence of DIC.

The patient's blood cultures are negative, and her chest X"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 93-year-old female with bleeding and low platelets, likely due to immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). She was started on Prednisone and transfused with PRBCs and platelets to increase Hct and platelet count. The patient's EKG showed resolution of previous STDs, and DNR/DNI was confirmed. Allergies include codeine, Percocet, and shortness of breath. The patient received Pantoprazole and other ICU medications. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission. Flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results. Physical examination assessments were not performed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems. Lab results show low WBC, Hct, and platelet counts, but normal Cr, glucose, and electrolyte levels. Assessment and plan involve management of thrombocytopenia, anemia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and urinary urgency. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT and VAP, and comments."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 90-year-old female, is in the ICU with a chief complaint of bleeding associated with low platelet count. She was started on Prednisone for presumed idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells and 1 bag of platelets, which increased her hematocrit and platelet count to 26.6% and 30, respectively.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/50-157/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,626 mL with an output of 1,930 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 696 mL. The patient is not receiving respiratory support, but her ABG results are within normal limits. 

Physical examination findings are not documented for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessment, and other systems.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female who presented with bleeding and was found to have low platelets, likely secondary to immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). She was started on Prednisone 1 mg/kg for presumed ITP. The patient received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 1 bag of platelets, resulting in an appropriate increase in hematocrit (Hct) and platelet count to 30 (goal > 10). Her repeat EKG at a slower rate showed resolution of previous ST-segment depressions (STDs). The patient confirmed her do not resuscitate (DNR) status, but not do not intubate (DNI). She has allergies to codeine, Percocet (oral), and shortness of breath. Her last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient is currently on various ICU medications, including Pantoprazole (Protonix), and other medications. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet count, which can lead to increased bleeding risk. Monitoring platelet levels and transfusing platelets to keep the count above 30 is recommended.
2. Anemia: The patient's Hct has improved"

   Assessment and Plan
   92 F PMH CAD admitted with profound thrombocytopenia with spontaneous
   bleeding.  ITP is leading the differential, though the evaluation is
   still ongoing.  To date, the only abnormality includes a low vitamin
   B12 level.
   1)       Thrombocytopenia
 Currently having epistaxis that is not
   being easily controlled.  Will transfuse another bag of platelets now
   and then repeat CBC.  Continue prednisone 40 mg daily.  Hematology
   following and considering bone marrow biopsy.  Holding anti-platelet
   therapy.  Viral serologies pending.
   2)       Vitamin B12 deficiency
 Start replacement today with 1000 mcg
   daily for 7 days, followed by 1000 mcg weekly for a month, then 1000
   mcg monthly.
   3)       CAD
 Continue BB, ACEI, statin.
   4)       HTN
 BB, ACEI. [**Month (only) 60**] need to uptitrate BB or resume amlodipine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 92-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted to the ICU with profound thrombocytopenia and spontaneous bleeding, including epistaxis and rectal bleeding. The patient's platelet count has responded to platelet transfusions and there are no signs of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is leading the differential diagnosis, along with viral serologies and metabolic studies pending. The patient has also been anemic and required packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions but seems to have stabilized. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count can lead to spontaneous bleeding, which is already evident from the epistaxis that is not being easily controlled. Continuing prednisone therapy and monitoring the platelet count is important. If the platelet count does not improve, a bone marrow biopsy may be considered.

2. Vitamin B12 deficiency: The patient has a low vitamin B12 level, which needs to be corrected. Vitamin B12 replacement therapy should be started to prevent further complications associated with this deficiency.

3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's CAD should continue to be managed with beta-blockers (BB), angiotensin-converting enzyme"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female who presents with bleeding in the setting of low platelets, likely secondary to ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura). The patient's platelet count is currently at 11 K/uL. She has been started on B12 repletion and prednisone for ITP. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are stable, but she has mild, non-focal cognitive impairment. She has a history of CAD, HTN, and urinary urgency. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 45 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 166/65 to 129/48 mmHg. She is receiving various medications, including Lopressor for blood pressure control and antibiotics for an unknown infection. She has a history of allergies to codeine, Percocet, and shortness of breath. The patient's recent lab results show low platelets, low calcium, low magnesium, and normal kidney function. Her blood cultures are still pending. The patient's current plan includes transfusing platelets to keep the count above 30 K/uL, transfusing red blood cells to maintain a hematocrit level above 25%, holding antiplatelet medications until platelet counts recover, and monitoring for any signs of active bleeding or cardiovascular problems. The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female presenting with bleeding and low platelets, likely due to ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura). She is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding and can lead to life-threatening complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to bleeding and may worsen if there is ongoing blood loss or inadequate red blood cell production.
3. Cardiovascular disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and is currently on medication for it. However, due to her thrombocytopenia, she is at an increased risk of cardiac complications, especially if her blood pressure drops or if she experiences any cardiac events.
4. Hypertension (HTN): The patient's hypertension needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as stroke or heart attack.
5. Urinary urgency: The patient's urinary urgency should be managed to prevent urinary tract infections or other urinary complications.
6. Vitamin B12 deficiency: The patient is being repleted with vitamin B12, which is important to prevent neurological complications associated with its deficiency.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient may be at risk for stress ulcers due to her critical illness and medication use. Prophyl"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and presumed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), epistaxis, and extremely low platelets. She was started on prednisone and has had recurrent epistaxis requiring nasal packing. Allergies include codeine and oxycodone/acetaminophen. She has been receiving various infusions and medications in the ICU. Vital signs show sinus bradycardia and slightly elevated blood pressure. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Physical examination reveals ecchymoses on her shins and arms, as well as a neck brace due to recent cervical spine fracture. Lab results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's extremely low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications, such as further epistaxis or bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.
2. Vitamin B12 deficiency: The patient has a low vitamin B12 level, which may contribute to anemia and other systemic complications if left untreated.
3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and presumed immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). She was admitted with profound thrombocytopenia and spontaneous bleeding. The initial assessment included low platelets, elevated bleeding time, and abnormal coagulation profile. The patient has been started on prednisone and her vitamin B12 level is low. She also has a history of CAD and HTN, for which she is currently taking beta-blockers and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) as part of her medication regimen. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 161/60 to 129/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has experienced epistaxis and presumed bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. She is currently in the ICU and will be transferred to the floor once stabilized. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of thrombocytopenia leading to further bleeding episodes, progression of CAD, and uncontrolled hypertension."
