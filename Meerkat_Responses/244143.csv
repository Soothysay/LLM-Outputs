   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 37 year old female with an unknown past medical history found
   unresponsive in her car after vomiting surrounded by pills with concern
   for suicide attempt with overdose.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness - Likely secondary to whatever medications the
   patient overdosed on and alcohol.  Intubated for airway protection at
   OSH after seizure.  More responsive now; had several episodes of
   agitation overnight requiring propofol as well as midazolam boluses.
   -RSBI this morning was [**Last Name (LF) 13693**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] we can extubate this morning.
   - monitor neurologic exam
   - ativan prn seizure
   .
   # Overdose, suicide attempt - Felt to be a suicide attempt.  Received
   charcoal at the OSH.  Evaluated by toxicology in the ED with concern
   for benadryl overdose and anticholinergic syndrome, though patient no
   longer tachycardic.  Utox and serum tox unrevealing except for alcohol
   (benzos likely secondary to ativan given for seizure at OSH).  Noteably
   negative for acetaminophen and tricyclics.
   - supportive care per toxicology recs
   - serial EKGs to monitor for QRS prolongation today; if no prolongation
   today can stop obtaining EKGs
   - if QTS > 100, [**12-14**] amps NaHCO3, consider gtt prn
   - monitor lytes, trend lactate
   - psychiatry evaluation when extubated and awake
   - CIWA scale when extubated and sedation has worn off
   - will require a sitter when extubated
   -social work consult
   .
   # Fevers - Was febrile O/N to 101.1, also has leukocytosis suggesting
   that underlying infection may be present.  Differential for fevers in
   her includes poor heat regulation secondary to anticholingeric
   toxicity, as well as fevers in the setting of alcohol withdrawal;
   however the accompanying leukocytosis argues for infection.
   -F/u blood cultures, urine cultures from last night
   -CXR this AM; follow up read
   -Trend fever curve and white count
   -Once extubated and after sedation is wearing off monitor for signs of
   withdrawal with CIWA (not currently on this as has been getting
   midazolam and propofol)
   -Consider antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with an unknown past medical history who was found unresponsive in her car after vomiting surrounded by pills with concern for a suicide attempt. The patient received charcoal at the OSH and was evaluated by toxicology in the ED with concern for a benadryl overdose and anticholinergic syndrome, though the patient is no longer tachycardic. Utox and serum tox were unrevealing except for alcohol (benzos likely secondary to ativan given for seizure at OSH). Notably negative for acetaminophen and tricyclics.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated for airway protection. She has had several episodes of agitation overnight requiring propofol as well as midazolam boluses. The RSBI this morning was [Last Name (LF) 13693], [First Name3 (LF)] and it is planned to extubate the patient this morning.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, suggesting an underlying infection. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia given her unresponsive state and potential for aspiration. Cultures have been sent and further monitoring is needed.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol use and current symptoms raise the concern for alcohol withdrawal. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal and CIWA scale when extubated and sed"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 37 year old female with an unknown past medical history found
   unresponsive in her car after vomiting surrounded by pills with concern
   for suicide attempt with overdose.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness - Likely secondary to whatever medications the
   patient overdosed on and alcohol.  Intubated for airway protection at
   OSH after seizure.  More responsive now; had several episodes of
   agitation overnight requiring propofol as well as midazolam boluses.
   -RSBI this morning was [**Last Name (LF) 13693**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] we can extubate this morning.
   - monitor neurologic exam
   - ativan prn seizure
   .
   # Overdose, suicide attempt - Felt to be a suicide attempt.  Received
   charcoal at the OSH.  Evaluated by toxicology in the ED with concern
   for benadryl overdose and anticholinergic syndrome, though patient no
   longer tachycardic.  Utox and serum tox unrevealing except for alcohol
   (benzos likely secondary to ativan given for seizure at OSH).  Noteably
   negative for acetaminophen and tricyclics.
   - supportive care per toxicology recs
   - serial EKGs to monitor for QRS prolongation today; if no prolongation
   today can stop obtaining EKGs
   - if QTS > 100, [**12-14**] amps NaHCO3, consider gtt prn
   - monitor lytes, trend lactate
   - psychiatry evaluation when extubated and awake
   - CIWA scale when extubated and sedation has worn off
   - will require a sitter when extubated
   -social work consult
   .
   # Fevers - Was febrile O/N to 101.1, also has leukocytosis suggesting
   that underlying infection may be present.  Differential for fevers in
   her includes poor heat regulation secondary to anticholingeric
   toxicity, as well as fevers in the setting of alcohol withdrawal;
   however the accompanying leukocytosis argues for infection.
   -F/u blood cultures, urine cultures from last night
   -CXR this AM; follow up read
   -Trend fever curve and white count
   -Once extubated and after sedation is wearing off monitor for signs of
   withdrawal with CIWA (not currently on this as has been getting
   midazolam and propofol)

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with an unknown past medical history who was found unresponsive in her car after vomiting surrounded by pills, with concern for a suicide attempt. She was intubated for airway protection and brought to the hospital. The patient is now more responsive but had several episodes of agitation overnight requiring propofol and midazolam boluses. Her respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR (set) of 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 47. Physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, movement, and tone. The patient's labs show a WBC count of 15.1, Hct of 34.7, Plt of 147, Cr of 0.8, TCO2 of 24, Glucose of 94, and other abnormal values. The patient's assessment includes unresponsiveness likely secondary to medication overdose and alcohol, overdose, and suicide attempt. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of an underlying infection. Blood cultures and urine cultures from last night should be followed up, and a chest X-ray (CXR) should be obtained this morning.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with an unknown past medical history found unresponsive in her car after vomiting surrounded by pills, raising concerns for a suicide attempt with overdose. She was intubated for airway protection at OSH after experiencing a seizure and is now awake and extubated. The patient is anxious and receiving ativan for anxiety. Fever, worsening leukocytosis, and sputum positive for Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) indicate a possible pneumonia, most likely community-acquired staph or MRSA given her intubation. Antibiotic coverage will be switched to clindamycin, following culture results. Trend fever curve and white count should be monitored, along with follow-up blood cultures and urine cultures from last night. The unresponsiveness is likely secondary to the medications overdosed on and alcohol consumption. The patient received charcoal at OSH and was evaluated by toxicology in the ED with concern for benadryl overdose and anticholinergic syndrome. However, the patient is no longer tachycardic, and utrox and serum tox were unrevealing except for alcohol. Notably negative for acetaminophen and tricyclics.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient was found unresponsive and is currently in the ICU. They have a fever of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit and an abnormal EKG with QTc interval of 421. The patient has been prescribed Ativan for anxiety and requires a psychiatric consultation. They are not allowed to leave against medical advice (AMA) and need a 1:1 sitter. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/64 to 142/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium and has received various other medications. Fluid balance shows an intake of 947 mL and output of 3,850 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,903 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, with an ABG showing partial pressures of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate at 21, 45, and 12 mmHg, respectively. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with normal glucose levels. The assessment includes fever, poisoning/overdose, suicidal ideation, ineffective coping, and airway protection issues. The plan involves managing the patient's nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and they are not permitted to leave AMA.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection, which can worsen if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to protect their airway increases the risk of aspiration and respiratory failure if proper ventilation and suctioning are not maintained.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The fluctuating blood pressure readings suggest potential cardiovascular instability, which may require further investigation and intervention.
4. Organ dysfunction: Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and creatinine levels may indicate organ dysfunction, such as liver or kidney impairment, which should be closely monitored and managed accordingly.
5. Suicidal behavior: The patient's suicidal ideation and attempt pose a significant risk for self-harm and require careful psychiatric evaluation and management.
6. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobilization due to critical illness increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), necessitating appropriate prophylaxis measures."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 37 year old female with an unknown past medical history found
   unresponsive in her car after vomiting surrounded by pills with concern
   for suicide attempt with overdose.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness - Likely secondary to whatever medications the
   patient overdosed on and alcohol.  Intubated for airway protection at
   OSH after seizure.  More responsive now; had several episodes of
   agitation overnight requiring propofol as well as midazolam boluses.
   -RSBI this morning was [**Last Name (LF) 13693**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] we can extubate this morning.
   - monitor neurologic exam
   - ativan prn seizure
   .
   # Overdose, suicide attempt - Felt to be a suicide attempt.  Received
   charcoal at the OSH.  Evaluated by toxicology in the ED with concern
   for benadryl overdose and anticholinergic syndrome, though patient no
   longer tachycardic.  Utox and serum tox unrevealing except for alcohol
   (benzos likely secondary to ativan given for seizure at OSH).  Noteably
   negative for acetaminophen and tricyclics.
   - supportive care per toxicology recs
   - serial EKGs to monitor for QRS prolongation today; if no prolongation
   today can stop obtaining EKGs
   - if QTS > 100, [**12-14**] amps NaHCO3, consider gtt prn
   - monitor lytes, trend lactate
   - psychiatry evaluation when extubated and awake
   - CIWA scale when extubated and sedation has worn off
   - will require a sitter when extubated
   -social work consult
   .
   # Fever, worsening leukocytosis - Was febrile O/N to 101.5, also has
   worsening leukocytosis suggesting that underlying infection may be
   present.  Differential for fevers in her includes poor heat regulation
   secondary to anticholingeric toxicity, as well as fevers in the setting
   of alcohol withdrawal; however the accompanying leukocytosis argues for
   infection.
   -F/u blood cultures, urine cultures from last night
   -CXR this AM; follow up read
   -Trend fever curve and white count
   -Once extubated and after sedation is wearing off monitor for signs of
   withdrawal with CIWA (not currently on this as has been getting
   midazolam and propofol)
   -Consider antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female who was found unresponsive in her car after vomiting surrounded by pills with concern for a suicide attempt. She was intubated for airway protection and now is awake and extubated. The patient is experiencing anxiety and is being given Ativan for it. 

The patient has a history of overdose and possible suicide attempt. She received charcoal at the OSH and was evaluated by toxicology in the ED with concern for a benadryl overdose and anticholinergic syndrome. However, her utrox and serum tox were unrevealing except for alcohol (benzos likely secondary to Ativan given for seizure at OSH). Notably, she tested negative for acetaminophen and tricyclics.

The patient is currently being monitored for QRS prolongation on EKGs, as well as her electrolytes, lactate levels, and neurologic exam. She is also receiving supportive care per toxicology recommendations.

Additionally, the patient has a fever and worsening leukocytosis, along with a new infiltrate on her chest X-ray. This could indicate pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia, especially considering her history of alcohol use. All culture data is pending. She is being followed up with blood cultures, urine cultures from last night, and a repeat CXR. Her fever curve and white count are being trended, and antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia is being considered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old female who presented to the ICU with an overdose. She has been experiencing coughing productively and has had a fever overnight. The patient has a history of suicide attempt, ineffective coping, and inability to protect her airway. She is currently intubated due to her altered mental status and risk for aspiration. Her vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 122/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination reveals crackles at the right base of her lungs and edema in both lower extremities. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, and abnormal kidney function. The patient's medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis and clindamycin for community-acquired MRSA and anaerobes. She is receiving nutrition through tube feeds. The patient's disposition is planned for transfer to the floor once she is medically cleared.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of coughing productively, fever, and crackles at the right base of her lungs suggest a possible pneumonia. This could be confirmed through a chest X-ray and further laboratory tests.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's presence of lower extremity edema may indicate a potential DVT. This can be"
