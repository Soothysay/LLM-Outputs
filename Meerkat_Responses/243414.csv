   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including healthcare associated
   pneumonia, chronic aspiration, afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who
   presents with hypoxia, consistent with pulmonary edema.
   .
   # Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: CXR with increased volume and
   patient did not improve with Bipap in the ED. Now intubated with
   improved ventilation on ABG. BNP greater than assay is markedly
   consistent with CHF. Put out well in the ED. Anticoagulated, so PE
   seems less likely. Mucous plugging seems like a likely component as
   well. Already on HAP treatment, and schedule to complete course
   tommorow. Worsening leukocytosis and fever concerning for possible
   resistant organism.
   - Continue Ventilation now, but reduce set rate given worsening
   alkalosis over
   - Continuing [**Last Name (un) 350**]/Vanco/Flagyl
   - Repeat TTE
   - consider additional diuresis this afternoon as BP allows
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - Change sedation to propafol for hopeful extubation in AM
   .
   # Pneumonia: Initially the pt was on vanc/pip-tazo for HCAP on
   admission on [**3-11**]. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to cefepime on
   [**3-13**]. Metronidazole was added on [**3-13**] due to persistent fevers.
   - broaden as above
   - follow cultures
   - repeat sputum
   .
   # Hypernatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be do to poor po intake, but patient total body
   overloaded. 2.5 L deficit at this time. Do not want to fluid bolus
   given CHF as above. Na 149 this AM.
   - FW flushes through tube 250cc x4
   -
   .
   # NSTEMI: Troponin elevated but flat CK, could be consistent with
   resolving infarct on last admission. EKG with signs of demand in
   lateral leads.  Troponin still trending up
   - cycle enzymes to peak
   - asa 325 mg daily
   - high dose statin
   - Betablocker with holding parameters
   - hold ace-i in setting of acute CHF
   .
   # Afib: Sinus tachycardia has resolved,  was previously in Afib in ED.
   Pt has been on anticoagulation for afib with stable hct for the past
   few days.
   - Continue coumadin
   - Rate control as above
   - Repeat EKG in AM
   .
   # Anemia: 5 point Hct drop in the setting of diuresis is concerning.
   Mild tachycardia, but patient is betablocked at baseline.
   - guaiac stools
   - continue PPI
   - T and S
   - Maintain 2 PIVs
   .
   # Dm: ISS
   .
   # Dementia: Continue mirtazapine
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   # Prophylaxis: On coumadin, PPI
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: has two daughters and son; [**Doctor Last Name **] is HCP, work

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including healthcare-associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular accidents. The patient presented with hypoxia consistent with pulmonary edema and was intubated due to acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's BNP levels are markedly elevated, suggesting congestive heart failure. The patient is already on treatment for healthcare-associated pneumonia and scheduled to complete the course tomorrow. There is worsening leukocytosis and fever, which is concerning for a possible resistant organism. The patient's current medications include [Last Name (un)]/Vanco/Flagyl, and they will continue ventilation but attempt extubation later in the morning. Repeat TTE is planned, and sedation will be changed to propofol for possible extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure and required intubation. Close monitoring of ventilation parameters and ABG results is necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination.

2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's BNP levels are markedly elevated, suggesting CHF. Monitoring fluid balance, pulmonary edema, and cardiac function through repeated TTEs is crucial. Care must be taken not to fluid overload the patient due to the risk of worsening CHF.

3. Healthcare-associated pneumonia"

   add the following points:
   Events: Hypotensive, propofol d/c
d and started on levophed.  PICC team
   informed of ?malposition of line on CXR, per their records, line has
   not moved and ? of whether tip is lost in mediastinal shadow.  Given
   lasix but I/O positive.

   levophed, simvastatin, free H2O bolus.
   78 y/o man with multiple medical problems including [**Name2 (NI) **], chronic
   aspiration, EF 40%, CVA, CAD, DM, Afib on coumdin admitted from [**Hospital 12226**] after recent d/c from [**Hospital1 5**] ([**3-19**]) admitted with recurrent
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, CHF (BNP of >70K) vs aspiration (h/o
   same, WBC 20).
   While doing better from resp status unclear how well underlying CHF has
   been treated, remains an aspiration risk, and would want to clarify
   code status as discussion re: DNR/DNI is pending.  Will continue
   treatment for HAP.
   Hypotensive in setting of Hct trending down
 transfuse, guaiac stool,
   Vit K, d/c coumadin and give FFP; will give CT abd if continues as
   bleed of unclear origin at prior admission.  Ddx for hypotension
   includes sepsis, cardiogenic; latter seems less likely given overall
   trend down in Trop, but will follow.
   Access an issue
 apparently required fem line in past; PICC is new
   from [**3-19**], though may be in great vessel and not SVC.  Will defer for
   now given risk / benefit unless pressor requirement persistent.

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including healthcare-associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents, and coronary artery disease. He presents with hypoxia consistent with pulmonary edema, acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, and worsening leukocytosis and fever concerning for possible resistant organism.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, pneumonia, hypernatremia, NSTEMI, atrial fibrillation, anemia, diabetes mellitus, dementia, and feeding tube. The plan includes continuing ventilation and discussing possible extubation, pressure support trial, broadening antibiotics, and monitoring for resistant organisms. The patient is also being treated for CHF, aspiration, and healthcare-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, and further cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias. The patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and management of these potential complications."

   patient did not improve with Bipap in the ED. Now intubated with
   improved ventilation on ABG. BNP greater than assay is markedly
   consistent with CHF. Put out well in the ED. Anticoagulated, so PE
   seems less likely. Mucous plugging seems like a likely component as
   well. Already on HAP treatment, and schedule to complete course today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems, presented with hypoxia consistent with pulmonary edema. He was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation due to acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's condition improved with ventilation, and his BNP levels are markedly consistent with CHF. The patient is already on HAP treatment and is scheduled to complete the course today. There is worsening leukocytosis and fever, which is concerning for a possible resistant organism.

The patient remains hypotensive despite diuresis overnight and has been started on levophed. There are concerns about CVL, decreasing PEEP, and attempting to wean the pressor. The patient initially received vanc/pip-tazo for HCAP but was changed to cefepime on [**3-13**]. Metronidazole was added on [**3-13**] due to persistent fevers.

The patient has hypernatremia, possibly due to poor PO intake and total body overload. There is a sodium level of 149 this morning. The patient's Troponin T levels are elevated but flat, which could be consistent with a resolving infarct on the last admission. The EKG shows signs of demand in the lateral leads. The patient has been anticoagulated for afib, but the Hct is trending down.

There is a concern about anemia with a 5-point Hct drop in"

The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems including healthcare-associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, coronary artery disease (CAD), and cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). The patient presented with hypoxia consistent with pulmonary edema and acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation with improved ventilation on ABG. His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are markedly elevated, consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). There is also evidence of anasarca, pleural effusions, and hyperdense fluid within the sigmoid colon, which may represent oral contrast or blood. The patient has been receiving treatment for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) with cefepime, metronidazole, and vancomycin. His leukocytosis and fever indicate a possible resistant organism. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's inability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation can lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's elevated BNP levels and symptoms suggest worsening heart failure, which can result in fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's persistent fevers and leukocytosis indicate an ongoing infection, possibly due to a resistant organism. This can lead to worsening of respiratory symptoms and systemic illness.

   CT Abdomen/Pelvis without Contrast:
   1. No definite evidence of retroperitoneal bleeding.
   2. Hyperdense fluid within the sigmoid colon. Correlation with
   Hemoccult is
   recommended to exclude blood within the colon. Alternately, this may
   represent oral contrast. Correlation with clinical history is
   recommended.
   3. Large bilateral pleural effusions, slightly increased when compared
   to
   prior exam.
   4. Vascular calcifications.
   5. Diffuse anasarca.
   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including healthcare associated
   pneumonia, chronic aspiration, afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who
   presents with hypoxia, consistent with pulmonary edema.
   # Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: CXR with increased volume and
   patient did not improve with Bipap in the ED. Now intubated with
   improved ventilation on ABG. BNP greater than assay is markedly
   consistent with CHF. Put out well in the ED. Anticoagulated, so PE
   seems less likely. Mucous plugging seems like a likely component as
   well. Worsening leukocytosis and fever concerning for possible
   resistant organism. CXR today with worsening infiltrates.
   - Continue Ventilation now and talk with family about possible
   extubation (family meeting scheduled for Tuesday)
   - Pressure support trial on 0/0
   - Continuing [**Last Name (un) 350**]/Vanco/Flagyl
   - Repeat TTE
   # Hypotension:  pt. intermittently hypotensive with diuresis, continues
   on levophed
   - consider CVL
   - attempt to wean pressor
   # Pneumonia: Initially the pt was on vanc/pip-tazo for HCAP on
   admission on [**3-11**]. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to cefepime on
   [**3-13**]. Metronidazole was added on [**3-13**] due to persistent fevers.
   - broaden as above
   - check vancomycin trough prior to PM dose
   - follow cultures
   - repeat sputum
   # Hypernatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be do to poor po intake, but patient total body
   overloaded. 2.5 L deficit at this time. Do not want to fluid bolus
   given CHF as above. Na 145 this AM.  FWD about 2L
   - Continue FW flushes through tube 250cc x4
   # NSTEMI: Troponin elevated but flat CK, could be consistent with
   resolving infarct on last admission. EKG with signs of demand in
   lateral leads.  Troponin now trending down
   - cycle enzymes to peak
   - asa 325 mg daily
   - high dose statin
   - d/c beta blocker
   - hold ace-i in setting of acute CHF
   # Afib: Sinus tachycardia has resolved, was previously in Afib in ED.
   Pt has been on anticoagulation for afib but Hct trending down. Concern
   for RP bleed but nothing on imaging.
   - hold coumadin for now, consider restarting in the near future
   - Rate control as above
   - Repeat EKG this morning
   # Anemia: HCT appears stable after transfusion of 1 unit pRBCs.
   - continue PPI
   - T and S
   - Maintain 2 PIVs , PICC
   # Dm: ISS
   # Dementia: Continue mirtazapine

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems including healthcare-associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presents with hypoxia consistent with pulmonary edema and is currently intubated.

The patient's condition has been stable with improved ventilation on the ventilator. However, there are several potential medical complications that could arise:

1. Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure and was intubated due to worsening pulmonary edema. This condition requires continued ventilation support.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been intermittently hypotensive, possibly due to diuresis. The patient is on levophed, a vasopressor, to maintain blood pressure. Consideration should be given to central venous pressure monitoring (CVL) and attempting to wean the pressor.

3. Pneumonia: The patient was initially treated with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). The antibiotic regimen may need to be broadened, and cultures should be followed.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, possibly due to poor oral intake and fluid overload. Sodium levels should be carefully monitored, and fluid restriction may be necessary.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is still intubated in the ICU and remains in critical condition. The son of the patient discussed the family's goal to have a meeting at Hospital3 to discuss the patient's care and possibly transition to a do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

The patient received a blood transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and had their International Normalized Ratio (INR) reversed with Vitamin K due to concerns about bleeding. A CT scan of the abdomen was performed to investigate the possibility of retroperitoneal bleed, but it did not show any evidence of bleeding. However, the CT scan revealed anasarca (generalized swelling) and pleural effusions (fluid accumulation in the lungs).

The patient is currently on propofol and norepinephrine infusions, as well as other ICU medications including lansoprazole and furosemide. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate between 81-89 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 98/39 to 161/71 mmHg, respiratory rate between 24-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient's fluid balance shows an overall intake of 2,956 mL and output of 1,707 mL through intravenous fluids, with a total balance of 2,161 mL. The respiratory support"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including healthcare associated
   pneumonia, chronic aspiration, afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who
   presents with hypoxia, consistent with pulmonary edema.
   # Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: CXR with increased volume and
   patient did not improve with Bipap in the ED. Now intubated with
   improved ventilation on ABG. BNP greater than assay is markedly
   consistent with CHF. Put out well in the ED. Anticoagulated, so PE
   seems less likely. Mucous plugging seems like a likely component as
   well. Already on HAP treatment, and schedule to complete course today.
   Worsening leukocytosis and fever concerning for possible resistant
   organism.
   - Continue Ventilation now and talk with family about possible
   extubation (family meeting scheduled for Tuesday)
   - Pressure support trial on 0/0
   - Continuing [**Last Name (un) 350**]/Vanco/Flagyl
 would have DC

   him on these for now
   - Repeat TTE
   # Hypotension:  pt. hypotensive with diuresis overnight, started on
   levophed overnight
   - consider CVL
   - decrease PEEP
   - attempt to wean pressor
   # Pneumonia: Initially the pt was on vanc/pip-tazo for HCAP on
   admission on [**3-11**]. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to cefepime on
   [**3-13**]. Metronidazole was added on [**3-13**] due to persistent fevers.
   - broaden as above
   - follow cultures
   - repeat sputum
   # Hypernatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be do to poor po intake, but patient total body
   overloaded. 2.5 L deficit at this time. Do not want to fluid bolus
   given CHF as above. Na 149 this AM.  FWD about 2L
   - Continue FW flushes through tube 250cc x4
   # NSTEMI: Troponin elevated but flat CK, could be consistent with
   resolving infarct on last admission. EKG with signs of demand in
   lateral leads.  Troponin still trending up
   - cycle enzymes to peak
   - asa 325 mg daily
   - high dose statin
   - Betablocker with holding parameters
   - hold ace-i in setting of acute CHF
   # Afib: Sinus tachycardia has resolved, was previously in Afib in ED.
   Pt has been on anticoagulation for afib but Hct trending down.
   - Hold Coumadin today in setting of ?bleed
   - Rate control as above
   - Repeat EKG in AM
   # Anemia: 5 point Hct drop in the setting of diuresis is concerning.
   Mild tachycardia, but patient is betablocked at baseline.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including healthcare-associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presented with hypoxia consistent with pulmonary edema and was intubated due to acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's condition improved after intubation, and the ABG showed improved ventilation. The patient also has an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, which is consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is currently on antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia and is scheduled to complete the course today. There is a concern for possible resistant organism due to worsening leukocytosis and fever.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive with diuresis overnight and started on levophed overnight. Consideration should be given to central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring, decreasing PEEP, and attempting to wean the pressor.

2. Pneumonia: The patient was initially on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for healthcare-associated pneumonia on admission. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to cefepime on [**3-13**]. Metronidazole was added on [**3-13**] due to"

   2. Hyperdense fluid within the sigmoid colon. Correlation with
   Hemoccult is
   recommended to exclude blood within the colon. Alternately, this may
   represent oral contrast. Correlation with clinical history is
   recommended.
   3. Large bilateral pleural effusions, slightly increased when compared
   to
   prior exam.
   4. Vascular calcifications.
   5. Diffuse anasarca.
   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including healthcare associated
   pneumonia, chronic aspiration, afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who
   presents with hypoxia, consistent with pulmonary edema.
   # Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: CXR with increased volume and
   patient did not improve with Bipap in the ED. Now intubated with
   improved ventilation on ABG. BNP greater than assay is markedly
   consistent with CHF. Put out well in the ED. Anticoagulated, so PE
   seems less likely. Mucous plugging seems like a likely component as
   well. Already on HAP treatment, and schedule to complete course today.
   Worsening leukocytosis and fever concerning for possible resistant
   organism.
   - Continue Ventilation now and talk with family about possible
   extubation (family meeting scheduled for Tuesday)
   - Pressure support trial on 0/0
   - Continuing [**Last Name (un) 350**]/Vanco/Flagyl
 would have DC
d today, but will keep
   him on these for now
   - Repeat TTE
   # Hypotension:  pt. intermittently hypotensive with diuresis, continues
   on levophed
   - consider CVL
   - attempt to wean pressor
   # Pneumonia: Initially the pt was on vanc/pip-tazo for HCAP on
   admission on [**3-11**]. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to cefepime on
   [**3-13**]. Metronidazole was added on [**3-13**] due to persistent fevers.
   - broaden as above
   - follow cultures
   - repeat sputum
   # Hypernatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be do to poor po intake, but patient total body
   overloaded. 2.5 L deficit at this time. Do not want to fluid bolus
   given CHF as above. Na 145 this AM.  FWD about 2L
   - Continue FW flushes through tube 250cc x4
   # NSTEMI: Troponin elevated but flat CK, could be consistent with
   resolving infarct on last admission. EKG with signs of demand in
   lateral leads.  Troponin now trending down
   - cycle enzymes to peak
   - asa 325 mg daily
   - high dose statin
   - Betablocker with holding parameters
   - hold ace-i in setting of acute CHF
   # Afib: Sinus tachycardia has resolved, was previously in Afib in ED.
   Pt has been on anticoagulation for afib but Hct trending down.
   - restart coumadin
   - Rate control as above
   - Repeat EKG this morning
   # Anemia: HCT appears stable after transfusion of 1 unit pRBCs.
   - continue PPI
   - T and S
   - Maintain 2 PIVs , PICC
   # Dm: ISS
   # Dementia: Continue mirtazapine

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems including healthcare associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presents with hypoxia consistent with pulmonary edema and acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation with improved ventilation on ABG. The patient has a history of chronic aspiration, which could contribute to his current respiratory issues.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
- Heart rate: 81 bpm (68-89)
- Blood pressure: 98/39 mmHg (53) {87/25 (41) - 161/71 (90)}
- Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute (13-27 inspiratory)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on FiO2 40% via endotracheal tube

The patient's physical examination shows bilateral inspiratory rhonchi, decreased breath sounds right base, regular rhythm with normal S1+S2, hypoactive bowel sounds, soft non-distended abdomen, and sedated mental status.

The patient's laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 11.4 x 10^9/L (10.6-11.0 x 10^9/L)
- Hematocrit:"

The patient presents with hypoxia consistent with pulmonary edema.

The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is mention of a family meeting scheduled for Tuesday to discuss the patient's goals of care. The family may consider moving towards do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

The patient received a blood transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and had his international normalized ratio (INR) reversed with Vitamin K due to anticoagulation. A CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast showed no evidence of retroperitoneal bleeding but did reveal hyperdense fluid within the sigmoid colon, large bilateral pleural effusions, vascular calcifications, and diffuse anasarca.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.4 K/uL, hypoalbuminemia with a level of 2.6 g/dL, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), and elevated troponin T levels indicating myocardial injury.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including healthcare associated
   pneumonia, chronic aspiration, afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who
   presents with hypoxia, consistent with pulmonary edema.
   # Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: CXR with increased volume and
   patient did not improve with Bipap in the ED. Now intubated with
   improved ventilation on ABG. BNP greater than assay is markedly
   consistent with CHF. Put out well in the ED. Anticoagulated, so PE
   seems less likely. Mucous plugging seems like a likely component as
   well. Worsening leukocytosis and fever concerning for possible
   resistant organism. CXR today with worsening infiltrates.
   - Continue Ventilation now and talk with family about possible
   extubation (family meeting scheduled for Tuesday)
   - Pressure support trial on 0/0
   - Continuing [**Last Name (un) 350**]/Vanco/Flagyl
   - Repeat TTE
   # Hypotension:  pt. intermittently hypotensive with diuresis, continues
   on levophed
   - consider CVL
   - attempt to wean pressor
   # Pneumonia: Initially the pt was on vanc/pip-tazo for HCAP on
   admission on [**3-11**]. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to cefepime on
   [**3-13**]. Metronidazole was added on [**3-13**] due to persistent fevers.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - follow cultures (NGTD)
   - f/u vanco trough with AM labs (pending)
   - repeat sputum
   # Hypernatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be do to poor po intake, but patient total body
   overloaded. 2.5 L deficit at this time. Do not want to fluid bolus
   given CHF as above. Na 145 this AM.  FWD about 2L
   - Continue FW flushes through tube 250cc x4
   # NSTEMI: Troponin elevated but flat CK, could be consistent with
   resolving infarct on last admission. EKG with signs of demand in
   lateral leads.  Troponin not re-checked today.
   - asa 325 mg daily
   - high dose statin
   - d/c beta blocker
   - hold ace-i in setting of acute CHF
   # Afib: Sinus tachycardia has resolved, was previously in Afib in ED.
   Pt has been on anticoagulation for afib but Hct trending down. Concern
   for RP bleed but nothing on imaging.
   - hold coumadin for now, consider restarting in the near future
   - Rate control as above
   - Repeat EKG this morning
   # Anemia: HCT appears stable after transfusion of 1 unit pRBCs.
   - continue PPI
   - T and S
   - Maintain 2 PIVs , PICC
   # Dm: ISS
   # Dementia: Continue mirtazapine
   # FEN: Gentle D5  IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including healthcare-associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular accidents.
- The patient presents with hypoxia consistent with pulmonary edema and acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. He did not improve with BiPAP in the ED and was intubated with improved ventilation on ABG. The patient's BNP is markedly elevated, consistent with congestive heart failure.
- The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which is concerning for a possible resistant organism. His chest X-ray shows worsening infiltrates.
- The patient's blood pressure has been intermittently low, and he continues to be on vasopressors. Consideration is being given to central venous pressure monitoring (CVL) and attempting to wean the pressor.
- The patient has pneumonia and is currently on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole. Antibiotics will be continued, and cultures (NGTD) will be followed. A vancomycin trough will be checked with AM labs (pending), and sputum will be repeated.
- The patient has hypernatremia due to poor PO intake and fluid overload. Sodium is 145 this morning, and fluid warming is being done.

The patient is an 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including healthcare-associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, coronary artery disease, and previous cerebrovascular accidents. He presents with respiratory distress and hypoxia consistent with pulmonary edema. The patient has been intubated and is now ventilated with improved ventilation on ABG. Blood tests show elevated levels of BNP, which is consistent with congestive heart failure. The patient is also hypotensive but now normotensive off of vasopressors for 24 hours. 

Plan for family meeting today to discuss possible extubation. Continuing ventilation and pressure support trial on 5/0. Antibiotics will be continued as above, with repeat sputum and cultures. Vancomycin will be changed to 1 gm q24 hours and Meropenem will be completed by Sunday, [**2190-3-28**]. Lasix drip will be initiated to address fluid overload. 

Other issues include hypernatremia, NSTEMI, atrial fibrillation, anemia, diabetes mellitus, dementia, and femoral hernia. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including healthcare associated
   pneumonia, chronic aspiration, afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who
   presents with hypoxia, consistent with pulmonary edema.
   # Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: CXR with increased volume and
   patient did not improve with Bipap in the ED. Now intubated with
   improved ventilation on ABG. BNP greater than assay is markedly
   consistent with CHF. Put out well in the ED. Anticoagulated, so PE
   seems less likely. Mucous plugging seems like a likely component as
   well. Worsening leukocytosis and fever concerning for possible
   resistant organism. CXR today with worsening infiltrates.
   - Continue Ventilation now and talk with family about possible
   extubation (family meeting scheduled for Tuesday)
   - Pressure support trial on 0/0
   - Continuing [**Last Name (un) 350**]/Vanco/Flagyl
   - Repeat TTE
   # Hypotension:  pt. intermittently hypotensive with diuresis, continues
   on levophed
   - consider CVL
   - attempt to wean pressor
   # Pneumonia: Initially the pt was on vanc/pip-tazo for HCAP on
   admission on [**3-11**]. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to cefepime on
   [**3-13**]. Metronidazole was added on [**3-13**] due to persistent fevers.
   - broaden as above
   - check vancomycin trough prior to PM dose
   - follow cultures
   - repeat sputum
   # Hypernatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be do to poor po intake, but patient total body
   overloaded. 2.5 L deficit at this time. Do not want to fluid bolus
   given CHF as above. Na 145 this AM.  FWD about 2L
   - Continue FW flushes through tube 250cc x4
   # NSTEMI: Troponin elevated but flat CK, could be consistent with
   resolving infarct on last admission. EKG with signs of demand in
   lateral leads.  Troponin now trending down
   - cycle enzymes to peak
   - asa 325 mg daily
   - high dose statin
   - d/c beta blocker
   - hold ace-i in setting of acute CHF
   # Afib: Sinus tachycardia has resolved, was previously in Afib in ED.
   Pt has been on anticoagulation for afib but Hct trending down. Concern
   for RP bleed but nothing on imaging.
   - hold coumadin for now, consider restarting in the near future
   - Rate control as above
   - Repeat EKG this morning
   # Anemia: HCT appears stable after transfusion of 1 unit pRBCs.
   - continue PPI
   - T and S
   - Maintain 2 PIVs , PICC
   # Dm: ISS
   # Dementia: Continue mirtazapine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems including healthcare associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presents with hypoxia consistent with pulmonary edema and acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was intubated in the emergency department and his ventilation improved with the ABG. 

The patient has a history of being anticoagulated, which makes pulmonary embolism less likely. Mucous plugging is considered as a likely component of his condition. There is worsening leukocytosis and fever, which is concerning for a possible resistant organism. The chest X-ray shows worsening infiltrates.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), blood pressure ranging from 129/69 mmHg to 142/99 mmHg, heart rate of 96 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, platelet count, troponin-T levels, lactate levels, calcium levels, and magnesium levels. The patient's sodium level is high at 145 mEq/L.

The patient has several medical conditions that need to be addressed. These include acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypot"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including healthcare associated
   pneumonia, chronic aspiration, afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who
   presents with hypoxia, consistent with pulmonary edema.
   # Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: CXR with increased volume and
   patient did not improve with Bipap in the ED. Now intubated with
   improved ventilation on ABG. BNP greater than assay is markedly
   consistent with CHF. Put out well in the ED. Anticoagulated, so PE
   seems less likely. Mucous plugging seems like a likely component as
   well. Worsening leukocytosis and fever concerning for possible
   resistant organism. CXR today with worsening infiltrates.
   - Continue Ventilation now and talk with family about possible
   extubation (family meeting scheduled for Tuesday)
   - Pressure support trial on 5/0
   - Continuing [**Last Name (un) 350**]/Vanco/Flagyl
   # Hypotension:  Pt normotensive now off of vasopressors for 24 hours.
   - continue to monitor; if becomes hypotensive will attempt gentle
   boluses followed by levophed
   # Pneumonia: Initially the pt was on vanc/pip-tazo for HCAP on
   admission on [**3-11**]. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to cefepime on
   [**3-13**]. Metronidazole was added on [**3-13**] due to persistent fevers.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - follow cultures (NGTD)
   - change vancomycin to 1gm q 24 hours
   - repeat sputum
   - will complete 8 day course of Meropenem (last dose Sunday, [**2190-3-28**])
   # Fluid Overload
  patient with total body overload.
   - check PM lytes, replete electrolytes as needed
   - Lasix drip
   # Hypernatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be do to poor po intake, but patient total body
   overloaded. 2.5 L deficit at this time. Do not want to fluid bolus
   given CHF as above. Na continues to improve this morning at 141.
   - Continue FW flushes through tube 200cc x 4
   # NSTEMI: Troponin elevated but flat CK, could be consistent with
   resolving infarct on last admission. EKG with signs of demand in
   lateral leads.  Troponin not re-checked today.
   - asa 325 mg daily
   - high dose statin
   - d/c beta blocker
   - hold ace-i in setting of acute CHF
   # Afib: Sinus tachycardia has resolved, was previously in Afib in ED.
   Pt has been on anticoagulation for afib but Hct trending down. Concern
   for RP bleed but nothing on imaging.
   - continue to hold Coumadin, but consider low dose in near future
   - Rate control as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including healthcare-associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, coronary artery disease, and previous cerebrovascular accidents. The patient presented with hypoxia and signs of pulmonary edema, and was intubated in the emergency department with improved ventilation. Blood tests indicate leukocytosis, fever, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide consistent with congestive heart failure. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has been off vasopressors for 24 hours. Antibiotics have been changed multiple times due to persistent fevers and worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient has fluid overload and hypernatremia, likely due to poor oral intake and total body overload. Troponin levels are elevated but flat, indicating a possible resolving myocardial infarction. The patient is also experiencing anemia, dementia, diabetes mellitus, and requires prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's family has been informed about his condition and a meeting is scheduled to discuss possible extubation. The patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
2. Cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
3. Renal failure due to hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including healthcare associated
   pneumonia, chronic aspiration, afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who
   presents with hypoxia, consistent with pulmonary edema.
   # Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: CXR without significant change
   without improvement on BiPAP. Now intubated with improved ventilation
   on ABG. BNP greater than assay is consistent with CHF. Put out well in
   the ED. Anticoagulated, so PE seems less likely. Mucous plugging seems
   like a likely component as well.  Worsening of leukocytosis and
   persistent fever concerning for possible resistant organism.
   - Family meeting yesterday; patient now DNR.  Will likely extubate when
   family can gather.
   - Continuing [**Last Name (un) 350**]/Vanco/Flagyl
   - Respiratory comfort while on vent, consider morphine
   # Hypotension:  Pt normotensive now off of vasopressors for 24 hours.
   - continue to monitor; if becomes hypotensive will attempt gentle
   boluses
   # Pneumonia: Initially the pt was on vanc/pip-tazo for HCAP on
   admission on [**3-11**]. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to cefepime on
   [**3-13**]. Metronidazole was added on [**3-13**] due to persistent fevers.
   - Continue antibiotics as above (last day Sunday [**3-28**])
   - follow cultures (NGTD)
   - changed vancomycin to 1gm q 24 hours, obtain trough
   - will complete 8 day course of Meropenem (last dose Sunday, [**2190-3-28**])
   # Fluid Overload
  patient with total body overload.
   - check PM lytes, replete electrolytes as needed
   - Lasix drip did not increase urine output and was discontinued.
   # Hypernatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be do to poor po intake, but patient total body
   overloaded. 2.5 L deficit at this time. Do not want to fluid bolus
   given CHF as above. Na continues to improve this morning at 141.
   - Continue FW flushes through tube 200cc x Q6h
   # NSTEMI: Troponin elevated but flat CK, could be consistent with
   resolving infarct on last admission. EKG with signs of demand in
   lateral leads.  Troponin not re-checked today.
   - asa 325 mg daily
   - high dose statin
   - d/c beta blocker
   - hold ace-i in setting of acute CHF
   # Afib: Sinus tachycardia has resolved, was previously in Afib in ED.
   Pt has been on anticoagulation for afib but Hct trending down. Concern
   for RP bleed but nothing on imaging.
   - continue to hold Coumadin, but consider low dose in near future
   - Rate control as above
   - Repeat EKG this morning
   # Anemia: HCT appears stable after transfusion of 1 unit pRBCs.
   - continue PPI
   - T and S
   - Maintain 2 PIVs , PICC
   # Dm: ISS
   # Dementia: Continue mirtazapine
   # FEN: IV boluses as needed, replete electrolytes, TF

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including healthcare-associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular accidents. The patient presented with hypoxia and signs of pulmonary edema. He was intubated due to acute hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been on various antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, including vancomycin, metronidazole, and meropenem. His fever persists, indicating a possible resistant organism. The patient's condition has improved with the intubation and ventilation.

The patient's blood pressure is stable and off vasopressors for 24 hours. Fluid overload is a concern, and the patient's sodium levels are improving after being elevated due to poor oral intake and fluid overload.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is anticoagulated, making pulmonary embolism less likely. However, mucous plugging may be contributing to his respiratory issues. The patient has an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide level, which is consistent with congestive heart failure.

Other medical issues include anemia, dementia, diabetes mellitus, and fever neutropenia. The patient is currently on various medications, including anticoagulants, antibiotics, cardiac medications, and pain relief.

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and the family has been informed. The patient will likely"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including healthcare associated
   pneumonia, chronic aspiration, afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who
   presents with hypoxia, consistent with pulmonary edema.
   # Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: CXR with increased volume and
   patient did not improve with Bipap in the ED. Now intubated with
   improved ventilation on ABG. BNP greater than assay is markedly
   consistent with CHF. Put out well in the ED. Anticoagulated, so PE
   seems less likely. Mucous plugging seems like a likely component as
   well. Initial worsening of leukocytosis and fever concerning for
   possible resistant organism.
   - Family meeting yesterday; patient now DNR.  Will likely extubate when
   family can gather.
   - Pressure support trial on 5/0
   - Continuing [**Last Name (un) 350**]/Vanco/Flagyl
   # Hypotension:  Pt normotensive now off of vasopressors for 24 hours.
   - continue to monitor; if becomes hypotensive will attempt gentle
   boluses followed by levophed
   # Pneumonia: Initially the pt was on vanc/pip-tazo for HCAP on
   admission on [**3-11**]. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to cefepime on
   [**3-13**]. Metronidazole was added on [**3-13**] due to persistent fevers.
   - Continue antibiotics as above (last day Sunday [**3-28**])
   - follow cultures (NGTD)
   - changed vancomycin to 1gm q 24 hours, obtain trough
   - will complete 8 day course of Meropenem (last dose Sunday, [**2190-3-28**])
   # Fluid Overload
  patient with total body overload.
   - check PM lytes, replete electrolytes as needed
   - Lasix drip did not increase urine output and was discontinued.
   # Hypernatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be do to poor po intake, but patient total body
   overloaded. 2.5 L deficit at this time. Do not want to fluid bolus
   given CHF as above. Na continues to improve this morning at 141.
   - Continue FW flushes through tube 200cc x Q6h
   # NSTEMI: Troponin elevated but flat CK, could be consistent with
   resolving infarct on last admission. EKG with signs of demand in
   lateral leads.  Troponin not re-checked today.
   - asa 325 mg daily
   - high dose statin
   - d/c beta blocker
   - hold ace-i in setting of acute CHF
   # Afib: Sinus tachycardia has resolved, was previously in Afib in ED.
   Pt has been on anticoagulation for afib but Hct trending down. Concern
   for RP bleed but nothing on imaging.
   - continue to hold Coumadin, but consider low dose in near future
   - Rate control as above
   - Repeat EKG this morning
   # Anemia: HCT appears stable after transfusion of 1 unit pRBCs.
   - continue PPI
   - T and S
   - Maintain 2 PIVs , PICC

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems including healthcare-associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presents with hypoxia and pulmonary edema, which is consistent with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated due to worsening respiratory failure and is now ventilated appropriately.

The patient's initial worsening of leukocytosis and fever was concerning for a possible resistant organism. The patient has been on antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, metronidazole, and meropenem. The antibiotics have been adjusted based on culture results.

The patient has been hypotensive but is now normotensive off vasopressors for 24 hours. Fluid overload is present, and the patient has hypernatremia due to poor oral intake and total body overload. The patient's sodium level continues to improve.

The patient had an elevated troponin level, suggesting a possible non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). However, the CK level was flat, indicating a resolving infarct from the patient's previous admission. The EKG showed signs of demand in lateral leads, and the troponin was not rechecked today.

The patient had atrial fibr"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including healthcare associated
   pneumonia, chronic aspiration, afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who
   presents with hypoxia, consistent with pulmonary edema.
   # Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: CXR without significant change
   without improvement on BiPAP. Now intubated with improved ventilation
   on ABG. BNP greater than assay is consistent with CHF. Put out well in
   the ED. Anticoagulated, so PE seems less likely. Mucous plugging seems
   like a likely component as well.  Worsening of leukocytosis and
   persistent fever concerning for possible resistant organism.
   - Family meeting [**2190-3-23**]; patient now DNR.  Will likely extubate when
   family can gather.
   - Continuing [**Last Name (un) 350**]/Vanco/Flagyl
   - Respiratory comfort while on vent, on morphine drip for comfort
   # Hypotension:  Pt normotensive now off of vasopressors for 24 hours.
   - continue to monitor; if becomes hypotensive will attempt gentle
   boluses
   # Pneumonia: Initially the pt was on vanc/pip-tazo for HCAP on
   admission on [**3-11**]. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to cefepime on
   [**3-13**]. Metronidazole was added on [**3-13**] due to persistent fevers.
   - Continue antibiotics as above (last day Sunday [**3-28**])
   - follow cultures (NGTD)
   - changed vancomycin to 1gm q 24 hours, obtain trough
   - will complete 8 day course of Meropenem (last dose Sunday, [**2190-3-28**])
   # Fluid Overload
  patient with total body overload.
   - check PM lytes, replete electrolytes as needed
   - Lasix drip did not increase urine output and was discontinued.
   # Hypernatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be do to poor po intake, but patient total body
   overloaded. Na continues to improve this morning at 144.
   - Continue FW flushes through tube 200cc x Q6h
   # NSTEMI: Troponin elevated but flat CK, could be consistent with
   resolving infarct on last admission. EKG with signs of demand in
   lateral leads.  Troponin not re-checked today.
   - asa 325 mg daily
   - high dose statin
   - d/c beta blocker
   - hold ace-i in setting of acute CHF
   # Afib: Sinus tachycardia has resolved, was previously in Afib in ED.
   Pt has been on anticoagulation for afib but Hct trending down. Concern
   for RP bleed but nothing on imaging.
   - continue to hold Coumadin, but consider low dose in near future
   - Rate control as above
   - Repeat EKG this morning
   # Anemia: HCT appears stable after transfusion of 1 unit pRBCs.
   - continue PPI

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems including healthcare-associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cardiovascular accidents (CVAs), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presents with hypoxia consistent with pulmonary edema and acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was initially intubated due to worsening of leukocytosis and persistent fever, which is concerning for a possible resistant organism.

The patient's current conditions include hypotension, pneumonia, fluid overload, hypernatremia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation (afib), anemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), dementia, and femoral neck fracture (FEN). The patient has been put on do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status and is currently in the ICU pending clinical improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further deterioration of renal function. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, daily weight, and fluid balance is crucial to prevent fluid overload and hypotension. Antibiotics should be continued to treat the suspected resistant organism, and daily reassessment of the patient's clinical status is necessary.

Given the patient's history of CAD, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as myocardial infarction"

","Summary:
The patient is an 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems including healthcare-associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents, and coronary artery disease. He presents with hypoxia and pulmonary edema. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with improved ventilation. He has a history of acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, worsening leukocytosis, persistent fever, and mucous plugging. The patient is DNR and will likely be extubated when family can gather. He is being treated with multiple antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia and resistant organisms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition is critical, and there is a risk of further respiratory failure due to pneumonia and chronic aspiration.
2. Infection: The patient has persistent fever and worsening leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing infection. There is a concern for a resistant organism.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has total body overload, and there is a risk of worsening fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia due to poor oral intake and total body overload. There is a risk of ongoing sodium imbalance.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and elevated troponin levels, suggesting a possible NSTEMI. There is a risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including healthcare associated
   pneumonia, chronic aspiration, afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who
   presents with hypoxia, consistent with pulmonary edema.  Plan to wait
   for family
s arrival today and take patient off of ventilator, transfer
   to [**Hospital1 **] for supportive care.
   # Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: Initial CXR without
   significant change or improvement on BiPAP. Now intubated with improved
   ventilation on ABG. BNP greater than assay is consistent with CHF. Put
   out well in the ED. Anticoagulated, so PE seems less likely. Mucous
   plugging seems like a likely component as well.  Worsening of
   leukocytosis and persistent fever concerning for possible resistant
   organism.  Per respiratory therapy notes, patient has increased amount
   and viscosity of secretions.
   - Family meeting [**2190-3-23**]; patient now DNR.  Will likely extubate today
   if family can gather.
   - Continuing [**Last Name (un) 350**]/Vanco/Flagyl for HAP
   - Respiratory comfort while on vent, on morphine drip for comfort
   - Suction PRN
   - Will not check daily CXR
   # Hypotension:  Pt normotensive now off of vasopressors for 24 hours.
   - continue to monitor; if becomes hypotensive will attempt gentle
   boluses
   # Pneumonia: Initially the pt was on vanc/pip-tazo for HCAP on
   admission on [**3-11**]. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to cefepime on
   [**3-13**]. Metronidazole was added on [**3-13**] due to persistent fevers.
   - Continue antibiotics as above (last day Sunday [**3-28**])
   - follow cultures (NGTD)
   - changed vancomycin to 1gm q 24 hours, obtain trough
   - will complete 8 day course of Meropenem (last dose Sunday, [**2190-3-28**])
   # Fluid Overload
  patient with total body overload.  Lasix drip did
   not increase urine output and was discontinued.
   - Will bolus gently if needed
   # Hypernatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be do to poor po intake, but patient total body
   overloaded. No longer checking labs.
   - Continue FW flushes through tube 200cc x Q6h
   # NSTEMI: Troponin elevated but flat CK, could be consistent with
   resolving infarct on last admission. EKG with signs of demand in
   lateral leads.  Troponin not re-checked today, no longer checking labs.
   - asa 325 mg daily
   - high dose statin
   - d/c beta blocker
   - hold ace-i in setting of acute CHF
   # Afib: Was previously in Afib in ED. Pt has been on anticoagulation
   for afib but Hct trending down. Concern for RP bleed but nothing on
   imaging. In sinus tach at this time.
   - No anticoagulation at this time
   # Anemia: HCT appears stable after transfusion of 1 unit pRBCs. No
   longer checking daily labs.
   - continue PPI
   - T and S
   - Maintain 2 PIVs , PICC
   # Dm: ISS
   # Dementia: Continue mirtazapine
   # FEN: IV boluses as needed, replete electrolytes, TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI, will stop subQ heparin

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o M with multiple medical problems including healthcare associated
   pneumonia, chronic aspiration, afib on coumadin, CVAs, and CAD who
   presents with hypoxia, consistent with pulmonary edema.  Plan to wait
   for family
s arrival today and take patient off of ventilator, transfer
   to [**Hospital1 **] for supportive care.
   # Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: Initial CXR without
   significant change or improvement on BiPAP. Now intubated with improved
   ventilation on ABG. BNP greater than assay is consistent with CHF. Put
   out well in the ED. Anticoagulated, so PE seems less likely. Mucous
   plugging seems like a likely component as well.  Worsening of
   leukocytosis and persistent fever concerning for possible resistant
   organism.  Per respiratory therapy notes, patient has increased amount
   and viscosity of secretions.
   - Family meeting [**2190-3-23**]; patient now DNR.  Will likely extubate today
   if family can gather.
   - Continuing [**Last Name (un) 350**]/Vanco/Flagyl for HAP
   - Respiratory comfort while on vent, on morphine drip for comfort
   - Suction PRN
   - Will not check daily CXR
   # Hypotension:  Pt normotensive now off of vasopressors for 24 hours.
   - continue to monitor; if becomes hypotensive will attempt gentle
   boluses
   # Pneumonia: Initially the pt was on vanc/pip-tazo for HCAP on
   admission on [**3-11**]. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to cefepime on
   [**3-13**]. Metronidazole was added on [**3-13**] due to persistent fevers.
   - Continue antibiotics as above (last day Sunday [**3-28**])
   - follow cultures (NGTD)
   - changed vancomycin to 1gm q 24 hours, obtain trough
   - will complete 8 day course of Meropenem (last dose Sunday, [**2190-3-28**])
   # Fluid Overload
  patient with total body overload.  Lasix drip did
   not increase urine output and was discontinued.
   - Will bolus gently if needed
   # Hypernatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be do to poor po intake, but patient total body
   overloaded. No longer checking labs.
   - Continue FW flushes through tube 200cc x Q6h
   # NSTEMI: Troponin elevated but flat CK, could be consistent with
   resolving infarct on last admission. EKG with signs of demand in
   lateral leads.  Troponin not re-checked today, no longer checking labs.
   - asa 325 mg daily
   - high dose statin
   - d/c beta blocker
   - hold ace-i in setting of acute CHF
   # Afib: Was previously in Afib in ED. Pt has been on anticoagulation
   for afib but Hct trending down. Concern for RP bleed but nothing on
   imaging. In sinus tach at this time.
   - No anticoagulation at this time
   # Anemia: HCT appears stable after transfusion of 1 unit pRBCs. No
   longer checking daily labs.
   - continue PPI
   - T and S
   - Maintain 2 PIVs , PICC
   # Dm: ISS
   # Dementia: Continue mirtazapine
   # FEN: IV boluses as needed, replete electrolytes, TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI, will stop subQ heparin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems including healthcare-associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presents with hypoxia consistent with pulmonary edema. The plan is to wait for the family's arrival today and take the patient off the ventilator, transferring him to Hospital1 for supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient initially had significant changes on BiPAP but did not improve, leading to intubation and improved ventilation on ABG. This condition is concerning for possible resistant organism, worsening leukocytosis, and persistent fever.
2. Hypotension: The patient was previously hypotensive but is now normotensive off of vasopressors for 24 hours. Close monitoring is required, and gentle boluses will be attempted if hypotension occurs again.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has been on various antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole.

   # Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: Initial CXR without
   significant change or improvement on BiPAP. Now intubated with improved
   ventilation on ABG. BNP greater than assay is consistent with CHF. Put
   out well in the ED. Anticoagulated, so PE seems less likely. Mucous
   plugging seems like a likely component as well.  Worsening of
   leukocytosis and persistent fever concerning for possible resistant
   organism.  Per respiratory therapy notes, patient has increased amount
   and viscosity of secretions.
   - Family meeting [**2190-3-26**]; patient now CMO.  Patient was extubated and
   has been maintaining his airway with no evidence of respiratory
   distress.
   - discontinue [**Last Name (un) 350**]/Vanco/Flagyl for HAP

   - CMO, pressures SBP 90s
   # Pneumonia: Initially the pt was on vanc/pip-tazo for HCAP on
   admission on [**3-11**]. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to cefepime on
   [**3-13**]. Metronidazole was added on [**3-13**] due to persistent fevers.
   - Discontinue antibiotics as above
   # Fluid Overload
  patient with total body overload.  Lasix drip did
   not increase urine output and was discontinued.
   # Hypernatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be do to poor po intake, but patient total body
   overloaded. No longer checking labs.
   - CMO
   # NSTEMI: Troponin elevated but flat CK, could be consistent with
   resolving infarct on last admission. EKG with signs of demand in

   Code status: DNR / DNI
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems including healthcare-associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents, and coronary artery disease. The patient presented with hypoxia consistent with pulmonary edema and was initially placed on BiPAP, which did not show significant improvement. The patient was then intubated and put on mechanical ventilation with improved ventilation. Blood tests revealed elevated BNP levels, indicating congestive heart failure (CHF), and leukocytosis with persistent fever, suggesting a possible resistant organism.

The patient's condition improved with extubation, and the family decided to pursue comfort measures only (CMO). Antibiotics were discontinued due to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), and the patient is now on morphine for comfort and suctioning as needed. The patient's blood pressure has stabilized without the need for vasopressors.

The patient's other medical issues include fluid overload, hypernatremia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation, anemia, dementia, and familial educational needs. These conditions were managed accordingly, with some treatments being discontinued based on the CMO decision.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the disposition plan is likely to return to Hospital3 today."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 78-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including healthcare-associated pneumonia, chronic aspiration, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presents with hypoxia consistent with pulmonary edema. The overall plan is to return to Hospital3 today after the patient was made comfort measures only (CMO) yesterday following a family meeting.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient initially had difficulty breathing and was intubated due to worsening hypercarbia. However, the patient has now been extubated and is maintaining his airway without evidence of respiratory distress.

2. Pneumonia: The patient was initially on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), but the antibiotics were changed to cefepime on 3/13 due to persistent fevers. Discontinuation of antibiotics is planned.

3. Fluid overload: The patient has a total body overload and Lasix drip did not increase urine output. Fluid overload is a concern, especially since the patient is comfort measures only.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient had elevated sodium levels due to poor oral intake and total body overload. However, no longer checking labs is mentioned.

5. NSTEMI: Troponin levels were elevated,"
