   Assessment and Plan
   43yo male patient of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] with severe dilated nonischemic
   cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, LVEF 15%, massively dilated LV, morbid
   obesity with weight in excess of 415 lbs., s/p BiV/ICD with LBBB, OSA
   who was directly admitted to CCU for decompensated systolic CHF
   requiring IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: EF 15% during last ECHO in
   [**3-25**] thought to be nonischemic cardiac myopathy, baseline weight 400
   currently with subacute increase in weight with large amount of
   ascites. Lasix and Milrinone started last night with excellent diuresis
   overnight. Neosynephrine only reguired during the milrinone bolus.
   - Continue Milrinone gtt at 0.375mcg/kg/min infusion watching for
   hypotension, have neosynephrine at bedside to start if MAP <60.
   - IV lasix gtt starting at 20mg/hr for diuresis
   - continue spironolactone at 25 daily
   - continue metoprolol at 100mg PO BID, titrate up to TID prn
   - hold lisinopril at this time
   - foley placement
   .
   # RHYTHM: with biV/ICD. Frequent runs of non
 sustained VTach
   overnight. During last device clinic interrogation on [**7-23**], pt found w
   occasional episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia successfully
   treated by the device by antitachycardia pacing. Has been unable to
   tolerate the amiodarone and has been off it for the past three months
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue metoprolol as above and uptitrate as needed for arrythmias
   in setting of milrinone
   - consider amio bolus and gtt in case of sustained VT
   .
   # Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine stable at 1.5 this
   morning. Will continue to follow creatinine.
   - Hold lisinopril at this time
   .
   # CORONARIES: Troponin 0.2 overnight. No ECG changes or complaints.
   Most likely secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy in setting of decreased
   renal function. no known CAD, no cath in past
   - Continue to trend cardiac enzymes, follow ECG
   - continue ASA

","The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, massively dilated left ventricle, morbid obesity with a weight exceeding 415 lbs, and a history of bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was directly admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic CHF requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 79 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 103/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on room air, and a heart rhythm of ventricular-paced. The patient has 3+ lower extremity edema to the level of the knee and stasis dermatitis in bilateral lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, while other values such as creatinine, glucose, troponin-T, and potassium are within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
   43yo male patient of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] with severe dilated nonischemic
   cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, LVEF 15%, massively dilated LV, morbid
   obesity with weight in excess of 415 lbs., s/p BiV/ICD with LBBB, OSA
   who was directly admitted to CCU for decompensated systolic CHF
   requiring IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: EF 15% during last ECHO in
   [**3-25**] thought to be nonischemic cardiac myopathy, baseline weight 400
   currently with subacute increase in weight with large amount of
   ascites. Lasix and Milrinone started last night with excellent diuresis
   overnight. Neosynephrine only reguired during the milrinone bolus.
   - Continue Milrinone gtt (switched to 0.5mcg/kg/min from 0.375) this
   morning, watching for hypotension, have neosynephrine at bedside to
   start if MAP <60.  Will likely start again this morning in order to
   support BP.
   - IV lasix gtt starting at 20mg/hr for diuresis
   - continue spironolactone at 25 daily
   - will increase metoprolol from 100mg PO BID to TID to prevent
   arrhthmias
   - hold lisinopril at this time
   - foley placement
   - I/O goal negative 1.5-2L, if lower than goal, will increase Lasix gtt
   diuresis (can increase up to 50mg/hr)
   - F/u electrolytes today 2pm and I/O check in pm today
   .
   # RHYTHM: with biV/ICD. Frequent runs of non
 sustained VTach
   overnight. During last device clinic interrogation on [**7-23**], pt found w
   occasional episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia successfully
   treated by the device by antitachycardia pacing. Has been unable to
   tolerate the amiodarone (GI symptoms) and has been off it for the past
   three months.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - increase metoprolol as above for arrythmias in setting of milrinone
   (will increase beta blocker to 100mg TID dosing)
   - consider amio bolus and gtt in case of sustained VT
   .
   # Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine stable at 1.5 this
   morning. Will continue to follow creatinine.
   - Hold lisinopril at this time
   .
   # CORONARIES: Troponin 0.2 overnight. No ECG changes or complaints.
   Most likely secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy in setting of decreased
   renal function. no known CAD, no cath in past
   - continue to trend cardiac enzymes, follow ECG
   - continue ASA

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic heart failure, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. He is obese and has a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OSA). The patient underwent biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement with left bundle branch block (LBBB). He presented to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic heart failure requiring intravenous milrinone and Lasix for diuresis.

24-hour events:
- Right internal jugular (RIJ) vein catheterization was successfully placed.
- Milrinone bolus and gtt started around 11:30 pm, with adjunctive neosynephrine for blood pressure support. The medication was stopped relatively soon as blood pressure responded.
- Good urine output.
- Multiple episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VTach) occurred, with some runs of VTach being longer.
- No new chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, or dizziness were reported overnight.

1. Pump/Decompensated Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's severely reduced LVEF indicates a compromised pumping ability of the heart. This can lead to further decompensation and worsening of heart failure symptoms.
2. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has a history of occasional episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia successfully treated by his biV/ICD device. Frequent non-sustained episodes of VT are also noted. Continuous monitoring on telemetry is advised.
3. Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest renal dysfunction. Secondary to poor cardiac output, the kidneys may not be receiving adequate perfusion leading to renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.
4. Gout: Although there are no recent flairs, the patient has a history of gout. Monitoring for signs of acute gouty arthritis is important, especially with ongoing diuresis.
5. Obesity: The patient's morbid obesity contributes to his overall cardiovascular risk profile. Weight management and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%, morbid obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea. He was admitted to the CCU for decompensated systolic heart failure requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: The patient's low ejection fraction and symptoms of heart failure indicate a risk for continued decompensation and potential cardiac arrest.
2. RHYTHM: The patient has a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia episodes, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
3. ACUTE VS CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest renal dysfunction, possibly secondary to poor cardiac output. This poses a risk for further renal deterioration.
4. CORONARIES: Although the patient has no known coronary artery disease, the decompensated heart failure may still be caused by ischemia. Monitoring cardiac enzymes and ECGs will be important to rule out ischemia as an etiology.
5. GOUT: The patient has a history of gout, and the use of diuretics may increase the risk of gout flares.
6. OSA: The patient's obstructive sleep apnea may worsen"

","The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, morbid obesity, and a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic CHF requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 78 bpm with a paced rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 97/56 mmHg to 128/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. The patient's weight is currently 184.2 kg, and his height is 72 inches.

The patient has been experiencing non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and requires a low dose of vasopressor support with phenylephrine. He reports some left knee pain that developed over the last day, described as anterior knee pain that increases with bending. The patient also states that his shortness of breath at night has improved. He denies chest pain and dizziness and occasionally feels episodes of ventricular tachycardia.

The physical examination reveals an impressive abdominal distention due to morbid obesity, no tenderness, and bowel sounds present"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, morbid obesity, and a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic CHF requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis. 

The patient has been experiencing numerous episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) despite having a biventricular (BiV)/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB). His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. He has a history of gout, but no recent flairs.

The patient's weight is currently 177 kg, and he has been losing weight since admission. His blood pressure is consistently low, requiring vasopressor support with phenylephrine. His oxygen saturation is below normal, and he requires supplemental oxygen. His respiratory rate is within normal limits.

Physical examination findings include general obesity, no jugular venous distension (JVD), regular rhythm with possible S4 heart sound, no murmurs or gallops, and no chest wall deformities. He has impressive abdominal distention, 3+ lower extremity"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, morbid obesity, and a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic CHF requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis.

The patient has been diuresing well, with output of approximately 7 liters per day. His electrolytes are relatively stable, with sodium at 130 (from 129), potassium at 3.6, and creatinine at 1.7 (from 1.6). He has been given a total of 60 milliequivalents of potassium with dinner and has been written for 20 milliequivalents daily.

The patient continues to experience numerous episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), with the longest run being 18 beats. He is on a ventricular pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB).

His weight is currently 177 kilograms, and he has impressive abdominal distention due to morbid obesity. He has 3+ lower extremity edema up to the level of the knee bilaterally, with mild tend"

   [**3-25**] thought to be nonischemic cardiac myopathy, baseline weight 400
   currently with subacute increase in weight with large amount of
   ascites. Patient continues with diuresis at approx. 6-7 L daily, goal
   will be to maximize diuresis.
   - Continue Milrinone 0.5mcg/kg/min infusion and neosynephrine 0.5
   mcg/kg/min infusion; will tolerate MAP > 55.  Will try to wean him off
   neosynephrine as BP tolerates.
   - Increase IV lasix gtt to 25 mg/hr
   - Continue Metolazone 5mg PO BID
   - continue spironolactone at 25 daily
   - continue metoprolol at 100mg PO TID
   - hold lisinopril at this time

   # RHYTHM: with biV/ICD. During last device clinic interrogation on [**7-23**],
   pt found w occasional episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia
   successfully treated by the device either by shock or by
   antitachycardia pacing. Continues with freguent non sustained episodes
   of VT.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Metoprolol 100mg PO TID
   - Amio bolus and gtt in case of sustained VT

   Disposition: CCU for approx. One week for diuresis
","The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%. He has massively dilated left ventricle, morbid obesity, and was admitted to the CCU for decompensated systolic heart failure requiring IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: The patient's low ejection fraction and massively dilated left ventricle put him at risk for further decompensation of his systolic heart failure. This can lead to worsening symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid accumulation, and decreased cardiac output.

2. RHYTHM DISTURBANCES: The patient has a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia episodes, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated. Monitoring on telemetry and appropriate antiarrhythmic medication should be continued to manage this risk.

3. ACUTE VS CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: The patient's poor cardiac output may lead to secondary renal failure. Close monitoring of creatinine levels and appropriate management will be necessary to prevent or minimize renal dysfunction.

4. CORONARIES: Although there is no known coronary artery disease (CAD), the patient's cardiomyopathy increases his risk for CAD. Regular monitoring and appropriate management of"

He has been experiencing a subacute increase in weight and has a large amount of ascites. The patient continues with diuresis at approximately 6-7 liters daily, with the goal of maximizing diuresis.

In terms of treatment, the patient is receiving milrinone and neosynephrine infusions to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55. The goal is to wean him off neosynephrine as his blood pressure tolerates. The patient's IV lasix rate has been increased to 25 mg/hr, and he is also taking metolazone 5mg PO BID, spironolactone 25 daily, and metoprolol 100mg PO TID. Lisinopril has been held at this time.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. He also has morbid obesity and has undergone biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement with left bundle branch block (LBBB), as well as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

The patient's current condition includes decompensated systolic CHF requiring intravenous (IV) milrinone and lasix for diuresis. His estimated fluid overload is -7629 mL, and he is receiving IV lasix at 30 mg/hr. The goal is to maximize diuresis and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 mmHg. He is also on metolazone 5 mg orally twice a day (BID), spironolactone 50 mg daily, and metoprolol 100 mg orally three times a day (TID).

The patient's rhythm is monitored on telemetry due to frequent non-sustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT). He is on metoprolol 100 mg orally TID, and an amiodarone bolus and gtt are available in case of sustained VT.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1"

","The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. He has been admitted to the CCU for decompensated systolic CHF and requires IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's severe dilated cardiomyopathy and low LVEF indicate a high risk for worsening heart failure. This can lead to further fluid accumulation, pulmonary edema, and respiratory distress.

2. Arrhythmias: The patient's biV/ICD is implanted for rhythm control, but he continues to experience frequent non-sustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT). There is a risk of progression to sustained VT or other arrhythmias, which could compromise cardiac output.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has elevated serum creatinine levels on admission and today, indicating renal impairment. Poor cardiac output secondary to heart failure can lead to decreased renal perfusion and contribute to AKI.

4. Gout flare: The patient has a current flare of gout in his left foot. Aggressive diuresis with lasix may exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gouty attacks. Appropriate management of gout is essential.

5. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: Although"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. He has morbid obesity, with a current weight exceeding 415 lbs. The patient underwent biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was directly admitted to the cardiac critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic CHF requiring intravenous (IV) milrinone and lasix for diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pump/Decompensated Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's severely reduced LVEF and massive dilation of the left ventricle put him at risk for ongoing pump dysfunction and decompensated heart failure. Diuretics and vasopressors are being used to manage fluid balance and blood pressure.
2. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has a history of episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia successfully treated by his ICD. He continues to experience frequent nonsustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia, and monitoring on telemetry is ongoing. Antiarrhythmic medications are being used for rhythm control.
3. Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. He has morbid obesity and is experiencing massively dilated left ventricle, bilateral lower extremity edema, and difficulty in assessing jugular venous pressure due to his body habitus. The patient has been admitted to the CCU for decompensated systolic CHF and requires intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis. He also has a history of gout flare in his left foot and acute renal failure secondary to poor cardiac output. The patient is on a bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's severely reduced LVEF and symptoms of decompensated systolic CHF indicate a high risk for cardiogenic shock, which can be life-threatening. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and timely administration of appropriate interventions are crucial.
2. Ventricular Arrhythmias: The patient's frequent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and the presence of LBBB increase the risk of potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, morbid obesity, and a history of bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic heart failure requiring intravenous (IV) milrinone and lasix for diuresis.

The patient's current condition includes ongoing diuresis at approximately 6-7 liters daily, with the goal to maximize diuresis. The patient is also on several medications including milrinone, neosynephrine, IV lasix, metolazone, spironolactone, and metoprolol. Lisinopril is currently held due to acute versus chronic renal failure secondary to poor cardiac output. The patient's rhythm is monitored on telemetry, and he receives a bolus and continuous infusion of amiodarone in case of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT).

The patient's kidney function is being monitored, with creatinine levels ranging from 1.5 to 1.7 on admission. There are no known coronary artery disease (CAD) issues, and the patient is not on bisoprolol or beta-blockers at home"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, morbid obesity, and a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted to the CCU for decompensated systolic CHF and required intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis. The patient has been diuresed with 40 liters of fluid, with ongoing diuresis at approximately 6-7 liters daily. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pump/Decompensated Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and low LVEF indicate poor cardiac function. Continued diuresis is necessary to manage fluid overload, and the patient's blood pressure should be monitored closely. The goal is to maximize diuresis while maintaining adequate tissue perfusion.

2. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has a history of biV/ICD (biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) with frequent non-sustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT). Close monitoring on telemetry is essential, and medications such as metoprolol and amiodarone may be required to manage rhythm disturbances.

3. Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased"

The patient was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic CHF requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis.

The patient's current condition includes ongoing diuresis at approximately 6-7 liters daily, with a goal to maximize diuresis. He is receiving milrinone and neosynephrine infusions to support blood pressure, aiming for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 55. The patient is also on IV lasix, metolazone, spironolactone, and metoprolol, while lisinopril has been held due to acute renal failure.

The patient continues to experience frequent non-sustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT), for which he is monitored on telemetry. Amiodarone has been prepared in case of sustained VT. The patient's renal function has been deteriorating, with an increase in creatinine levels from 1.5 to 1.7 today, likely secondary to poor"

   fired and patient lifted back to bed.  Electrolytes at the time stable
   from the morning.
   - Milrinone changed to 0.375mcg/kg/min (as needs to be dose adjusted
   for new lower weight) - likely milrinone precipitated VT event? - will
   watch for afterload increase after decreasing dose of milrinone and
   will wean phenylephrine as needed
   - Patient actually had low bp's after milrinone decreased, increased
   neosynephrine slightly
   - Talked to pharm re: SC heparin dose in obese patients.  Stated that
   they don't typically adjust dose based on body weight but they ""have
   seen 7500units TID used before"" and if we want to switch to that, we
   can.  Left it at 5000units TID.

   ECHO ([**8-5**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated
   with severer global hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
   left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, jet of moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior
   study (images reviewed) of [**2199-3-19**], left ventricular cavity size is
   minimally smaller and systolic function is minimally improved. Right
   ventricular free wall hypokinesis appears more global, but of similar
   magnitude.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: CCU for now
","The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%, massively dilated left ventricle, morbid obesity with a weight in excess of 415 lbs, and a history of biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB). He was admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic heart failure requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/54 mmHg to 122/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and a heart rhythm of ventricular paced. The patient has 3+ lower extremity edema to the level of the knee bilaterally, improved from previous, mild tenderness on palpation of the patellar tendon, stasis dermatitis in bilateral lower extremities, and no other ulcers or skin breakdown appreciated on exam.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 6.9-8.4 thousand/mm3, hematocrit of 41.5-43.2%, platelet count of 31-200,000/mm3, creatinine of 1.6-1.9 mg/dL, glucose of 100-121 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.04 ng/mL, and an ejection fraction of 15%.

An echocardiogram reveals a markedly dilated left atrium, normal left ventricular wall thicknesses, severely dilated left ventricular cavity with severe global hypokinesis, no masses or thrombi in the left ventricle, increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg), moderately dilated right ventricular cavity with moderate global free wall hypokinesis, structurally normal aortic valve leaflets with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation, mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets, moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and no pericardial effusion. The echocardiogram also shows that compared with the prior study, the left ventricular cavity size is minimally smaller and systolic function is minimally improved.

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing with milrinone infusion at 0.375 mcg/kg/min and neosynephrine infusion at 0.6 mcg/kg/min, tolerating mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 55, trying to wean him off neosynephrine as blood pressure tolerates, continuing IV lasix at 30 mg/hr, continuing metol"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events: Pt notes no chest pain, shortness of breath. Only notes
   left gouty toe and left knee tendonitis. Pt very concerned by events
   and would like to discuss goals of treatment.
   -Two episodes of VT @220.  First, at 1330 ([**8-5**]) patient collapsed to
   floor, ICD fired. Milrinone reduced to .375 mcg/kg/min. Second, at 0400
   ([**8-6**]) patient felt palpitations/rapid heart beat and then passed out
   device fired. Milrinone turned off. After both events patient returned
   to vpaced rhythm. Electrolytes at the time stable from the morning.
   - Patient actually had low bp's after milrinone decreased, increased
   neosynephrine slightly
   - Talked to pharm re: SC heparin dose in obese patients.  Stated that
   they don't typically adjust dose based on body weight but they ""have
   seen 7500units TID used before"" and if we want to switch to that, we
   can.  Left it at 5000units TID.

   Episodes of VT due to potassium depletion and milrinone therapy.
   Potassium is being aggressively repleted and we have stopped the
   milrinone.  He is now 50 liters negative and appears to be approaching
   the limiot of volume removal.  Will reduce diuretic regimen once
   creatinine rises significantly above 2.0

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, massively dilated left ventricle, morbid obesity, and a history of bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic CHF requiring intravenous milrinone and Lasix for diuresis.

The patient has experienced two episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) at a rate of 220 beats per minute, resulting in ICD firing twice. After each episode, the patient's rhythm returned to a paced rhythm. The patient continues to have frequent non-sustained episodes of VT. The ICD is appropriately activated due to the presence of a clear trigger for sustained VT, which is low potassium levels and the use of milrinone.

The patient's blood pressure has been low, and neosynephrine has been started at 0.6 mcg/kg/min infusion, aiming to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 mmHg. The plan is to wean off neosynephrine as the patient's blood pressure tolerates.

The patient is on diuretics, including IV Lasix at 30 mg/hr, Metolazone 5 mg orally twice a day, Spironolactone 50 mg orally daily, and Metoprolol 100 mg orally three times a day. Lisinopril has been held due to acute renal failure secondary to poor cardiac output.

The patient's potassium levels need to be repleted aggressively due to episodes of VT caused by potassium depletion and milrinone therapy. Acetazolamide has been started to promote diuresis.

The patient's renal function is worsening, with a creatinine level on admission of 1.5 mg/dL and now up to 1.9 mg/dL. The plan is to continue holding lisinopril and monitor the creatinine levels.

The patient has a history of gout and is currently experiencing a flare in the left big toe. Colchicine has been continued, and loperamide has been started for diarrhea related to colchicine.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 82 beats per minute with marked ectopy, blood pressure of 93/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight has decreased from 189.9 kg to 148.6 kg, indicating significant weight loss.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose levels"

   ECHO ([**8-5**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated
   with severer global hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
   left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, jet of moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior
   study (images reviewed) of [**2199-3-19**], left ventricular cavity size is
   minimally smaller and systolic function is minimally improved. Right
   ventricular free wall hypokinesis appears more global, but of similar
   magnitude.

   ECHO ([**8-5**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated
   with severer global hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
   left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, jet of moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior
   study (images reviewed) of [**2199-3-19**], left ventricular cavity size is
   minimally smaller and systolic function is minimally improved. Right
   ventricular free wall hypokinesis appears more global, but of similar
   magnitude.

   Disposition: CCU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, massively dilated left ventricle, morbid obesity, and a history of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient was admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic CHF requiring intravenous milrinone and Lasix for diuresis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: The patient continues to require diuresis with approximately 6-7 liters daily. The goal is to maximize diuresis and potentially restart milrinone with amiodarone. The patient's blood pressure needs to be maintained above 55 mmHg, and there is an attempt to wean off neosynephrine as the blood pressure tolerates.

2. RHYTHM: The patient has experienced two episodes of fast ventricular tachycardia (VT) with an ICD firing twice. The patient is currently paced with a ventricular rhythm and continues to have frequent non-sustained episodes of VT. Metoprolol is being administered to control the heart rate"

   and would like to discuss goals of treatment.
   -Two episodes of VT @220.  First, at 1330 ([**8-5**]) patient collapsed to
   floor, ICD fired. Milrinone reduced to .375 mcg/kg/min. Second, at 0400
   ([**8-6**]) patient felt palpitations/rapid heart beat and then passed out
   device fired. Milrinone turned off. After both events patient returned
   to vpaced rhythm. Electrolytes at the time stable from the morning.
   - Patient actually had low bp's after milrinone decreased, increased
   neosynephrine slightly
   - Talked to pharm re: SC heparin dose in obese patients.  Stated that
   they don't typically adjust dose based on body weight but they ""have

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, massively dilated left ventricle, morbid obesity, and a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic heart failure requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis. The patient has experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT), which resulted in the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing. He is currently being treated with frequent non-sustained episodes of VT and has a biventricular (BiV)/ICD device.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: The patient's severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and systolic heart failure may lead to further deterioration of cardiac function, resulting in decreased cardiac output and organ perfusion.
2. RHYTHM: The patient's episodes of VT and the ICD firing indicate a risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Frequent non-sustained episodes of VT suggest ongoing arrhythmogenicity, which could potentially progress to sustained VT or ventricular fibrillation, leading to cardiac arrest.
3. HYponatremia/Hypochloremia:"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The patient experienced a significant event where they collapsed and telemetry showed polymorphic VTach, resulting in an ICD shock. The patient's electrolytes were stable at the time. The milrinone dose was reduced due to the patient's new lower weight, and there is a concern if milrinone precipitated the VT event. The patient also had low blood pressures after decreasing the milrinone dose, leading to an increase in neosynephrine. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is within normal range, heart rate is within normal limits, blood pressure is low, respiratory rate is within normal range, and oxygen saturation is good. The patient is on multiple medications including furosemide, phenylephrine, and heparin sodium. 

The patient's labs show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Kidney function seems to be within normal range based on the creatinine levels. Liver function tests are also within normal limits. Electrolyte levels are within normal range except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. 

The patient has a history of iodine allergy and an unknown allergy. They have been receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU. The patient's pain control and cardiomyopathy are being addressed. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include arrhythmias, low blood pressure, kidney dysfunction"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events: Pt notes no chest pain, shortness of breath. Only notes
   left gouty toe and left knee tendonitis. Pt very concerned by events
   and would like to discuss goals of treatment.
   -Two episodes of VT @220.  First, at 1330 ([**8-5**]) patient collapsed to
   floor, ICD fired. Milrinone reduced to .375 mcg/kg/min. Second, at 0400
   ([**8-6**]) patient felt palpitations/rapid heart beat and then passed out
   device fired. Milrinone turned off. After both events patient returned
   to vpaced rhythm. Electrolytes at the time stable from the morning.
   - Patient actually had low bp's after milrinone decreased, increased
   neosynephrine slightly
   - Talked to pharm re: SC heparin dose in obese patients.  Stated that
   they don't typically adjust dose based on body weight but they ""have
   seen 7500units TID used before"" and if we want to switch to that, we
   can.  Left it at 5000units TID.

   ECHO ([**8-5**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated
   with severer global hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
   left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, jet of moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior
   study (images reviewed) of [**2199-3-19**], left ventricular cavity size is
   minimally smaller and systolic function is minimally improved. Right
   ventricular free wall hypokinesis appears more global, but of similar
   magnitude.
   Assessment and Plan
   43yo male patient of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] with severe dilated non-ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, LVEF 15%, massively dilated LV, morbid
   obesity with weight in excess of 415 lbs., s/p BiV/ICD with LBBB, OSA
   who was directly admitted to CCU for decompensated systolic CHF
   requiring IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis and now with 40 Liters
   diuresed.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Length of stay 45 liters
   diuresed.  Continues diuresis at approx. 6-7 L daily, goal will be to
   maximize diuresis.
   - Consider restarting Milrinone with Amio?????
   - Milrinone off and Neosynephrine 0.6 mcg/kg/min infusion; will
   tolerate MAP > 55.  Will try to wean him off neosynephrine as BP
   tolerates.
   - continue IV lasix gtt at 30 mg/hr
   - continue Metolazone 5mg PO BID
   - continue spironolactone 50 PO daily
   - continue metoprolol 100mg PO TID
   - hold lisinopril at this time
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Chem 7s
   - Replete Potassium 40 meq IV TID/PRN
   - Acetazolamide 500mg Po Daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: with biV/ICD. Two episodes of fast VT (rate 220s) which
   resulted in ICD firing x2. V paced rhythm returned. Continues with
   freguent non- sustained episodes of VT.
   - Hold Milrinone at this time.
   - Check K TID, and give an extra 80 meq of K today on top of 40 TID;
   goal of 5.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Metoprolol 100mg PO TID
   - Avoid amio at this time as patient has had clear trigger of Sustained
   VT; low K and on milrinone
   -Avoid digoxin as this may potentiate arrythmia
   #Hyponatremia/Hypochloremia: intravasculary low volume which triggers
   ADH; Developed slowly over the past week on lasix gtt. 127/78 today.
   - Continue to monitor
   - When lasix gtt stopped will follow to assure controlled return to
   normal.
   .
   # Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: Secondary to poor cardiac output.
   Creatinine on admission 1.5 up to 1.9 today.
   - continue to hold lisinopril at this time
   - monitor Creatinine
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD, no cath in past
   - continue ASA
   .
   # Gout: Flare in left big toe.
   - continue colchicine q 6 hours with tylenol
   # Diarrhea: Started on loperamide yesterday for diarrhea related to
   colchicine.
   .
   # OSA
   - not on bipap at home

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, LVEF 15%, massively dilated LV, morbid obesity, s/p BiV/ICD with LBBB, OSA. He was admitted to the CCU for decompensated systolic CHF requiring IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis. The patient has been diuresed 40 liters, and continues diuresis at approximately 6-7 L daily. The goal is to maximize diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pump/Decompensated Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's heart function remains compromised, and there is a need to optimize diuresis to manage fluid overload.
2. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has experienced two episodes of fast VT (rate 220s) resulting in ICD firing. He continues to have frequent non-sustained episodes of VT and is currently paced in a V rhythm. There is a concern about maintaining an adequate heart rate and preventing further arrhythmias.
3. Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with an increase in creatinine levels from 1.5 to 1.9 today. This could be secondary to poor cardiac output and ongoing fluid management.

   Assessment and Plan
   43yo male patient of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] with severe dilated non-ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, LVEF 15%, massively dilated LV, morbid
   obesity with weight on admission in excess of 415 lbs., s/p BiV/ICD
   with LBBB, OSA who was directly admitted to CCU for decompensated
   systolic CHF requiring IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis and now with
   40 Liters diuresed.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Length of stay 53 liters
   diuresed.  Yesterday diuresis at approx. 4.5 Liters; decrease in
   diuresis likely due to decrease in Lasix gtt to 20/hr and Milrinone
   off.
   - Will try to wean him off neosynephrine as BP tolerates.
   - DC IV lasix gtt and transition to Turosemide 80mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Change  Metolazone to 5mg PO QAM
   - continue spironolactone 50 PO daily
   - continue metoprolol 100mg PO TID, transition to Toprol XL 200mg QAm
   tomorrow.
   - hold lisinopril at this time
   - Q8hr Chem 7s
   - Replete Potassium 40 meq IV TID + PRN
   - Acetazolamide 500mg Po Daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: with biV/ICD. No further episodes of fast VT in past 24hours,
   no ICD firing. V paced rhythm, but continues w/ frequent ectopy and
   occasional non- sustained episodes of VT.
   - Check K TID, and give an extra K today for goal K of 5.0.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg PO TID, to Toprol XL 200mg in AM
   .
   #Hyponatremia/Hypochloremia: Intravasculary low volume which triggers
   ADH; Developed slowly over the past week on lasix gtt. 128/79 today,
   stable in past 24hr.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: Secondary to poor cardiac output.
   Creatinine on admission 1.5, steadily increasing, up to 2.2 today.
   - continue to hold lisinopril at this time
   - monitor Creatinine
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD, no cath in past
   - continue ASA
   .
   # Gout: Flare in left big toe.  Improved today.
   - continue colchicine q 6 hours with tylenol, as needed.
   # Diarrhea: related to colchicine. Improved today.
    -Continue on loperamide as needed
   .
   # OSA
   - not on bipap at home

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes.
   Rising creat indicates that we are at or near the limit of aggressive
   volume unloading.  Therefore we will stop lasix gtt and start torsemide
   80 mg [**Hospital1 **]; reduce metolazone to 5 mg once daily, and attempt to wean
   off phenylephrine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). He has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15% and was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic CHF requiring intravenous milrinone and Lasix for diuresis.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including neosynephrine, Lasix, milrinone, metoprolol, spironolactone, and acetazolamide. His potassium levels are being monitored and repleted as needed. He is also on a low-sodium diet.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 95/62 mmHg to 129/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air, and temperature within normal range. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 6 mmHg.

The patient has experienced some complications, including acute renal failure with increasing creatinine levels from 1.5 to 2.2 mg/dL, hypokalemia with potassium levels ranging from 2.8 to 4.8 mEq/L, and hyponatremia/hypochloremia with sodium and chloride levels"

   Disposition: Floor if pt can be weaned off Neosynephrine.
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. He is morbidly obese and has been admitted to the ICU for decompensated systolic heart failure requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis. 

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Pump/Decompensated Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure has led to fluid overload, as evidenced by his massive diuresis of 40 liters. He is currently on IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis, with plans to wean him off neosynephrine as his blood pressure tolerates. He will be transitioned to oral diuretics, including furosemide and metolazone, and continue on spironolactone and metoprolol.

2. Rhythm: The patient has a biventricular/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB). He has had episodes of fast ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the past but has not had any ICD firing or fast VT episodes in the last 24 hours. He will continue to be monitored on telemetry, and his potassium levels will be checked regularly"

   Assessment and Plan
   43yo male patient of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] with severe dilated non-ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, LVEF 15%, massively dilated LV, morbid
   obesity with weight on admission in excess of 415 lbs., s/p BiV/ICD
   with LBBB, OSA who was directly admitted to CCU for decompensated
   systolic CHF requiring IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis and now with
   40 Liters diuresed.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Length of stay 53 liters
   diuresed.  Yesterday diuresis at approx. 4.5 Liters; decrease in
   diuresis likely due to decrease in Lasix gtt to 20/hr and Milrinone
   off.
   - Will try to wean him off neosynephrine as BP tolerates.
   - DC IV lasix gtt and transition to Turosemide 200mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - continue Metolazone 5mg PO BID
   - continue spironolactone 50 PO daily
   - continue metoprolol 100mg PO TID, transition to Toprol XL tomorrow.
   - hold lisinopril at this time
   - Q8hr Chem 7s
   - Replete Potassium 40 meq IV TID + PRN
   - Acetazolamide 500mg Po Daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: with biV/ICD. No further episodes of fast VT in past 24hours,
   no ICD firing. V paced rhythm, but continues w/ frequent ectopy and
   occasional non- sustained episodes of VT.
   - Hold Milrinone at this time.
   - Check K TID, and give an extra K today for goal K of 5.0.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg PO TID
   - Avoid amio at this time as patient has had clear trigger of Sustained
   VT; K increasing, holding milrinone
   -Avoid digoxin as this may potentiate arrhythmia
   #Hyponatremia/Hypochloremia: Intravasculary low volume which triggers
   ADH; Developed slowly over the past week on lasix gtt. 128/79 today,
   stable in past 24hr.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: Secondary to poor cardiac output.
   Creatinine on admission 1.5, steadily increasing, up to 2.2 today.
   - continue to hold lisinopril at this time
   - monitor Creatinine
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD, no cath in past
   - continue ASA
   .
   # Gout: Flare in left big toe.  Improved today.
   - continue colchicine q 6 hours with tylenol, as needed.
   # Diarrhea: related to colchicine. Improved today.
    -Continue on loperamide as needed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic heart failure, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. The patient has been admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic heart failure requiring intravenous milrinone and Lasix for diuresis. 

The patient's potassium levels have been fluctuating, with a high of 4.8 mEq/L and a low of 3.5 K/uL. The patient has received multiple potassium boluses, totaling 200mEq in the last 24 hours. The creatinine level has also increased from 1.7 to 2.2 mg/dL.

The patient's heart rhythm is currently ventricular-paced, with marked ectopy and occasional non-sustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB). 

The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, with an oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's blood pressure is currently 95/62 mmHg, and the central venous pressure (CVP) is 6 mmHg. The patient has been receiving phenylephrine and furosemide infusions.

   Assessment and Plan
   43yo male patient of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] with severe dilated non-ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, LVEF 15%, massively dilated LV, morbid
   obesity with weight on admission in excess of 415 lbs., s/p BiV/ICD
   with LBBB, OSA who was directly admitted to CCU for decompensated
   systolic CHF requiring IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis and now with
   40 Liters diuresed.
   .
   # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Length of stay 51 liters
   diuresed.  Yesterday diuresis at approx. 4.5 Liters; decrease in
   diuresis likely due to decrease in Lasix gtt to 20/hr and Milrinone
   off.
   - Consider restarting Milrinone with Amio or increased B-blockade????
   - Milrinone off and Neosynephrine 0.6 mcg/kg/min infusion; will
   tolerate MAP > 55.  Will try to wean him off neosynephrine as BP
   tolerates.
   - continue IV lasix gtt at 20 mg/hr
   - continue Metolazone 5mg PO BID
   - continue spironolactone 50 PO daily
   - continue metoprolol 100mg PO TID
   - hold lisinopril at this time
   - Q8hr Chem 7s
   - Replete Potassium 40 meq IV TID + PRN
   - Acetazolamide 500mg Po Daily
   .
   # RHYTHM: with biV/ICD. No further episodes of fast VT in past 24hours,
   no ICD firing. V paced rhythm, but continues w/ frequent ectopy and
   occasional non- sustained episodes of VT.
   - Hold Milrinone at this time.
   - Check K TID, and give an extra K today for goal K of 5.0.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg PO TID
   - Avoid amio at this time as patient has had clear trigger of Sustained
   VT; K increasing, holding milrinone
   -Avoid digoxin as this may potentiate arrhythmia
   #Hyponatremia/Hypochloremia: intravasculary low volume which triggers
   ADH; Developed slowly over the past week on lasix gtt. 128/79 today,
   stable in past 24hr.
   - Continue to monitor
   - When lasix gtt stopped will follow to assure controlled return to
   normal.
   .
   # Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: Secondary to poor cardiac output.
   Creatinine on admission 1.5, steadily increasing, up to 2.2 today.
   - continue to hold lisinopril at this time
   - monitor Creatinine
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD, no cath in past
   - continue ASA
   .
   # Gout: Flare in left big toe.
   - continue colchicine q 6 hours with tylenol
   # Diarrhea: related to colchicine.
    -Continue on loperamide as needed
   .
   # OSA
   - not on bipap at home

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%, morbid obesity, and a history of biventricular (BiV) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic CHF requiring intravenous milrinone and lasix for diuresis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: The patient's condition is currently stable, but there is a risk of further decompensation if diuretic therapy is not optimized or if there is a worsening of heart function.
2. RHYTHM: The patient has a history of BiV/ICD with LBBB and continues to experience frequent ectopy and occasional nonsustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT). Close monitoring and adjustment of antiarrhythmic medications may be necessary to prevent further arrhythmias.
3. HYponatremia/HYPONATERMIA: The patient has hyponatremia and hypochloremia, which could be due to intravasculary low volume triggering antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion. Continuous"

   Communication:  Comments: with patient, sister
   [**Name (NI) 36**] status: Full code
   Disposition: Floor if pt can be weaned off Neosynephrine
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with severe dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic heart failure, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15%. The patient is morbidly obese, with a weight on admission exceeding 415 lbs. He has undergone biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

The patient was directly admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for decompensated systolic heart failure requiring intravenous milrinone and Lasix for diuresis. He has already undergone 40 liters of diuresis, with a decrease in diuresis observed due to the decrease in Lasix gtt to 20/hr and milrinone off.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: The patient's condition requires close monitoring for any signs of worsening heart failure, such as increased shortness of breath, fluid accumulation, or decreased cardiac output.

2. RHYTHM: With the biV/ICD in place, the patient is at risk for arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia (VT). Continuous monitoring on telemetry is essential to detect any abnormal rhythms promptly.

3. HYPNATREMIA/HYPOCHLOREMIA: The patient's hyponatremia and hypochloremia should be monitored closely. Intravascular volume depletion triggers antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release, leading to hyponatremia. Close attention should be given to electrolyte levels and fluid balance.

4. ACUTE VS CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: The patient's creatinine levels have been steadily increasing, indicating possible acute or chronic renal failure secondary to poor cardiac output. Regular monitoring of renal function is crucial.

5. GOUT: The patient experienced a flare-up of gout in the left big toe. Treatment with colchicine and loperamide should be continued as prescribed.

6. DIARRHEA: The patient also experienced diarrhea related to colchicine use. Monitoring for gastrointestinal symptoms and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.

7. OSA: The patient's OSA should be managed with appropriate measures, such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or other respiratory support if necessary.

8. DVT PROPHYLAXIS: The patient is receiving subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary.

9. STRESS ULCER: Prophylactic stress ulcer precautions should be continued to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.

10. VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA (VAP): Close surveillance for signs of VAP,"
