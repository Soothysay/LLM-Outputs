","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for suspected acute pancreatitis, most likely related to alcohol use. The patient's condition is complicated by anion gap metabolic acidosis due to ketoacidosis and lactic acidosis, hypoxemia secondary to hypoventilation and atelectasis, renal failure likely due to dehydration, and hypertension. The patient has been managed with fluid resuscitation, pain control, ruling out gallstones, close monitoring of electrolytes, and supportive care. The patient is also being closely monitored for symptoms of ethanol withdrawal and provided with appropriate therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued progression of acute pancreatitis with potential complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst formation, or infected pancreatic necrosis.
2. Hypoxemia may persist or worsen if the patient continues to have hypoventilation or atelectasis.
3. Renal failure could recur if the patient does not maintain adequate hydration.
4. Hypertension may require further management and adjustment of antihypertensive therapy.
5. Ethanol withdrawal symptoms may develop and require prompt recognition and treatment to prevent complications such as seizures or delirium tremens.
6. The patient is at risk for infections due to indwelling lines and the use of immunosuppressive medications.
7. The patient's underlying Hepatitis C infection may worsen if not properly managed."

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis. The patient's condition has been stable, with controlled pain and fluid resuscitation. He is currently on BiPAP for respiratory support, and his oxygen requirement has been increasing overnight. His blood pressure is within the normal range, and he is on labetalol for blood pressure control. The patient's renal function is improving, and his acid-base imbalance is resolving.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pancreatitis-related complications: The patient may develop infected pancreatic necrosis, pancreatic pseudocyst, or abscess formation.
2. Respiratory complications: Due to hypoventilation and atelectasis, the patient is at risk of developing pneumonia or further respiratory distress.
3. Renal failure: The patient's initial renal failure is likely due to dehydration, but ongoing monitoring is necessary to prevent further renal dysfunction.
4. Hypoxemia: Although the patient's hypoxemia is currently being managed with BiPAP, continuous monitoring is required to ensure adequate oxygenation.
5. Ethanol withdrawal: Given the patient's history of heavy alcohol abuse, there is a risk of ethanol withdrawal syndrome, which requires close monitoring and appropriate management with benzodiazepines and other medications as needed.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
7. Aspiration"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis, likely related to alcohol use. The patient has increased oxygen requirements, anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypoxemia, renal failure, hypertension, and ethanol withdrawal. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's acute pancreatitis may lead to complications such as infected pancreatic necrosis, pancreatic pseudocyst, or pancreatic fistula.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels can result in tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not properly managed with respiratory support.
3. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient is at risk for developing symptoms of ethanol withdrawal, which can include agitation, seizures, and delirium tremens.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure could progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease if not promptly treated.
5. Hypertension: Uncontrolled hypertension may lead to cardiovascular complications such as stroke or heart attack.
6. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to alcohol abuse and pancreatitis increases the risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
7. Malnutrition: Prolonged NPO status and decreased oral intake due to pancreatitis can lead to malnutrition and subsequent complications.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and inflammation associated"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/oM with h/o HCV and Alcohol abuse is admitted with acute
   pancreatitis presubambly from acute EtOH ingestion given negative
   report of cholelithiasis on Fast U/S in ED. His brief course is
   additionally notable for hypoxia requiring NIMV/BIPAP, altered mental
   status, and severe hypertension.
   1) Pancreatitis - [**Last Name (un) 1840**] Score 3 on admission
   - For further diagnosis:
     RUQ ultrasound formally when more stable to further characterize
   ducts, no elevation in bili at this time to suggest obstructing
     stone.  Checking triglycerides, cholesterol.
   - PIV x2
   - NS/LR Fluid Resus 250cc/hour (alternate NS and LR given rising
   chloride)
   - Consider imipenem-cilastin as case progresses; described as phlegmon
   on OSH transfer summary, and noted by OSH rads resident (as discussed
   by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 697**] from surgery) as pancreatic stranding without fluid
   collections, no pancreatic necrosis. We do not have CT/imaging with us
   at present. Will f/u final read
   - Continue to have surgery following
   - NPO including meds for now, aim for early PO intake with NGT or POs
   (defer for now given NIMV and clinical condition)
   2) Hypoxia
   DDx includes Acute Lung Injury/ARDS from Pancreatitis, volume overload.
   CXR non-descript at this time but portable cxr of medium quality. Given
   lack of infiltrates and improvement on cxr, likely hypoventilation.
   - NIMV, wean as tolerated
   - f/u CXR in morning
   - continue fluid resus, intubate if ventilation becomes difficult or
   compromised
   3) Acidemia
   - component of gap acidosis and respiratory acidosis on admission, gap
   now closing. Suspect due to SIRS with elevated OSH lactate that is
   improving with fluids.
   - Initial respiratory acidosis likely [**1-2**] hypoventilation from pain,
   inc abdomen size, ventilating better with BIPAP. follow.
   4) Hypertension
   Severe hypertensive urgency at outside hospital and ED, improved on
   nipride gtt started in ED, aim to wean down antihypertensives
   - Nipride gtt from ER, change over to labetolol for longer-term use if
   necessary
   - Titrate to gently decreased BP over hours, Goal SBP 160s for now
   - Arterial-line placed to transduce pressures
   5) Ketosis
   - Follow anion gap (15 in ED) now down to 9 (closed)
   - Recheck urine ketones/ serum acetone
   6) EtOH Abuse / Concern for Withdrawal
   - Lorazepam IV CIWA Scale
   - Thiamine, Folate daily
   7) Elevated Creatinine
   - check  urine lytes
   - recheck lytes q6 initially
   - Creanine has normalized now in MICU
   8) Altered Mental Status
   ?medication vs. medical delirium. Replete thiamine, folate.
   9) Hypocalcemia
   related to pancreatitis likely, potential malignant calcification.
   Replete IV for now. Follow ionized calciums.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HCV and alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis.
- He has been experiencing hypoxia, altered mental status, and severe hypertension.
- Pancreatitis is confirmed, but no evidence of cholelithiasis on FAST ultrasound.
- The patient requires NIMV/BIPAP for hypoxia, IV fluids for rehydration, and antibiotics for potential infection.
- Other lab results show elevated WBC, platelets, and liver enzymes, with low potassium and calcium levels.
- Assessment and plan include managing pancreatitis, hypoxia, hypertension, altered mental status, ketosis, alcohol withdrawal, and electrolyte imbalances.
- ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for DVT and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pancreatitis: Acute pancreatitis can lead to complications such as necrosis, pseudocyst formation, abscess, or infected pancreatic necrosis.
2. Hypoxia: If not adequately managed, hypoxia can result in tissue damage, organ dysfunction, and potentially lead to respiratory failure.
3. Hypertension: Uncontrolled hypertension may cause end-organ damage, including cardiac complications, stroke, or kidney injury.
4. Alcohol Withdrawal: If not treated appropriately, alcohol withdrawal can progress to severe complications like seizures or delirium tremens.

   57 y/oM with h/o HCV and Alcohol abuse, admitted with acute
   pancreatitis likely  from acute EtOH ingestion.  Course additionally
   notable for hypoxia requiring NIMV/BIPAP, altered mental status, and
   severe hypertension.
   #) Pancreatitis - [**Last Name (un) 1840**] Score 3 on admission. Likely related to EtOH.
   Other possibilities include gallstones (negative cholelithiasis on Fast
   U/S in ED), hypertriglyceridemia (history of this; level pending).
   - RUQ today to further characterize ducts, no elevation in bili at this
   time to suggest obstructing stone.
   - f/u triglycerides.
   - PIV x2
   - NS/LR Fluid Resus (will decrease to 125/h)
   - No current role for antibiotics.
   - Continue to have surgery following.
   - NPO including meds for now, aim for early PO intake with NGT or POs
   - Low threshold for insulin gtt
   #) Hypoxia - DDx includes Acute Lung Injury/ARDS from Pancreatitis,
   volume overload, splinting due to pain and large abdomen. Given lack of
   infiltrates and improvement CXR with biPAP, likely hypoventilation.
   - FM this morning, back to NIPPV if needed
   - CXR in AM.
   #) Acidemia
 initial component of gap acidosis and respiratory
   acidosis on admission, gap now closing. Suspect related to elevated OSH
   lactate that is improving with fluids.  Initial respiratory acidosis
   likely [**1-2**] hypoventilation from pain, inc abdomen size, ventilating
   better with BIPAP.
   - PM ABG and lytes
   #) Hypertension.  Severe hypertensive urgency at outside hospital and
   ED, improved on nipride gtt started in ED, then switched to labetalol,
   now on just small doses.
   - prn labetolol gtt, no PO meds for now.
   - Arterial-line in place to transduce pressures
   #) EtOH Abuse / Concern for Withdrawal. Last drink [**10-1**] or [**10-2**].
   - Lorazepam IV CIWA Scale
   - Thiamine, Folate daily
   - Will attempt IV haldol for agitation related symptomatology; consider
   clonidine or labetalol for hemodynamic changes.
   #) Elevated Creatinine
   - recheck lytes this afternoon
   - Creatinine has normalized now in MICU
   #) Altered Mental Status.  Likely medication vs. medical delirium.
   Replete thiamine, folate.
   - Monitor status with prn lorazepam, haldol
   #  Hypocalcemia. Likely related to pancreatitis.
   -          Replete IV for now. Follow ionized calciums.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, alcohol withdrawal, acute pancreatitis, and malignant hypertension. He is currently on multiple medications including labetalol, haloperidol, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate. His vital signs are unstable with a high heart rate, fluctuating blood pressure, and elevated respiratory rate. The patient has received various treatments and interventions since admission. His laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, troponin T, TCO2, glucose, and other lab values. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory support, glycemic control, and blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if there is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation support.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient may experience worsening symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as seizures or delirium tremens if not properly managed with medication.
3. Acute Pancreatitis: Complications like necrotizing pancreatitis or infected pancreatic necrosis could occur, leading to further deterioration in the patient's condition.
4. Malignant Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored to prevent complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or aortic dissection.
5. Infections: The patient is at risk for developing infections, especially ventilator"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis likely due to acute ethanol ingestion. The patient's course has been notable for hypoxia requiring NIMV/BIPAP, altered mental status, and severe hypertension.

The patient has a high score on the Ranson criteria for pancreatitis, indicating a suboptimal prognosis. The etiology of the pancreatitis is likely related to alcohol abuse, as there are no gallstones or elevated triglycerides present. The patient has been aggressively fluid-repleted and is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) with IV fluids being decreased to 80cc/hr due to pulmonary edema and hypoxia.

There is a concern for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and the patient's condition requires close monitoring. The patient is at risk for ethanol withdrawal/hypertension, and the current management plan includes NPO, keeping the patient on labetalol, administering thiamine and folate, and using Haldol as needed for hallucinations while minimizing its use to optimize mental status.

The patient also has acidemia, which is likely related to elevated OSH lactate that is improving with fluids. There is an initial component of gap acidosis and respiratory acidosis on admission, which is now closing. The patient's hypertension is being managed with labetalol.

The patient's elevated creatinine levels have normalized in the MICU (medical intensive care unit), and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HCV and alcohol abuse admitted with acute pancreatitis likely caused by acute alcohol ingestion. The patient's course is notable for hypoxia requiring non-invasive ventilation, altered mental status, and severe hypertension. The patient has been aggressively fluid repleted, placed on strict NPO status, and received insulin to keep glucose levels below 150. Calcium levels are being trended. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's condition is complicated by pancreatitis, which can lead to local and systemic complications such as infection, organ failure, and sepsis.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory support with NIMV/BIPAP may not be sufficient, and there is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation leading to respiratory failure.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid resuscitation, which increases the risk of fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
4. Alcohol withdrawal/hypertension: The patient is at risk for withdrawal symptoms and delirium tremens due to chronic alcohol abuse. Hypertension may complicate the clinical picture.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to multiple factors including alcohol intoxication, pancreatitis, or encephalopathy. Monitoring for signs of deterioration and infection is essential.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis likely caused by acute ethanol ingestion. The patient's course has been notable for hypoxia requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV)/bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP), altered mental status, and severe hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may progress to infected pancreatic necrosis or develop complications such as pseudocysts or abscesses.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory support with NIMV/BIPAP may be required long-term or transition to invasive mechanical ventilation if there is worsening respiratory function or failure to improve.
3. Severe hypertension: The patient's severe hypertension may lead to end-organ damage if not adequately controlled.
4. EtOH withdrawal: The patient's last drink was [**10-1**] or [**10-2**], and he is at risk for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can be precipitated by sudden cessation of alcohol intake.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to multiple factors including medication effects, metabolic disturbances, or alcohol withdrawal. Monitoring and management of the patient's mental status is important to prevent further complications.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia is likely related to pancreatitis and may require repletion and monitoring of ion"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis. The pancreatitis is likely related to alcohol use and the patient has elevated lipase levels. The patient initially presented with hypoxemia due to hypoventilation and atelectasis, but this has progressed over the past 24 hours. The patient also has fluid overload and is at risk for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Other medical issues include anion gap acidosis, hypertension, renal failure, hypoxemia, and ethanol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's progressive hypoxemia and fluid overload put him at high risk for developing ARDS. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions such as CPAP trial and weaning off supportive oxygen are necessary.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function may worsen due to dehydration and subsequent volume overload. Close monitoring of renal parameters and gentle diuresis might be required.
3. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient should be closely monitored for symptoms of ethanol withdrawal and treated accordingly with a combination therapy of benzodiazepines, haloperidol, and potentially labetalol or clonidine as needed.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently elevated, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. Close monitoring and appropriate management with antihypertensive medications like labetalol are necessary."

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis, likely related to alcohol use. The patient's vital signs show tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, fever with a temperature of 100.2°F (38.7°C), and hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient's blood pressure is high at 175/163 mmHg, and the heart rate is within normal limits at 74 beats per minute.

The patient has a decreased mental status and increased oxygen requirements. On physical examination, the patient has crackles in the bases of both lungs bilaterally, indicating possible pulmonary edema or atelectasis. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, with bowel sounds present but distended. The neurologic examination reveals the patient to be attentive, oriented to time and place, and moving all extremities spontaneously.

Laboratory results show elevated lipase levels of 3000 at the time of admission, indicating acute pancreatitis. The patient also has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.6-14.6 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) of 38.7%, and mildly elevated platelet count (Plt) of 115-152 K/uL. Renal function tests show a creatinine level of 1.0-1.1 mg/dL, and liver enzymes such as ALT and AST are elevated. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's current medications include labetalol, haloperidol, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate. The patient's condition is complicated by anion gap acidosis, which is likely due to ketoacidosis and lactic acidosis resulting from decreased PO intake and hypo-perfusion in the setting of pancreatitis. Both conditions are now normalizing with supportive fluid resuscitation.

The patient is at high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the progression of hypoxemia in the setting of pancreatitis and fluid overload. The patient will need a trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and weaning off supplemental oxygen. The patient is also at risk for ethanol withdrawal, and close monitoring for symptom development is necessary. Aspiration precautions should be taken, and thiamine and folate supplementation should be considered.

The patient's nutritional status is compromised due to pancreatitis, and regular insulin sliding scale is being used for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line, and is receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse. He was admitted with acute pancreatitis, likely related to alcohol use, as indicated by a lipase level of 3000 at OSH. The patient also has hypoxemia due to hypoventilation and atelectasis, as well as anion gap metabolic acidosis caused by ketoacidosis and lactic acidosis.

The patient's current vital signs show a high blood pressure of 175/163 mmHg, which is being managed with labetalol. His respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 29 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is at 93% with the use of a nasal cannula. His heart rhythm is normal.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelets (Plt). His troponin-T level is below 0.01, indicating no cardiac damage. His liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are slightly elevated, while his bilirubin and electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's plan includes fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's (LR) and repletion of electrolytes, as well as pain control and strict sugar control. He is being closely monitored for signs of alcohol withdrawal and potential complications such as renal failure, hypoxemia, and stress ulcer.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a chief complaint of pancreatitis. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing high benzo and haldol requirements, fever, and intermittent use of BIPAP. The patient has allergies to codeine and unknown allergens. He has been receiving various medications including haloperidol, pantoprazole, furosemide, heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, and lorazepam. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.2 axillary, blood pressure ranging from 112-158 mmHg, heart rate between 67-84 bpm, respiratory rate of 22-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. The blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, HCO3- of 103 mEq/L, PO2/FiO2 ratio of 206, and slightly increased lactate level. 

The patient has been diagnosed with fever of unknown origin, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), alcohol withdrawal, acute pancreatitis, malignant hypertension, and is being managed in the ICU. He is NPO (nothing by mouth), receiving regular insulin for glycemic control, and has multiple lines including an arterial line. Prophylactic measures such as DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP are being taken. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are on the lower end, indicating a potential risk for hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and he requires intermittent BIPAP support. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration, and close monitoring of his respiratory status is essential.
4. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms: The patient's history of alcohol use suggests a risk for withdrawal symptoms. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal, such as seizures or delirium tremens, is important for timely intervention.
5. Pancreatitis complications: Acute pancreatitis can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, or infected pancreatic necrosis. Monitoring for any signs of worsening pancreatitis or its complications is crucial.
6. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate a risk for malignant hypertension. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent complications associated with uncontrolled hypertension."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis likely due to acute alcohol ingestion. The patient's course has been notable for hypoxia requiring non-invasive ventilation, altered mental status, and severe hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and infected pancreatic necrosis.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory support with NIMV/BIPAP indicates that he is experiencing difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygen levels in his blood. This can result in tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not promptly addressed.
3. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse, there is a significant risk of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, including delirium tremens (DTs) and seizures. Appropriate management with benzodiazepines and thiamine is necessary to prevent complications.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an excess of fluid intake over output, indicating fluid overload. This condition can lead to pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Hypertension: The patient's persistent hypertension requires close monitoring and appropriate antihypertensive therapy to prevent complications like intracranial hemorrhage or cardiac strain.
6. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient's recent temperature spike suggests an"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis likely caused by acute alcohol ingestion. The patient has been experiencing hypoxia, altered mental status, and hypertension. His pancreatitis is severe, with a Ranson score of 4, indicating a poor prognosis. The patient's lipase levels have improved significantly today. 

Potential Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels may indicate respiratory distress or inadequate oxygenation. This could be due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), especially considering the patient's fluid overload and need for NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation).
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an excess of fluid intake compared to output, suggesting fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory symptoms.
3. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and recent cessation, there is a significant risk for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including delirium tremens (DTs) and seizures. Close monitoring and appropriate medication management are essential.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, with a free water deficit of approximately 3 liters. Starting D5W (5% dextrose in water) to correct the sodium imbalance is important.
5. Fever: The patient has had a fever, and cultures have been taken. Further evaluation is needed to determine the origin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HCV and alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis likely due to acute EtOH ingestion. The patient's course has been complicated by hypoxia requiring NIMV/BIPAP, altered mental status, severe hypertension, and fluid overload. The patient's pancreatitis is classified as severe with a Ranson score of 3 on admission and 4 at 48 hours post-presentation. There are concerns about the potential development of complications such as alcohol withdrawal (including delirium tremens), hypoxia, fluid overload, and possible ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a significant risk for withdrawal symptoms, including seizures and delirium tremens.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has required NIMV/BIPAP due to hypoxia and there is a concern for ongoing respiratory support.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload, which may require diuretic therapy and careful monitoring of fluid balance.
4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's current condition and history of pancreatitis, there is a concern for the development of ARDS.
5. Delirium Tremens: This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by altered mental status, fever, tachycardia, and agitation.
6. Seizures: The patient is at risk for seizures as part of alcohol withdrawal"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis, likely related to alcohol use. He has a high lipase level of 3000 at OSH and is experiencing progressive hypoxemia, likely secondary to hypoventilation and atelectasis. The patient also has hypoxemia that has worsened over the past 24 hours, possibly due to his progressive fluid overload.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/86 mmHg to 113/62 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on Face tent with standby ventilator support. His ABG results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, PaO2 of 206, and HCO3- of 22 mEq/L.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. His cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds (S1 and S2), and his peripheral pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Neurological examination shows that he is not oriented, has A+O x 0, and moves all extremities. The respiratory examination reveals symmetric chest expansion, dullness at the bases, and crackles at the bases."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o male with hist of Hep C and heavy EtOH abuse admitted with acute
   pancreatitis (most likely ETOH related) with lipase of 3000 at OSH,
   hypoxemia (secondary to hypoventilation/ atelectasis ) which improved
   yesterday with diuresis
    >Pancreatitis: likely EtOH related, stranding seen on CT scan at OSH
   but no evidence of abscess/pseudocyst.. Notably he has nl
   triglycerides. Lipase values now normalized.
   - maintenance fluid resus with D5 (given hypernatremia) and repletion
   of lytes (decreasing fluids given vol overload) will need to follow Na
   closely
   - NPO for now
   - no role for abx (WBC likely [**1-2**] pancreatitis). F/u blood clx.
   - hold on opiates for now.
   - tight SSI
   > Hypernatremia: will need to increase his  free water repletion (D5),
   will calc the free water deficit
   >Fever: no new clx data, WBC stable, no new infiltrate, lipase
   normalizing. Cont to follow for now.
   >HTN: tolerate SBP <170mmHg
   - wean labetalol gtt as tolerated given inability to tolerate PO
   >Renal failure: likely dehydration but now volume overloaded
     >Hypoxemia: likely [**1-2**] appropriate volume resus in the setting of
   pancreatitis complicated by splinting and atelectasis now concerning
   for evolution into ARDS.  Concern for progressive hypoxemia, he is at
   high risk for ARDS [**1-2**] pancreatitis. He responded well to diuresis
   yesterday.
   - Can use BiPAP intermittently if O2 requirement increases and gentle
   diuresis as needed (but following Na closely)
   >EtOH withdrawl/Altered MS:  will follow closely for symptom
   development and work to control symptoms with combination therapy
   (benzos, haldol and potentially labet/clonidine as needed) will D/c
   narcotics for now. Will try to prioritize haldol use today. Alternate
   explanations for MS include: metabolic (see hypernatremia) and possible
   hepatic encephalopathy. For now will defer NG tube as this seems most
   likely to be a presentation consistent with EtOH withdrawl. If no
   improvement may need NG tube for lactulose.
   - monitor symptoms (CIWA)
   - aspiration precautions: HOB elevation
   - thiamine and folate

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse. He was admitted with acute pancreatitis, most likely related to alcohol use, as indicated by a lipase level of 3000 at OSH. The patient initially had hypoxemia due to hypoventilation and atelectasis but has since developed progressive vol overload.

The patient's assessment includes:

1. Pancreatitis: likely EtOH related, with stranding seen on CT scan at OSH but no evidence of abscess/pseudocyst. His triglycerides are normal.
   - Maintenance fluid resuscitation with LR and repletion of electrolytes (decreasing fluids due to volume overload).
   - NPO (nothing by mouth) for now.
   - No role for antibiotics (WBC likely 1-2 pancreatitis).
   - Follow-up blood cultures.
   - Pain control.
   - Tight sugar control.

2. Anion Gap Acidosis: ketoacidosis and lactic acidosis likely a result of hypo-perfusion and decreased PO intake in the setting of pancreatitis. Both are now normalizing.
   - Continue to follow, supportive fluid resuscitation using LR as choice of fluids to avoid hyperchloremia.
   - Recheck lactate.

   CXR [**10-6**]: improved pul vasc congestion
   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o male with hist of Hep C and heavy EtOH abuse admitted with acute
   pancreatitis (most likely ETOH related) with lipase of 3000 at OSH,
   hypoxemia (secondary to hypoventilation/ atelectasis ) which improved
   yesterday with diuresis
    >Pancreatitis: likely EtOH related, stranding seen on CT scan at OSH
   but no evidence of abscess/pseudocyst.. Notably he has nl
   triglycerides. Lipase values now normalized.
   - maintenance fluid resus with D5 (given hypernatremia) and repletion
   of lytes (decreasing fluids given vol overload) will need to follow Na
   closely
   - NPO for now
   - no role for abx (WBC likely [**1-2**] pancreatitis). F/u blood clx.
   - hold on opiates for now.
   - tight SSI
   > Hypernatremia: will need to increase his  free water repletion (D5),
   will calc the free water deficit
   >Fever: no new clx data, WBC stable, no new infiltrate, lipase
   normalizing. Cont to follow for now.
   >HTN: tolerate SBP <170mmHg
   - wean labetalol gtt as tolerated given inability to tolerate PO
   >Renal failure: likely dehydration but now volume overloaded
     >Hypoxemia: likely [**1-2**] appropriate volume resus in the setting of
   pancreatitis complicated by splinting and atelectasis now concerning
   for evolution into ARDS.  Concern for progressive hypoxemia, he is at
   high risk for ARDS [**1-2**] pancreatitis. He responded well to diuresis
   yesterday. Will hold today given rising serum sodium
   - Can use BiPAP intermittently if O2 requirement increases and gentle
   diuresis as needed (but following Na closely)
   >EtOH withdrawl/Altered MS:  will follow closely for symptom
   development and work to control symptoms with combination therapy
   (benzos, haldol and potentially labet/clonidine as needed) will D/c
   narcotics for now. Will try to prioritize haldol use today. Alternate
   explanations for MS include: metabolic (see hypernatremia) and possible
   hepatic encephalopathy. For now will defer NG tube as this seems most
   likely to be a presentation consistent with EtOH withdrawl. If no
   improvement may need NG tube for lactulose.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse admitted with acute pancreatitis, most likely related to alcohol use. He presented with hypoxemia secondary to hypoventilation and atelectasis, which improved yesterday with diuresis. The patient's lipase levels were initially elevated but have now normalized. He is currently on maintenance fluid resuscitation with D5 and repletion of electrolytes. He is NPO at the moment. There is no role for antibiotics as his white blood cell count is within normal range and all cultures are negative.

Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis likely related to alcohol use. It is important to monitor his condition closely for any signs of complications such as abscess or pseudocyst formation.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be managed by increasing free water repletion. Sodium levels should be closely monitored, and the free water deficit should be calculated.
3. Fever: The patient has had low-grade fevers, but no new clinical data or infiltrate on chest X-ray. His white blood cell count is stable, and there is no need for immediate intervention. However, if the fever persists or spikes, it may be necessary to reculture.
4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and his blood pressure should be maintained below 170 mmHg. L"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse.
- He was admitted with acute pancreatitis, most likely related to alcohol use.
- The patient had hypoxemia secondary to hypoventilation/atelectasis, which improved yesterday with diuresis.
- His lipase levels were initially elevated at 3000 but have now normalized.
- The patient is currently experiencing fever of unknown origin (FUO), hypernatremia, hypertension, renal failure, and altered mental status (AMS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever needs to be investigated further to determine the underlying cause. Possible causes include infection, inflammation, or malignancy.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high levels of sodium in his blood. This can lead to dehydration, increased thirst, confusion, seizures, or even coma if not managed properly.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, indicating hypertension. If left uncontrolled, it can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other complications.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to decreased urine output. This can result in fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and waste product accumulation in the body.

   high risk for ARDS [**1-2**] pancreatitis. He responded well to diuresis
   yesterday and conts to respond well to BiPAP (marked improving
   oxygentation). Will hold today given rising serum sodium
   - Can use BiPAP intermittently if O2 requirement increases and gentle

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis, most likely related to alcohol use. The patient presented with hypoxemia secondary to hypoventilation and atelectasis, which improved with diuresis. The patient's lipase levels were elevated initially but have now normalized.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Fever of unknown origin: The patient has had persistent low-grade fevers, but no new clinical data or infiltrates on chest X-ray. The white blood cell count is stable, and lipase levels are normalizing. The fever will be monitored for now.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to dehydration. Free water repletion with D5 (5% dextrose in water) will be increased to correct the sodium imbalance.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to atelectasis and may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient responded well to diuresis and BiPAP (Bilevel positive airway pressure) therapy, which improved oxygenation. BiPAP can be used intermittently if oxygen requirements increase. Gentle diuresis will be continued, but sodium levels will be closely monitored.

4. Ethanol withdrawal/Altered mental status: The patient will be closely monitored for symptoms of ethanol withdrawal"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o male with hist of Hep C and heavy EtOH abuse admitted with acute
   pancreatitis (most likely ETOH related) with lipase of 3000 at OSH,
   hypoxemia (secondary to hypoventilation/ atelectasis ) which improved
   yesterday with diuresis
    >Pancreatitis: likely EtOH related, stranding seen on CT scan at OSH
   but no evidence of abscess/pseudocyst.. Notably he has nl
   triglycerides. Lipase values now normalized.
   - maintenance fluid resus with D5 (given hypernatremia) and repletion
   of lytes (decreasing fluids given vol overload) will need to follow Na
   closely
   - NPO for now
   - hold on opiates for now.
   - tight SSI
   > Hypernatremia: will need to increase his  free water repletion (D5),
   will calc the free water deficit
   >Fever: Conts low grade fevers, no new clx data, WBC stable, no new
   infiltrate on [**10-7**], lipase normalizing. Will empirically cover for asp
   PNA with Vanco and Pip-Tazo (empiric for now x 48 hrs)
   - repeat LFTs
    >HTN: tolerate SBP <170mmHg
   - wean labetalol gtt as tolerated given inability to tolerate PO
    >Hypoxemia: likely [**1-2**] appropriate volume resuscitation in the setting
   of pancreatitis complicated by splinting and atelectasis now concerning
   for evolution into ARDS.  Concern for progressive hypoxemia, he is at
   high risk for ARDS [**1-2**] pancreatitis. He responded well to diuresis
   yesterday and conts to respond well to BiPAP (marked improving
   oxygentation). Will hold today given rising serum sodium
   - Can use BiPAP intermittently if O2 requirement increases and gentle
   diuresis as needed (but following Na closely)
   - Trial diuresis (20 mg lasix ) with goal of negative 1L
   >EtOH withdrawl/Altered MS:  will follow closely for symptom
   development and work to control symptoms with combination therapy
   (benzos, haldol and potentially labet/clonidine as needed) will D/c
   narcotics for now. Will try to prioritize haldol use today. Alternate
   explanations for MS include: metabolic (see hypernatremia) and possible
   hepatic encephalopathy. For now will defer NG tube as this seems most
   likely to be a presentation consistent with EtOH withdrawl. If no
   improvement may need NG tube for lactulose.
   - monitor symptoms (CIWA)
   - aspiration precautions: HOB elevation
   - thiamine and folate

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis. The pancreatitis is most likely related to alcohol use. The patient had hypoxemia, which improved yesterday with diuresis. His lipase levels were initially elevated but have now normalized. The patient has been on maintenance fluid resuscitation with D5 and repletion of electrolytes. He is currently NPO and will need to have his sodium levels closely monitored. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection, pseudocyst formation, or abscess.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be closely monitored and managed with free water repletion.
3. Fever: The patient has low-grade fevers, and there is concern for aspiration pneumonia. Empiric coverage for ASP PNA with Vancomycin and Piperacillin-tazobactam has been started.
4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and the goal is to maintain a systolic blood pressure below 170 mmHg. Labetalol will be weaned as tolerated.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient initially had hypoxemia due to hypoventilation and atelectasis. BiPAP has been effective in improving oxygenation, but further monitoring is needed, especially considering the risk of developing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HCV and alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis likely due to acute alcohol ingestion. The patient's course is notable for hypoxia requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIMV)/BIPAP, altered mental status, and hypertension. The patient's pancreatitis score has worsened from 3 to 4 within 48 hours post presentation, indicating a clinically suboptimal prognosis. The patient's lipase levels have improved today to 103.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient required NIMV/BIPAP due to hypoxia. This indicates respiratory distress or impaired gas exchange. The patient's SpO2 is maintained at 96%, but there is a risk of worsening hypoxia if respiratory support is discontinued.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient has received aggressive intravenous fluid repletion, which may lead to fluid overload. The patient's total fluid input is 4,537 mL, while the total fluid output is 2,207 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 1,330 mL. This could contribute to pulmonary edema and further respiratory compromise.

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's fluid overload and respiratory distress, there is a possibility of developing ARDS. The patient's chest X-ray is planned to be done every morning to monitor for any signs of infiltrates.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis. The patient has been experiencing tachypnea and required non-invasive ventilation, which was later switched to bipap and then to a facemask overnight. The patient continues to withdraw with high benzodiazepine (benzo) and haloperidol (Haldol) requirements, showing intermittent agitation in bed. A re-site of arterial line over wire was performed, and blood pressures are being controlled with labetalol bolus due to poor IV access. A second peripheral IV was placed overnight.

The patient's allergies include codeine and unknown. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2106-10-6**]. Infusions include morphine sulfate, pantoprazole (Protonix), haloperidol (Haldol), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), lorazepam (Ativan), labetalol, diazepam (Valium), and others.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. Flow sheet data shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also noted. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula and receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 478 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis likely due to acute alcohol ingestion. The patient's course is notable for hypoxia requiring non-invasive ventilation, altered mental status, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's condition is complicated by acute pancreatitis, which can lead to pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation if not managed properly.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for non-invasive ventilation indicate a risk for further respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the patient's significant alcohol abuse history and recent cessation, there is a high risk for alcohol withdrawal symptoms including delirium tremens (DTs) and seizures. Appropriate management with thiamine, folate, benzodiazepines, and close monitoring is crucial.

4. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressure requires careful management with antihypertensive medications like labetalol to prevent complications such as intracranial hemorrhage.

5. Altered mental status: The patient's confusion and agitation could be attributed to multiple factors including alcohol withdrawal, hepatic encephalopathy, or direct effects of pancreatitis. Further evaluation and management are necessary to optimize mental status and prevent complications like falls or pressure ulcers.

6. Fever of unknown origin: The patient's elevated temperature"

   - strict NPO
   - d/c IVFs, as significantly overloaded
   - insulin, keep glucoses <150
   - pain control - ?having abdominal pain (has said
 to question
   this morning); will assess before admin narcotics.

   splinting.
   - NIPPV prn
   - positioning key
 keep upright due to large abdominal size and
   splinting
   - cxr QAM
   - minimize morphine; try to minimize respiratory suppressants
   - Lasix 20 IV today and stop fluids; CXR more overloaded and
   significantly positive.
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES). Last

   - BP control with labetalol
   # altered mental status
 likely from above, but note question of
   cirrhosis hx and possible contribution of encephalopathy to clinical

   -          Hold morphine; minimize benzos as possible
   -          Consider NGT placement and lactulose (holding off for right
   now, as would interfere with bipap seal if this is needed today)
   -          Consider head CT if persists, though nonfocal exam and no
   clear risk factors for a bleed.
 HYPERTENSION
   -          IV labetalol gtt while NPO.  Treatment of pain and
   withdrawal.

   -          f/u cultures
   -          CXR without infiltrate, but certainly at risk for
   aspiration.
   -          Consider reimaging of pancreas to evaluate for
   worsening/necrosis, could consider prophylactic antibiotic coverage if
   evidence of >30% necrosis of pancreas.  Otherwise, little role for

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis likely caused by acute alcohol ingestion. The patient's medical history includes hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. The patient's course has been notable for hypoxia requiring non-invasive ventilation, altered mental status, and hypertension.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/60 mmHg to 204/126 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count. Liver enzymes such as ALT and AST are elevated, while bilirubin levels are within normal range. Amylase and lipase levels are significantly elevated, suggesting acute pancreatitis. Electrolyte levels including sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are within normal limits. Blood glucose levels are elevated.

The patient's chest X-ray shows no infiltrates but is positive for fluid overload. An arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory alkalosis with a pH of 7.44 and slightly low carbon dioxide levels. Other lab results show elevated lactic acid levels and slightly low albumin levels.

The patient has been started on strict nothing-by-mouth status, insulin to control blood glucose levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o male with hist of Hep C and heavy EtOH abuse admitted with acute
   pancreatitis (most likely ETOH related) with lipase of 3000 at OSH,
   hypoxemia (secondary to hypoventilation/ atelectasis ) which improved
   yesterday with diuresis
     >Pancreatitis: likely EtOH related, stranding seen on CT scan at OSH
   but no evidence of abscess/pseudocyst.. Notably he has nl
   triglycerides. Lipase values now normalized.
   - maintenance fluid resus with D5 (given hypernatremia) and repletion
   of lytes (decreasing fluids given vol overload) will need to follow Na
   closely
   - NPO for now
   - hold on opiates for now.
   - tight SSI
   > Hypernatremia: will need to increase his  free water repletion (D5),
   will calc the free water deficit
   >Fever: Conts low grade fevers, no new clx data, WBC stable, no new
   infiltrate on [**10-7**], lipase normalizing. Will empirically cover for asp
   PNA with Vanco and Pip-Tazo (empiric for now x 48 hrs)
   - repeat LFTs
   >HTN: tolerate SBP <170mmHg
   - wean labetalol gtt as tolerated given inability to tolerate PO
    >Hypoxemia: likely [**1-2**] appropriate volume resuscitation in the setting
   of pancreatitis complicated by splinting and atelectasis now concerning
   for evolution into ARDS.  Concern for progressive hypoxemia, he is at
   high risk for ARDS [**1-2**] pancreatitis. He responded well to diuresis
   yesterday and conts to respond well to BiPAP (marked improving
   oxygentation). Will hold today given rising serum sodium
   - Can use BiPAP intermittently if O2 requirement increases and gentle
   diuresis as needed (but following Na closely)
   - Trial diuresis (20 mg lasix ) with goal of negative 1L
   >EtOH withdrawl/Altered MS:  will follow closely for symptom
   development and work to control symptoms with combination therapy
   (benzos, haldol and potentially labet/clonidine as needed) will D/c
   narcotics for now. Will try to prioritize haldol use today. Alternate
   explanations for MS include: metabolic (see hypernatremia) and possible
   hepatic encephalopathy. For now will defer NG tube as this seems most
   likely to be a presentation consistent with EtOH withdrawl. If no
   improvement may need NG tube for lactulose.
   - monitor symptoms (CIWA)
   - aspiration precautions: HOB elevation

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis, likely related to alcohol use. He presented with hypoxemia secondary to hypoventilation and atelectasis, which improved yesterday with diuresis. His lipase values were initially elevated but have now normalized. The patient has hypernatremia, which requires careful fluid management. He also has a fever, and empirical coverage for aspiration pneumonia has been started with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. The patient's blood pressure is high, and the plan is to wean off Labetalol if tolerated. The patient's hypoxemia is being managed with BiPAP, and diuretics are being used cautiously to avoid exacerbating hypernatremia. There are concerns about the potential development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient is at risk for ethanol withdrawal and altered mental status, which may be due to metabolic causes or hepatic encephalopathy. Close monitoring is necessary, and treatment for ethanol withdrawal is being initiated. Aspiration precautions are in place, and the patient is on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o male with hist of Hep C and heavy EtOH abuse admitted with acute
   pancreatitis (most likely ETOH related) with lipase of 3000 at OSH,
   hypoxemia (secondary to hypoventilation/ atelectasis ) which improved
   yesterday with diuresis
     >Pancreatitis: likely EtOH related, stranding seen on CT scan at OSH
   but no evidence of abscess/pseudocyst.. Notably he has nl
   triglycerides. Lipase values now normalized.
   - maintenance fluid resus with D5 (given hypernatremia) and repletion
   of lytes (decreasing fluids given vol overload) will need to follow Na
   closely
   - NPO for now
   - hold on opiates for now.
   - tight SSI
   > Hypernatremia: will need to increase his  free water repletion (D5),
   will calc the free water deficit
   >Fever: Conts low grade fevers, no new clx data, WBC stable, no new
   infiltrate on [**10-7**], lipase normalizing. Will empirically cover for asp
   PNA with Vanco and Pip-Tazo (empiric for now x 48 hrs)
   - repeat LFTs
   >HTN: tolerate SBP <170mmHg
   - wean labetalol gtt as tolerated given inability to tolerate PO
    >Hypoxemia: likely [**1-2**] appropriate volume resuscitation in the setting
   of pancreatitis complicated by splinting and atelectasis now concerning
   for evolution into ARDS.  Concern for progressive hypoxemia, he is at
   high risk for ARDS [**1-2**] pancreatitis. He responded well to diuresis
   yesterday and conts to respond well to BiPAP (marked improving
   oxygentation). Will hold today given rising serum sodium
   - Can use BiPAP intermittently if O2 requirement increases and gentle
   diuresis as needed (but following Na closely)
   - Trial diuresis (20 mg lasix ) with goal of negative 1L
   >EtOH withdrawl/Altered MS:  will follow closely for symptom
   development and work to control symptoms with combination therapy
   (benzos, haldol and potentially labet/clonidine as needed) will D/c
   narcotics for now. Will try to prioritize haldol use today. Alternate
   explanations for MS include: metabolic (see hypernatremia) and possible
   hepatic encephalopathy. For now will defer NG tube as this seems most
   likely to be a presentation consistent with EtOH withdrawl. If no
   improvement may need NG tube for lactulose.
   - monitor symptoms (CIWA)
   - aspiration precautions: HOB elevation
   - thiamine and folate

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis, most likely related to alcohol consumption. The patient has had episodes of hypoxemia secondary to hypoventilation and atelectasis but showed improvement with diuresis. He also has hypernatremia, likely due to dehydration, and his lipase levels have normalized.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemia and the presence of pancreatitis increase his risk for developing ARDS. Close monitoring of oxygenation and consideration of intermittent BiPAP use if oxygen requirements increase is recommended.

2. Infection: The patient has had a fever, and there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia (PNA) due to his altered mental status and possible ethanol withdrawal. Empiric coverage with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam has been initiated.

3. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating fluid overload. Careful monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent further fluid accumulation.

4. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient is at risk for ethanol withdrawal due to heavy alcohol abuse. Close monitoring for symptoms and administration of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics (such as Haloperidol), and potential use of clonidine or labetalol as needed are recommended."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o male with hist of Hep C and heavy EtOH abuse now with necrotic
   pancreatitis (most likely ETOH related) with lipase of 3000 at OSH,
   hypoxemia (secondary to hypoventilation/ atelectasis ) which has
   improved with NIPPV and diuresis.
   >Necrotic Pancreatitis: likely EtOH related, stranding seen on CT scan
   at OSH but no evidence of abscess/pseudocyst.. Notably he has nl
   triglycerides. Lipase values now normalized however with 3x3 cm area of
   necrosis on CT scan (no discrete fluid collection)
   - maintenance fluid resus with D5 (given hypernatremia) and repletion
   of lytes (decreasing fluids given vol overload) will need to follow Na
   closely
   - NPO for now. [**Month (only) 11**] need post pyloric feeding tube vs TPN
   - hold on opiates for now.
   - tight SSI
   - Surgery for management of necrosis
   - Empiric Abx.
   > Hypernatremia: following Na closely in the setting of volume status
   >Fever: Conts low grade fevers, no new clx data, WBC stable, no new
   infiltrate on [**10-7**], lipase normalizing, however necrosis visible on CT
   of the pancreas.
   -Will empirically cover for Vanco and Pip-Tazo
   - Surgery input for management of necrosis
   >HTN: tolerate SBP <170mmHg
   - wean labetalol gtt as tolerated given inability to tolerate PO
    >Hypoxemia: likely [**1-2**] appropriate volume resuscitation in the setting
   of pancreatitis complicated by splinting and atelectasis now concerning
   for evolution into ARDS.  Concern for progressive hypoxemia, he is at
   high risk for ARDS [**1-2**] pancreatitis. He responded well to diuresis
   yesterday and conts to respond well to BiPAP (marked improving
   oxygentation). Will hold today given rising serum sodium
   - Can use BiPAP intermittently if O2 requirement increases and gentle
   diuresis as needed (but following Na closely)
   - Trial diuresis (20 mg lasix ) with goal of negative 1L
   >EtOH withdrawl/Altered MS:  will follow closely for symptom
   development and work to control symptoms with combination therapy
   (benzos, haldol and potentially labet/clonidine as needed) will D/c
   narcotics for now.  Head CT reveal no intracranial process.
   - monitor symptoms (CIWA)

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient has a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse.
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with necrotic pancreatitis, likely related to alcohol use.
- Lipase levels have normalized, but there is a 3x3 cm area of necrosis on the CT scan.
- The patient is hypoxemic due to hypoventilation and atelectasis, which has improved with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).
- The patient requires diuresis to manage hypernatremia and fluid overload.
- The patient needs to be monitored for signs of alcohol withdrawal and will be managed with combination therapy.
- The patient has right upper lobe pneumonia and cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.
- The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient's CT scan reveals extensive pancreatitis, necrotic pancreas, peripancreatic inflammatory changes, and diverticulosis without acute diverticulitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is at high risk for developing ARDS due to pancreatitis and hypoxemia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and consideration of BiPAP use is advised.
2. Infection: Given the presence of necrotic pancreatitis, the patient is at risk for infection."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse admitted with acute pancreatitis. The patient's condition is likely related to alcohol use, as indicated by the high lipase levels of 3000 at the time of admission, which have since normalized. The patient also has hypoxemia secondary to hypoventilation and atelectasis, but this improved yesterday with diuresis.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient has extensive pancreatitis with necrosis visible on the CT scan. There is no evidence of abscess or pseudocyst at this time. The pancreatitis is most likely ethanol-related.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which requires close monitoring of sodium levels in the setting of volume status. The patient is receiving maintenance fluid resuscitation with D5 and repletion of electrolytes. Fluid intake and output should be closely monitored.

3. Fever: The patient has had low-grade fevers, but no new clinical data or infiltrate on the chest X-ray. The lipase values are normalizing, but necrosis is visible on the CT scan of the pancreas.

   pancreas, highly concerning for necrosis. Extensive peripancreatic
   inflammatory changes; however, no evidence of fluid collection at this
   time.
   2. Findings concerning for right upper lobe pneumonia.
   3. Cholelithiasis, no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
   4. Diverticulosis, no evidence of acute diverticulitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o male with hist of Hep C and heavy EtOH abuse now with necrotic
   pancreatitis (most likely ETOH related) with lipase of 3000 at OSH,
   hypoxemia (secondary to hypoventilation/ atelectasis ) which has
   improved with NIPPV and diuresis.
   >Necrotic Pancreatitis: likely EtOH related, stranding seen on CT scan
   at OSH but no evidence of abscess/pseudocyst.. Notably he has nl
   triglycerides. Lipase values now normalized however with 3x3 cm area of
   necrosis on CT scan (no discrete fluid collection)
   - maintenance fluid resus with D5 (given hypernatremia) and repletion
   of lytes (decreasing fluids given vol overload) will need to follow Na
   closely
   - NPO for now
   - hold on opiates for now.
   - tight SSI
   - Surgery for management of necrosis
   - Empiric Abx.
   > Hypernatremia: following Na closely in the setting of volume status
   >Fever: Conts low grade fevers, no new clx data, WBC stable, no new
   infiltrate on [**10-7**], lipase normalizing, however necrosis visible on CT
   of the pancreas.
   -Will empirically cover for Vanco and Pip-Tazo
   - Surgery input for management of necrosis
   >HTN: tolerate SBP <170mmHg
   - wean labetalol gtt as tolerated given inability to tolerate PO
    >Hypoxemia: likely [**1-2**] appropriate volume resuscitation in the setting
   of pancreatitis complicated by splinting and atelectasis now concerning
   for evolution into ARDS.  Concern for progressive hypoxemia, he is at
   high risk for ARDS [**1-2**] pancreatitis. He responded well to diuresis
   yesterday and conts to respond well to BiPAP (marked improving
   oxygentation). Will hold today given rising serum sodium
   - Can use BiPAP intermittently if O2 requirement increases and gentle
   diuresis as needed (but following Na closely)
   - Trial diuresis (20 mg lasix ) with goal of negative 1L
   >EtOH withdrawl/Altered MS:  will follow closely for symptom
   development and work to control symptoms with combination therapy
   (benzos, haldol and potentially labet/clonidine as needed) will D/c
   narcotics for now.  Head CT reveal no intracranial process.
   - monitor symptoms (CIWA)
   - aspiration precautions: HOB elevation
   - thiamine and folate
   - Qtc 474 on [**10-7**] ECG

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse. He is currently being treated for necrotic pancreatitis, likely related to alcohol consumption. The patient's lipase values have normalized, but there is a 3x3 cm area of necrosis on the CT scan. He also has hypoxemia due to hypoventilation and atelectasis, which has improved with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and diuresis.

The patient is also experiencing hypernatremia, fever, hypertension, and potential ethanol withdrawal with altered mental status. His vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 101.4°F
- Heart rate: 82 bpm

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/oM with h/o HCV and Alcohol abuse, admitted with acute
   pancreatitis likely from acute EtOH ingestion.  Course additionally
   notable for hypoxia requiring NIMV/BIPAP, altered mental status, and
   hypertension.
   # PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
 elevated [**Last Name (un) 1840**] scores on admit/48hrs, likely
   [**1-2**] ethanol, lipase now improved, +pancreatic necrosis on CT.
    Ultimately need nutrition, but respiratory and mental status limit
   placement of NGT currently.
   - hold on IVF, given recent fluid overload
   - NPO today with IV meds, plan to transition to NGT, possibly Pos [**10-9**]
   - insulin, keep glucoses <150
   # FEVER
 [**10-7**] and [**10-8**] T rise to 101, pan cultures, cxs(-),
   presumptive necrotic pancreatitis, ?developing RUL infiltrate.
   Vanco/Zosyn started [**10-8**], with plan for 10d course.
   - f/u cultures
   - CIS >101, including sputum and urine (to assess for alternative
   sources of fever)
   # HYPOXIA
 fluid overload [**1-2**] resuscitation, ARDS possible,
   splinting.
   - NIPPV prn
   - positioning key
 keep upright due to large abdominal size and
   splinting
   - cxr QAM
   - minimize morphine; try to minimize respiratory suppressants
   - Lasix 20 IV today and stop fluids; CXR more overloaded and
   significantly positive.
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES). Last
   drink [**10-1**] or [**10-2**].  Also hypertensive and intermittently agitated.
   - NPO
   - thiamine, folate
   - haldol prn for hallucinations and agitation. Daily ECG.
   - Diazepam on ciwa scale, keep to minimum to optimize mental status
   - BP control with labetalol
   # altered mental status
 likely from above, but note question of
   cirrhosis hx and possible contribution of encephalopathy to clinical
   picture.  Labs, exam, and wet read of U/S does not support chronic
   liver dz, but possible.  Ammonia 53.
   -          Hold morphine; minimize benzos as possible
   -          Consider NGT placement and lactulose (holding off for right
   now, as would interfere with bipap seal if this is needed today)
   -          Consider head CT if persists, though nonfocal exam and no
   clear risk factors for a bleed.
 HYPERTENSION
   -          IV labetalol gtt while NPO.  Treatment of pain and
   withdrawal.
   -          CXR without infiltrate, but certainly at risk for
   aspiration.
   -          Consider reimaging of pancreas to evaluate for
   worsening/necrosis, could consider prophylactic antibiotic coverage if
   evidence of >30% necrosis of pancreas.  Otherwise, little role for
   prophylactic antibiotic therapy.

   splinting
   - cxr QAM
   - minimize morphine; try to minimize respiratory suppressants
   - Lasix 20 IV today and stop fluids; CXR more overloaded and
   significantly positive.
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES). Last
   drink [**10-1**] or [**10-2**].  Also hypertensive and intermittently agitated.

   - Diazepam on ciwa scale, keep to minimum to optimize mental status
   - BP control with labetalol
   # altered mental status
 likely from above, but note question of
   cirrhosis hx and possible contribution of encephalopathy to clinical
   picture.  Labs, exam, and wet read of U/S does not support chronic
   liver dz, but possible.  Ammonia 53.
   -          Hold morphine; minimize benzos as possible
   -          Consider NGT placement and lactulose (holding off for right
   now, as would interfere with bipap seal if this is needed today)
   -          Consider head CT if persists, though nonfocal exam and no
   clear risk factors for a bleed.
 HYPERTENSION
   -          IV labetalol gtt while NPO.  Treatment of pain and
   withdrawal.

   -          CXR without infiltrate, but certainly at risk for
   aspiration.
   -          Consider reimaging of pancreas to evaluate for
   worsening/necrosis, could consider prophylactic antibiotic coverage if
   evidence of >30% necrosis of pancreas.  Otherwise, little role for

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis likely due to acute ethanol ingestion. The patient's course has been notable for hypoxia requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIMV) / bipap, altered mental status, and hypertension.

The patient's pancreatitis score was initially 3 on admission and has now increased to 4. The lipase levels have improved from yesterday but are still elevated. The patient is advised to remain NPO (nothing by mouth), and IV fluids should be discontinued due to fluid overload. Insulin will be given to keep glucose levels below 150 mg/dL. Pain control will be assessed before administering narcotics.

The patient is also diagnosed with hypoxia, which may be due to fluid overload and the possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation) will be used as needed, and the patient should be positioned upright due to large abdominal size and splinting. A chest X-ray will be performed daily, and morphine use will be minimized to avoid respiratory suppression. Lasix 20 IV will be administered today, along with stopping fluids, and a chest X-ray will be done to assess for fluid overload.

There is also a concern for alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens (DTs) and seizures. The patient's last drink was either [**10-1**] or [**10-2**]. Management will include NPO, thiamine, folate, and daily ECG monitoring. Diazepam will be used based on the CIWA scale, keeping it to a minimum to optimize mental status. Labetalol will be used for blood pressure control.

The patient's altered mental status may be due to various factors such as alcohol withdrawal, possible cirrhosis history, and encephalopathy. Ammonia levels are elevated at 53, so lactulose may be considered if the patient develops encephalopathy. A head CT may be performed if the altered mental status persists, although the physical examination and initial imaging do not show any clear risk factors for bleeding.

The patient is also hypertensive, and IV labetalol will be administered while the patient is NPO. Pain management and withdrawal treatment will be provided.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is present, with a temperature spike to 100.8 yesterday. Cultures will be followed up, and a chest X-ray will be done to rule out aspiration. Imaging of the pancreas may be repeated to evaluate for worsening or necrosis, and prophylactic antibiotic coverage may be considered if there is evidence of >30% necrosis of the pancreas.

In terms of ICU care, the patient will receive nutrition support, strict glycemic control, and appropriate line management. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. He was admitted with acute pancreatitis likely caused by acute ethanol ingestion. The patient's course has been notable for hypoxia requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIMV) or bipap, altered mental status, and hypertension.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, which is a serious condition that can lead to complications such as infection, necrosis, and organ failure.

2. Respiratory issues: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to hypoxia and the need for NIMV or bipap. There is a possibility of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to fluid overload and splinting.

3. Infection: The patient has developed a fever on two occasions, and cultures have been obtained to identify the source of infection. The preliminary CT scan shows a possible right upper lobe infiltrate, suggesting a lung infection. The patient has also been started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for a presumed necrotizing pancreatitis and potential lung infection.

4. Alcohol withdrawal/hypertension: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and has shown signs of withdrawal and intermittent hypertension. He will be closely monitored for symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and hypertension.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. He was admitted with acute pancreatitis likely due to acute ethanol ingestion. The patient's course has been notable for hypoxia requiring noninvasive mechanical ventilation/biPAP, altered mental status, and hypertension.

The patient's current assessment includes pancreatitis, fever, hypoxia, and possible developing right upper lobe infiltrate. The plan includes holding on intravenous fluids due to recent fluid overload, transitioning to nasogastric tube (NGT) possibly per oral (PO) on [**10-9**], insulin to keep glucose levels below 150, and consulting surgery for assistance with necrotizing pancreatitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's hypoxia and possible development of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) pose a risk for respiratory complications. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory status is essential.

2. Infection: The patient's fever and developing right upper lobe infiltrate raise concerns about possible infections, such as pneumonia. Appropriate cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

3. Pancreatitis complications: The patient's pancreatitis has led to pancreatic necrosis. Surgical consultation has been sought for assistance with necrotizing pancreatitis. Complications such as pancreatic pseudocysts or abscesses may develop.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. The patient has been experiencing fever and tachycardia. Surgery recommended feeding with clears as soon as the patient is able, but if unable to take POs for a few more days, they would recommend TPN. They also recommended a follow-up MRCP in 1-3 weeks to evaluate pancreatic duct. The patient is more alert and complaining of pain, so morphine 2 mg x 2 was given. The patient remained off bipap. Allergies include codeine and unknown. The last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 10/7/2106 at 04:47 PM, Vancomycin on 10/8/2106 at 08:56 AM, and Piperacillin on 10/8/2106 at 11:37 PM. The patient is currently receiving various medications including Diazepam (Valium), Morphine Sulfate, Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis), and Pantoprazole (Protonix). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 167/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis likely due to acute ethanol ingestion. The patient's course has been notable for hypoxia requiring noninvasive ventilation, altered mental status, and hypertension. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated amylase scores on admission and 48 hours later, indicating acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic necrosis was also observed on CT scan.
2. Fever: The patient experienced fevers on [10-7] and [10-8], with temperatures rising to 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Cultures were taken from the pancreas, chest X-ray, and other sites to identify the cause of the fever. Presumptive necrotic pancreatitis and a possible developing right upper lobe infiltrate were considered. Antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) were started for a 10-day course.
3. Hypoxia: The patient initially required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) due to fluid overload and potential acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the patient's mental status is improving, and NIPPV is no longer required. Chest X-rays will be monitored regularly.
4. Alcohol Withdrawal/Hypertension: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and last drank on [10-2]. Intermittent hypertension and agitation have been observed. The goal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse, now presenting with necrotic pancreatitis (likely alcohol-related) and hypoxemia (secondary to hypoventilation/atelectasis). He has improved with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and diuresis. There is no evidence of abscess or pseudocyst. He has a 3x3 cm area of necrosis on the CT scan but no discrete fluid collection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Necrotic Pancreatitis: The patient has necrotic pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection, abscess formation, and pseudocyst development. Surgical intervention may be required for the management of necrosis.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient is experiencing hypernatremia, which requires close monitoring of sodium levels in the setting of volume status. Repletion of electrolytes and maintenance fluid resuscitation with D5 will be necessary.
3. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers despite no new clinical findings or changes in laboratory values. Possible causes include drug fever, DVT, or respiratory infection. Empiric antibiotic coverage is being provided.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to hypoventilation and atelectasis, potentially evolving into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Close monitoring of oxygen requirements and intermittent use of Bi"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse. He has necrotic pancreatitis, likely related to alcohol use, with lipase levels of 3000 at OSH. The patient also has hypoxemia due to hypoventilation and atelectasis, which has improved with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and diuresis. His course has been complicated by ethanol withdrawal, which is slowly clearing. 

The patient's condition is assessed as follows:
1. Necrotic Pancreatitis: The patient has evidence of necrosis on CT scan, but no surgical options for now.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are high, requiring close monitoring and management.

   triglycerides. Has a  3x3 cm area of necrosis on CT scan (no discrete
   fluid collection)
   - maintenance fluid resus with D5 (given hypernatremia) and repletion
   of lytes (decreasing fluids given vol overload) will need to follow Na
   closely
   - Will place NG tube. Also initiate lactulose (to reverse whatever
   component of this may be encephalopathiic)
   - hold on opiates for now.
   - tight SSI
   - Surgery for management of necrosis
   - Empiric Abx.
   - Check lipase in AM.
    > Hypernatremia: following Na closely in the setting of volume status
   - follow other lytes closely
   >Fever: Conts fevers, no new clx data, WBC stable, no new infiltrate on

   pancreas.  CT scan of chest ? RUL PNA.  Also with a maxillary sinusitis
   which is being conservatively treated. Currently on empiric coverage.
   Other possibilities include drug fever (but no eos/rash), DVT (no
   asymmetric swelling, may need to consider lower dopplers) and
   gallbladder with cholelithiasis on recent CT scan but alk phos OK.
   -Will empirically cover for Vanco and Pip-Tazo

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse, who is now experiencing necrotic pancreatitis, most likely related to alcohol use. He has an elevated lipase level of 3000 at OSH and hypoxemia secondary to hypoventilation and atelectasis, which has improved with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and diuresis. The patient has a 3x3 cm area of necrosis on CT scan without evidence of abscess or pseudocyst. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Necrotic Pancreatitis: The patient's necrotic pancreatitis is likely related to alcohol abuse. Close monitoring and management are required, including maintenance fluid resuscitation, repletion of electrolytes, placement of a nasogastric tube, initiation of lactulose, holding opiates, tight source control, consideration of surgery for management of necrosis, and empirical antibiotic coverage.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which requires close follow-up of sodium levels in the setting of volume status. Fluid resuscitation with D5 (due to hypernatremia) and repletion of electrolytes (decreasing fluids given volume overload) should be done cautiously.

3. Fever: The patient's fever may be due to various causes, including infection, drug fever, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or gallbladder issues"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis likely caused by acute ethanol ingestion. The patient has also experienced hypoxia requiring non-invasive ventilation/bipap, altered mental status, and hypertension. Laboratory results show elevated amylase levels and pancreatic necrosis on CT scan. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, possibly due to developing right upper lobe infiltrate, and fluid overload with a possibility of ARDS. The patient has also shown signs of alcohol withdrawal/hypertension, altered mental status, and potential encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms and elevated amylase levels indicate acute pancreatitis. Complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or pseudocyst may arise.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory support and the need for non-invasive ventilation/bipap suggest respiratory distress. Complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may develop.

3. Fever: The patient's fever could be due to developing right upper lobe infiltrate, indicating a possible lung infection. Complications such as pneumonia or sepsis may arise.

4. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, suggesting fluid overload. Complications such as acute kidney injury or pulmonary edema may occur.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HCV and alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis likely caused by acute ethanol ingestion. The patient has experienced hypoxia requiring NIPPV/BIPAP, altered mental status, and hypertension. The patient's lipase levels have improved, and there is evidence of pancreatic necrosis on CT scan. The patient has been unable to tolerate nasogastric tube feeds and is currently NPO. Surgery is being considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's condition suggests acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, pseudocysts, or systemic complications like sepsis.
2. Infection: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count indicates a possible infection, which could be due to necrotic pancreatitis or another source. This increases the risk of sepsis and organ failure.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient initially required NIPPV/BIPAP due to hypoxia, indicating respiratory distress. There is a possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse. He was admitted with necrotic pancreatitis, most likely related to alcohol use, and has a lipase level of 3000 at OSH. The patient also has hypoxemia due to hypoventilation and atelectasis, which has improved with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and diuresis. Additionally, the patient experienced EtOH withdrawal, which has slowly been clearing. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Necrotic Pancreatitis: The patient has likely alcohol-related necrotic pancreatitis, with stranding seen on CT scan at OSH. No evidence of abscess or pseudocyst is present. Surgical options are not available at this time.
   - Maintain fluid resuscitation with D5 (due to hypernatremia) and repletion of electrolytes (decreasing fluids given volume overload).
   - Switch to free water after nasogastric (NG) tube placement.
   - Initiate lactulose to reverse any encephalopathic component.
   - Hold opiates for now.
   - Tight sepsis prevention.
   - Consider surgery for management of necrosis.
   - Empiric antibiotic coverage.
   - Check lipase in the morning.

2. Hypernatremia: Follow sodium levels closely in the setting of volume status and other electrolytes.
   - Continue monitoring and"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse, presenting with necrotic pancreatitis. He has been treated with NIPPV (noninvasive positive pressure ventilation) and diuresis for hypoxemia secondary to hypoventilation/atelectasis. The patient also has ethanol withdrawal, which has slowly been clearing.

Assessment and plan:
1. Necrotic Pancreatitis: likely EtOH related, stranding seen on CT scan at OSH but no evidence of abscess/pseudocyst. Now has a 3x3 cm area of necrosis on CT scan (no discrete fluid collection) and no surgical options for now. Lipase was okay after briefly getting tube feeds on [**10-9**].
   - maintenance fluid resus with D5 (given hypernatremia) and repletion of lytes (decreasing fluids given vol overload) will need to follow Na closely. Change to free water after NG tube.
   - Will RE-place NG tube if his MS does not improve. Cont lactulose (to reverse whatever component of this may be encephalopathiic)
   - hold on opiates for now.
   - tight SSI
   - Empiric Abx.
   - Check lipase in AM.

2. Hypernatremia: following Na closely in the setting of volume status - follow other lytes closely.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse, now presenting with necrotic pancreatitis likely related to alcohol use. The patient's condition has been complicated by ethanol withdrawal, hypoxemia secondary to hypoventilation and atelectasis, and hypernatremia. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, lipase, and troponin T. The patient also has an elevated blood glucose level and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Necrotic Pancreatitis: The patient has necrotic pancreatitis with an area of necrosis on the CT scan. This condition can lead to complications such as infection, abscess formation, and pseudocyst development.
2. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of ethanol withdrawal, which can cause symptoms like agitation, tremors, seizures, and hallucinations.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation may indicate respiratory distress or inadequate oxygen delivery to the tissues.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
5. Infection: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count suggests the possibility of an infection. Clostridium difficile toxin test is pending.
6. Venous Thromboembolism (DVT):"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse. He was admitted with necrotic pancreatitis, most likely related to alcohol use, as indicated by a lipase level of 3000 at the time of admission. He also has hypoxemia due to hypoventilation and atelectasis, which has improved with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and diuresis. The patient's course has been complicated by ethanol withdrawal, which is slowly clearing. 

The patient has a 3x3 cm area of necrosis on CT scan, but no surgical options are available at present. His lipase level was okay after briefly receiving tube feeds on [10-9]. 

The plan includes maintaining fluid resuscitation with D5 (due to hypernatremia) and repletion of electrolytes (decreasing fluids given volume overload). The patient will be monitored closely for sodium levels. The NG tube will be replaced if there is no improvement in mental status. Lactulose will be continued to reverse any encephalopathic component. Opiates will be held. Strict sepsis surveillance will be maintained, along with empiric antibiotic coverage. Lipase levels will be checked in the morning. 

The patient also has hypernatremia, fever, right upper lobe pneumonia (RUL PNA), and left maxillary sinusitis. These conditions are being treated conservatively. The"

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 655**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1130**], whose note reflects my
   input.  I would add/emphasize that this 57-year-old man with
   pancreatitis, alcohol withdrawal, and respiratory distress has ongoing
   low-grade fevers and substantial leucocytosis (to 17).  On exam, he is
   now more oriented.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.
   Main issue is whether his fevers represent infected pancreatic
   necrosis.  Although he is at the right time course for this, his
   clinical picture seems to be improving.  We will continue antibiotics
   for now.  Repeat CT in next day or so if fevers and leucocytosis
   persist.  Would consider FNA to exclude infected necrosis if area
   persists on imaging.
   Other issues as per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1130**]
s note.
   He is critically ill.  30 minutes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse, who is now presenting with necrotic pancreatitis, likely related to alcohol consumption. He also has hypoxemia secondary to hypoventilation and atelectasis, which has improved with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and diuresis. The patient's course has been complicated by ethanol withdrawal, which is slowly clearing. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infected pancreatic necrosis: The patient's ongoing low-grade fevers and substantial leukocytosis suggest the possibility of infected pancreatic necrosis. This is a serious complication that may require further interventions such as repeat CT imaging and/or fine-needle aspiration (FNA) to exclude infected necrosis.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoventilation/atelectasis could lead to worsening hypoxemia, requiring close monitoring and continued use of NIPPV as needed.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, necessitating careful fluid management and repletion of electrolytes.
4. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient's symptoms of altered mental status and agitation may be attributed to ethanol withdrawal, which should be managed with appropriate medications and monitoring of withdrawal symptoms using the CIWA scale.
5. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's altered mental status and risk factors, there is a possibility of aspiration leading to pneumonia, warranting aspiration precautions"

   57 y/o male with hist of Hep C and heavy EtOH abuse now with necrotic
   pancreatitis (most likely ETOH related) with lipase of 3000 at OSH,
   hypoxemia (secondary to hypoventilation/ atelectasis ) which has
   improved with NIPPV and diuresis. His course has also been complicated
   by EtOH withdrawl which has slowly been clearing.
     >Necrotic Pancreatitis: likely EtOH related, stranding seen on CT
   scan at OSH but no evidence of abscess/pseudocyst.. Now  has a  3x3 cm
   area of necrosis on CT scan (no discrete fluid collection) and no
   surgical options for now.  Lipase was OK after briefly getting tubes
   feeds on [**10-9**].
   - maintenance fluid resus with D5 (given hypernatremia) and repletion
   of lytes (decreasing fluids given vol overload) will need to follow Na
   closely. Change to free water after NG tube.
   - Will RE-place NG tube if his MS does not improve. Cont lactulose (to
   reverse whatever component of this may be encephalopathiic)
   - hold on opiates for now.
   - tight SSI
   - Empiric Abx.
   - Check lipase in AM.
    > Hypernatremia: following Na closely in the setting of volume status
   - follow other lytes closely
   >Fever: Conts fevers, no new clx data, WBC stable, no new infiltrate on
   [**10-7**], lipase normalizing, however necrosis visible on CT of the
   pancreas.  CT scan of chest ? RUL PNA.  Also with a left maxillary
   sinusitis which is being conservatively treated. Currently on empiric
   coverage. Other possibilities include drug fever (but no eos/rash), DVT
   (no asymmetric swelling) and gallbladder with cholelithiasis on recent
   CT scan but alk phos OK.
   -Will cont Vanco and Pip-Tazo
   - check c. dif (pending)
   - cont to culture for spikes
   -Check lower ext U/S for DVT.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need to have pancreas imaged again (? Evolving necrosis in the
   pancreas with abscess formation)
    >HTN: tolerate SBP <170mmHg
   - wean labetalol gtt as tolerated and switch to PO post NG tube
   placement.
    >Hypoxemia: likely [**1-2**] appropriate volume resuscitation in the setting
   of pancreatitis complicated by splinting and atelectasis.  He conts to
   improve over the past 48 hrs with no BiPAP requirement at present.
   - Can use BiPAP intermittently if O2 requirement increases and gentle
   diuresis as needed (but following Na closely)
   - Cont to favor gently net negative fluid balance
    >EtOH withdrawl/Altered MS: slowly improving from a withdrawl
   perspective over the last two days. Now alert and oriented x 2.
   - monitor symptoms (CIWA). Low dose standing standing olanzapine

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and heavy alcohol abuse, presenting with necrotic pancreatitis (likely ethanol-related) and hypoxemia secondary to hypoventilation/atelectasis. The patient's course has also been complicated by ethanol withdrawal, which has slowly been clearing. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has a risk of developing infections due to necrotic pancreatitis and prolonged hospitalization. This may manifest as fever, worsening of symptoms, or positive cultures.
2. Abscess formation: There is a possibility of abscess formation in the pancreas, especially if the necrotic area becomes infected.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient does not exhibit any signs of asymmetric swelling, it is still important to rule out DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU.
4. Gallbladder issues: The presence of cholelithiasis on the recent CT scan increases the risk of gallbladder-related complications such as cholecystitis.
5. Respiratory issues: The patient's hypoxemia may worsen if there is further atelectasis or development of pneumonia.
6. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms: The patient's altered mental status may indicate ongoing ethanol withdrawal, which requires careful monitoring and management.
7. Hepatic encephalopathy: The use of lactulose is aimed at reversing any component of hepatic en"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o male with hist of Hep C and heavy EtOH abuse now with necrotic
   pancreatitis (most likely ETOH related) with lipase of 3000 at OSH,
   hypoxemia (secondary to hypoventilation/ atelectasis ) which has
   improved with NIPPV and diuresis. His course has also been complicated
   by EtOH withdrawl which has slowly been clearing.
     >Necrotic Pancreatitis: likely EtOH related, stranding seen on CT
   scan at OSH but no evidence of abscess/pseudocyst.. Now  has a  3x3 cm
   area of necrosis on CT scan (no discrete fluid collection) and no
   surgical options for now.  Lipase was OK after briefly getting tubes
   feeds on [**10-9**].
   - maintenance fluid resus with D5 (given hypernatremia) and repletion
   of lytes (decreasing fluids given vol overload) will need to follow Na
   closely. Change to free water after NG tube.
   - tight SSI
   - Empiric Abx.
   >Fever: Conts fevers, no new clx data, WBC stable, no new infiltrate on
   [**10-7**], lipase normalizing, however necrosis visible on CT of the
   pancreas.  CT scan of chest ? RUL PNA.  Also with a left maxillary
   sinusitis which is being conservatively treated. Currently on empiric
   coverage. Other possibilities include drug fever (but no eos/rash), DVT
   (no asymmetric swelling) and gallbladder with cholelithiasis on recent
   CT scan but alk phos OK.  Now with new right knee pain, unable to
   extend. Concerning for joint effusion/infection. This could be gout or
   it could also be infected. We will need to perform a joint effusion.
   - Arthrocentesis of the right knee and evaluate for gout vs infection.
   -Will cont Vanco and Pip-Tazo
   - Repeat CT scan of the abd with pancreatic protocol.
   - check c. dif (pending)
   - cont to culture for spikes
   -Check lower ext U/S for DVT.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need to have pancreas imaged again (? Evolving necrosis in the
   pancreas with abscess formation)
    >HTN: tolerate SBP <170mmHg
   - wean labetalol gtt as tolerated and switch to PO post NG tube
   placement.
    >Hypoxemia: likely [**1-2**] appropriate volume resuscitation in the setting
   of pancreatitis complicated by splinting and atelectasis.  He conts to
   improve over the past 48 hrs with no BiPAP requirement at present.
   - Can use BiPAP intermittently if O2 requirement increases and gentle
   diuresis as needed (but following Na closely)
   - Cont to favor gently net negative fluid balance
    >EtOH withdrawl/Altered MS: slowly improving from a withdrawl
   perspective over the last two days. Now alert and oriented x 2.
   - monitor symptoms (CIWA). Low dose standing standing olanzapine
   - initiate lactulose, we will trial PO and if he can not take re-place
   NG (on the right side).
   - aspiration precautions: HOB elevation
   - thiamine and folate
   - lytes repletion

 elevated [**Last Name (un) 1840**] scores on admit/48hrs, likely
   [**1-2**] ethanol, lipase now improved, +pancreatic necrosis on CT.
   NGT placement briefly for nutrition, now out and NPO.  Surgery
   following.
   - replace NGT if not swallowing safely; if okay taking PO then will not
   need.
   - insulin, keep glucoses <150
   # FEVER
 [**10-7**] and [**10-8**] T rise to 101, pan cultures, cxs(-),
   presumptive necrotic pancreatitis. Chest film looks clear but of
   infiltrate on past chest CT.  Vanco/Zosyn started [**10-8**], with plan for
   10d course.  Diff with no eos to suggest drug fever, all culture data
   (-), has been on hep sq so dvt less likely.  Other possibilities
   include cholecystitis (less likely with normal AP, bili downtrending),
   sinusitis (left maxillary opacification of head CT).
   - f/u cultures
   - cont vanco, zosyn for 10d course [**10-16**]
   - CIS >101, including sputum and urine (to assess for alternative
   sources of fever)
   - Will check LENIs today.
   - Afrin and nasal saline for sinusitis.
   - consider reimage abdomen if continues to spike high temps.
   # HYPOXIA
 fluid overload [**1-2**] resuscitation, ARDS possible,
   splinting.  Now not requiring NIPPV as mental status improving.
   -          minimize respiratory suppressants.
   -          Diurese with goal negative 500-1 L today.
   # ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL/HYPERTENSION - last drink [**10-2**], intermittent htn
   and agitation, as previously noted.  Trying to minimize sedating meds
   and benzos,  with goal to improve mental status and preclude need for
   Bipap.
   - PO olanzipine [**Hospital1 **] small dose (perhaps change to nighttime only dose)
   - PRN valium
   - BP control with PO labetalol
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS - likely from above, with possible cirrhosis,
   encephalopathy.  CT head (-).
   - hold sedating meds

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of HCV and alcohol abuse, admitted with acute pancreatitis likely due to acute ethanol ingestion. The patient's course has been notable for hypoxia requiring NIMV/BIPAP, altered mental status, and hypertension. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, alcohol withdrawal/hypertension, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and infection.
2. Infection: The patient has a fever and positive pancreatic enzymes, suggesting a possible infection in the pancreas or elsewhere in the body. This could lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
3. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, which can include agitation, tremors, seizures, and delirium tremens.
4. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure, which can increase the risk of organ damage and complications.
5. Respiratory issues: The patient initially required NIMV/BIPAP for hypoxia, indicating respiratory distress or failure. There is a possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient has shown improvement in mental status during the day, being conversant and able to swallow soft diet without issue. However, overnight the patient became more confused, tried to get out of bed, and attempted to pull out lines. The patient's temperature (Tmax) was recorded at 38°C, and they have been febrile since admission. 

The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, ranging from 94/59 mmHg to 156/102 mmHg. The heart rate is stable between 56-89 bpm, respiratory rate is within normal range at 18-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is at 94% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient has received various medications including codeine, piperacillin, vancomycin, and morphine sulfate. They have also been given prophylactic heparin sodium and have multiple IV lines inserted.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events. The patient has a history of gout but the knee is not erythematous or inflamed.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, and liver function tests are within normal ranges.

   notable for hypoxia requiring NIMV/BIPAP, altered mental status, and
   hypertension in setting of alcohol withdrawal, and new right knee pain
   concerning for gout.
   1.  Pancreatitis.   Pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse.  Found to
   have pancreatic necrosis on CT.  Overall, pain is improving and
   tolerating diet well.
   - advance diet as tolerated
   - pain management if needed
   2.        Leukocytosis.  Patient found to have rising wbc, though fever
   curve is trending down.  Known necrotic pancreas on CT.  On
   vanco/zosyn.  Now with new onset right knee pain concnerning for gout.
   - knee tap
   - rheum consult
   - follow fever curve, leukocytosis
   2.        Right knee pain.  History of gout.  Now with right knee pain
   with suspsician for gout.

   # FEVER
 [**10-7**] and [**10-8**] T rise to 101, pan cultures, cxs(-),
   presumptive necrotic pancreatitis. Chest film looks clear but of
   infiltrate on past chest CT.  Vanco/Zosyn started [**10-8**], with plan for
   10d course.  Diff with no eos to suggest drug fever, all culture data
   (-), has been on hep sq so dvt less likely.  Other possibilities
   include cholecystitis (less likely with normal AP, bili downtrending),
   sinusitis (left maxillary opacification of head CT).
   - f/u cultures
   - cont vanco, zosyn for 10d course [**10-16**]
   - CIS >101, including sputum and urine (to assess for alternative
   sources of fever)
   - Will check LENIs today.
   - Afrin and nasal saline for sinusitis.
   - consider reimage abdomen if continues to spike high temps.
   # HYPOXIA
 fluid overload [**1-2**] resuscitation, ARDS possible,
   splinting.  Now not requiring NIPPV as mental status improving.
   -          minimize respiratory suppressants.
   -          Diurese with goal negative 500-1 L today.
   # ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL/HYPERTENSION - last drink [**10-2**], intermittent htn
   and agitation, as previously noted.  Trying to minimize sedating meds
   and benzos,  with goal to improve mental status and preclude need for
   Bipap.
   - PO olanzipine [**Hospital1 **] small dose (perhaps change to nighttime only dose)
   - PRN valium
   - BP control with PO labetalol
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS - likely from above, with possible cirrhosis,
   encephalopathy.  CT head (-).
   - hold sedating meds
   - NGT

Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse. He has pancreatic necrosis on CT, but his pain is improving, and he is tolerating a soft diet well.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a rising white blood cell count, although his fever curve is trending down. He has a known necrotic pancreas on CT and is on vancomycin and Zosyn. He now has new-onset right knee pain suspected to be gout.
3. Right knee pain: The patient has a history of gout and is experiencing right knee pain. There is suspicion of gout as the cause of the pain.
4. Fever: The patient had two episodes of fever, with a temperature rise to 101°F. Pan cultures, chest x-rays, and blood cultures are negative. He was started on vancomycin and Zosyn, and the course will continue for 10 days. Other possibilities for the fever include cholecystitis, sinusitis, or drug fever"

 elevated [**Last Name (un) 1840**] scores on admit/48hrs, likely
   [**1-2**] ethanol, lipase now improved, +pancreatic necrosis on CT.
   NGT placement briefly for nutrition, now out and NPO.  Surgery
   following.
   - replace NGT if not swallowing safely; if okay taking PO then will not
   need.
   - insulin, keep glucoses <150
   # FEVER
 [**10-7**] and [**10-8**] T rise to 101, pan cultures, cxs(-),
   presumptive necrotic pancreatitis. Chest film looks clear but of
   infiltrate on past chest CT.  Vanco/Zosyn started [**10-8**], with plan for
   10d course.  Diff with no eos to suggest drug fever, all culture data
   (-), has been on hep sq so dvt less likely.  Other possibilities
   include cholecystitis (less likely with normal AP, bili downtrending),
   sinusitis (left maxillary opacification of head CT).
   - f/u cultures
   - cont vanco, zosyn for 10d course [**10-16**]
   - CIS >101, including sputum and urine (to assess for alternative
   sources of fever)
   - Will check LENIs today.
   - Afrin and nasal saline for sinusitis.
   - consider reimage abdomen if continues to spike high temps.
   # HYPOXIA
 fluid overload [**1-2**] resuscitation, ARDS possible,
   splinting.  Now not requiring NIPPV as mental status improving.
   -          minimize respiratory suppressants.
   -          Diurese with goal negative 500-1 L today.
   # ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL/HYPERTENSION - last drink [**10-2**], intermittent htn
   and agitation, as previously noted.  Trying to minimize sedating meds
   and benzos,  with goal to improve mental status and preclude need for
   Bipap.
   - PO olanzipine [**Hospital1 **] small dose (perhaps change to nighttime only dose)
   - PRN valium

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. He was admitted with acute pancreatitis, likely caused by acute ethanol ingestion. The patient's course has been notable for hypoxia requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV)/bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP), altered mental status, and hypertension.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which is characterized by inflammation of the pancreas. Complications of pancreatitis can include infection of the pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, pseudocyst development, and pancreatic fistula.

2. Alcohol withdrawal/hypertension: The patient is at risk for alcohol withdrawal syndrome due to his history of alcohol abuse and recent cessation of alcohol intake. Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal can include agitation, tremors, seizures, hallucinations, and delirium tremens. Hypertension is also present, which may be related to alcohol withdrawal or other underlying causes.

3. Hypoxia: The patient required NIMV/BIPAP due to hypoxia. This indicates a compromised respiratory function, which can be caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, atelectasis, or other respiratory conditions. Monitoring and managing oxygenation is crucial to prevent further respiratory compromise.

4. Fever: The patient has had fevers on multiple occasions, with a"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and alcohol abuse, admitted for acute pancreatitis likely caused by acute ethanol ingestion. The patient has also experienced hypoxia requiring noninvasive ventilation/bilevel positive airway pressure (NIMV/BIPAP), altered mental status, and hypertension in the setting of alcohol withdrawal, as well as new right knee pain concerning for gout.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse. This condition may lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, abscesses, or infections.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is rising, indicating an ongoing infection. This could be due to the necrotic pancreas on CT scan. Close monitoring of the fever curve and completion of antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam are recommended.
3. Right knee pain: The patient's history of gout and new onset right knee pain raise suspicion for gouty arthritis. Joint aspiration and rheumatology consultation are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.
4. Fever: Although the fever curve is trending down, the patient still has low-grade fevers. The patient is on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam to cover potential aspiration pneumonia and necrotic pancreatitis. All cultures have been negative,"
