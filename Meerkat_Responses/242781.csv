","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of paraplegia, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 25-30%, severe sacral decubitus ulcers, multiple urinary tract infections (UTIs), and pulmonary embolism (PE) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter on anticoagulation. The patient presents with hypotension and is diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to urosepsis, decubitus ulcers, and a PICC line. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 97/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has crackles at the bases of both lungs on physical examination. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics (vancomycin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin), anticoagulants (Coumadin), antiplatelet agents (aspirin), and medications for depression, seizures, cholelithiasis, anorexia, and prophylaxis for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's plan includes pulling the PICC line, treating urosepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics, treating decubitus ulcers with antibiotics and flagyl, weaning off levophed, monitoring mean arterial pressure (MAP) and urine output, and evaluating for absolute adrenal insufficiency."

The plan includes following midline cultures, treating urosepsis with vancomycin (MRSA), meropenem, and ciprofloxacin (GNRs), and treating the ulcers with the same antibiotics plus metronidazole. 

The patient's goal is to have urine output greater than 30cc/hour. Given the patient's history of CHF and CAD, the medical team will monitor mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 60 and urine output. The patient is off levophed since 10 pm and will receive bolus intravenous fluids as needed. Cultures will be followed to wean antibiotics with culture data. 

The decubitus ulcer is described as long-standing with recent debridement. The plan is to continue metronidazole and follow wound care consultation. Imaging for osteomyelitis may be considered"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of paraplegia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 25-30%. He has severe sacral decubitus ulcers, multiple urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a pulmonary embolism (PE) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient presents with hypotension and is diagnosed with sepsis due to urosepsis, decubitus ulcers, and midline infection. He is being treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin for MRSA, GNRs, and anaerobes. The goal is to achieve a urine output of more than 30cc/hour.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is a critical condition that requires immediate attention. If not managed properly, it can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death.
2. Decubitus Ulcers: The patient's severe sacral decubitus ulcers can become complicated if not properly managed. They may lead to infection or expose underlying bone, increasing the risk of osteomyelitis.
3. Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs): With a history of multiple UTIs, there is a risk of recurrence or progression to a more severe infection, such as pyelonephritis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with septic shock, likely caused by decubitus ulcers, urinary tract infection, and potentially the PICC line. He has a history of T4 paraplegia, complicated by decubiti, neurogenic bladder, pulmonary embolisms, and urinary tract infections. The patient remains hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation and is awaiting further evaluation for source control. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 88/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. He is being managed using the Early Goal-Directed Therapy (EGDT) algorithm, aiming for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 7.1 g/dL, and elevated platelet count of 185 K/uL. Other lab values indicate normal renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and coagulopathy. The patient's ECG shows sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of T4 paraplegia, complicated by decubiti, neurogenic bladder, pulmonary embolisms (PEs), and urinary tract infections (UTIs). He is currently in septic shock, with the source likely being a decubitus ulcer but also including a possible urinary tract infection and PICC line infection. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin for MRSA, meropenem for gram-negative bacteria, ciprofloxacin for gram-negative bacteria, and metronidazole for anaerobes. His blood pressure is intermittently hypotensive and requires fluid boluses. The patient's neurologic examination and other systems assessments are incomplete. His labs show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and low platelets. The patient has an ECG showing sinus rhythm without evidence of ischemia. The assessment and plan involve managing septic shock using the Early Goal-Directed Therapy (EGDT) algorithm, addressing the source of infection through wound care and plastics consult, monitoring renal function, managing cardiovascular issues including a history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, continuing anticoagulation for a previous pulmonary embolism, managing seizure disorder, and maintaining glycemic control.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan:
   64-year-old man with septic shock (source most likely decub, but UTI
   and PICC line also in DDx) on a background history of T4 paraplegia
   (?myelitis) complicated by decubiti, neurogenic bladder, PEs and UTIs.
   Septic Shock
   Source control
 pulled PICC line. Awaiting plastics input for decub.
   Flu and blood neg. Still hypotensive with appropriate adrenal reserve
   (still working on figuring out source).
   ABX
 vanco (MRSA), meropenem (GNR), cipro (GNR), flagyl (C diff, addl
   anaerobes)  Follow cx.
   Hemodynamics
 manage using EGDT algorithm.  Good UOP. Goal MAP 60.
   Will fluid bolus (LR), try to figure out his real out pt BP. If he
   needs pressors again will place art line.
   Steroids
 assessed for adrenal insufficiency since on Megace.
   Appropriate stim.
   Etiol: urosepsis, decubitus ulcers, picc line.
   Decubitus ulcers vs osteo
   Quite long-standing, with recent debridement
   Wound care and plastics consult.  [**Month (only) 60**] need additional imaging for
   osteo. (awaiting plastics for type of imaging).
   PE s/p IVC filter:
   Continue warfarin for now, with goal INR 2
 3.  Monitor closely, since
   may trend up with quinolone.  Now back on coumadin (holding dose)
   (elevated presently)
   CAD/CHF
   No evidence of volume overload (but will need to be cautious with
   IVF).  Hold antihypertensive; continue aspirin.  [**Month (only) 60**] be able to retart
   in next couple of days.
   Seizure disorder. T4 plegia (very unclear etiology)
   Continue keppra

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of T4 paraplegia, coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), sacral decubitus ulcers, multiple urinary tract infections (UTIs), and pulmonary embolism (PE) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter on anticoagulation. The patient was admitted with hypotension.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics for sepsis, including vancomycin, metronidazole, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. The recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating ongoing infection.

The patient has a stage III-IV sacral decubitus ulcer, which requires wound care. The PE is being managed with continued anticoagulation. The patient also has a history of seizures, depression, cholelithiasis, and anorexia, for which he is receiving appropriate medications.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's history of CAD, systolic CHF, and hypotension puts him at risk for further cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest. The presence of a sacral decubitus ulcer indicates a risk for wound infection and potential sepsis. Additionally, the patient's multiple UTIs suggest a risk for recurrent urinary tract infections.

   Assessment and Plan
   64-year-old man with septic shock (source most likely decub, but UTI
   and PICC line also in DDx) on a background history of T4 paraplegia
   (?myelitis) complicated by decubiti, neurogenic bladder, PEs and UTIs.
   Septic Shock
   Source control
 pulled PICC line (neg to date, other clx also neg).
   Plastics does not think the decub is source of infection. . Flu and
   blood neg. Now back at baseline BP with appropriate adrenal reserve
   (still working on figuring out source).
   ABX
 vanco (MRSA), meropenem (GNR), cipro (GNR). Stopped metronidazole
   and ciproflox today (as no evidence of GNR in blood or need for double
   coverage). Empiric treatment for 10 days with Vanco and meropenem.
   Hemodynamics
 BP back at baseline
   Steroids
 assessed for adrenal insufficiency since on Megace.
   Appropriate stim.
   Decubitus ulcers vs osteo
   Quite long-standing, with recent debridement
   Plastics states no active infection, cont wound care rec's
   PE s/p IVC filter:
   Continue warfarin for now, with goal INR 2
 3.  Monitor closely, since
   may trend up with quinolone.  Now back on coumadin (holding dose)
   (elevated presently at 3.5)
   Renal function:
   Ok for now. Fluids with LR to avoid hyperchloremic acidosis.
   CAD/CHF
   No evidence of volume overload (but will need to be cautious with
   IVF).  Hold antihypertensive; continue aspirin.  [**Month (only) 60**] be able to retart
   in next couple of days (deferring for now)
   chest pain is muscoskeletal (pain with palpation and reassuring ECG)
   Seizure disorder. T4 plegia (very unclear etiology)
   Continue keppra

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old man with septic shock and a background history of T4 paraplegia, decubiti, neurogenic bladder, pulmonary embolisms, and urinary tract infections. The patient has been experiencing septic shock, which is believed to be caused by a source most likely related to decubitus ulcers, but other possibilities such as urinary tract infections and PICC line infections are also being considered.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), current temperature of 36.8 C (98.3 F), heart rate of 80 bpm (normal range: 70-92 bpm), blood pressure of 109/69 mmHg (normal range: 79-109/70-79 mmHg), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (normal range: 11-20 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.

The patient is receiving multiple IV medications including vancomycin, meropenem, famotidine, and possibly others. The patient has been on antibiotics for sepsis and will continue with empiric treatment for 10 days.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, platelet count of 185 K/uL, creatinine level of 0"
