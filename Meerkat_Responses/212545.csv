","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, presenting with a vesicular rash, confusion, and fevers. She has a history of depression, mild dementia, and type II diabetes. The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 143/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a vesicular rash over the right breast extending to the axilla and slightly to the back. Neurological examination is limited due to patient compliance, but she can move all four extremities slowly with prompting, and her reflexes are 3+ bilaterally.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 219 K/uL, elevated glucose level of 164 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 130 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications. Firstly, the patient's fevers, worsening mental status, and increasing leukocytosis on CSF are concerning for evolving bacterial meningitis or viral meningoencephalitis. Broad coverage with acyclovir, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, and vancomycin has been initiated.

Secondly, the patient's hyperref"

Imaging studies and other lab results are pending.

Assessment and plan include multiple concerns such as potential bacterial or viral meningitis, possible disseminated zoster, pneumonia, and the patient's underlying conditions including HIV/AIDS, depression, and diabetes. The patient is being treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral medications, and further diagnostic tests including MRI, EEG, and cultures are planned.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include worsening of the patient's mental status due to bacterial or viral meningitis, development of hydrocephalus if there is blockage of CSF drainage, progression of the vesicular rash leading to complications associated with disseminated zoster, and possible worsening of the patient's respiratory status due to underlying lung infection."

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with recent diagnosis of HIV/AIDS who presents with a vesicular rash, confusion, and fevers. She has a history of depression and mild dementia. The patient's mental status has improved, but there is still concern for evolving bacterial meningitis or viral meningoencephalitis. The differential diagnosis includes toxoplasmosis and cryptococcus. 

The patient is currently on a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen including acyclovir, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and vancomycin. Her hyperreflexia and spasticity raise concern for basal exudate blocking CSF drainage, potentially leading to hydrocephalus. An MRI of the head with and without contrast was negative for encephalitis. Neurology and Infectious Disease consultations have been requested.

The patient also has hyponatremia, which is being addressed with IV fluids containing dextrose in normal saline (D5NS) to prevent worsening of sodium levels. Nutrition consultation for tube feeds has been requested due to the extended period of nothing by mouth (npo).

There is a concern for possible pneumonia on chest X-ray with a vague opacity at the left lung base. Azithromycin has been changed to treatment doses per Infectious Disease consultation.

The patient's rash is classic for zoster, with a positive direct antigen test for VZV (Varicella-Zoster Virus) and negative for HSV (Herpes Simplex"

   # Fevers/AMS/Headache: Fevers:  Her worsening mental status and
   increasing leukocytosis on CSF is concerning for evolving bacterial
   meningitis or viral meningoencephalitis. Also in the differential will
   be toxoplasmosis and cryptococcus.  Cover broadly with acyclovir,
   ceftriaxone, amoxicillin and vancomycin. Given her hyperreflexia and
   spasticity, will appreciate neurology recommendations.  Acute worsening
   is concerning for basal exudate blocking CSF drainage producing
   hydrocephalus per Neurology.
   - MRI head w/ and w/o contrast to check for meningeal enhancement or
   other sources of her somnolence.
   - neurology recs
   - ID recs
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u CSF cultures and differential
   - precautions and negative pressure room for possible disseminated
   zoster.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of HIV/AIDS. She presented with a vesicular rash, confusion, and fevers. The patient's medical history includes depression, mild dementia, type II diabetes, and a previous diagnosis of PCP pneumonia. Her most recent CD4 count was 253. The patient is currently on HAART therapy for HIV/AIDS and is also taking medications for depression and diabetes.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 138/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals a vesicular rash over the right breast extending to the axilla and slightly to the back. Neurological examination is limited by patient compliance, but she is able to move all four extremities slowly with prompting. Reflexes are 3+ bilaterally.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21000/uL, elevated glucose levels, and slightly low potassium levels. The patient's platelet count is within normal range, and her liver function tests are mildly elevated. Electrolyte levels are also within normal limits.

Assessment and plan:
1. Fevers/AMS/Headache: The patient's worsening mental status, increasing leukocytosis on CSF, and fever raise concern for evolving bacterial meningitis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with HIV/AIDS presenting with acute on chronic mental status changes. She has been diagnosed with meningitis vs. meningoencephalitis and is showing some improvement since yesterday. She has been on broad antiviral/antibacterial coverage guided by ID consultation. An MRI shows no new findings to explain her deterioration. The patient is also experiencing a vesicular rash over her right breast, axilla, and back consistent with T3 zoster. There is evidence of meningitis on CSF analysis. An EEG has been done but not yet reported, and CSF was sent for cytology and HSV virus (given her history of lymphoma). She is being covered broadly, and will need to follow up on cultures. The patient is stable for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to HIV/AIDS, making her more susceptible to various infections. Meningitis is already present, and there is a possibility of other infections due to her weakened immune response.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's mental status changes indicate potential neurological complications. Further deterioration or development of new neurological symptoms could occur if the underlying cause is not effectively treated.
3. Zoster infection: The presence of a vesicular rash consistent with T3 zoster suggests a possible complication related to the varicella-zoster virus reactivation. This could lead to discomfort, pain, and potential secondary"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y.o. woman with HIV/AIDs, component of dementia presenting with
   acute on chronic mental status changes, workup consistent with
   meningitis vs.meningoencephalitis with some improvement since
   yesterday. She has been on broad antiviral/antibacterial coverage
   guided by ID consultation.  MRI shows no new findings to explain
   deterioration. Exam notable for somnolence but arousable, improved over
   past 24 hrs, and vesicular rash over right breast/axilla/back
   consistent with T3 zoster. There is evidence of meningitis on CSF. EEG
   done - not yet reported. CSF was sent for cytology and [**Male First Name (un) 9577**] virus (given
   hx of lymphoma). Being covered broadly, will need to f/u on cultures.
   Need to confirm with lab that zoster culture was in fact a skin biopsy,
   not CSF.
   Agree with plan as summarized in Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9311**].
   Stable for transfer to floor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with HIV/AIDS and dementia who presented with acute on chronic mental status changes. She has been diagnosed with meningitis or meningoencephalitis and is currently on broad antiviral/antibacterial coverage. Her condition has shown some improvement since yesterday. An MRI revealed no new findings to explain her deterioration. The patient has a vesicular rash on her breast, axilla, and back, which is consistent with T3 zoster. There is evidence of meningitis in her CSF. An EEG has been done but not yet reported, and CSF was sent for cytology and testing for [Male First Name (un)] virus due to her history of lymphoma. The patient's vitals are stable, and she is expected to be stable for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms and CSF findings suggest meningitis. If left untreated or not properly managed, it can lead to further deterioration, seizures, and potentially fatal outcomes.
2. T3 Zoster: The presence of a vesicular rash on the patient's breast, axilla, and back indicates T3 zoster. This condition can cause pain, discomfort, and potential complications such as postherpetic neuralgia.
3. HIV/AIDS: As the patient has HIV/AIDS, there is an increased risk of opportunistic infections and progression of the disease, which may lead to further"

The patient also has hyponatremia, which is being managed with IV fluids containing dextrose in normal saline (D5NS). Nutrition support is needed due to the extended period of not eating (npo), and a nutrition consult has been requested.

Additionally, the patient has a possible pneumonia on chest X-ray, and azithromycin has been changed to treatment doses per ID consultation.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 CALLED OUT
   This is a 66 year old female with recent diagnosis of HIV/AIDS on HAART
   last CD4 count 253 and, depression and mild dementia who presents from
   home with a vesicular rash, confusion and fevers. The patient was in
   her usual state of health approximately one week ago. Her husband has
   noticed for the past 3-4 days she has seemed more confused than normal.
   At the same time she has developed a right sided vesicular rash which
   is located over her right breast. The rash is painful and mildly
   pruritic. She has had mild fevers at home to as high as 100.1 without
   chills. She has not had headache, photophobia or neck stiffness. She
   has not had chest pain or difficulty breathing. No nausea, vomiting,
   adominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or
   swelling. She has had decreased PO intake for the past week. She did
   have one episode of urinary incontinence which is unusual for her and
   no episodes of bowel incontinence. She was seen by her VNA on the day
   of presentation who noted her to be mildly confused with a temperature
   of 100.1. Her primary care physician was [**Name (NI) 161**] who recommended
   transfer to the emergency room.
   .
   In the ED, initial vs were: T: 102 BP: 136/75 P: 85 R: 16 O2: 100% on
   RA. She had a CXR which showed a possible small left lower lobe
   opacity. She had a head CT without acute changes. ECG without acute
   changes.  She had a lumbar puncture which showed 18 WBC in tube 4 with
   16 RBC, 61% neutrophils. Protein was 62, glucose 66. She received
   ceftriaxone 2 grams IV x 1 and azithromycin 500 mg PO x 1. She weas
   admitted to the floor for further workup.
   .
   On the floor she is somnolent but alert and oriented x 3 initially.
   She became less responsive through out the day.  She was still able to
   open eyes to verbal stimuli but stopped following commands.  Repeat CSF
   today had 133 with 69% PMNs, protein 114 and glucose 54, concerning for
   evolving meningoencephalitis.  She was transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for further
   care.  Brain MR w/wo contrast is obtained prior to transfer per
   Neurology recs.
   .
   On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**], patient does not have any complaints.  She denies
   chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, weakness,
   photophobia/phonophobia, weakness or numbness.  She denies cough, cold,
   diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, blood in stool or urine.

   # Fevers/AMS/Headache: Fevers:  Mental status improved today, more
   oriented and involved in exam, her worsening mental status and
   increasing leukocytosis on CSF is concerning for evolving bacterial
   meningitis or viral meningoencephalitis. Also in the differential will
   be toxoplasmosis and cryptococcus.  Continue to cover broadly with
   acyclovir, ceftriaxone, ampicillin and vancomycin. Given her
   hyperreflexia and spasticity, will appreciate neurology
   recommendations.  Acute worsening is concerning for basal exudate
   blocking CSF drainage producing hydrocephalus per Neurology.
   - MRI head w/ and w/o contrast negative for encephalitis.
   - neurology following appreciate recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of HIV/AIDS on HAART therapy, last CD4 count 253, depression, and mild dementia. She presents with a vesicular rash, confusion, and fevers. The patient's mental status has improved over the course of the day, but she still shows signs of confusion. She has a history of type II diabetes and was previously diet controlled. Her blood glucose levels are currently being monitored with finger sticks every six hours and she is on a sliding scale of Humalog. The patient also has anemia but her hematocrit is at baseline and being monitored. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and vancomycin) for suspected bacterial meningitis or viral meningoencephalitis. Acyclovir has been started due to the vesicular rash, which is classic for herpes zoster, confirmed by a positive direct antigen test for VZV. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, with ongoing assessments and plans for further investigations, including imaging studies, blood cultures, CSF cultures, viral PCR, and cytology."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y.o. woman with HIV/AIDs, component of dementia presenting with
   acute on chronic mental status changes, workup consistent with
   meningitis or meningoencephalitis with continued decline despite
   initiation of broad antiviral/antibacterial coverage guided by ID
   consultation.  MRI
 preliminary read shows no new findings to explain
   deterioration.   Exam notable for somnolence but arousable, improved
   since earlier in the morning, and vesicular rash over right
   breast/axilla/back consistent with T3 zoster. There is evidence of
   meningitis on CSF. Being covered broadly, cultures pending. MRI prelim
   shows no evidence of encephalitis. EEG will likely be done today per
   neuro
s recommendation. She is at risk of seizures. Will try to send
   CSF for cytology and [**Male First Name (un) 9577**] virus (given hx of lymphoma).
   Agree with plan as summarized in Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9271**].
   Monitor in ICU given labile neurological status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with HIV/AIDS who presented with acute on chronic mental status changes. She has been diagnosed with meningitis or meningoencephalitis, as indicated by her workup and examination findings. Despite broad antiviral/antibacterial coverage guided by an Infectious Disease consultation, her condition has continued to decline. A preliminary read of her MRI shows no new findings to explain her deterioration. She exhibits somnolence but can be aroused, and her mental status has improved since earlier in the morning. She also has a vesicular rash over her right breast/axilla/back, which is consistent with T3 zoster. There is evidence of meningitis on her CSF analysis. She is being covered broadly, with cultures pending. Her EEG will likely be performed today per neurologic recommendation. She is at risk of seizures. Additionally, her physicians plan to send her CSF for cytology and test for [Male First Name (un) 9577] virus, given her history of lymphoma. Due to her labile neurological status, she will continue to be monitored in the ICU."
