","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, history of heart attack, chronic kidney disease (on hemodialysis), and chronic congestive heart failure. He presented for elective SMA stenting due to mesenteric ischemia but experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) post-procedure. Extensive coronary artery disease was found, and surgical intervention was not possible. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the placement of bare-metal stents in the left circumflex artery and the right coronary artery. He is currently in the critical care unit (CCU) for persistent chest pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chest Pain - The patient's anginal pain in the setting of severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and recent NSTEMI indicates ongoing myocardial ischemia or potential progression of CAD.
2. Diabetic Complications - The patient is reported to have diabetes, but no outpatient diabetic medications are listed. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and consideration of insulin therapy may be necessary.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) - The patient is on hemodialysis for CKD. Monitoring fluid status, electrolyte imbalances, and adherence to the dialysis schedule will be crucial.
4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) - The patient has a history of chronic CHF, which may worsen due"

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease (on hemodialysis), coronary artery disease, and chronic heart failure. He presented for elective superior mesenteric artery stenting due to mesenteric ischemia but experienced an NSTEMI post-procedure. Extensive coronary artery disease was found, not amenable to surgery, and plans for staged intervention were made.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/43 mmHg to 147/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on a nasal cannula. The patient has a first-degree atrioventricular block.

   Assessment and Plan
   80M w DM2, HTN, HL, CAD, CKD (on HD), chr dCHF, who presented for
   elective SMA stenting for mesenteric ischemia, had an NSTEMI post
   procedure, was found to have extensive CAD on cath, not amenable to
   surgery, with plans for staged [**Hospital 3657**] transferred to CCU for persistent
   chest pain.
   # Chest Pain - Anginal pain in setting of severe 3v CAD and NSTEMI.
   Patient was transferred to CCU for excalating chest pain with increased
   ST depressions in V4-V6. He is currently chest pain free. S/p  PCI with
   BMS x 2 to LCx on [**1-25**] and BMS x 2 to RCA on [**1-27**].
   - ASA 325 mg PO daily
   - Plavix 75 mg PO Daily
   - Atorvastatin 80 mg PO qhs
   - Metoprolol 50mg PO BID, consider uptitration as tolerated by
   hemodialysis.
   - Lisinopril 5mg PO daily, held on HD days
   # COPD: Stable
   - albuterol/ipratropium PRN
   # ESRD- patient with history of ESRD likely [**1-31**] hypertension and
   diabetes receives dialysis m,w,f.
   - HD today
   - Sevalemer to TID with meals
   - Nephrocaps
   # Pump
 Clinical heart failure, ejection fraction preserved, so
   presumed acute on chronic diastolic CHF.  improves with fluid removal
   on HD.
   - f/u fluid status after HD, currently stable
   - patient already on beta blocker, lisinopril
   # Diabetes - Patient is reportedly diabetic however no outpatient
   diabetic medications listed. HgA1C 5.8%
   - insulin sliding scale
   - continue to monitor
   # Hyperlipdemia - patient with history of hyperlipidemia.  Recent lipid
   panel with LDL 65.
   - continue lipitor 80 mg PO daily
   # Carotid stenosis s/p L carotid endarterectomy
   - cont statin, aspirin
   # Anemia
 Chronic disease, stable.
   - transfuse for Hct < 30 based on NSTEMI (would prefer to give to
   patient when in dialysis)
   #. FEN: Follow and replete electrolytes. Cardiac, diabetic, renal
   diet.
   #. Access: PIV
   #. PPx: Heparin SC, colace, senna, PP.
   #. Code: Full Code
   #. Dispo: PT eval today, likely dispo to home after HD if cleared by

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease (on hemodialysis), chronic heart failure, and carotid stenosis. He presented for elective SMA stenting due to mesenteric ischemia but experienced an NSTEMI post procedure. Extensive coronary artery disease was found, making him not amenable to surgery. He was transferred to the CCU for persistent chest pain.

The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stents placed in the left circumflex artery (LCx) on 1-25 and in the right coronary artery (RCA) on 1-27. He is currently chest pain-free.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and sevalemer.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Chest Pain - Anginal pain due to severe three-vessel coronary artery disease and NSTEMI. The patient is currently chest pain-free after PCI.
2. COPD - Stable with albuterol/ipratropium as needed.
3. ESRD - The patient receives dialysis on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
4. Pump Failure - Presumed acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, improves with fluid removal on HD. Follow-up fluid status after HD"
