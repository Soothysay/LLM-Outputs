 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   63 yo F with PCKD s/p bilateral nephrectomies on HD, polycystic liver
   dz, and high resting LVOT gradient, currently being treated for MRSA
   bacterimia and peritonitis who became hypotensive/tachycardic in HD.
   .
   # Hypotension/tachycardia/sespis:  The most likely etiology of her
   hypotension in the setting of an ongoing infection seems to be sepsis
   exacerbated by her intrinsic pre-load dependence secondary to a high
   LVOT gradient from assymmetric septal hypertrophy.  It does not seem
   that LV outflow tract obstruction is the primary process resulting in
   hypotension, but it does have implications in how her hypotension
   should be managed. Strongly favor aggressive fluid resucitation
   (although it may lead to intubation in [**Last Name (un) 9917**] anuric pt) over pressor
   support as her cardiac output should respond significantly to increased
   end diastolic volumes.  If pressors necessary would strongly favor neo
   over levophed to increase filling time and not increase LVOT gradient
   with increased inotropy.  Possiblity of adding gentamicin to her
   current Abx discussed with ID who recommended holding off for now--will
   reconsider if clinical status declines overnight.
   -- Broadened gram negative covg with cefepime instead of ceftriaxone
   -- Last vanco trough 17. Gave another dose of 1g  per pharmacy's
   recommendation; check level this am
   -- consider more Albumin
   -- IVF to miantain HR ~110 and MAP above 60; neo if pressor necessary
   --US of right arm graft to determine if source of infxn
   .
   # MRSA bacterimia: as above, continue vancomycin. Surveillance
   cultures.
   # MRSA peritonitis: Seeded from the blood? Seems to be an odd organism
   for SBP as the primary process. S/p second diagnositc paracentesis this
   am. Holding on therapeutic tap given septic physiology/ hypotension.
   -- vancomycin as above, f/u tap, albumin as above
   # ESLD: Pt is on the transplant list. Synthetic function seems
   relatively intact. Hepatology consulting.
   # Elevated troponin/ new wall mtn abnormaility: Pt may have missed an
   MI at some point since her last echo in [**Month (only) **].  This echo is done
   in the setting of sepsis at a much higher heart rate and may reflect
   some demand ischemia in the hypokinetic region.  Low CK argues against
   infarct. Septal q-waves and small apical aneurysm argue in favor of
   missed infarct.
   -- cardiology recs
   -- no indication for treatent of ACS, troponin attributable to renal
   failure

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of polycystic kidney disease, who has undergone bilateral nephrectomies and is currently on hemodialysis. She presents with hypotension, tachycardia, and signs of sepsis, possibly due to MRSA bacteremia and peritonitis. The patient's cardiac output is expected to improve with aggressive fluid resuscitation rather than pressor support. The possibility of adding gentamicin to the current antibiotics is being considered. There is a concern for a missed myocardial infarction, but it is less likely due to the low CK levels. The patient's renal function seems relatively intact, and she is on the transplant list. She also has ascites, impaired skin integrity, diarrhea, and evidence of hepatic failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing hypotension, tachycardia, and signs of infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires hemodialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
3. Hepatic Failure: The patient has evidence of hepatic failure, which may lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Myocardial Infarction: Although less likely given the low CK levels, there is"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   63 yo F with PCKD s/p bilateral nephrectomies on HD, polycystic liver
   dz, and high resting LVOT gradient, currently being treated for MRSA
   bacterimia and peritonitis who became hypotensive/tachycardic in HD.
   .
   # Hypotension/tachycardia/sespis:  The most likely etiology of her
   hypotension in the setting of an ongoing infection seems to be sepsis
   exacerbated by her intrinsic pre-load dependence secondary to a high
   LVOT gradient from assymmetric septal hypertrophy.  It does not seem
   that LV outflow tract obstruction is the primary process resulting in
   hypotension, but it does have implications in how her hypotension
   should be managed. Strongly favor aggressive fluid resucitation
   (although it may lead to intubation in [**Last Name (un) 9917**] anuric pt) over pressor
   support as her cardiac output should respond significantly to increased
   end diastolic volumes.  If pressors necessary would strongly favor neo
   over levophed to increase filling time and not increase LVOT gradient
   with increased inotropy.  Possiblity of adding gentamicin to her
   current Abx discussed with ID who recommended holding off for now--will
   reconsider if clinical status declines overnight.
   -- Broadened gram negative covg with cefepime instead of ceftriaxone
   -- Last vanco trough 17. Gave another dose of 1g  per pharmacy's
   recommendation; check level this am
   -- consider more Albumin
   -- IVF to miantain HR ~110 and MAP above 60; neo if pressor necessary
   --US of right arm graft to determine if source of infxn
   .
   # MRSA bacterimia: as above, continue vancomycin. Surveillance
   cultures.
   # MRSA peritonitis: Seeded from the blood? Seems to be an odd organism
   for SBP as the primary process. S/p second diagnositc paracentesis this
   am. Holding on therapeutic tap given septic physiology/ hypotension.
   -- vancomycin as above, f/u tap, albumin as above
   # ESLD: Pt is on the transplant list. Synthetic function seems
   relatively intact. Hepatology consulting.
   # Elevated troponin/ new wall mtn abnormaility: Pt may have missed an
   MI at some point since her last echo in [**Month (only) **].  This echo is done
   in the setting of sepsis at a much higher heart rate and may reflect
   some demand ischemia in the hypokinetic region.  Low CK argues against
   infarct. Septal q-waves and small apical aneurysm argue in favor of
   missed infarct.
   -- cardiology recs
   -- no indication for treatent of ACS, troponin attributable to renal
   failure

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of polycystic kidney disease, who has undergone bilateral nephrectomies and is currently on hemodialysis. She also has polycystic liver disease and a high resting left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient. The patient is being treated for MRSA bacteremia and peritonitis. She experienced hypotension and tachycardia during hemodialysis, which was likely due to sepsis exacerbated by her intrinsic preload dependence secondary to the high LVOT gradient from asymmetric septal hypertrophy. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 90/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. Physical examination findings include jaundice, right lower extremity edema, and poor dentition. Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, bilirubin, and lactate, as well as low albumin and hemoglobin. The patient's WBC count has been fluctuating over the past few days. The patient is diagnosed with ascites, impaired skin integrity, diarrhea, hepatic failure (fulminant), renal failure (end-stage), and hypotension (not in shock). The plan is to aggressively fluid resuscitate the patient, possibly leading to intubation in"

    # Hypotension/tachycardia: Likely secondary to sepsis - possibly from
   partially treated MRSA bacteremia or another microorganism.  Per
   primary physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3433**] SBP is in 80s.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime, consider gent if clinically worsens
   - IVF to maintain MAP > 60 and HR < 115
   - F/u cultures, recheck daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Recheck lactate
   - U/S fistula to r/o fluid collection/clot (stopped working day PTA)

   - IVF for hypotension
   - BB when BP allows
   - Continue asa and lipitor
   - Repeat TTE when sepsis physiology resolved
   # ESLD: Synthetic function intact.  Now with MRSA SBP.  On transplant
   list.
   - Continue midodrine, albumin
   - Improved WBC count on peritoneal fluid
   - Hepatology following
   - Routine therapeutic taps
   # Hypoxia: Likely from volume overload due to missing HD.
   - Stable on 1L. [**Month (only) 8**] need to increase with volume resuscitation.
   # ESRD: Overdue for HD, but held [**1-1**] hypotension.
   - Renal following
   - Consider taking off less fluid in future as appears to be very fluid

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) who underwent bilateral nephrectomy and developed end-stage liver disease (ESLD). She is currently on the transplant list and experienced a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm that was surgically clipped. As a result, she has residual right-sided hemiparesis.

The patient was admitted from hemodialysis (HD) to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) on [10-4] due to hypotension and MRSA bacteremia/peritonitis. She received treatment with vancomycin (Vanc) and cefepime (CTX). On [10-6], she was called out, and on [10-8], she developed recurrent, fluid-refractory hypotension and tachycardia. She was then transferred to the MICU green.

The assessment and plan include several sections:

1. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia are likely secondary to sepsis, possibly from partially treated MRSA bacteremia or another microorganism. She is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime, and IV fluids are being administered to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and heart rate (HR) below 115. Cultures are being followed, and daily surveillance blood cultures are being rechecked. Lactate levels are also being monitored, and an ultrasound (U/S) of the fistula is being performed to rule out fluid collection/clot.

2. TTE: The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) which showed new apical hypokinesis with aneurysm formation and a worsening intraventricular gradient. This is concerning for recent myocardial infarction (MI) that went unrecognized or demand ischemia from tachycardia/sepsis physiology. The patient is being treated with IV fluids for hypotension and beta-blockers (BB) when her blood pressure allows. She is also continuing aspirin (ASA) and lipitor. Repeat TTE is planned when sepsis physiology resolves.

3. ESLD: The patient's synthetic function is intact, but she now has MRSA spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She is on the transplant list and receiving midodrine and albumin. The improved white blood cell (WBC) count in the peritoneal fluid suggests a response to treatment. Hepatology follow-up is being coordinated, and routine therapeutic taps are being performed.

4. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to volume overload due to missed hemodialysis. She is stable on 1 liter of oxygen and needs to increase with volume resuscitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o female with h/o PCKD s/p bilateral nephrectomy with liver cysts
   resulting in ESLD on transplant list and ruptured [**Doctor Last Name **] aneurysm s/p
   clipping with residual R sided hemiparesis admitted [**10-4**] from HD to
   MICU [**Location (un) **] with hypotension and MRSA bacteremia/peritonitis.  Tx with
   vanc/CTX.  Called out [**10-6**].  On floor [**10-8**] developed recurrent, fluid
   refractory hypotension and tachycardia.  Transferred to MICU green.  Of
   note, the patient had a TTE with new apical hypokinesis with aneurysm
   formation and a worsening intraventricular gradient.
    # Hypotension/tachycardia: Likely secondary to sepsis - possibly from
   partially treated MRSA bacteremia or another microorganism.  Per
   primary physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3433**] SBP is in 80s.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime, consider gent if clinically worsens
   - IVF to maintain MAP > 60 and HR < 115
   - F/u cultures, recheck daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Recheck lactate
   - U/S fistula to r/o fluid collection/clot (stopped working day PTA)
   # TTE: Echo with new apical hypokinesis with aneurysm formation and a
   worsening intraventricular gradient.  Concerning for recent MI that
   went unrecognized vs demand ischemia from tachycardia/sepsis
   physiology.  Fluid dependent given obstructive physiology.
   - IVF for hypotension
   - BB when BP allows
   - Continue asa and lipitor
   - Repeat TTE when sepsis physiology resolved
   # ESLD: Synthetic function intact.  Now with MRSA SBP.  On transplant
   list.
   - Continue midodrine, albumin
   - Improved WBC count on peritoneal fluid
   - Hepatology following
   - Routine therapeutic taps
   # Hypoxia:- Stable on 1L. [**Month (only) 8**] need to increase with volume
   resuscitation.
   ? element of hepatopulmonary syndrome
   # ESRD: Overdue for HD, but held [**1-1**] hypotension.
   - Renal following
   - Consider taking off less fluid in future as appears to be very fluid
   dependent from a cardiac standpoint.
   - Would like to see how her BP tolerates HD before transferring back to
   floor

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), who underwent bilateral nephrectomy and developed end-stage liver disease (ESLD). She is currently admitted to the MICU with hypotension and MRSA bacteremia/peritonitis. The patient's recent medical history includes a ruptured aneurysm that was clipped, resulting in residual right-sided hemiparesis.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 96/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. She is receiving IV fluids at a rate of 2.7 liters and has been transfused with 200 mL of blood products. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 11.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, creatinine level of 5.3, and blood glucose level of 140. Other notable lab findings include an elevated lactate level of 3.1 mmol/L, low platelet count of 83 K/uL, and elevated levels of troponin-T and CK-MB, indicating potential myocardial injury.

The patient has undergone several interventions and tests, including the placement of dialysis catheters, echocardiography revealing new apical hypokinesis with"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o female with h/o PCKD s/p bilateral nephrectomy with liver cysts
   resulting in ESLD on transplant list and ruptured [**Doctor Last Name **] aneurysm s/p
   clipping with residual R sided hemiparesis admitted [**10-4**] from HD to
   MICU [**Location (un) **] with hypotension and MRSA bacteremia/peritonitis.  Tx with
   vanc/CTX.  Called out [**10-6**].  On floor [**10-8**] developed recurrent, fluid
   refractory hypotension and tachycardia.  Transferred to MICU green.  Of
   note, the patient had a TTE with new apical hypokinesis with aneurysm
   formation and a worsening intraventricular gradient.
    # Hypotension/tachycardia: Likely secondary to sepsis - possibly from
   partially treated MRSA bacteremia or another microorganism.  Per
   primary physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3433**] SBP is in 80s.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime, consider gent if clinically worsens
   - IVF to maintain MAP > 60 and HR < 115
   - F/u cultures, recheck daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Recheck lactate
   - U/S fistula to r/o fluid collection (stopped working day PTA)
   # TTE: Echo with new apical hypokinesis with aneurysm formation and a
   worsening intraventricular gradient.  Concerning for recent MI that
   went unrecognized vs demand ischemia from tachycardia/sepsis
   physiology.  Fluid dependent given obstructive physiology.
   - IVF for hypotension
   - BB when BP allows
   - Continue asa and lipitor
   - Repeat TTE when sepsis physiology resolved
   # ESLD: Synthetic function intact.  Now with MRSA SBP.  On transplant
   list.
   - Continue midodrine, albumin
   - Improved WBC count on peritoneal fluid
   - Hepatology following
   - Routine therapeutic taps
   # Hypoxia: Likely from volume overload due to missing HD.
   - Stable on 1L. [**Month (only) 8**] need to increase with volume resuscitation.
   # ESRD: Overdue for HD, but held [**1-1**] hypotension.
   - Renal following
   - Consider taking off less fluid in future as appears to be very fluid
   dependent from a cardiac standpoint.
   - Would like to see how her BP tolerates HD before transferring back to
   floor

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) who underwent bilateral nephrectomy and developed end-stage liver disease (ESLD). She has been admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) multiple times due to various complications. The current admission is for hypotension and MRSA bacteremia/peritonitis. She has been treated with vancomycin and cefepime, but her condition worsened with recurrent, fluid-refractory hypotension and tachycardia. She was transferred back to the MICU from the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's recurrent hypotension and tachycardia may be secondary to sepsis, possibly from partially treated MRSA bacteremia or another microorganism. This is a potential complication of her current condition and requires close monitoring and management.
2. TTE (Transesophageal Echocardiogram): The patient's TTE showed new apical hypokinesis with aneurysm formation and worsening intraventricular gradient. This could be concerning for recent myocardial infarction (MI) that went unrecognized or demand ischemia from tachycardia/sepsis physiology. Fluid dependency is noted due to obstructive physiology.
3. ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease): The patient's synthetic function in ESLD is intact,"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   63 yo F with PCKD s/p bilateral nephrectomies on HD, polycystic liver
   dz, and high resting LVOT gradient, currently being treated for MRSA
   bacterimia and peritonitis who became hypotensive/tachycardic in HD.
   .
   # Hypotension/tachycardia/sespis:  The most likely etiology of her
   hypotension in the setting of an ongoing infection seems to be sepsis
   exacerbated by her intrinsic pre-load dependence secondary to a high
   LVOT gradient from assymmetric septal hypertrophy.  It does not seem
   that LV outflow tract obstruction is the primary process resulting in
   hypotension, but it does have implications in how her hypotension
   should be managed. Strongly favor aggressive fluid resucitation
   (although it may lead to intubation in [**Last Name (un) 9917**] anuric pt) over pressor
   support as her cardiac output should respond significantly to increased
   end diastolic volumes.  If pressors necessary would strongly favor neo
   over levophed to increase filling time and not increase LVOT gradient
   with increased inotropy.  Possiblity of adding gentamicin to her
   current Abx discussed with ID who recommended holding off for now--will
   reconsider if clinical status declines overnight.
   -- Broadened gram negative covg with cefepime instead of ceftriaxone
   -- Last vanco trough 17. Gave another dose of 1g  per pharmacy's
   recommendation; check level this am
   -- consider more Albumin
   -- IVF to miantain HR ~110 and MAP above 60; neo if pressor necessary
   --US of right arm graft to determine if source of infxn
   .
   # MRSA bacterimia: as above, continue vancomycin. Surveillance
   cultures.
   # MRSA peritonitis: Seeded from the blood? Seems to be an odd organism
   for SBP as the primary process. S/p second diagnositc paracentesis this
   am. Holding on therapeutic tap given septic physiology/ hypotension.
   -- vancomycin as above, f/u tap, albumin as above
   # ESLD: Pt is on the transplant list. Synthetic function seems
   relatively intact. Hepatology consulting.
   # Elevated troponin/ new wall mtn abnormaility: Pt may have missed an
   MI at some point since her last echo in [**Month (only) **].  This echo is done
   in the setting of sepsis at a much higher heart rate and may reflect
   some demand ischemia in the hypokinetic region.  Low CK argues against
   infarct. Septal q-waves and small apical aneurysm argue in favor of
   missed infarct.
   -- cardiology recs
   -- no indication for treatent of ACS, troponin attributable to renal
   failure

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, polycystic liver disease, and a high resting left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient. She is currently being treated for MRSA bacteremia and peritonitis. The patient became hypotensive and tachycardic during hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension in the setting of an ongoing infection suggests sepsis exacerbated by her intrinsic pre-load dependence secondary to a high LVOT gradient from asymmetric septal hypertrophy.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to poor nutrition or underlying conditions.
3. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, which could be related to her underlying conditions or medication side effects.
4. Hepatic Failure, Fulminant: The patient shows signs of hepatic failure, possibly secondary to her underlying liver disease or infection.
5. Renal Failure, End Stage (ESRD): The patient has chronic kidney disease and is on hemodialysis, indicating end-stage renal failure.
6. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to sepsis and intrinsic pre-load dependence.

   63 yo F with PCKD s/p bilateral nephrectomies on HD, polycystic liver
   dz, and high resting LVOT gradient, currently being treated for MRSA
   bacterimia and peritonitis who became hypotensive/tachycardic in HD.
   .
   # Hypotension/tachycardia/sespis:  The most likely etiology of her
   hypotension in the setting of an ongoing infection seems to be sepsis
   exacerbated by her intrinsic pre-load dependence secondary to a high
   LVOT gradient from assymmetric septal hypertrophy.  It does not seem
   that LV outflow tract obstruction is the primary process resulting in
   hypotension, but it does have implications in how her hypotension
   should be managed. Strongly favor aggressive fluid resucitation
   (although it may lead to intubation in [**Last Name (un) 9917**] anuric pt) over pressor
   support as her cardiac output should respond significantly to increased
   end diastolic volumes.  If pressors necessary would strongly favor neo
   over levophed to increase filling time and not increase LVOT gradient
   with increased inotropy.  Possiblity of adding gentamicin to her
   current Abx discussed with ID who recommended holding off for now--will
   reconsider if clinical status declines overnight.
   -- Broadened gram negative covg with cefepime instead of ceftriaxone
   -- Last vanco trough 17. Gave another dose of 1g  per pharmacy's
   recommendation; check level this am
   -- consider more Albumin
   -- IVF to miantain HR ~110 and MAP above 60; neo if pressor necessary
   --US of right arm graft to determine if source of infxn
   .
   # MRSA bacterimia: as above, continue vancomycin. Surveillance
   cultures.
   # MRSA peritonitis: Seeded from the blood? Seems to be an odd organism
   for SBP as the primary process. S/p second diagnositc paracentesis this
   am. Holding on therapeutic tap given septic physiology/ hypotension.
   -- vancomycin as above, f/u tap, albumin as above
   # ESLD: Pt is on the transplant list. Synthetic function seems
   relatively intact. Hepatology consulting.
   # Elevated troponin/ new wall mtn abnormaility: Pt may have missed an
   MI at some point since her last echo in [**Month (only) **].  This echo is done
   in the setting of sepsis at a much higher heart rate and may reflect
   some demand ischemia in the hypokinetic region.  Low CK argues against
   infarct. Septal q-waves and small apical aneurysm argue in favor of
   missed infarct.
   -- cardiology recs
   -- no indication for treatent of ACS, troponin attributable to renal
   failure

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a medical history of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), polycystic liver disease, and a high resting left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient. She is currently being treated for MRSA bacteremia and peritonitis. The patient presented with hypotension, tachycardia, and sepsis during her HD session. 

The most likely etiology of her hypotension is sepsis exacerbated by her intrinsic preload dependence secondary to a high LVOT gradient from asymmetric septal hypertrophy. The patient's cardiac output should respond significantly to increased end-diastolic volumes. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is favored over pressor support due to her preload dependence. If pressors are necessary, neosynephrine (neo) is preferred over norepinephrine (Levophed) to increase filling time and not increase LVOT gradient with increased inotropy. The possibility of adding gentamicin to her current antibiotic regimen was discussed with the infectious disease team, but it was decided to hold off for now.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia and peritonitis, and cefepime instead of ceftriaxone for broad-spectrum coverage. The last vancomycin trough level was 17, and another"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   63 yo F with PCKD s/p bilateral nephrectomies on HD, polycystic liver
   dz, and high resting LVOT gradient, currently being treated for MRSA
   bacterimia and peritonitis who became hypotensive/tachycardic in HD.
   .
   # Hypotension/tachycardia/sespis:  The most likely etiology of her
   hypotension in the setting of an ongoing infection seems to be sepsis
   exacerbated by her intrinsic pre-load dependence secondary to a high
   LVOT gradient from assymmetric septal hypertrophy.  It does not seem
   that LV outflow tract obstruction is the primary process resulting in
   hypotension, but it does have implications in how her hypotension
   should be managed.  Responded well to IVF getting a total of 2.75
   liters on the day of tx to MICU
resp status remained stable, pt not
   requiring more than 1L NS.
   -- gram negative covg from cefepime back to ceftriaxone
   -- Last vanco trough 50. holding for now, CHECK LEVEL TOMORROW
   -- IVF to miantain HR ~110 and MAP above 60; neo if pressor necessary
   --US of right arm graft showed no obvious infxn, but did reveal
   brachial DVT
   .
   # MRSA bacterimia: as above, continue vancomycin. Surveillance
   cultures.
   # MRSA peritonitis: Seeded from the blood? Seems to be an odd organism
   for SBP as the primary process. S/p second diagnositc paracentesis
   showing improvement in WBC.
   -- vancomycin as above, f/u tap, albumin as above
   # ESLD: Pt is on the transplant list. Synthetic function seems
   relatively intact. Hepatology consulting.
   --THERAPEUTIC PARACENTESIS today, goal is 2L out, will send studies
   inclding fungal cx per ID recs
   # Elevated troponin/ new wall mtn abnormaility: Pt may have missed an
   MI at some point since her last echo in [**Month (only) **].  This echo is done
   in the setting of sepsis at a much higher heart rate and may reflect
   some demand ischemia in the hypokinetic region.  Low CK argues against
   infarct. Septal q-waves and small apical aneurysm argue in favor of
   missed infarct.
   -- cardiology recs
   -- no indication for treatent of ACS, troponin attributable to renal
   failure

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of polycystic kidney disease, who has undergone bilateral nephrectomies and is currently on hemodialysis (HD). She also has polycystic liver disease and a high resting left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient due to asymmetric septal hypertrophy. The patient is being treated for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and peritonitis.

The patient presented with hypotension and tachycardia during HD, which was initially thought to be due to sepsis exacerbated by her intrinsic pre-load dependence secondary to the high LVOT gradient. However, it seems that the LVOT obstruction is not the primary cause of hypotension but does have implications for management. The patient responded well to intravenous fluid (IVF) administration and did not require more than 1 liter of normal saline.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including ascites, impaired skin integrity, diarrhea, hepatic failure (fulminant), renal failure (end-stage), and hypotension (not in shock). She also has an elevated troponin level and a new wall motion abnormality, which may indicate a missed myocardial infarction (MI).

The patient's current plan includes continuing vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia and peritonitis, therapeutic paracentesis to drain ascites, and consultation with hepatology. The patient is on"
