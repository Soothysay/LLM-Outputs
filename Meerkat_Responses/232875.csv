   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**]):  Underlying COPD, heavy
   smokers.  CT somewhat unusual with increased septal thickening that may
   suggest interstitial lung disease or acute infection. (Not much
   fibrosis to suggest IPF).  No clear evidence of PNA, but reasonable to
   treat with levoflox
   for bronchitis associated with COPD.
      -  Continue steroids
   High WBC:  check C. diff since he has been on antibiotics
   (azithromycin) for two months.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was found unresponsive at a social function, wheezing and cyanotic. He was intubated, placed on pressors, and then weaned off pressors. The patient is still requiring ventilation and has been started on steroids in the MICU.

24-hour events include the placement of an arterial line and multi-lumen line. Allergies, infusions, and other medications are documented.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. The patient's vital signs show a stable blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature, but slightly low oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also noted.

Physical examination reveals crackles in the bibasilar region, diminished breath sounds, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and no neurologic assessment due to sedation.

Lab results show normal sodium, potassium, and glucose levels, but elevated white blood cell count. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and plan include hypotension, respiratory failure due to underlying COPD, and the possibility of an acute infection. The patient will continue on steroids, and antibiotics will be continued for bronchitis associated with COPD. A high WBC count is noted, and Clostridium difficile should be checked since the patient has been on antibiotics for two months."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was found unresponsive and cyanotic while sitting on a toilet. He was intubated at the hospital after initial attempts by emergency medical services (EMS). The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is now off pressors. However, his etiology of respiratory arrest remains uncertain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory arrest: The patient's initial presentation with respiratory arrest suggests a potential life-threatening complication. The underlying cause needs further investigation to determine the appropriate treatment approach.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology. It could be due to sedation or other factors. Monitoring the patient's blood pressure and adjusting treatment accordingly will be crucial to managing this complication.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient exhibits leukocytosis, which could indicate a reactive response or an infectious process. Further evaluation through cultures and imaging is necessary to determine the cause and guide treatment.

4. COPD exacerbation: Given the patient's history of COPD, it is possible that he is experiencing an acute exacerbation. Treating the patient for an acute exacerbation, obtaining further history, and coordinating with the patient's primary care physician will be important in managing this complication.

5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored and managed to maintain proper balance."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of COPD, who was found unresponsive and cyanotic while sitting on the toilet. He has been intubated and is currently off pressors. The etiology of his respiratory arrest is uncertain, with potential causes including COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, seizure, or other factors. He is being treated for respiratory distress with bronchodilators and steroids.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Arrest: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory arrest, which is a medical emergency. The cause of this event is still uncertain, but possible causes include COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, seizure, or other factors.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, although it is unclear what the exact cause is. Sedation may have contributed to this issue, but the patient is now off pressors and has a CVP of 11.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to a reactive process or an infectious process. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
4. COPD Exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and it is unclear how well-controlled his condition is. He has been treated for an acute exacerbation of COPD with bronchodilators and steroids.
5. Pneumonia: Although the patient's troponin levels are not elevated, indicating a lower likelihood of"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of COPD, tobacco use, who was found unresponsive and cyanotic while sitting on a toilet after experiencing progressive shortness of breath. He was intubated at the hospital but is now off pressors. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 147/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The patient's medical history includes a prior myocardial infarction, as evidenced by inferior and infero-lateral akinesis on an echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 55%. The patient is also taking medications for hypertension, including captopril 25 mg three times a day. 

In terms of the patient's progress, he was extubated and given lorazepam for nerves at 2100 hours. He received Lasix 20 mg in the morning and repeated the dose in the evening, resulting in diuresis of -2.5 liters. The patient's allergies are documented as a reaction to antibiotics, specifically levofloxacin and vancomycin. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and troponin levels, as well as slightly elevated blood glucose. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, creatinine, potassium, sodium, magnesium,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of COPD, tobacco use, who was found unresponsive and cyanotic while sitting on a toilet after experiencing progressive shortness of breath. He was intubated at the hospital and is now extubated. The patient has a history of inferior and inferolateral akinesis (prior myocardial infarction) with an ejection fraction of 55%. He is taking medications for hypertension and has been diagnosed with respiratory arrest, hypotension, leukocytosis, COPD exacerbation, coronary artery disease, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of COPD, which puts him at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and exacerbation of COPD.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: Given the patient's history of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease, he is at risk for cardiac complications like arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial ischemia.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and changes in antibiotic therapy suggest a possible infection, which can lead to sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and hospitalization increase the risk of developing blood clots, which can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a PE.
5. Medication Side Effects: The patient is on multiple medications, including antihypertensives, diuretics, and antibiotics. These medications can have side effects that may impact his overall health and well-being.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for these potential complications and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Regular assessment of vital signs, respiratory status, cardiac function, and laboratory values will help in early detection and management of any complications that may arise."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old man with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented to the hospital with respiratory failure. The patient was intubated, placed on pressors, and extubated yesterday. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 163/74 mmHg to 125/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets, with slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal limits. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs, trace edema in both lower extremities, and normal neurologic function. 

The assessment and plan include several conditions such as hypertension, anxiety, hypoxemia, liver function abnormalities, COPD with acute exacerbation, tobacco use, respiratory failure (not ARDS), leukocytosis, hypotension (not shock), and coronary artery disease. 

The plan is to continue prednisone and standing bronchodilators for COPD exacerbation, consult pulmonary on call-out to the floor, and provide coronary artery disease management including adding aspirin, checking lipids, and considering beta-blocker/ACE"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of COPD, tobacco use, who was found unresponsive and cyanotic while sitting on a toilet after experiencing progressive shortness of breath. He was initially intubated at the hospital, extubated the following day, and transferred to the regular medical floor. However, he was then returned to the ICU due to new hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient is currently extubated and tolerating a facemask well. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 137/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He has diffuse wheezes on pulmonary examination, and his arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 57 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 234.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and low platelet count of 121 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current diagnoses include hypercarbic respiratory failure likely due to mucous plugging, COPD exacerbation, and possible contribution"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of COPD, tobacco use, found unresponsive and cyanotic while sitting on the toilet after several days of progressive shortness of breath. He was intubated at the hospital (first attempted by EMS), extubated the day following admission, and transferred to the regular medical floor on January 27th. However, he was returned to the ICU with new hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to mucus plugging as seen on bronchoscopy in combination with COPD exacerbation, possibly worsened by high flow oxygen leading to CO2 retention. There is also a low suspicion for pneumonia (PNA), but it will be monitored with white blood cell count and fever. The patient is currently extubated and tolerating a facemask well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): Although there is a low suspicion for PNA at the moment, it is important to monitor the patient's white blood cell count and fever to rule out any potential infection.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD may worsen due to mucus plugging and the current respiratory failure. It is crucial to manage his symptoms and prevent further exacerbations.
3. Hypertension: Although the patient's hypertension has resolved, there may be hypertensive episodes in the setting of anxiety."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of COPD, tobacco use, who was found unresponsive and cyanotic while sitting on a toilet after several days of progressive shortness of breath. The patient was intubated at the hospital (first attempted by EMS), extubated the next day, and transferred to the regular medical floor on [1-27]. However, due to new hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure, the patient was transferred back to the ICU.

The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely caused by mucous plugging as seen on bronchoscopy in combination with a COPD exacerbation, possibly worsened by high flow oxygen resulting in CO2 retention. The patient is currently intubated on the medical floor without incident. There are no signs of new ischemia on the EKG, although there was some enzyme leak likely due to [12-31] strain on admission.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Intubated due to mucous plugging and COPD exacerbation. Mechanical ventilation, AC (assist control) mode with increased minute ventilation to decrease CO2 levels to approximately 50%. Albuterol every 4 hours, ipratropium every 6 hours, Solumedrol 80 IV every 8 hours, calcium gluconate, and acid suppression. Follow-up BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) and sputum culture, repeat EKG, levofloxacin IV, cefepime IV, vancomycin IV with a plan to discontinue if BAL is negative in 72 hours ([2200-1-31]). Humidified vent for improved airway secretion movement. Post-extubation consider chest PT, [Name (NI) 11783].

2. Hypotension: Suspect medication effect as the primary source (Lasix, Diltiazem, Propofol, Etomidate, Succinate). Could also consider septic physiology with worsening PNA (pneumonia) vs breath-stacking and increased PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) with poor vascular return. Echo with some dysfunction and posterior akinesis. Bolus 500cc, calcium gluconate for Diltiazem, if worsens, check for auto-PEEP vs take briefly off ventilator, follow-up cultures.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of COPD, tobacco use, found unresponsive and cyanotic while sitting on the toilet. He was intubated and transferred to the ICU due to progressive shortness of breath and respiratory failure. The patient was extubated the day following admission but was later readmitted to the ICU with new hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's current condition suggests a possible exacerbation of COPD, which can lead to hypercarbic respiratory failure due to impaired gas exchange.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): There is a low suspicion for PNA, but it should be monitored through WBC count and fever.
3. Volume overload: The patient has been receiving fluids, which may contribute to volume overload. This can increase the risk of heart failure or pulmonary edema.
4. Hypertension: Although the patient's blood pressure has resolved, there have been a few episodes of hypertension during times of anxiety. Monitoring blood pressure and managing stress levels will be important.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct level is stable, but it should be monitored for any changes.
6. Tobacco use: The patient is an active smoker, which increases the risk of respiratory complications and impairs healing.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels should be monitored regularly to ensure they are within the normal range"
