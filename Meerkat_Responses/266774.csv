 BACTEREMIA
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 75F with severe vascular disease and
   chronic kidney disease presenting in transfer with hypotension, ARF and
   anuria and GAS bacteremia.
    # Sepsis. Pt meets criteria for sepsis given hypotension, leukocytosis
   and bandemia. GAS bacteremia is very likely source. Pt with no recent
   complaints of pharyngitis, most likely sources are multiple ulcers on
   lower extremities.
   -Has central access
   -Hydrate with D5bicarb to goal CVP 10-12
   -Monitor lactates and mental status as UOP less likely representative
   of fluid status.
   - f/u CT abd final read
   -off levophed
   - Cont unasyn and clinda
   # GAS bacteremia. Likely due to extensive skin breakdown on LEs.
   Surgery consulted to eval for necrotizing fasciitis.  Based on history
   (ulcerations present for ~2-3 weeks) and exam without rapidly expanding
   erythyema or crepitus, this is unlikely. Pt with severe arterial
   insufficiency on exam.
   -Double coverage with unasyn and clindamycin
   -surveillance blood cultures
   -[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 9672**] [**Location (un) **] for sensitivities on GAS from [**8-3**]
   -Surgery input appreciated, f/u recs
   -Vascular surgery, f/u recs - want Una boots. Thinks this is venous not
   arterial but still want arteriogram

   -Multipodus boots
   # Renal failure. Appears to be acute on chronic. Last Cr on labs from
   [**2-27**] was 3.0.  Elevated phos argues for chronic component as well.
   Likely acute worsening in setting of hypotension/sepsis.  Had rare eos
   on UA at OSH, however ARF predated any new meds to raise suspicion for
   AIN. CKs minimally elevated, not c/w rhabdo.
   -Will use D5 Bicarb or LR for rescuscitation.
   -Renal consulted for the am to eval need for CVVH (indication would be
   acidemia) vs. HD.
   -Phos binder
   -renally dose abx, avoid IV contrast.
   -given oliguria, pt may need intubation if develops pulm edema after
   fluid rescusitation. Discussed with pt and family.
   -Hold ACEI
   # Coagulopathy. INR 1.4-->1.5.  ? Evolving DIC
   -Active T&S
   -DIC labs suggest chronic DIC if any. If INR continues to go up,
   consider peripheral smear
   # Altered mental status - Ddx includes hypotension/hypoperfusion vs

   outpatient. Basline cr in low to mid 30s, is at or slightly below
   baseline at 33.2, although in setting of likely being
   under-rescusitated this may be artificially high.
   -Keep active T&S
   -monitor
   # CAD. Pt has extensive coronary disease, s/p 4 vessel CABG followed by
   stenting in [**2197**]/[**2198**].  On plavix, BB, ACEI and ASA.  > 1 year out from
   stents which were bare metal.  Pt is very high risk to have a repeat
   cardiac event, but given sepsis and hypotension with recent profound
   bradycardia at OSH, will hold anti-platelet agents and BB.  Holding
   ACEI for ARF and hypotension.
   # HL - Continue statin
   # DM - ISS
   # HTN - holding antihypertensives (amlopdipine, ACEI and BB) for

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of severe vascular disease and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted with hypotension, acute renal failure, anuria, and GAS bacteremia. The patient has impaired skin integrity with multiple ulcers on his lower extremities, which is likely the source of the GAS bacteremia. He also has a urinary tract infection caused by Klebsiella.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis due to hypotension, leukocytosis, and bandemia. GAS bacteremia is the likely source of sepsis.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with elevated creatinine levels. This could be due to hypotension and sepsis.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, suggesting a possible evolving disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Altered mental status: The patient has an altered mental status, which could be due to hypotension/hypoperfusion, uremia, or medication effects.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a history of a UTI caused by Klebsiella, which was previously treated with levoquin.
6. Anemia: The patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia and is on epogen as an outpatient.
7. Coronary artery disease ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with severe vascular disease and chronic kidney disease. He presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, anuria, and GAS bacteremia. The patient has extensive skin breakdown on his lower extremities and diffuse soft tissue edema. He also has a history of iron deficiency anemia and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is likely suffering from sepsis due to GAS bacteremia and extensive skin breakdown on the lower extremities. Immediate measures should be taken to manage his fluid status, monitor lactates and mental status, and continue appropriate antibiotics.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with elevated phosphorus levels. He requires careful monitoring of his renal function and may require dialysis to manage uremia and fluid overload.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a potential coagulation disorder. Further evaluation is necessary to determine if this is chronic DIC or another underlying cause.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status which could be due to hypotension/hypoperfusion, uremia, or medication effects. It is important to minimize sedatives, discuss the need for dialysis with the renal team, and maintain adequate perfusion.

5. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a history of Klebsiella UTI, but the current urine culture results are pending"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with severe vascular disease and chronic kidney disease presenting in the ICU with hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), anuria, and GAS bacteremia. The patient has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently on various medications including anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has GAS bacteremia, which is likely due to extensive skin breakdown on his lower extremities. There is also evidence of leukocytosis, suggesting an ongoing infection.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has severe arterial insufficiency on examination, which can lead to poor wound healing and further risk of infection.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine levels, indicating impaired renal function. This may require dialysis and careful management of fluid and electrolyte balance.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, suggesting a possible coagulation disorder. This could increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which can be attributed to hypotension/hypoperfusion, uremia, or medication effects. Close monitoring is necessary, and minimizing sed"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with severe vascular disease and chronic kidney disease who presented with hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), anuria, and GAS bacteremia. The patient has extensive skin breakdown on both lower extremities and is at high risk for reinfection. He also has a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and stenting. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, potential evolving disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has GAS bacteremia and extensive skin breakdown, which increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Reinfection: Due to the patient's severe arterial insufficiency and skin breakdown, there is a high risk of reinfection even if the current septicemia resolves.
3. Impaired wound healing: The patient's wounds are unlikely to heal due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
5. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient has a pre-existing chronic kidney disease, and his current condition may worsen his renal function.
6. Cardiac events: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG, putting him at high risk for recurrent cardiac events.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with severe vascular disease and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted with hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), anuria, and GAS bacteremia. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with some readings indicating hypoglycemia. Continuous monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further episodes.

2. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) without critical limb ischemia: The patient has severe arterial insufficiency in her lower extremities, which increases the risk of impaired skin integrity and potential wound complications.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, likely exacerbated by hypotension and sepsis. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, including consideration for dialysis, are required.

4. Bacteremia: The patient is currently experiencing GAS bacteremia, which is likely due to extensive skin breakdown in her lower extremities. Active surveillance blood cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to manage and prevent further infection.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's lower extremities have wounds that are unlikely to heal due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD). There is an increased risk of reinfection even if septicemia resolves. Wound care management and potential revascularization procedures may be required.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with severe vascular disease and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, acute renal failure, and GAS bacteremia. She has central access, a CVP of 16, and is on various medications including heparin, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 100/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her renal function is still impaired, and she is anuric. The patient has peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia and impaired skin integrity due to extensive skin breakdown on her lower extremities. She also has hypoglycemia, anemia, and a history of coronary artery disease with previous CABG and stenting. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Reinfection of lower extremity wounds due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and septicemia.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure, which could worsen if not managed properly.
3. Possible development of pulmonary edema after fluid resuscitation.
4. Altered mental status, which could be due to hypotension/hypoperfusion, uremia, or medication effects.
5. Coagulopathy, as indicated by an elevated INR.
6. Complications related to central venous catheterization.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with severe vascular disease and chronic kidney disease presenting with hypotension, acute renal failure, anuria, and GAS bacteremia. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoglycemia, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, bacteremia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being managed for sepsis, wound care, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, altered mental status, urinary tract infection, anemia, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing low blood sugar levels, which can lead to weakness, confusion, and even loss of consciousness if not managed properly.
2. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient has severe arterial insufficiency, which increases the risk of critical limb ischemia and potential limb loss if not managed appropriately.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to an accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances. This can result in fluid overload, electrolyte disturbances, and acid-base imbalance if not treated promptly.
4. Bacteremia: The presence of GAS bacteremia indicates a systemic infection that can spread to other organs and potentially lead to septicemia or sepsis if not treated effectively.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has wounds on her lower extremities that are unlikely"

   LEs. Pt with severe arterial insufficiency on exam.  WBC trending down
   today
   -CVP 16 today, no hydration needed
   -Monitor lactates (down to 1.0 yesterday) and mental status as UOP less
   likely representative of fluid status.
   - Cont unasyn D1 [**8-5**]; d/c

   -surveillance blood cultures from [**8-5**], [**8-6**], [**8-7**].
   -awaiting ctx on GAS sent to [**Hospital1 **] from OSH
   #LE wounds: wounds unlikely to heal due to PAD, increasing risk of
   reinfection even if septicemia resolves.  Vascular surgery can hold off
   on angio for now given ARF.
   - remove dressings and monitor today
   - per ID can have intervention if necessary
   -Vascular surgery-does not want unna boots; f/u with them if wounds
   appear worse
   -continue current wound care
   # Renal failure. Appears to be acute on chronic. Last Cr on labs from
   [**2-27**] was 3.0.  Elevated phos argues for chronic component as well.
   Likely acute worsening in setting of hypotension/sepsis.  Had rare eos
   on UA at OSH, however ARF predated any new meds to raise suspicion for
   AIN. CKs minimally elevated, not c/w rhabdo.
   - hold off on IVF for now because appears euvolemic
   -send urine lytes/eos
   -Will use NS or LR for rescuscitation if needed
   -Renal consulted , does not rec CVVH, reassess today.
   -Phos binder

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with severe vascular disease and chronic kidney disease who presented in transfer with hypotension, acute renal failure, and anuria. The patient also has a history of GAS bacteremia, impaired skin integrity, and peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia. The patient's current conditions include sepsis, renal failure, bacteremia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 136/56 mmHg, heart rate of 61 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated blood glucose levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormalities in electrolyte levels. The patient has ongoing infections, including a urinary tract infection and bacteremia. The patient's mental status is altered, and there are concerns about fluid status and the need for dialysis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications related to sepsis due to the ongoing GAS bacteremia and impaired skin integrity.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure on top of chronic kidney disease, which may worsen if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been in the 60s, indicating a risk for hypoglycemia.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 75-year-old female with severe vascular disease and chronic kidney disease.
- She presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, and anuria.
- She also has gas bacteremia, likely due to extensive skin breakdown.
- The patient's pain requires continuous management, and she is being transitioned to oral pain medication.
- Her renal function is improving, but she still has elevated creatinine levels.
- She has impaired skin integrity, which is a concern for calciphylaxis.
- The patient's blood glucose levels are poorly controlled, and she is at risk for hypoglycemia.
- Her coagulation profile is within normal limits.
- She has altered mental status, which may be due to hypotension/hypoperfusion, uremia, or medication effects.
- She has a history of urinary tract infection and coronary artery disease.
- The patient's medications include heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has gas bacteremia, indicating an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, and she is experiencing acute renal failure. This can progress to AKI if not managed appropriately.
3. Calciphylaxis: The patient has high PTH levels and pain, which raises concern for calciphylaxis. This is a"

 ISS. Hypoglycemia o/n likely [**2-20**] lack of desire to take PO.
   Continue observe overnight, and discuss NG tube and tube feeds tomorrow
   if poor PO intake persists.
   -pt will not get NG tube for feeds.
   # Coagulopathy. INR 1.4 and stable
   -Active T&S
   -DIC labs suggest chronic DIC if any. If INR continues to go up,
   consider peripheral smear
   # Altered mental status - Ddx includes hypotension/hypoperfusion vs
   uremia vs medication effect; today appeared worse after Morphine
   -recheck in pm given BUN which continues to rise; would be an
   indication for dialysis if not improved
   -Minimize sedatives
   -Discuss need for dialysis with renal
   # UTI - OSH cx grew pan-sensitive klebsiella. Started on levaquin on
   [**8-3**].
   -Unasyn will cover klebsiella
   # Anemia. Currently stable.
   -Keep active T&S
   -monitor
   # CAD. Pt has extensive coronary disease, s/p 4 vessel CABG followed by
   stenting in [**2197**]/[**2198**].  On plavix, BB, ACEI and ASA.  > 1 year out from
   stents which were bare metal.  Pt is very high risk to have a repeat
   cardiac event, but given sepsis and hypotension with recent profound
   bradycardia at OSH, will hold anti-platelet agents and BB.  Holding
   ACEI for ARF and hypotension.
   # HL - Continue statin
   # HTN - holding antihypertensives (amlopdipine, ACEI and BB) for
   hypotension

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 75-year-old female with severe vascular disease and chronic kidney disease.
- She presented with hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), anuria, and GAS bacteremia.
- The patient has been experiencing pain requiring morphine IV, which has led to respiratory depression.
- There is concern for sepsis due to extensive skin breakdown on the lower extremities.
- Renal function is improving with a decrease in creatinine levels and urine output.
- The patient has been receiving antibiotics to treat GAS bacteremia.
- There is suspicion of calciphylaxis with high PTH, pain, and dermatology consultation.
- Wound care for the lower extremity wounds is ongoing.
- The patient has a history of diabetes, but hypoglycemia has been observed.
- Coagulopathy is present with an INR of 1.4.
- Altered mental status is suspected to be due to hypotension/hypoperfusion, uremia, or medication effect.
- UTI is being treated with levaquin.
- Anemia is stable.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous CABG and stenting.
- Medications for CAD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are being held due to the patient's current condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
