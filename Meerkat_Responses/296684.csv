","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of [Location (un) 2455] syndrome, who underwent small and large bowel resection. She is currently on chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a history of multiple line infections. The patient presented with worsening hypotension despite being 5 liters positive, and a femoral line was removed due to klebsiella bacteremia. The patient is currently on meropenem for klebsiella bacteremia, linezolid for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) urinary tract infection (UTI), and IV flagyl and PO vancomycin for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Her white blood cell count is elevated with over 90% neutrophils, which decreased overnight. The patient also has tenderness in her abdomen, and surgery consulted due to concern for C. diff. The patient's creatinine levels have fluctuated, indicating acute kidney injury (ARF). She is receiving aggressive hydration and her renal function is improving. The patient is also being treated for discitis/osteomyelitis, UTI, and bacteremia. Her lines include a tunneled (Hickman) line and a midline. She is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old female with [Location (un) 2455] syndrome who underwent small and large bowel resection. She has a history of chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN), multiple line infections, and limited access. The patient is currently experiencing sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control issues, and hypotension. Her blood cultures have revealed bacteremia with Klebsiella and CoNS, as well as a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Klebsiella. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 95/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's blood work indicates elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 57.0 K/uL, decreased hematocrit (Hct) of 29.2%, decreased platelet count (Plt) of 332, increased creatinine (Cr) of 1.4, and other lab abnormalities. The patient's assessment and plan include sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control, and hypotension. The plan involves bolusing with LR via the tunneled Hickman line, using peripheral Levo as needed, continuing Linezolid/Zosyn, administering cortisol in the morning, discussing empiric fungal coverage on rounds, placing a line when stable via IR, imaging when stable, and culturing ostomy output.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of sepsis without organ dysfunction indicates a systemic infection. If not properly managed, it can lead to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

2. Line-associated infections: The patient's history of multiple line infections suggests a higher risk for further infections related to central venous catheters or arterial lines. These infections can be serious and potentially life-threatening.

3. Klebsiella bacteremia/UTI: The presence of Klebsiella bacteremia and UTI indicates a significant infection caused by this antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and implement measures to prevent the spread of Klebsiella.

4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to increased ostomy output or septic shock. If not managed promptly, it can lead to organ perfusion issues and potential organ dysfunction.

5. Pain control: The patient's pain control issues need to be addressed to ensure comfort and prevent complications associated with inadequate pain management.

6. Nutritional support: As the patient is on chronic TPN, it is essential to monitor her nutritional status and provide appropriate support to prevent malnutrition and associated complications.

7. Glycemic control: The patient's glycemic control should be monitored closely, considering her critical condition and the use of insulin in TPN"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of Gardner's syndrome, multiple bowel resections with short gut syndrome, and chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She was admitted with lower abdominal pain and lower back pain and subsequently found to have bacteremia with klebsiella and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, as well as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in her urine. The patient was hypotensive overnight with increased ostomy output and a low systolic blood pressure in the 60's mmHg. She is currently being treated for sepsis with linezolid for VRE urinary tract infection (UTI) and meropenem for bacteremia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of multiple infections, including bacteremia with klebsiella and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and VRE UTI. She is currently being treated for sepsis, which is a serious complication that can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Discitis: The patient has a discitis seen on lumbar spine imaging, which is an infection of the intervertebral disc space. This condition can cause back pain and potentially lead to neurological complications if not properly managed.
3. Line Infection: Given the patient's history of multiple line infections, there is a risk of developing another line infection, especially since she is currently"

","The patient is a 46-year-old female with short gut syndrome, recurrent line infections, and vascular occlusions. She presented with fever, hypotension, and oliguria. The patient has a history of multiple bowel resections and is on chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

On admission, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius. Her blood pressure was 104/57 mmHg, heart rate was 65 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 97% on nasal cannula. The patient was alert and oriented but unable to follow simple commands.

Physical examination revealed a thin, chronically ill-appearing individual with warm, pale skin. Abdominal tenderness was noted bilaterally in the lower quadrants without rebound. No peripheral pulses were palpable in the lower extremities.

Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 57.0 K/uL, elevated neutrophil percentage, and an increased lactate level of 8 mg/dL. Blood cultures were obtained, and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including linezolid, metronidazole, meropenem, and vancomycin. 

The patient's condition improved over the next few days, and she was transitioned off vasopressor support. Her fever resolved, and her renal function improved. She was able to tolerate oral fluids"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of short gut syndrome, chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN), multiple recurrent line infections, and vascular occlusions. She was admitted with fever and hot off to the neck (HOTN), as well as abdominal pain. 

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including linezolid, metronidazole, meropenem, and vancomycin. She is also on norepinephrine infusion for hemodynamic support and prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention. 

Her vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/57 to 117/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on nasal cannula. 

Her blood cultures have been drawn multiple times, and her stool culture is pending. The patient has a history of allergies to several medications, including Demerol, Compazine, Reglan, Betadine, and morphine. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, but her blood glucose level is on the lower end. 

The patient's abdominal pain is described as better,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of Gardner syndrome, short gut syndrome, multiple bowel resections, and chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She presented with fever and hot off to the nose (HOTN), as well as abdominal pain. She has a history of recurrent line infections and vascular occlusions. The patient was transferred for further evaluation and management.

24-hour events:
- Blood cultures were drawn at 02:00 AM, 09:32 PM, and 04:31 AM.
- Stool culture was obtained at 06:30 AM.
- Temporary midline line was placed.
- Tunneled (Hickman) line was stopped.
- Arterial line was started.

Assessment and plan:
The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to Klebsiella bacteremia, which may have originated from a line infection or discitis. Overnight, the patient's blood pressure and lactate levels improved, and the white blood cell count is trending down. The femoral line was discontinued yesterday, and a temporary midline line was placed. Repeat blood cultures are planned, along with surveillance blood cultures. Antibiotic therapy will continue with linezolid for Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) urinary tract infection (UTI) and meropenem for bacteremia. Oral vancomycin and Flagyl will be discontinued, and repeat Clostridium difficile (C. diff) testing"

","The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of Gardner syndrome, who presented to the hospital with lower abdominal pain and lower back pain. She has undergone multiple bowel resections with short gut syndrome and is on chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She has had recurrent line infections and vascular occlusions. The patient was transferred for fever and hot off, along with abdominal pain. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: 
- Temperature: 36.2 C (97.2 F)
- Heart rate: 65 bpm
- Blood pressure: 104/57 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to Klebsiella bacteremia, which may be related to a line infection or discitis. The source of infection is still under investigation. The patient's blood cultures have been taken multiple times, and stool culture has also been done. 

The patient's abdominal pain has been stable to mildly improved, and her liver function tests (LFTs) are stable. However, her white blood cell count (WBC) is significantly elevated, indicating an ongoing infection. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.21, which indicates acidosis. Her blood glucose level is within normal range at 86 mg/dL. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of (un) syndrome who underwent small and large bowel resection. She is currently on chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has had multiple line infections. The patient presented with hypotension, likely due to septic shock, and a history of Klebsiella bacteremia with an indwelling femoral line. The femoral line was removed on 9/24, and the plan was to resite the line in a couple of days once blood cultures remain negative. The patient is being treated with meropenem for Klebsiella bacteremia and linezolid for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) urinary tract infection (UTI). She also received LR boluses as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60, and a permanent line will be re-sited in 12 days if unable to replace, requiring trans-hepatic venous access. Surveillance blood cultures were sent.

The patient had leukocytosis with over 90% neutrophils, which decreased overnight. She was initially treated empirically with flagyl and PO vancomycin for Clostridium difficile (C. diff), but the test was negative. Surgery consulted and examined the patient, who has a tender abdomen, concern for C. diff. The patient's abdominal exam is too concerning, and a lumbar CT did not reveal the source of leukocytosis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of [location] syndrome, who underwent small and large bowel resection. She is currently on chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a history of multiple line infections. The patient presented with hypotension, likely due to septic shock, and had a previous episode of Klebsiella bacteremia associated with an indwelling femoral line. The femoral line was removed, and the plan was to re-site the line in a few days once blood cultures remain negative. She is being treated with meropenem for Klebsiella bacteremia and linezolid for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient also received lorazepam boluses and is expected to have a permanent line re-sited in 12 days. If unable to replace, trans-hepatic venous access may be required.

The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 57, which has decreased overnight to 29.3. There is concern for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and she was treated empirically with Flagyl and oral vancomycin. The C. diff test was negative, and the abdominal exam does not seem concerning. A lumbar CT scan was performed to examine for abdominal pathology, but no source of leukocytosis was found. It is believed to be secondary to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old female with [**Location (un) 2455**] syndrome, multiple bowel resections resulting in short gut syndrome, and chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She also has a history of vascular occlusions with 27 stents placed. The patient was admitted with an ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) urinary tract infection (UTI), leading to septic shock.

24-hour events include stopping Flagyl and PO vancomycin after a negative Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test. The patient's diet was advanced, and blood cultures from September 24th showed growth of Gram-negative rods (GNRs). The patient required an increased amount of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation (O2 sat) at approximately 90%. 

Allergies include oral Demerol, Compazine, Reglan, and morphine, as well as a reaction to Betadine Surgi-Prep. The patient has experienced nausea/vomiting and unknown reactions to morphine. The last doses of antibiotics were given on September 25th, including vancomycin, metronidazole, meropenem, and linezolid. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.1°C (98.7°F)

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with [**Location (un) 2455**] syndrome, multiple bowel resections resulting in short gut syndrome, and chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) since [**2123**]. She also has a history of multiple vascular occlusions with 27 stents. The patient was admitted with ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infection (VRE UTI), and developed septic shock.

24-hour events include stopping Flagyl and PO vancomycin after Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test negative, advancing diet, obtaining blood cultures, increasing oxygen requirement, and new pleural effusions.

Allergies include Demerol, Compazine, Reglan, Betadine, iodine, and morphine.

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on [**2145-9-25**] at 06:00 AM, metronidazole on [**2145-9-25**] at 08:00 AM, meropenem on [**2145-9-26**] at 06:05 AM, and linezolid on [**2145-9-26**] at 07:57 AM.

Infusions include hydromorphone, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications.

The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of [**Location (un) 2455**] syndrome, multiple bowel resections, and short gut syndrome. She is currently in the ICU for hot nodular obesity and abdominal pain. The patient has several allergies including Demerol, Compazine, Reglan, Betadine, Iodine, and Morphine. She has been on various antibiotics including Flagyl, vancomycin, metronidazole, meropenem, and linezolid.

24-hour events include stopping Flagyl and PO vancomycin since C. difficile test was negative, advancing diet, and obtaining blood cultures. The patient now requires more oxygen and has shown new O2 requirements today.

The patient has several medical and family history updates, review of systems, and physical examination findings. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature at 37.1 C (98.7 F), current temperature at 36.4 C (97.6 F), heart rate at 73 bpm (69-79), blood pressure ranging from 92/52 to 102/78 mmHg, respiratory rate at 15 breaths per minute (11-19), oxygen saturation at 93%, and sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 7,643 mL and output of 3,628 mL, resulting in a balance of 4,015 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through nasal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old female with [Location (un) 2455] syndrome, multiple bowel resections with resultant short gut syndrome on chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) since [2123], s/p multiple vascular occlusions with 27 stents. She was admitted with ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) urinary tract infection (UTI) and resultant septic shock. 

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to line sepsis, and the infected central line was removed on [9-24]. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is trending down and she is afebrile, indicating improvement. However, there is concern for chronic but worsening discitis, possibly as a source of repeated infection, and she may require a biopsy of L4-5. 

The patient is also experiencing hypotension (not in shock), edema, and hypoxemia. Her blood pressure is near 100 mmHg, and she has peripheral edema. The hypoxemia is likely due to aggressive intravenous fluid (IVF) resuscitation, which has resulted in bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe (LLL) collapse. 

The patient's current plan includes stopping IVF due to total body overload, tolerating mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55 as long as"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with [unlocated] syndrome, multiple bowel resections, and short gut syndrome on chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) since [2123]. She has a history of multiple vascular occlusions with 27 stents. The patient was admitted with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella bacteremia and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) urinary tract infection (UTI), and septic shock. 

24-hour events include blood cultures taken at 02:48 PM on 9/26/2145. The patient has allergies to Demerol, Compazine, Reglan, Betadine Surgi-Prep, and an unknown reaction to morphine. She received various antibiotics including Vancomycin, Metronidazole, Linezolid, and Meropenem. Other medications include Pantoprazole, Heparin Sodium, and Hydromorphone.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 36.8°C (98.3°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate (HR) of 69 bpm with a range of 69-79 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 101/71 mmHg to 102/99 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 10 breaths per minute with a range of 8-17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an input of 3,450 mL with an output of 3,360 mL, resulting in a balance of 90 mL. The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has a nasal cannula in place with a SpO2 of 96%. An arterial blood gas (ABG) result is noted as ///22. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin appearance, and peripheral pulses present. Chest examination shows symmetric expansion and clear breath sounds. Abdominal examination reveals a soft abdomen with bowel sounds present but diffuse tenderness. Extremities show 1+ edema in the right leg and 1+ edema in the left leg. Skin examination is not assessed. Neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive and responds appropriately but movement, tone, and other neurological assessments are not evaluated.

Laboratory results include white blood cell count (WBC) of 57.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.2 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 29.2%, platelet count (Plt) of 332 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.4 mg/dL, glucose of 86 mg/dL, and various other lab values"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with [unspecified location] syndrome, multiple bowel resections resulting in short gut syndrome on chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and a history of multiple vascular occlusions with 27 stents. The patient was admitted with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella bacteremia and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) urinary tract infection (UTI), leading to septic shock. The patient has undergone removal of a central venous catheter that was positive for blood culture (Klebsiella pneumoniae). The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, and subsequent blood cultures have been negative. However, there is concern for chronic but worsening discitis, possibly related to osteomyelitis as a potential source of repeated infection. The patient continues on meropenem (Day 3), which will be changed back to piperacillin-tazobactam for a 14-day course. The patient also continues on linezolid for UTI, with the last dose today (7-day course). The patient needs follow-up with orthopedics for discitis once acute issues are resolved, and may require a biopsy of L4-5.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line sepsis: The patient had a central venous catheter that was removed due to positive blood culture (Klebsiella pneumoniae)."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old individual with a history of multiple line infections, chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN), small and large bowel resection, and osteomyelitis with discitis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated for oral sphincter hematoma urinary tract infection (OSH UTI) and gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection.

The patient has been prescribed various antibiotics to target different microorganisms, including meropenem, linezolid, and zosyn. The meropenem was stopped and replaced with zosyn due to the growth of klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pna) in the blood culture. Linezolid has been continued indefinitely for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   46 y.o female with [**Location (un) 2455**] syndrome s/p small and large bowel
   resection on chronic TPN and hx of multiple line infections s/p femoral
   line removal, on meropenem, linezolid, IV flagyl, PO vancomycin
   #Hypotension: Likely from septic shock.  History of klebsiella
   Bacteremia with indwelling femoral line.  Treated through line once,
   presenting later with worsening hypotension.  Femoral line was removed
   on [**9-24**], with plan to resite line in a couple of days once blood
   cultures remain negative.  Baseline SBP in 80-90
   -meropenem for klebsiella bacteremia, day #3, follow-up organism
   identification and sensitivities
   -linezolid for VRE UTI, day #6 of 7
   -LR boluses as needed to maintain MAP>60
   -re-site permanent line in [**12-27**] days. If unable to replace, will require
   trans-hepatic venous access.
   -surveillance blood cx
   #Leukocytosis: wbc 57 with over 90% neutrophils, decreased to 29.3
   overnight.  Surgery consulted given patient has tender abdomen, concern
   for C.Diff.  Initially treated empirically with flagyl and Po vanc,
   then d/c
d after C.Diff negative X1.  Surgery consulted and reported
   abdominal exam too concerning.  Re-examined lumbar CT for abdominal
   pathology and CT did not reveal source of leukocytosis.  Possibly
   secondary to discitis/osteomyelitis, UTI, bacteremia.  Now improving on
   antibiotic therapy.
   -continue meropenem and linezolid
   - f/u cdiff toxin #2
   # Depression:
   -discontinue celexa in setting of linezolid administration
   #ARF: baseline Cr 0.6, now at 1.0 in the setting of recent
   hypotension.  Good UOP.  Suspect prerenal etiology vs. element of
   ATN.
   -continue with hydration, bolus as necessary

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 46-year-old female with [unspecified location] syndrome who underwent small and large bowel resection. She is currently on chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a history of multiple line infections. The patient's recent medical events include septic shock, klebsiella bacteremia, and removal of a femoral line. She is being treated with meropenem, linezolid, and IV flagyl for klebsiella bacteremia. The patient's baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) is in the range of 80-90 mmHg. The plan is to resite the line in a few days once blood cultures remain negative. 

The patient also has leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 57, which decreased to 29.3 overnight. Surgery was consulted due to the patient's tender abdomen and concern for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Initially, the patient was treated empirically with flagyl and PO vanc, but the C. diff test was negative. Surgery re-examined the patient and reported an abdominal exam that was concerning. A lumbar CT scan was performed to examine for abdominal pathology, but it did not reveal the source of leukocytosis. The possible causes of leukocytosis could be secondary to discitis/osteomyelitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), or bacteremia. The patient is now improving on"
