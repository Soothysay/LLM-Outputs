","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of recurrent diverticulitis and sigmoid colectomy. She is currently in the ICU with a protracted post-operative course complicated by persistent sinus tachycardia and acute renal failure. The patient presents acutely with hypotension and has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, intra-abdominal abscesses, bilateral pyelonephritis, sinus tachycardia, acute renal failure, anemia, malnutrition, tachypnea, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, GERD, and FEN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for severe sepsis with fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and hypotension. Potential sources of infection include intra-abdominal processes, pneumonia, and pyelonephritis. The large fluid collections in the abdomen, which were drained and identified as stool-like, indicate a possible source of infection.

2. Intra-abdominal Abscesses: The presence of two large fluid collections in the abdomen, one of which was drained and identified as stool-like, suggests the presence of intra-abdominal abscesses. These abscesses can cause localized infections and may lead to further complications if not properly managed.

3. Bilateral Pyeloneph"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Severe Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for severe sepsis with symptoms such as fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and hypotension. Potential sources of infection include intra-abdominal processes, pneumonia (PNA), and pyelonephritis. Immediate management should include fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and drainage of any abscesses.

2. Intraabdominal Abscesses: The presence of two large fluid collections in the abdomen, one of which was stool-like, suggests longstanding intraabdominal abscesses. Definitive management, such as an operative washout, may be required in addition to ongoing antibiotic therapy.

3. Bilateral Pyelonephritis: The patient likely has bilateral pyelonephritis, which is likely related to the abscesses. Continuing antibiotic therapy and monitoring urine output are essential.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a history of ARF, with an initial rise in creatinine to 1.6 following a contrast load. Hypotension and fluid repletion may contribute to the renal dysfunction. Management should include IV fluid boluses for volume depletion, maintenance fluids, and antibiotics.

5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), intra-abdominal bleed, chronic inflammation,"

   tachycardia. Meets sepsis criteria with potential sources including
   intra-abdominal processes, PNA, and pyelo. Severe because hypotension
   with oliguria. CT abd yielded  two very large fluid collections, one of
   which was drained and was stool like.

   infection and hypotension. Greatest concerns are infection or acute
   intraabdominal process.
   - Fluid resuscitation as above
   - pain control: IV morphine, can switch to PCA with morph/dilaudid
   - Serial abdominal exams
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.6. Previous rise to 1.6
   with simultaneous decrease in urine output to 5-10cc/hr s/p contrast
   load with CTA. On [**3-8**], back up to 1.3 with FeNa of 0.3% and
   hypotension. Fell to 1.0 on [**3-9**] with fluid repletion. Also related to

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of recurrent diverticulitis who underwent sigmoid colectomy. She is currently in the ICU with several medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are as follows:

1. Severe Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for severe sepsis due to fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and hypotension. Potential sources of infection include intra-abdominal processes, pneumonia, and pyelonephritis. Immediate fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy are required.

2. Intraabdominal Abscesses: The patient has two large fluid collections in the abdomen, one of which was drained and found to contain stool-like material. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and further drainage may be necessary, possibly requiring operative washout.

3. Bilateral Pyelonephritis: The patient likely has bilateral pyelonephritis, which is related to the abscesses. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and urine output should be closely monitored.

4. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia since her operation. This may be an appropriate response to pain, infection, and hypotension. Close monitoring for signs of infection or acute intraabdominal processes is necessary.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine level of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of recurrent diverticulitis who underwent sigmoid colectomy. She presented with hypotension and was diagnosed with severe sepsis due to potential sources including intra-abdominal processes, pneumonia, and pyelonephritis. The patient also has intra-abdominal abscesses, bilateral pyelonephritis, rash, sinus tachycardia, acute renal failure, anemia, malnutrition, tachypnea, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, GERD, and FEN. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 111/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine level, and platelet count, while other parameters are within normal range. The patient is currently receiving multiple antibiotics, fluids, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intra-abdominal abscesses: The patient has two large fluid collections in the abdomen, one of which was drained and found to be stool-like. This indicates the presence of intra-abdominal abscesses. If left untreated, these abscesses can lead to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of recurrent diverticulitis who underwent sigmoid colectomy. She presents with severe sepsis, intra-abdominal abscesses, bilateral pyelonephritis, a tender erythematous rash, sinus tachycardia, acute renal failure, anemia, malnutrition, tachypnea, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, GERD, and FEN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intra-abdominal abscesses: The patient has two large fluid collections in the abdomen, one of which was drained and found to be stool-like. There is a possibility of a second collection that may need to be drained. There is also a need for operative washout to manage the abscesses.
2. Bilateral pyelonephritis: The patient has symptoms and lab findings consistent with pyelonephritis, which is an infection of the kidneys. This condition needs to be treated with appropriate antibiotics and monitoring of urine output.
3. Rash: The patient has a tender erythematous rash over her right thigh. The differential diagnosis includes cellulitis (extension from an underlying abscess), venous thrombosis, or drug-induced rash. Antibiotics should cover possible cellulitis, and a lower extremity venous Doppler (LENS) should be done to evaluate for deep"

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of recurrent diverticulitis and sigmoid colectomy. She presents with hypotension, fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and oliguria. CT abdomen revealed two large fluid collections, one of which was drained and contained stool-like material. The patient has multiple medical complications including severe sepsis, intra-abdominal abscesses, bilateral pyelonephritis, rash, sinus tachycardia, acute renal failure, anemia, malnutrition, tachypnea, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, GERD, and FEN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria with fever, leukocytosis, and tachycardia. She also meets sepsis criteria with potential sources including intra-abdominal processes, pneumonia, and pyelonephritis. Her hypotension with oliguria indicates severe sepsis.
2. Intra-abdominal Abscesses: CT abdomen showed two large fluid collections, one of which was drained and contained stool-like material. This suggests the presence of intra-abdominal abscesses.
3. Bilateral Pyelonephritis: The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate a possible urinary tract infection that has spread to both kidneys.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male who underwent a sigmoid colectomy and is currently experiencing sepsis. The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Intraabdominal abscess/sepsis: The patient has a positive urine analysis (u/a) and wound culture growing E. coli, indicating a possible intraabdominal abscess or sepsis. This condition may require surgical intervention.

2. Bilateral pyelonephritis: The patient also has signs of bilateral pyelonephritis, as evidenced by the positive u/a. This could be due to the ascending infection from the intraabdominal abscess.

3. Rash: The patient has a rash on the upper right thigh and right flank, which may be indicative of infection, such as cellulitis, related to the intraabdominal abscess or pyelonephritis. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is also a concern, and the patient is planned to receive low molecular weight heparin (LE) for this.

4. Abdominal pain: The cause of the abdominal pain could be either pyelonephritis or peritonitis. Pain management with morphine or dilaudid at a low basal rate is recommended.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient is improving from acute renal failure, which was initially prerenal with a fractional excretion of sodium (FENA) of 0.3%. Continued hydration as needed is advised.

6. Anemia: The patient does not appear to have evidence of intra-abdominal bleed. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the anemia.

7. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with bands, metas, and monos, raising the possibility of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Further evaluation is required.

8. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished and requires nutritional support. A nutrition consult is recommended, considering the need for parenteral nutrition (PN) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

These are the potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case."

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old postoperative patient who underwent sigmoid colectomy and is now experiencing sepsis due to an intraabdominal infection (abscess related to bowel surgery) and pyelonephritis. The patient has shown clinical improvement after percutaneous drainage. Current treatment includes antimicrobials, pain management with morphine or dilaudid as needed, and continued hydration.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing further infections, particularly due to the presence of a rash on the upper right thigh and right flank, which may be cellulitis related to the intraabdominal abscess or pyelonephritis. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be important.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's edema in the lower extremities and tenderness of the calves may indicate a potential risk for DVT. It is crucial to monitor for symptoms such as swelling, redness, warmth, and pain in the legs, as well as consider performing a venous ultrasound if needed.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels indicate a potential risk for acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and adequate hydration will be necessary to prevent further deterioration.

4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level suggests the possibility of anemia. Monitoring the hemoglobin level and considering"

   - on antibiotics that should cover possible cellulitis
   - LENIs to evaluate for DVT given bilateral lower extremity pitting
   edema
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: This has been a persistent problem since her
   operation and likely represents an appropriate response to pain,
   infection and hypotension. Greatest concerns are infection or acute
   intraabdominal process.
   - Fluid resuscitation as above
   - pain control: IV morphine, can switch to PCA with morph/dilaudid
   - Serial abdominal exams

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of recurrent diverticulitis and sigmoid colectomy. She is currently in the ICU due to severe sepsis and has multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

1. Severe Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for severe sepsis, which includes fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and potential sources of infection such as intra-abdominal processes, pneumonia, and pyelonephritis. The hypotension with oliguria indicates poor organ perfusion.

2. Intraabdominal Abscesses: There are large fluid collections in the abdomen, one of which was drained and found to be stool-like. This suggests the presence of intraabdominal abscesses. Appropriate antibiotic coverage should be continued, and further management will depend on surgical recommendations.

3. Bilateral Pyelonephritis: The patient likely has bilateral pyelonephritis, which may be related to the abscesses. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and urine output should be closely monitored.

4. Rash: The patient has a tender erythematous rash over the right proximal and lateral thigh. Differential diagnoses include cellulitis, venous thrombosis, or drug-induced rash. Antibiotics should cover possible cellulitis, and lower extremity venous thrombosis should be evaluated"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of recurrent diverticulitis who underwent a sigmoid colectomy. She is currently in the ICU due to a protracted post-operative course complicated by persistent sinus tachycardia and acute renal failure. The patient presents acutely with hypotension and has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, likely secondary to intra-abdominal abscesses, pneumonia, and pyelonephritis. She also has pulmonary edema and hypoxia, which may be contributing to her respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever (Tmax: 38.2 C), tachycardia (HR: 109 bpm), hypotension (BP: 109/64 mmHg), and tachypnea (RR: 37 insp/min). Her oxygen saturation is at 91%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.9 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels indicating acute renal failure, and a low platelet count of 367 K/uL.

The patient has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources of infection, including intra-abdominal processes, pneumonia, and pyelonephritis. She is also receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate blood pressure and urine output. The drainage of an intra-abdominal abscess has been performed, and further drainage"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of recurrent diverticulitis who underwent sigmoid colectomy. She is currently in the ICU with several medical complications.

1. Severe Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for severe sepsis due to fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and hypotension. Potential sources of infection include intra-abdominal processes, pneumonia (PNA), and pyelonephritis. The CT abdomen revealed two large fluid collections, one of which was drained and contained fecal material.

2. Intraabdominal Abscesses: The patient has intraabdominal abscesses, likely causing the severe sepsis. Treatment includes antibiotics (Vanc, Zosyn), and the possibility of an operative washout if necessary. The second collection may need to be drained.

3. Bilateral Pyelonephritis: The patient likely has bilateral pyelonephritis, possibly related to the abscesses. Antibiotics should be continued, and urine output should be monitored.

4. Rash: The patient has a tender erythematous rash over her right thigh. Differential diagnoses include cellulitis (extension from an underlying abscess), venous thrombosis (given bilateral lower extremity pitting edema), or drug-induced rash. Antibiotics should cover possible cellulitis, and a Lower Extremity Nearing Index (LENI) should evaluate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

5. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia since her operation, which is likely an appropriate response to pain, infection, and hypotension. Fluid resuscitation, pain control, and serial abdominal exams should be continued.

6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 0.6, which rose to 1.6 with a decrease in urine output after contrast exposure. It then decreased to 1.0 with fluid repletion. The patient also has pyelonephritis. Treatment includes IV fluids, antibiotics, and monitoring of creatinine and electrolytes.

7. Anemia: The patient has anemia, with a possible cause being gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). Other causes include intra-abdominal bleed, chronic inflammation, or hemolysis. Transfusion should be given for hypoperfusion, and stool guaiac should be done.

8. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished, as indicated by low albumin levels and intolerance to oral intake. Considering total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to poor bowel sounds.

9. Tachypnea: The patient's tachypnea is likely due to discomfort, worsened by the recent contrast load. Monitoring for evolving metabolic acidosis should be continued.

10. Abdominal Pain/S/P Sigmoid Colectomy: The patient has ongoing abdominal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old postoperative day (POD) 14 patient who underwent sigmoid colectomy. They are currently experiencing sepsis attributed to intraabdominal infection (abscess related to bowel surgery and pyelonephritis). The patient's condition has not improved despite percutaneous drainage, and there is evidence of gradual clinical decline.

The patient also has an intraabdominal abscess/peritonitis, likely due to an anastomotic leak from the recent surgery. Monitoring and continuing drainage of intraabdominal collections are recommended, with the possibility of surgical exploration.

Additionally, the patient has a rash on their upper right thigh and right flank, which may be cellulitis and could be related to the intraabdominal abscess/peritonitis. There is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) based on lower extremity venous ultrasound.

The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, likely due to recent surgery complications including the abscess/peritonitis. Pain management with morphine or dilaudid as needed is advised.

Acute renal failure is improving, initially caused by prerenal factors with a fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) of 0.3%. Continue hydration as needed.

The patient has anemia, with no evidence of intra-abdominal bleeding. Monitoring hematocrit levels and considering transfusion to maintain a hematocrit level above 21% is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual presenting with respiratory distress and sepsis. They have been admitted to the ICU and are experiencing worsening symptoms, including tachypnea and increased FiO2 requirements. The patient has undergone a second percutaneous drain placement to address intraabdominal collections. They are requiring PCA pump for pain management. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa and morphine sulfate, as well as nausea and vomiting with morphine use. 

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever, elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. Their SpO2 levels are at 98%. They are on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery and have been intubated. The ABG results show normal pH, slightly low carbon dioxide levels, and normal oxygen saturation. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal pupils. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI) and normal heart sounds without murmurs. Peripheral vascular examination is incomplete due to lack of assessment in the radial and digital pulses. Skin examination is not assessed. Neurologic examination is also not assessed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.9 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, slightly low sodium level of 126 mg/dL, and elevated potassium level of 5.4 mEq/L."
