   Pt is a 72 yo female with PMHx of CAD, COPD, CHF EF 40% here with
   altered mental status and dyspnea.
   .
   # Dyspnea: Patient
s admission ABG with pCO2 at patient
s baseline, but
   normal pH, indicating a superimposing metabolic alkalosis on top of and
   opposing chronic CO2 retension/respiratory acidosis.  Metabolic
   alkalosis likely secondary to increased Lasix and contraction
   alkalosis.  Her dyspnea is likely a combination of chronic ventillatory
   failure and contraction alkalosis.
   No evidence for CHF (BNP 487), pneumonia (CXR without infiltrates), PE,
   or cardiac ischemia (EKG unchanged).
   - cont. BiPap
   - cont. home doses of advair, tiotropium and albeterol
   - stop prednisone, unlikely to be a COPD exacerbation.
   - hold diuresis as exam and [**Year (4 digits) **] (increased BUN/Cr) are consistent with
   being intravascularly dry
   .
   # Altered mental status/somnolence: Orientation at baseline.  Increased
   somnolence likely related to metabolic abnormalities, hypercarbia in
   the setting of BiPAP non-compliance, and multiple medications including
   oxycodone.  No white count or fever to suggest infection.
   - avoid opiates
   - use BiPAP at night
   - f/u UCx
   - f/u MS exam

   # Neck pain: Likely musculoskeletal vs. DJD changes. [**Month (only) 60**] have nerve
   impingement in the C2 region based on her pain. Normal strength.  CT C
   spine done on [**10-26**] as outpatient (ordered by PCP) which showed
   degenerative changes and limited study due to cervical positioning in
   lateral film. Pt cannot have MRI of her C spine due to her ICD.
   - ultram stopped in the past due to sleepiness.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%. She was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and dyspnea. The patient requires home oxygen and BiPAP but is non-compliant with BiPAP usage. Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 105/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has been since December 28th at 09:59 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's dyspnea may be due to a COPD exacerbation, which can lead to increased respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. CHF: The patient has a history of chronic diastolic CHF, and her current presentation could be exacerbated by this condition. Poor glycemic control and fluid overload can worsen heart failure symptoms.
3. Hypercarbia: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to hypercarbia caused by hypoventilation, especially considering her non-compliance with BiPAP usage. This can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood, causing confusion and other neurological symptoms.
4. Infection: Although there are no signs of leukocytosis or fever, the patient's altered mental status and dyspnea could be secondary to an underlying infection. Monitoring for any changes in vital signs or laboratory values is crucial.
5. Medication Overload: The patient is on multiple medications, including oxycodone, which could contribute to altered mental status. Assessing the appropriateness of these medications and potential interactions is essential.
6. ICD/Pacemaker Complications: The patient has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place. Complications such as lead dislodgement or battery depletion may occur and need to be considered.
7. Pneumonia: Although the chest X-ray does not show evidence of infection, pneumonia cannot be completely ruled out, especially considering the patient's COPD and recent non-compliance with BiPAP. Monitoring for any changes in respiratory status or laboratory values is necessary.

The patient's complex medical history and current presentation require close monitoring and careful management to address potential complications and improve her condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female with h/o CHF/COPD/CAD who is admitted in the setting of
   recent worsening of orthopnea and increased diuretic dosing at home.
   She is admitted with respiratory failure and requirementfor BIPAP in
   the setting of known obstructive lung disease and narcotic use for next
   pain.  She has a profound elevation of HCO3-suggesting signficant
   chronic compromise of ventilation. She in response to intervention has
   had improvement in alertness and responsiveness.  Initial ABG was
   7.40/75/76 which represents signficiant combination of respiratory
   acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])--At this time her exam does
   not appear to be one of severe volume overload based upon exam at this
   time--with minimal peripheral edema despite some modest suggestion of
   pulmonary edema on initial CXR.  We do not have a story of acute change
   over time and do not have a clear picture of fever/phlegm arguing for
   pneumonia, she has no evidence of acute congestive heart failure, she
   has background combined obstructive and restrictive ventilatory defect
   which is likely at play.
   -Pred 60mg/d-->Will D/C with PCO2 at baseline, decreased lungs with
   good air movement.
   -Albuterol/Atrovent
   -Advair continuing
   -Titatropium
   -WIll hold further diuresis
   -Return to O2 and BIPAP as at baseline
   -Congestive Heart Failure-
   -Continue with B-blocker
   -Return to baseline diuretic dosing
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)--Likely a combination of chronic
   hypercarbia, new metabolic alkalosis and narcotic dosing for pain.
   This is in the setting of background schizophrenia.
   -Hold Narcotics
   -Zoloft
   -Dilantin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD).
- She was admitted due to worsening orthopnea and increased diuretic dosing at home.
- The patient presented with respiratory failure and required non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in the form of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP).
- The patient received Narcan, which showed some improvement in respiratory status.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/59 mmHg to 128/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on high-flow nasal cannula with FiO2 of 80%.
- The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 75 mmHg, and HCO3- of 76 mEq/L, suggesting a combination of respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
- Physical examination findings include diminished breath sounds and signs of pulmonary edema on initial chest X-ray.
- The patient's mental status has improved following interventions.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, glucose, lactate, potassium, and bicarbonate levels.
- The patient's assessment includes acute respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%. She is currently admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and dyspnea. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/35 to 126/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 86%. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula. Her fluid balance shows an intake of 743 mL and output of 1,123 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 380 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of potassium, glucose, and troponin-T, while her white blood cell count is within normal range. The patient's physical examination reveals tender paraspinal muscles in the neck, crackles in the left lung base, a regular sinus rhythm, and no peripheral edema. The patient is also experiencing neck pain and headache, which is likely due to arthritis or nerve impingement. The patient has a history of CABG and reports chest pain at home, for which she is taking nitro. She requires an outpatient stress test and continuation of her current medications, including ASA, statin, and Toprol XL. The patient has chronic diastolic CHF,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 yo female with PMHx of CAD, COPD, CHF EF 40% here with
   altered mental status and dyspnea.
   .
   # Dyspnea: Patient
s admission ABG with pCO2 at patient
s baseline, but
   normal pH, indicating a superimposing metabolic alkalosis on top of and
   opposing chronic CO2 retension/respiratory acidosis.  Metabolic
   alkalosis likely secondary to increased Lasix and contraction
   alkalosis.  Her dyspnea is likely a combination of chronic ventillatory
   failure and contraction alkalosis.
   No evidence for CHF (BNP 487), pneumonia (CXR without infiltrates), PE,
   or cardiac ischemia (EKG unchanged).
   - cont. BiPap
   - cont. home doses of advair, tiotropium and albeterol
   - stop prednisone, unlikely to be a COPD exacerbation.
   - hold diuresis as exam and labs (increased BUN/Cr) are consistent with
   being intravascularly dry
   .
   # Altered mental status/somnolence: Orientation at baseline.  Increased
   somnolence likely related to metabolic abnormalities, hypercarbia in
   the setting of BiPAP non-compliance, and multiple medications including
   oxycodone.  No white count or fever to suggest infection.
   - avoid opiates
   - use BiPAP at night
   - f/u UCx
   - f/u MS exam
   .
   # Neck pain: Likely musculoskeletal vs. DJD changes. [**Month (only) 60**] have nerve
   impingement in the C2 region based on her pain. Normal strength.  CT C
   spine done on [**10-26**] as outpatient (ordered by PCP) which showed
   degenerative changes and limited study due to cervical positioning in

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%, and schizophrenia. She is currently admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and dyspnea.

During the night, the patient experienced episodes of ectopy and an irregular supraventricular rhythm with new twelfth lead changes in leads I, II, aVF, and V4 while asleep. Her potassium levels were repleted. She also had desaturation episodes on BiPAP while asleep, so the respiratory support was adjusted.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 63 bpm (normal range 50-79 bpm), blood pressure of 110/35 mmHg (normal range 90-126/70-84 mmHg), respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute (normal range 17-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 86% on nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 743 mL of total fluids, with outputs of 490 mL of PO (oral output), 253 mL of IVF (intravenous fluids), and 30 mL of TF (total fluids). The patient received a total of 1,123 mL of blood products,"

   # Dyspnea: No objective e/o worsening, ABG is baseline, SPO2 also
   appears to be baseline. Pt. does not appear hypervolemic and is not
   having productive cough so doubt CHF or COPD exacerbation. Likely that
   her previous Bipap settings were inadequate.
   -          Use new Bipap settings
   -          Wean O2 to keep SPO2 between 88-92
   -          Continue home meds
   .
   # Altered mental status/somnolence: Orientation at baseline.  Appears
   much improved since stopping oxycodone.
   - Hold oxycodone
   .
   # Neck pain/Headache: Likely [**3-3**] arthritis/nerve impingement. Responds
   well to tylenol
   -          Neuro consult for pain management

   Addendum:
   Called neurology for neck pain, management of possible neuropathic pain
   - suggest starting neurontin if suspicious for neuropathic pain.
   However suggest minimal dose of 300mg TID. If pt not sedated with that
   regimen may increase the following day to 600mg TID.  Lyrica may be
   slightly less sedating but must be slowly titrated over weeks.
   - If neurotin proves too sedationg consider Lyrica or Trileptal.
   -Will start with small test dose  of neurotinin, 100mg qhs to monitor
   for sedating effects.
   - If further questions with management will need to formally consult
   neuro.

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%. She is currently admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and dyspnea. 

On the night shift, the patient experienced ectopy, an irregular supraventricular rhythm with new twelfth leads in I, II, aVF, and V4 while asleep. Her potassium was repleted, and she responded well to increased IPAP and EPAP on bipap while desatting. The patient yelled in Farsi, which her daughter mentioned is normal for her. 

The patient has no known drug allergies and is on various infusions and medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis. She has a history of CABG for CAD and has been experiencing chest pain at home, taking nitroglycerin. 

Her vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 63 bpm (50-79 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 110/35-126/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute (17-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 86%. 

Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Her labs show a white blood cell count of 4.7 K/uL (7.3 K/uL), hematocrit of 30.2% (27.3%), platelet count of 225 (206), creatinine of 1.2 (1.1), troponin T at <0.01, and glucose levels ranging from 115-306 mg/dL. Other labs include elevated D-dimer levels, normal calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, as well as lactic acid at 0.8 mmol/L. 

The patient's physical examination reveals tender paraspinal muscles in the neck, no jugular venous distention, crackles in the left lung base, a regular rhythm with a systolic murmur, soft abdomen with no tenderness, normal bowel sounds, and no peripheral edema. 

The patient's assessment and plan include addressing dyspnea, altered mental status/somnolence, neck pain/headache, coronary artery disease, chronic diastolic CHF, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hypothyroidism, anemia, schizophrenia, and prophylaxis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include exacerbation of COPD, CHF, or CAD, worsening of the patient's altered mental status, and further complications related to her comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and hypothyroidism."

   ECG: Ectopic atrial rhythm noted
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo female with h/o COPD, neck pain on narcotics for control and CHF
   now admit with increasing lethargy at home and worsening dyspnea.  She
   had mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis at admission in
   the setting of increasing lasix dosing at home.  Ovenright patient with
   significant arrhythmia and requirement for up-titration of BIPAP
   overnight with persistent and significant hypoxemia noted across the
   night.  This likely represents a challenging combination of chronic
   obstructive lung disease, congestive heart failure and restriction in
   the setting of obesity which with sleep onset may all conspire to
   compromise venilatory function particularly during sleep requiring
   up-titration of BIPAP therapy.
   What appears to be likely is a combination of chronic ventilatory
   failure and chronic heart failure both needing ongoing stabilization of
   ventilatory failure and congestive heart failure/atrial arrhythmia.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Advair/Spiriva
   -Will up-titrate BIPAP to 16/12 for use with 4 lpm O2
   -This is in the setting of empiric titration of BIPAP in ICU with
   oxygen saturations stabilized at 93% during brief period of sleep last
   night.
   -Would continue with BIPAP during any period of sleep
   -Steroids D/C
d without consequence
   -Follow up with sleep clinic and outpatient sleep study to truly

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neck pain, and congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted with increasing lethargy and worsening dyspnea. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmias. She required up-titration of BIPAP therapy to optimize ventilatory function, particularly during sleep. The patient's medical history, review of systems, and physical examination findings are consistent with COPD, CHF, and obesity-related respiratory compromise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and obesity contribute to her respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in ventilatory function if BIPAP settings are not appropriately adjusted or if the patient does not follow up with a sleep clinic and outpatient sleep study.
2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's CHF may worsen if her cardiac function is not adequately managed. Monitoring and adjusting medications such as Digoxin and ASA will be necessary to maintain stability.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient has experienced ectopic atrial rhythm and bradycardia. Continued monitoring and possible intervention with a pacer may be required to manage these arrhythmias.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has had episodes of hyperglycemia. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and appropriate management with regular insulin sliding scale will be necessary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with ongoing neck and head pain, agitation, increased Injury Severity Score (ISS), desaturation in the mid-80s, and difficulty with maintaining the seal on the BiPAP mask. The patient has a history of no known drug allergies. The patient received Ibuprofen, neurotrophic medication, and Zyprexa for symptom management. Additionally, the patient was given Lasix for desaturation events.

On the vital signs flow sheet, the patient's temperature ranges from 36.9 to 36.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate is between 60 and 74 beats per minute, blood pressure ranges from 122/45 to 127/77 mmHg, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation remains at 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,094 mL, including 1,070 mL through the oral route, 24 mL through intravenous fluids, and 210 mL through blood products. The total output consists of 1,363 mL through urine, 210 mL through other routes, resulting in a negative balance of -269 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with a BiPAP mask, and the arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 42 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 33 mmHg.

Physical examination findings include the absence of peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, neurologic assessment, and the inability to assess certain pulses.

Lab results reveal leukocyte count of 19.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, sodium level of 142 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride level of 99 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 29.6 mEq/L, BUN level of 33 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, glucose level of 306 mg/dL, and a slightly elevated troponin-T level of <0.01. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Radiology images were not included in the progress note.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is receiving ICU care with nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is DNI (do not intubate), and the disposition is not mentioned in the provided information.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's repeated desaturation events and difficulty maintaining the seal on the BiPAP mask indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, including VAP.
3. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for DVT and pulmonary embolism due to immobility and central venous catheterization.
4. Delirium or agitation: The patient's ongoing agitation and difficulty with neurologic assessments may suggest delirium or agitation, which can complicate the clinical picture and recovery.
5. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
6. Organ dysfunction: Elevated troponin-T levels suggest possible cardiac involvement, and the elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction.
7. Metabolic disturbances: The elevated glucose levels indicate a need for glycemic control, and the patient may be at risk for further metabolic disturbances.

These potential medical complications should be closely monitored and managed to optimize the patient's outcome."

   Dispo: Will call-out to floor today.
   Addendum:
   Called neurology for neck pain, management of possible neuropathic pain
   - suggest starting neurontin if suspicious for neuropathic pain.
   However suggest minimal dose of 300mg TID. If pt not sedated with that
   regimen may increase the following day to 600mg TID.  Lyrica may be
   slightly less sedating but must be slowly titrated over weeks.
   - If neurotin proves too sedationg consider Lyrica or Trileptal.
   -Will start with small test dose  of neurotinin, 100mg qhs to monitor
   for sedating effects.
   - If further questions with management will need to formally consult
   neuro.

   # Dyspnea: No objective e/o worsening, ABG is baseline, SPO2 also
   appears to be baseline. Pt. does not appear hypervolemic and is not
   having productive cough so doubt CHF or COPD exacerbation. Likely that
   her previous Bipap settings were inadequate.
   -          Use new Bipap settings

   Addendum:
   Called neurology for neck pain, management of possible neuropathic pain
   - suggest starting neurontin if suspicious for neuropathic pain.
   However suggest minimal dose of 300mg TID. If pt not sedated with that
   regimen may increase the following day to 600mg TID.  Lyrica may be
   slightly less sedating but must be slowly titrated over weeks.
   - If neurotin proves too sedationg consider Lyrica or Trileptal.
   -Will start with small test dose  of neurotinin, 100mg qhs to monitor
   for sedating effects.
   - If further questions with management will need to formally consult
   neuro.

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%, and schizophrenia. She was admitted with altered mental status and dyspnea.

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. CHF exacerbation: The patient has a history of CHF, and there are no signs of hypervolemia. However, the use of NSAIDs may cause fluid retention and worsen CHF symptoms. Monitoring for signs of volume overload or worsening respiratory status is important.

2. COPD exacerbation: Although the patient's ABG results are within baseline levels, her dyspnea and altered mental status may be indicative of a COPD exacerbation. Close monitoring for increased work of breathing, oxygen saturation below 88-92%, and changes in mental status is necessary.

3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's glucose levels were elevated at admission, and she required an insulin drip for blood glucose control. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is crucial to prevent further hyperglycemia or development of DKA.

4. Hypoglycemia: Insulin therapy carries a risk of hypoglycemia. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to avoid hypoglycemic episodes.

   intermittently. Pt. does not appear hypervolemic and is not having
   productive cough.  Will continue to  work on appropriate bipap settings
   and avoid sedating meds as this is likely what exacerbated her
   respiratory status over the weekend.  Currently doing well on 3L O2 NC
   but should be on bipap when sleeping.

   -          avoid opioids, sedating meds
   -          Continue nebs
   -          Would benefit from an outpatient sleep study

   # Altered mental status/somnolence: Appears improved and at baseline,
   with intermittent episodes of agitation and c/o pain.
   -continue psych meds
   -avoid sedating medications
   -zyprexa prn for agitation
   .
   # Neck pain/Headache: This is a chronic issue for her. NSAIDs are a
   problem given her poor renal status. Per neurology, started neurontin
   to see if this alleviates some of her pain. Toradol may also be better
   than NSAIDs in general (both for pain and to avoid further renal
   insult) .
   -          Neurontin up to 100 po tid
   -          Standing Tylenol
   -          Tramadol IV prn, try avoiding NSAIDs
   .
   #CAD:  h/o CABG.  Has been having
Heart pain

   # Chronic diastolic CHF: Euvolemic, not actively diuresing. Unsure why
   patient is on digoxin for diastolic dysfunction, will stop for now and
   monitor hemodynamics.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%. The patient was admitted with altered mental status and dyspnea.

During the course of admission, the patient's respiratory status improved with the use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (BIPAP) intermittently. However, the patient does not appear hypervolemic and is not producing cough. It is recommended to continue working on appropriate BIPAP settings and avoid sedating medications.

The patient's altered mental status/somnolence seems to have improved, with intermittent episodes of agitation and complaints of pain. It is advised to continue psychotropic medications, avoid sedating drugs, and administer zyprexa as needed for agitation.

Regarding the patient's neck pain and headache, which are chronic issues, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided due to the patient's poor renal status. Neurology has started neurontin at a dose of 100 mg orally three times a day to alleviate pain. Tramadol IV can be given as needed, while trying to avoid NSAIDs.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She is currently asymptomatic and her current regimen of aspirin, statin, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old woman with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF), admitted for acute on chronic respiratory failure. She has been complaining of neck and head pain, which was treated with Advil and Neurontin. The patient has also experienced intermittent desaturations while taking off her bipap periodically. She has a history of coronary artery disease, pain control, hyperglycemia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, and obesity hypoventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is acute respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed. This may require continuous monitoring and support with bipap or other respiratory interventions.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are consistently elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. This can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state if not controlled.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which increases the risk of myocardial infarction or unstable angina. Regular monitoring of cardiac status and consideration of cardiac interventions may be necessary.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may be due to various factors such as medication effects, hypoxia, or an underlying neurological condition. Continuous assessment and observation of her mental status are crucial.

5. Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome: Given the patient's obesity and respiratory failure, she may have obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Proper management of her respiratory function, especially during sleep, is essential to prevent further complications.

6. Headaches: The patient complains of severe headaches, which could be related to her underlying conditions or possibly secondary to medication use. Further evaluation and appropriate treatment should be considered.

7. Pain Control: The patient's pain needs to be adequately managed to prevent discomfort and potential complications. A multimodal approach to pain management should be employed, taking into account her overall health status.

8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and her medical conditions. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be implemented to prevent this complication.

9. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: Given the patient's critical condition and the potential risk of stress ulcers, prophylactic treatment with proton pump inhibitors should be continued to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.

10. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures to prevent and monitor for this condition should be implemented.

Overall, close monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory status, blood glucose levels, cardiac function, mental status, and pain control are crucial to prevent potential medical complications."
