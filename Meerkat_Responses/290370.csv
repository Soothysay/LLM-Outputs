","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, aortic stenosis/arthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with respiratory distress and received diuretics overnight, which improved her condition. The patient now expresses a desire to no longer be hospitalized. She has been on non-invasive ventilation multiple times due to respiratory distress. The patient has allergies to tetanus antitoxin, penicillins, and ethambutol. She received a dose of ciprofloxacin at 08:00 PM on 01/31/2199. She is currently receiving various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, ssi, hep s/q, cipro, nifedipine, hydralizine, lopressor, asa, tiatropium, and flovent.

24-hour events include episodes of non-invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/33 mmHg to 198/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus bradycardia. The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 350 mL and output of 600 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 250 mL. Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula with"
