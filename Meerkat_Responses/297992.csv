   [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1324**]. Last Hbg A1C of 9.3, new one pending.  Current
   hyperglycemia in the setting of steroid injection in ortho clinic. Pt
   developed BG > 600 and was symptomatic. No ketones in urine, and an AG
   of 15. AG closed w/ fluids.  Insulin gtt d/c'd yesterday, still w/
   persistently high BS.  SS increased, and sugars appear to b e moving in
   the correct direction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and congestive heart failure. She presented with hyperglycemia and was found to have a very high blood glucose level of over 600. She received insulin gtt, but her blood sugars remained persistently high. Her current medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other medications for her various conditions. She also has a history of asthma and is on Singular and Advair for it. The patient's vital signs are stable, but her blood pressure remains elevated. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for joint pain. Her physical examination reveals wheezes bilaterally in the lungs and no peripheral edema. Her labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. Her glucose level is still high, and her INR is supratherapeutic. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugars have been persistently high despite receiving insulin gtt. This may lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite being on lisinopril. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as stroke or heart attack.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of CAD and evidence of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and congestive heart failure. She presented with hyperglycemia and her current medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. 

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from her conditions. Firstly, her diabetes mellitus type II puts her at risk for hyperglycemia and potential diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) if not properly managed. Secondly, her history of coronary artery disease (CAD) increases her risk for myocardial infarction (MI) and unstable angina. Thirdly, her hypertension (HTN) may lead to further elevation of blood pressure and potential organ damage if not controlled. Lastly, her congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 55% indicates a compromised cardiac function, which increases the risk of fluid overload and pulmonary edema.

Additionally, the patient's recent episode of hyperglycemia required insulin therapy, and her current blood glucose levels are still elevated. This suggests ongoing difficulties in glycemic control. Moreover, the patient's INR is elevated, indicating possible issues with her anticoagulation therapy, and she is currently on hold for coumadin due to supratherapeutic levels.

Other potential complications include the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), given"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and hypertension. She presents with hyperglycemia/anion gap (HONK) following a steroid injection for chronic knee pain. Her blood sugars remained elevated despite adjustments to her insulin and sliding scale insulin doses. The patient also has a history of similar acute hyperglycemia episodes in the past with steroid injections and oral steroids. There are no signs of infection or additional etiology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia/anion gap (HONK): The patient's elevated blood sugars indicate uncontrolled diabetes, which can lead to various complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).
2. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels have shown mild elevation on admission, indicating potential renal impairment. This could be related to the hyperglycemic state or pre-existing CKD.
3. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is higher than the normal range, indicating a potential risk for bleeding. This may require adjustment of Coumadin dosage and close monitoring.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to the use of steroids. However, it is normalizing, and further investigation is not necessary at"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure presenting with hyperglycemia/anion gap (HONK) following a steroid injection for chronic knee pain. She has been admitted to the ICU and her blood sugars have remained elevated, requiring adjustments to her insulin dosage. Her blood pressure is also elevated, and she has been started on lisinopril. The patient has a history of allergies to codeine, aspirin, augmentin, trazodone, ibuprofen, atrovent, reglan, ampicillin, and Lipitor. She has been receiving heparin sodium prophylaxis and other medications as per review. 

Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for wheezing and gastrointestinal symptoms. Her vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/71 to 177/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. She has a sinus rhythm and her temperature is within normal limits. 

Her physical examination reveals that she is well-nourished and not in acute distress. She has symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, and good air movement. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and obese with present bowel sounds. Her extremities are warm and well-perfused without cyanosis or clubbing. 

Her laboratory results show elevated glucose levels, leukocytosis, mild creatinine elevation, and a slightly low potassium level. Her HbA1c level is elevated as well. Other lab values such as white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, and magnesium are within normal limits. 

The patient's imaging, microbiology, and urine analysis did not show any significant findings. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current assessment includes diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure, hyperglycemia/anion gap (HONK) following a steroid injection for chronic knee pain. She has improved control of her blood sugars with an insulin drip but still requires adjustments to her NPH and sliding scale insulin doses. 

The plan includes continuing insulin therapy, monitoring her creatinine levels, restarting Coumadin at home dose, and adjusting her antihypertensive medication. She may benefit from a consult with a specialist regarding her elevated HbA1c level. Other issues include leukocytosis, which is likely due to steroids and now normalizing, mild creatinine elevation, and supratherapeutic INR. 

The patient also has hypertension and diastolic congestive heart failure, for which her medications will be adjusted for improved control. There are concerns about possible obstructive sleep apnea, and an outpatient sleep evaluation is recommended. 

The patient's ICU care includes diabetic diet, regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Her code status is full code, and she will be transferred to the floor once her sugars are better controlled and she is stable."
