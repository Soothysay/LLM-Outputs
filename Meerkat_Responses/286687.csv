","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, and new variceal bleed. The patient is currently stable, but there are several potential medical complications that could arise. These include respiratory failure due to impaired oxygenation, cardiac failure due to fluid overload, renal failure requiring hemodialysis for volume control, hepatic encephalopathy, and potential infections such as deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. ABG results indicate a respiratory acidosis with a PaCO2 of 50 mmHg and a pH of 7.31. The patient's respiratory support should be closely monitored, and weaning should be done cautiously.

2. Cardiac Failure: The patient's blood pressure is low at 99/66 mmHg, and the heart rate is elevated at 93 bpm. The patient's fluid status is positive with a total fluid input of 2,137 mL and output of only 20 mL. This suggests fluid overload, which may contribute to cardiac failure. Monitoring CVP, mixed oxygen saturation, and conducting an echocardiogram once stable would help assess cardiac function.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric, and the cause of renal failure is"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, and new variceal bleed. The patient is currently stable and receiving treatment for the variceal bleed, including octreotide and pantoprazole drips. They also have a right femoral central venous catheter (CVC) placed for better access.

The patient is experiencing renal failure, with an unclear etiology. They have a low urine output of approximately 20 cc/hr. Careful volume resuscitation is being performed due to the patient's congestive heart failure (CHF) history. A hemodialysis (HD) line is in place, and plans are being made for HD for volume control, addressing the right internal jugular (IJ) line discontinuation.

The patient's respiratory function is stable with good oxygenation, and plans are to wean them off the ventilator as tolerated. They will remain sedated and on the vent until the gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) is stabilized. An arterial line (a-line) will be placed for respiratory surveillance.

The patient may require removal of excess volume for improved cardiac function if they are overloaded with platelets and red blood cells (RBCs). An echocardiogram (ECHO) will be done once the patient is more stable, and continuous monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP) and mixed oxygen saturation will be performed.

The patient is on nothing by mouth (NPO),"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 79 yo with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal
   failure and new variceal bleed.
   .
   # Variceal bleed: currently stable, most likely due to portal
   hypertension, unclear precipitant, infectious w/u negative.
   predisposing factor is thrombocytopenia, uremic plt dysfunction, ?  SBP
   - octreotide drip
   - ppi drip
   - Placed R fem CVC for better access as R IJ will likely be pulled
   will touch base with Renal re: R IJ line
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Check fibrinogen, and transfuse cryoprecipitate if < 100
   - Cont hemodynamic monitoring, incl CVP
   - HCT Q2H, while bleeding
   - GI aware and to scope today
   - DDAVP if BP can tolerate for uremic platelet dysfunction
   .
   # Renal failure: currently etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] urine (~20cc/hr).
   Careful volume resuscitation as CHF hx.
   - HD line in place
   - Renal c/s in process for HD for volume control, will address R IJ
   discontinuation
   .
   # Resp failure: good oxygenation, wean as tolerated. Keep sedated and
   on vent until GIB stabilized
   - Cont propofol
   - Will use 20/5 PS as tolerated for vent settings
   - Will need a-line for resp surveillance
   .
   # CHF: may need volume removed for improved cardiac function if too
   overload with plt and RBC
   - ECHO once more stable
   - monitor CVP, mixed o2 sat

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 79F UGIB, dCHF (preserved EF), CAD s/p BMS
   (07), DM, AF, HTN, ARF/ESRD, ESLD from cryptogenic cirrhosis c/b esoph
   varix x1 epr OSH report. Intubated, RIJ HD cath. Overnight continued
   resuscitation, PPI, octerotide, propofol.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.9 BP 100/55 HR 96 RR 26 with sat 100 on VAC.
   Frail woman, alert, uncomfortable on vent. Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft
   +BS. 2+edema. Labs notable for WBC 8K, HCT 34, K+ 4.1, Cr 2.3, INR 1.4,
   lactate 0.9. CXR with patch B infiltrates.
   Agree with plan to manage acute UGIB bleed with octerotide, PPI IV,
   urgent EGD, NGT to LWS, HCT q4-6h and aggressive repletion of platelets
   as well as administration of ddAVP. Will check fibrinogen, and replete
   with cryoprecipitate if <100. Will transition to PSV with fent /
   midazolam for sedation and place arterial line for monitoring for acute
   respiratory failure. Will alert renal for HD once stabilized given ESRD
   (though will likely need to d/c dysfunctional line), and will check
   echo for likely acute and chronic diastolic CHF as well as known PHTN
   to assess LV filling. Will continue RISS and consider gtt if FSG >200.
   For CAD, will hold ASA and cardiac meds for now. Hematuria is improved
   with TBI. Access is CVL, HD line, EJ. Full code, will meet with family
   after EGD. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension (HTN). She presented with acute gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and required intubation. The patient also has end-stage liver disease (ESLD) due to esophageal varices.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 97.9°F, blood pressure of 100/55 mmHg, heart rate of 96 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator assistance (VAC). The physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally, mild basilar crackles, and 2+ edema. Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8K, hematocrit of 34%, potassium level of 4.1 meq/L, creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL, INR of 1.4, and lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L.

The assessment and plan include management of acute UGIB with octreotide, PPI IV, urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), nasogastric tube (NGT) to low wall suction (LWS), and aggressive repletion of platelets as well as administration of DDAVP. The patient's respiratory status will be closely monitored with transition to pressure support ventilation (PSV) with fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and placement of an arterial line for monitoring for acute respiratory failure.

Renal function will be supported with hemodialysis (HD) once stabilized, given the patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD). An echocardiogram will be obtained to assess for acute and chronic diastolic CHF as well as known portal hypertension (PHTN) to evaluate left ventricular filling. The patient's cardiac medications will be held temporarily. Access includes peripheral lines, central venous lines, and an arterial line.

The patient's code status is full code, and a family meeting will be planned to discuss goals of care. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, heart failure, and sepsis."

   COMPARISON: A series of prior chest radiographs, most recently one day
   prior
   ([**2125-3-21**]), dating back to [**2117-1-1**].
   CHEST, AP PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW: Pulmonary edema has increased.
   Bilateral opacities, left greater than right, persist.
   Small-to-moderate
   bilateral pleural effusions are not significantly changed.
   3-cm nodular opacity projecting superior to the left hilus is unchanged
   in
   comparison to [**2125-3-21**]. As noted on that study, if this persists,
   CT is
   recommended, after the resolution of this acute process.
   Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in standard position.
   There has
   been interval removal of the right internal jugular central venous
   catheter.
   IMPRESSION: Increased pulmonary edema. Unchanged pulmonary opacities.
   CT is
   recommended if left suprahilar opacity persists after resolution of
   acute
   chest pathology.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 79 yo with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal
   failure and new variceal bleed.
   .
   # Variceal bleed: Hct stable. Bleed most likely due to portal
   hypertension, unclear precipitant, infectious w/u negative.
   predisposing factor is thrombocytopenia, uremic plt dysfunction, ?  SBP
   - continue octreotide, PPI drip
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Check fibrinogen, and transfuse cryoprecipitate if < 100
   - Cont hemodynamic monitoring, incl CVP
   - Check Hct Q8H as hct has been stable
   - GI aware and will re-scope in the near future
   - DDAVP if BP can tolerate for uremic platelet dysfunction
   .
   # Renal failure: currently etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] urine (~20cc/hr).
   Careful volume resuscitation as CHF hx.
   - HD from OSH pulled; renal placed a new line
   - Renal following; will need HD vs CVVH today
   .
   # Resp failure: good oxygenation, wean as tolerated.
   - Will diurese first via dialysis today then try RSBI and SBT, if does
   well, try extubation (likely tomorrow)
   - Sedation switched from propofol to fentanyl/versed due to low BP on
   propofol
   .
   # CHF: may need volume removed for improved cardiac function if too
   overload with plt and RBC
   - ECHO once more stable
   - monitor CVP, mixed o2 sat

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, and new variceal bleed. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Vital signs include a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 95/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and temperature of 36.9°C.

The patient has been placed on DDAVP and switched to fentanyl/versed for sedation due to low blood pressures while sleeping. A line was placed and re-threaded, and the patient received a unit of platelets this morning. The patient underwent a scope but could not localize the source of bleeding. A repeat scope will be performed once the patient is stabilized and extubated.

The patient has allergies to cephalexin and severe rash. The last doses of antibiotics administered were ciprofloxacin on [2125-3-22] at 01:30 AM and erythromycin on [2125-3-22] at 02:30 AM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's medical and family history have undergone changes.

Lab results show elevated potassium levels at 5.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin at 10.3 g/dL, increased white blood cell count at 14.2 K/uL, and"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 79F UGIB, dCHF (preserved EF), CAD s/p BMS
   (07), DM, AF, HTN, ARF/ESRD, ESLD from cryptogenic cirrhosis c/b esoph
   varix x1 epr OSH report. Intubated, RIJ HD cath. Overnight continued
   resuscitation, PPI, octerotide, propofol.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.9 BP 100/55 HR 96 RR 26 with sat 100 on VAC.
   Frail woman, alert, uncomfortable on vent. Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft
   +BS. 2+edema. Labs notable for WBC 8K, HCT 34, K+ 4.1, Cr 2.3, INR 1.4,
   lactate 0.9. CXR with patch B infiltrates.
   Agree with plan to manage acute UGIB bleed with octerotide, PPI IV,
   urgent EGD, NGT to LWS, HCT q4-6h and aggressive repletion of platelets
   as well as administration of ddAVP. Will check fibrinogen, and replete
   with cryoprecipitate if <100. Will transition to PSV with fent /
   midazolam for sedation and place arterial line for monitoring for acute
   respiratory failure. Will alert renal for HD once stabilized given ESRD
   (though will likely need to d/c dysfunctional line), and will check
   echo for likely acute and chronic diastolic CHF as well as known PHTN
   to assess LV filling. Will continue RISS and consider gtt if FSG >200.
   For CAD, will hold ASA and cardiac meds for now. Hematuria is improved
   with TBI. Access is CVL, HD line, EJ. Full code, will meet with family
   after EGD. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, and new variceal bleed. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 97.9°F, blood pressure of 100/55 mmHg, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on VAC (ventilator-associated pneumonia). 

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure. The gastrointestinal bleed is likely due to portal hypertension, and infectious workup is negative. The patient's platelet count is low, which may contribute to the bleeding. 

The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous placement of a bare-metal stent (BMS), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension (HTN). 

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 8K, hematocrit (HCT) of 34%, potassium (K+) level of 4.1 meq/L, creatinine (Cr) level of 2.3 mg/dL, international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.4, lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L, and fibrinogen"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of these conditions.

Over the past 24 hours, the following interventions have been performed: placement and re-threading of a line, administration of DDAVP, trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV), switching to fentanyl/versed for sedation due to low blood pressures while sleeping, and transfusion of platelets.

The patient has allergies to Keflex, resulting in a severe rash. The last doses of antibiotics administered were ciprofloxacin and erythromycin.

The patient is currently on several infusions, including fentanyl at 25 mcg/hour and midazolam (versed) at 1 mg/hour. Other ICU medications include midazolam (versed), which was started on 03/21/2125 at 09:55 AM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.3 C (99.1 F), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.9 C (98.5 F), heart rate (HR) of 70 bpm with a range of 69-98 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 95/45 mmHg with a range of 63-114/54-72 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 11 breaths per minute with a range of 11-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%.

The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter with a total intake of 3,370 mL and output of 2,875 mL, resulting in a fluid balance of 495 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with the following settings: volume-controlled ventilation mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 76, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 27 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium (K+) at 6.3 K/uL, low bicarbonate (HCO3-) at 23 mEq/L, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 109 mg/dL, elevated creatinine (Cr) at 2.7 mg/dL, elevated lactate (Lactic Acid) at 0.7 mmol/L, and decreased albumin (Albumin) at 3.2 g/dL.

Based on the patient's condition and the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, further gastrointestinal bleeding, development of pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to impaired skin"

   add the following points: 79F UGIB, dCHF (preserved EF), CAD s/p BMS
   (07), DM, AF, HTN, ARF/ESRD, ESLD from cryptogenic cirrhosis c/b esoph
   varix x1 epr OSH report. Intubated, RIJ HD cath. Overnight continued
   resuscitation, PPI, octerotide, propofol.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.9 BP 100/55 HR 96 RR 26 with sat 100 on VAC.
   Frail woman, alert, uncomfortable on vent. Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft
   +BS. 2+edema. Labs notable for WBC 8K, HCT 34, K+ 4.1, Cr 2.3, INR 1.4,
   lactate 0.9. CXR with patch B infiltrates.
   Agree with plan to manage acute UGIB bleed with octerotide, PPI IV,
   urgent EGD, NGT to LWS, HCT q4-6h and aggressive repletion of platelets
   as well as administration of ddAVP. Will check fibrinogen, and replete
   with cryoprecipitate if <100. Will transition to PSV with fent /
   midazolam for sedation and place arterial line for monitoring for acute
   respiratory failure. Will alert renal for HD once stabilized given ESRD
   (though will likely need to d/c dysfunctional line), and will check
   echo for likely acute and chronic diastolic CHF as well as known PHTN
   to assess LV filling. Will continue RISS and consider gtt if FSG >200.
   For CAD, will hold ASA and cardiac meds for now. Hematuria is improved
   with TBI. Access is CVL, HD line, EJ. Full code, will meet with family
   after EGD. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and altered mental status. The vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 95/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a Vt of 500 mL, PS of 15 cmH2O, RR set at 18, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and SpO2 of 98%. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.28, PaCO2 of 47 mmHg, HCO3- of 111 mEq/L, and BE of -4.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), potassium (K+), lactate, and low levels of hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), and platelets (Plt). The liver function tests reveal elevated levels of total bilirubin (T Bili) and alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos). The chest X-ray shows patchy infiltrates in the lungs.

The assessment and plan include acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's recent events include placement and re-threading of a line, administration of DDAVP, trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV), switching to fentanyl/versed for sedation due to low blood pressures while sleeping, and transfusion of platelets.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition and history include:

1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and presence of patchy infiltrates in the lungs may predispose her to the development of ARDS. Close monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be crucial.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and further evaluation with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned. Continued monitoring of hemodynamic status and repletion of blood products will be necessary.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function. Close monitoring of urine output, electrolyte levels, and acid-base balance will be important for early detection and management of AKI.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers. Regular turning, proper positioning, and skin assessment are essential to prevent further complications.

5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo female with cirrhosis and renal failure presenting with variceal
   bleed and now complicated by persistent respiratory failure and renal
   failure.  She has had substantial improvement in ventilatory status and
   oxygenation across time.  There is no evidence of active GIB noted at
   this time given HCT stability over time.  She has maintained minimal
   urine output at 15-20cc hr which limits capacity for rapid fluid
   removal in the setting of ongoing need for dialysis.  This volume
   overload appears to be primarily manifest as significant bilateral
   effusions upon review of chest films.
   1)Resiratory Failure-
   -A/C this morning
   -Wean to PSV today
   -Hope to wean to [**5-22**] this morning following relief of sedating effects
   of medications.
   2)GI Bleed-
   -DDAVP given
   -EGD plan following extubation and stability if HCT remains with
   reasonable stability
   -Octreotide
   -Protonix continuing
   -Erythromycin to be completed
used only for EGD aid
   3) RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -Catheter placed
   -Dialysis today
   -Will need to continue to monitor urine flow as any hope/expectation of
   recovery will depend on this
   -Consider move to extubation following dialysis and stabilization of
   effusions and volume status as best we can.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis and renal failure. She presented with a variceal bleed and has been complicated by persistent respiratory failure and renal failure. The patient has shown improvement in her ventilatory status and oxygenation over time. There is no evidence of active gastrointestinal bleeding at the moment. She maintains minimal urine output, limiting fluid removal during dialysis. The patient also has significant bilateral effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is planned to be weaned off soon. However, there is a risk of respiratory failure recurring if the patient does not respond well to extubation or if there are any complications during the weaning process.
2. GI Bleed: Although the patient has received DDAVP and other medications to manage the GI bleed, there is still a risk of re-bleeding or ongoing bleeding. Further evaluation and management, such as an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), will be necessary once the patient is stable.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and continued monitoring of urine flow is essential for any hope or expectation of recovery. The patient will need ongoing dialysis and careful management of fluid and electrolyte balance.

Please note that this analysis is based on the provided information and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate assessments and treatment planning."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 yo with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted
   with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed.
   .
   # Resp failure: good oxygenation on pressure support. Will wean as
   tolerated, w/ plan to trial extubation after HD today.
   - Dialysis occurred late yesterday. Will trial RSBI and SBT, if does
   well, try extubation
   - Sedation switched from propofol to fentanyl/versed due to low BP on
   propofol
   .
   # Variceal bleed: Hct stable. Bleed most likely due to portal
   hypertension, unclear precipitant, infectious w/u negative.
   Predisposing factor is thrombocytopenia, which per Heme may be due to
   Lovenox at OSH plus splenic sequestration. [**Month (only) 60**] also have component of
   uremic plt dysfunction. Received DDAVP on HD1.
   - continue octreotide, PPI drip, ciprofloxacin
   - Per Heme, start EPO 10,000 3x/week for goal Hgb >10.  Will discuss
   dosing w/ renal.
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Fibrinogen checked, normal at 327. Will transfuse cryoprecipitate if
   < 100
   - Cont hemodynamic monitoring, incl CVP
   - Check Hct [**Hospital1 **].
   - GI aware. Not recommending repeat scope while intubated. Will follow
   up recs.
   - No heparin products
   .
   # Renal failure: currently etiology unclear. Differential includes
   prerenal ARF-> ATN, but workup in place for glomerulonephritis and
   vasculitis. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]/ANCA negative. ASO positive. CRP elevated at 73.3.
   Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass,
   making obstruction very unlikely. Min urine (~20cc/hr). Careful volume
   resuscitation as CHF hx.
   - HD line placed [**3-22**] and HD performed.
   - ASO titer positive. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of post-streptococcal GN.
   - Renal following.
   .
   # CHF: 2.5L removed during HD [**5-20**] and required levophed during
   dialysis. Plan for repeat HD today for goal -1 to 1.5 L.
   - ECHO once more stable
   - monitor CVP, mixed o2 sat
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, npo
   .
   # Prophylaxis: ppi [**Hospital1 **], no sc hep, but pneumoboots, hold home cardiac
   meds until stable
   .
   # Access: Fem line, HD line. Plan to d/c fem line after HD and
   extubation and add PIV.
   .
   # Code: full, per HCP as reported by daughter,  family meeting to be
   planned re goals of care

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old individual with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed. The patient's medical history includes thrombocytopenia, which may be due to Lovenox at OSH plus splenic sequestration, and uremic platelet dysfunction. 

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Their vital signs show hypotension and low heart rate. The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, as well as low levels of hemoglobin and platelets. 

The patient has multiple comorbidities including cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, respiratory failure, and a history of congestive heart failure. The patient also has a positive ASO titer, suggesting a possible post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Hemodynamic instability due to hypotension and low heart rate.
2. Variceal bleed due to portal hypertension, which can lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
3. Thrombocytopenia, which increases the risk of bleeding and further complications.
4. Uremic platelet dysfunction, which can impair the function of platelets and increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Respiratory failure, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation.
6. Renal failure,"

   # Resp failure: good oxygenation on pressure support. Will wean as
   tolerated, w/ plan to trial extubation after HD today.
   - Dialysis occurred late yesterday. Will trial RSBI and SBT, if does
   well, try extubation
   - Sedation switched from propofol to fentanyl/versed due to low BP on
   propofol
   .
   # Variceal bleed: Hct stable. Bleed most likely due to portal
   hypertension, unclear precipitant, infectious w/u negative.
   Predisposing factor is thrombocytopenia, which per Heme may be due to
   Lovenox at OSH plus splenic sequestration. [**Month (only) 60**] also have component of
   uremic plt dysfunction. Received DDAVP on HD1.
   - continue octreotide, PPI drip, ciprofloxacin
   - Per Heme, start EPO 10,000 3x/week for goal Hgb >10.  Will discuss
   dosing w/ renal.
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Fibrinogen checked, normal at 327. Will transfuse cryoprecipitate if
   < 100
   - Cont hemodynamic monitoring, incl CVP
   - Check Hct [**Hospital1 **].
   - GI aware. Not recommending repeat scope while intubated. Will follow
   up recs.
   - No heparin products

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old individual with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient was admitted with a new variceal bleed. 

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving pressure support ventilation. The oxygenation is good, and they may be weaned off the ventilator soon. 

2. Variceal bleed: The patient has a history of portal hypertension, leading to variceal bleeding. The bleeding is likely due to thrombocytopenia, possibly caused by Lovenox at OSH, splenic sequestration, and uremic platelet dysfunction. The patient is receiving octreotide, PPI drip, and ciprofloxacin.

3. Renal failure: The etiology of renal failure is unclear. The differential includes pre-renal acute kidney injury progressing to acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis, and vasculitis. Renal ultrasound showed no signs of obstruction. The patient is undergoing hemodialysis.

4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient had 2.5L removed during hemodialysis and required levophed during dialysis. There is a plan for repeat hemodialysis today.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and renal failure admitted with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed. The patient has been sedated with fentanyl/versed due to hypotension on propofol. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with good oxygenation. 

The patient underwent hemodialysis yesterday and will be tried for spontaneous breathing trials and weaning off mechanical ventilation if he tolerates it well. 

The variceal bleed is likely due to portal hypertension, with predisposing factors including thrombocytopenia caused by Lovenox at OSH, splenic sequestration, and uremic platelet dysfunction. 

The patient is receiving octreotide, pantoprazole, and ciprofloxacin for the variceal bleed. Erythropoietin 10,000 units three times a week is started for a goal hemoglobin of 10. Cryoprecipitate will be transfused if fibrinogen level is less than 100. Hemodynamic monitoring will be continued, including central venous pressure (CVP). 

Renal failure etiology is unclear, with a differential diagnosis including prerenal acute kidney injury progressing to acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis, and vasculitis. An ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass, making obstruction unlikely."

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male admitted to the ICU with upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and hemodynamic instability. The patient has a history of severe allergic reaction to cephalexin and is currently on multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, octreotide, and pantoprazole. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The vital signs show hypotension and bradycardia, with an increased heart rate during dialysis. The patient has been receiving hemodialysis since March 22nd and is being monitored for fluid balance, blood products, and urine output. The patient's laboratory results indicate acute renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid. The patient also has thrombocytopenia and anemia. The physical examination reveals a non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present and no signs of organomegaly. The patient's neurological status is described as awake and following commands.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated levels of creatinine and lactic acid suggest acute renal failure, which can be caused by factors such as hypotension, nephrotoxic medications, or sepsis. This condition requires close monitoring and management of fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as addressing the underlying cause.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient initially presented with upper GI bleeding, which may have been due to stress ulcers or another underlying cause. The bleeding has been managed with pantoprazole infusion and other interventions. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, coagulation parameters, and hemodynamic stability is crucial to prevent rebleeding and complications.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to lovenox administration, splenic sequestration, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Close monitoring of platelet counts and appropriate management to prevent bleeding complications is necessary.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity could lead to pressure ulcers or infections. Regular turning and proper skin care should be implemented to prevent further complications.

5. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and careful monitoring of respiratory parameters is required. The risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be minimized through appropriate sedation, bronchial hygiene, and infection control measures.

6. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate, along with appropriate fluid resuscitation and medication adjustments, is necessary to maintain hemodynamic stability.

7. Infection Risk: Given the patient's ICU stay, invasive lines, and immunocompromised state, there is a higher risk of developing infections such as cath"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 yo with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted
   with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed.
   .
   # Resp failure: good oxygenation, wean as tolerated.
   - Dialysis occurred late yesterday. Will trial RSBI and SBT, if does
   well, try extubation
   - Sedation switched from propofol to fentanyl/versed due to low BP on
   propofol
   .
   # Variceal bleed: Hct stable. Bleed most likely due to portal
   hypertension, unclear precipitant, infectious w/u negative.
   Predisposing factor is thrombocytopenia, which per Heme may be due to
   Lovenox at OSH plus splenic sequestration. [**Month (only) 60**] also have component of
   uremic plt dysfunction, ?  SBP.
   - continue octreotide, PPI drip, ciprofloxacin
   - Per Heme, start EPO 10,000 3x/week for goal Hgb >10.
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Fibrinogen checked, normal at 327. Will transfuse cryoprecipitate if
   < 100
   - Cont hemodynamic monitoring, incl CVP
   - Check Hct Q8H as hct has been stable
   - GI aware and will re-scope when extubated and hemodynamically stable
   - DDAVP if BP can tolerate for uremic platelet dysfunction
   - No heparin products
   .
   # Renal failure: currently etiology unclear. Differential includes
   prerenal ARF-> ATN, but workup in place for glomerulonephritis and
   vasculitis. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]/ANCA negative. ASO positive. CRP elevated at 73.3.
   Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass,
   making obstruction very unlikely. Min urine (~20cc/hr). Careful volume
   resuscitation as CHF hx.
   - HD line placed [**3-22**] and HD performed.
   - ASO titer positive. ?Post-streptococcal GN.
   - Renal following.
   .
   # CHF: 2.5L removed during HD. Requiring levophed overnight.
   - Attempt to wean levophed today.
   - ECHO once more stable
   - monitor CVP, mixed o2 sat
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, npo

","Summary of the progress note:

- The patient is a 79-year-old with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed.
- The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, variceal bleed, renal failure, and congestive heart failure (CHF).
- The patient underwent hemodialysis, had hypotension requiring vasopressor support, thrombocytopenia, and received EPO for anemia.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with low blood pressure and heart rate.
- The patient's labs show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, high creatinine, and electrolyte imbalances.
- The patient's renal failure etiology is unclear, with a workup for glomerulonephritis and vasculitis.
- The patient has CHF, requiring careful volume resuscitation due to a history of CHF.
- The patient is receiving prophylactic medications, including PPI, and has multiple lines and catheters in place.
- The patient's code status is full code, and the family meeting is planned to discuss goals of care.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or extubation failure if weaning attempts are unsuccessful.

2. Variceal bleed: The patient has ongoing bleeding due to portal hypertension, and there is a"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 yo with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted
   with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed.
   .
   # Resp failure: Good oxygenation on pressure support. Did not tolerated
   [**5-22**] trial this AM, likely in setting of ongoing volume overload per
   CXR. Will attempt to remove more fluid and then trial again on [**5-22**]
   pressure support, check RSBI.
   - Will trial RSBI and SBT, if does well, try extubation
   - Sedation fentanyl/versed.
   .
   # Variceal bleed: Hct stable. Bleed most likely due to portal
   hypertension, unclear precipitant, infectious w/u negative.
   Predisposing factor is thrombocytopenia, which per Heme may be due to
   Lovenox at OSH plus splenic sequestration. [**Month (only) 60**] also have component of
   uremic plt dysfunction. Received DDAVP on HD1. Per GI, d/c
d octreotide
   [**3-23**], cipro [**3-24**]. Also, Heme concern for HIT+ contributing to
   thrombocytopenia.
   - IV pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per Heme, start EPO 10,000 3x/week for goal Hgb >10. Dosing ok with
   renal.
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Cont hemodynamic monitoring, incl CVP
   - Check Hct [**Hospital1 **].
   - F/U results of EGD and further GI Recs.
   - No heparin products. F/U HIT antibody, serotonin release assay per
   Heme.
   - Obtain in-house heme/onc consult regarding ?HIT. Consider argatroban,
   though reticent to start anticoagulation given recent UGIB.
   .
   # Renal failure: currently etiology unclear. Differential includes
   prerenal ARF-> ATN, but workup in place for glomerulonephritis and
   vasculitis. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]/ANCA negative. ASO positive. CRP elevated at 73.3.
   Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass,
   making obstruction very unlikely. Min urine (~20cc/hr). Careful volume
   resuscitation as CHF hx. U/A w/ [**3-22**] RBCs, >50 WBCs.
   - New tunneled HD line placed [**3-22**]. Last HD
   - ASO titer positive. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of post-streptococcal GN.
   - Last HD [**3-24**], with -2.2L.
   - Appreciate further Renal recs, especially regarding possibility for
   recovery of pt
s renal function.
   .
   # CHF: 2.5L removed during HD [**5-20**], -2.2L during HD [**6-20**]. Did not require
   levophed during 2^nd HD.  Appears to have ongoing pulmonary edema on
   CXR.
   - F/U ECHO today.
   - Continue HD today for goal -2L.
   - monitor CVP, mixed o2 sat
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable. On epogen/Fe at transfer. Per heme, restart
   Epogen 10,000U TID.
   - Epo 10000U TID, ok per Renal.
   .
   # T2DM: Blood glucose elevated today. On Lantus 25U qPM at home.
   - ISS w/ QID FS while NPO. Will readdress when Pt has glucose source.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On 50mcg levothyroxine at home.
   - 25mcg IV levothyroxine daily.
   .
   # CAD: Known h/o CAD with 3 stents.
   - Lipitor 25mg qAM.
   - Holding ASA given recent GIB and antihypertensives given hypotension.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes. Currently NPO. If extubated today,
   will likely trial PO. Otherwise will drop NG Tube for feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: ppi [**Hospital1 **], no sc hep, but pneumoboots, holding home
   antihypertensives until stable
   .
   # Access: Fem line, HD line. Plan to d/c fem line after HD and

   MICU Intern addendum: Patient seen and discussed with MSIV and ICU team
   on rounds.  Plan for another round of dialysis later today to remove
   more fluid and then will attempt extubation.  EGD by GI this am with
   evidence of portal gastropathy.  Assistance from nephrology and
   hepatology teams is much appreciated.
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, and recent variceal bleed. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, ongoing volume overload, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure with unclear etiology. The patient has multiple comorbidities including congestive heart failure, anemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. 

The patient's vital signs show stable hemodynamics but with decreased breath sounds on the right lung base. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. His oxygenation is good with a SpO2 of 96%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, as well as abnormal renal function tests. The platelet count is low, and there are signs of possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). 

The patient's treatment plan includes continued hemodynamic monitoring, removal of more fluid via dialysis, and another trial of pressure support ventilation. The goal is to extubate the patient if he tolerates these interventions well. 

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is to remain in the ICU for now. The patient's care team includes multiple specialists including GI, nephrology, hepatology, and cardiology."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 yo with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted
   with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed.
   .
   # Resp failure: good oxygenation on pressure support. Will wean as
   tolerated, w/ plan to trial extubation after HD today.
   - Dialysis occurred late yesterday. Will trial RSBI and SBT, if does
   well, try extubation
   - Sedation fentanyl/versed.
   .
   # Variceal bleed: Hct stable. Bleed most likely due to portal
   hypertension, unclear precipitant, infectious w/u negative.
   Predisposing factor is thrombocytopenia, which per Heme may be due to
   Lovenox at OSH plus splenic sequestration. [**Month (only) 60**] also have component of
   uremic plt dysfunction. Received DDAVP on HD1. Per GI, d/c
d octreotide
   [**3-23**].
   - Transitioned PPI drip to IV pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per GI, d/c cipro today.
   - Per Heme, start EPO 10,000 3x/week for goal Hgb >10. Dosing ok with
   renal.
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Fibrinogen checked, normal at 327. Will transfuse cryoprecipitate if
   < 100
   - Cont hemodynamic monitoring, incl CVP
   - Check Hct [**Hospital1 **].
   - GI aware. Not recommending repeat scope while intubated. Will follow
   up recs.
   - No heparin products. F/U HIT antibody, serotonin release assay.
   .
   # Renal failure: currently etiology unclear. Differential includes
   prerenal ARF-> ATN, but workup in place for glomerulonephritis and
   vasculitis. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]/ANCA negative. ASO positive. CRP elevated at 73.3.
   Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass,
   making obstruction very unlikely. Min urine (~20cc/hr). Careful volume
   resuscitation as CHF hx. U/A w/ [**3-22**] RBCs, >50 WBCs.
   - HD line placed [**3-22**] and HD performed.
   - ASO titer positive. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of post-streptococcal GN.
   - U/A difficult to interpret given foley. Pt already on Cipro x 3days.
   ?D/C foley.
   - Renal following.
   .
   # CHF: 2.5L removed during HD [**5-20**], -2.2L during HD [**6-20**]. Did not require
   levophed during 2^nd HD.
   - ECHO today.
   - Continue HD today for goal -2L.
   - monitor CVP, mixed o2 sat
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable. On epogen/Fe at transfer. Per heme, restart
   Epogen 10,000U TID.
   - Epo 10000U TID, ok per Renal.
   .
   # T2DM: Blood glucose elevated today. On Lantus 25U qPM at home.
   - ISS today. Will calculate requirement and start standing insulin dose
   tomorrow.

   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, npo
   .
   # Prophylaxis: ppi [**Hospital1 **], no sc hep, but pneumoboots, hold home cardiac
   meds until stable
   .
   # Access: Fem line, HD line. Plan to d/c fem line after HD and
   extubation and add PIV.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, respiratory failure, and a new variceal bleed. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He has been admitted with respiratory failure and received hemodialysis (HD) yesterday. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and he is not requiring vasopressor support. His heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are within normal limits. The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, which may be due to Lovenox at OSH and splenic sequestration. He also has uremic platelet dysfunction. The patient received desmopressin on HD1. Octreotide has been discontinued as per GI recommendation. The patient's renal function is impaired, and the etiology of renal failure is unclear. The patient's electrolyte levels are replete, and he is receiving prophylactic PPI. He is also receiving EPO and iron supplementation for anemia management. The patient's medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and congestive heart failure. He has been on insulin therapy and levothyroxine at home. The patient's family meeting is planned to discuss goals of care. The patient's current disposition is ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 yo with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted
   with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed.
   .
   # Resp failure: good oxygenation on pressure support. Will wean as
   tolerated, w/ plan to trial extubation after HD today.
   - Dialysis occurred late yesterday. Will trial RSBI and SBT, if does
   well, try extubation
   - Sedation fentanyl/versed.
   .
   # Variceal bleed: Hct stable. Bleed most likely due to portal
   hypertension, unclear precipitant, infectious w/u negative.
   Predisposing factor is thrombocytopenia, which per Heme may be due to
   Lovenox at OSH plus splenic sequestration. [**Month (only) 60**] also have component of
   uremic plt dysfunction. Received DDAVP on HD1. Per GI, d/c
d octreotide
   [**3-23**].
   - Transitioned PPI drip to IV pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per GI, d/c cipro today.
   - Per Heme, start EPO 10,000 3x/week for goal Hgb >10. Dosing ok with
   renal.
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Fibrinogen checked, normal at 327. Will transfuse cryoprecipitate if
   < 100
   - Cont hemodynamic monitoring, incl CVP
   - Check Hct [**Hospital1 **].
   - GI aware. Not recommending repeat scope while intubated. Will follow
   up recs.
   - No heparin products. F/U HIT antibody, serotonin release assay.
   .
   # Renal failure: currently etiology unclear. Differential includes
   prerenal ARF-> ATN, but workup in place for glomerulonephritis and
   vasculitis. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]/ANCA negative. ASO positive. CRP elevated at 73.3.
   Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass,
   making obstruction very unlikely. Min urine (~20cc/hr). Careful volume
   resuscitation as CHF hx. U/A w/ [**3-22**] RBCs, >50 WBCs.
   - HD line placed [**3-22**] and HD performed.
   - ASO titer positive. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of post-streptococcal GN.
   - U/A difficult to interpret given foley. Pt already on Cipro x 3days.
   ?D/C foley.
   - Renal following.
   .
   # CHF: 2.5L removed during HD [**5-20**], -2.2L during HD [**6-20**]. Did not require
   levophed during 2^nd HD.
   - ECHO today.
   - Continue HD today for goal -2L.
   - monitor CVP, mixed o2 sat
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable. On epogen/Fe at transfer. Per heme, restart
   Epogen 10,000U TID.
   - Epo 10000U TID, ok per Renal.
   .
   # T2DM: Blood glucose elevated today. On Lantus 25U qPM at home.
   - ISS today. Will calculate requirement and start standing insulin dose
   tomorrow.
   # Hypothyroidism: On 50mcg levothyroxine at home.
   -
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, npo
   .
   # Prophylaxis: ppi [**Hospital1 **], no sc hep, but pneumoboots, hold home cardiac
   meds until stable
   .
   # Access: Fem line, HD line. Plan to d/c fem line after HD and
   extubation and add PIV.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, and respiratory failure admitted with a new variceal bleed. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, variceal bleed, renal failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), anemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypothyroidism, and familial hypertriglyceridemia (FEN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. The risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) should be monitored closely.
2. Variceal Bleed: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding, which can recur. There is a risk of rebleeding or continued bleeding leading to hypotension and hemodynamic instability.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and there is a risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening renal function due to various factors like hypotension, sepsis, or nephrotoxic drugs.
4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of CHF, and fluid overload or inadequate cardiac output may contribute to worsening heart failure symptoms.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be managed"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 yo with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted
   with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed.
   .
   # Resp failure: good oxygenation on pressure support. Will wean as
   tolerated, w/ plan to trial extubation after HD today.
   - Dialysis occurred late yesterday. Will trial RSBI and SBT, if does
   well, try extubation
   - Sedation switched from propofol to fentanyl/versed due to low BP on
   propofol
   .
   # Variceal bleed: Hct stable. Bleed most likely due to portal
   hypertension, unclear precipitant, infectious w/u negative.
   Predisposing factor is thrombocytopenia, which per Heme may be due to
   Lovenox at OSH plus splenic sequestration. [**Month (only) 60**] also have component of
   uremic plt dysfunction. Received DDAVP on HD1.
   - continue octreotide, PPI drip, ciprofloxacin
   - Per Heme, start EPO 10,000 3x/week for goal Hgb >10.  Will discuss
   dosing w/ renal.
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Fibrinogen checked, normal at 327. Will transfuse cryoprecipitate if
   < 100
   - Cont hemodynamic monitoring, incl CVP
   - Check Hct [**Hospital1 **].
   - GI aware. Not recommending repeat scope while intubated. Will follow
   up recs.
   - No heparin products
   .
   # Renal failure: currently etiology unclear. Differential includes
   prerenal ARF-> ATN, but workup in place for glomerulonephritis and
   vasculitis. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]/ANCA negative. ASO positive. CRP elevated at 73.3.
   Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass,
   making obstruction very unlikely. Min urine (~20cc/hr). Careful volume
   resuscitation as CHF hx.
   - HD line placed [**3-22**] and HD performed.
   - ASO titer positive. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of post-streptococcal GN.
   - Renal following.
   .
   # CHF: 2.5L removed during HD [**5-20**] and required levophed during
   dialysis. Plan for repeat HD today for goal -1 to 1.5 L.
   - ECHO once more stable
   - monitor CVP, mixed o2 sat
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, npo
   .
   # Prophylaxis: ppi [**Hospital1 **], no sc hep, but pneumoboots, hold home cardiac
   meds until stable
   .
   # Access: Fem line, HD line. Plan to d/c fem line after HD and
   extubation and add PIV.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and renal failure, admitted with respiratory failure and a new variceal bleed. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has stable oxygenation on pressure support and will be weaned off ventilator support as tolerated. 

The patient's variceal bleed is likely due to portal hypertension, with thrombocytopenia being a predisposing factor. The patient received DDAVP during dialysis and will continue on octreotide, PPI drip, and ciprofloxacin. 

The etiology of the patient's renal failure is unclear, but workup is in place for glomerulonephritis and vasculitis. Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass, making obstruction unlikely. 

The patient required levophed during dialysis and had 2.5L removed during the last HD. Repeat HD is planned for today. 

Other medical issues include congestive heart failure (CHF), for which the patient had significant volume removal during HD and required levophed support. 

The patient is currently on fem lines and a dialysis catheter. Fem line will be discontinued after HD and extubation, and a PIV will be added. 

A code status of full code has been established, and a family meeting will be planned to discuss goals of care."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, and respiratory failure who presented with a new variceal bleed. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic instability. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, variceal bleed, renal failure, congestive heart failure, anemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which indicates respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).

2. Variceal Bleed: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding, which is commonly associated with portal hypertension. There is a risk of rebleeding and further gastrointestinal complications.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of renal failure, and the etiology is unclear. There is a risk of worsening renal function and the need for ongoing hemodialysis.

4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has evidence of CHF, as indicated by fluid overload and pulmonary edema. There is a risk of further cardiac decompensation and fluid balance issues.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and there is a need for ongoing management with erythropoietin and iron supplementation. There is a risk of worsening"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 yo with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted
   with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed.
   .
   # Resp failure: good oxygenation on pressure support. Will wean as
   tolerated, w/ plan to trial extubation after HD today.
   - Dialysis occurred late yesterday. Will trial RSBI and SBT, if does
   well, try extubation
   - Sedation switched from propofol to fentanyl/versed due to low BP on
   propofol
   .
   # Variceal bleed: Hct stable. Bleed most likely due to portal
   hypertension, unclear precipitant, infectious w/u negative.
   Predisposing factor is thrombocytopenia, which per Heme may be due to
   Lovenox at OSH plus splenic sequestration. [**Month (only) 60**] also have component of
   uremic plt dysfunction. Received DDAVP on HD1.
   - continue octreotide, PPI drip, ciprofloxacin
   - Per Heme, start EPO 10,000 3x/week for goal Hgb >10.  Will discuss
   dosing w/ renal.
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Fibrinogen checked, normal at 327. Will transfuse cryoprecipitate if
   < 100
   - Cont hemodynamic monitoring, incl CVP
   - Check Hct [**Hospital1 **].
   - GI aware. Not recommending repeat scope while intubated. Will follow
   up recs.
   - No heparin products
   .
   # Renal failure: currently etiology unclear. Differential includes
   prerenal ARF-> ATN, but workup in place for glomerulonephritis and
   vasculitis. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]/ANCA negative. ASO positive. CRP elevated at 73.3.
   Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass,
   making obstruction very unlikely. Min urine (~20cc/hr). Careful volume
   resuscitation as CHF hx.
   - HD line placed [**3-22**] and HD performed.
   - ASO titer positive. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of post-streptococcal GN.
   - Renal following.
   .
   # CHF: 2.5L removed during HD [**5-20**] and required levophed during
   dialysis. Plan for repeat HD today for goal -1 to 1.5 L.
   - ECHO once more stable
   - monitor CVP, mixed o2 sat
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, npo
   .
   # Prophylaxis: ppi [**Hospital1 **], no sc hep, but pneumoboots, hold home cardiac
   meds until stable
   .
   # Access: Fem line, HD line. Plan to d/c fem line after HD and
   extubation and add PIV.
   .
   # Code: full, per HCP as reported by daughter,  family meeting to be
   planned re goals of care

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, and respiratory failure who was admitted for a new variceal bleed. He has been in the ICU since then and has undergone several interventions and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure and is currently on pressure support ventilation. There is a plan to wean him off the ventilator and trial extubation after hemodialysis (HD) today.

2. Variceal Bleed: The patient has experienced a variceal bleed, which is likely due to portal hypertension. The precipitant of the bleed is unclear, but thrombocytopenia may have contributed. The patient has received octreotide, PPI drip, and ciprofloxacin to manage the bleed. There is also a plan to transfuse him to keep hematocrit (Hct) >30 and check fibrinogen levels. If fibrinogen is low, cryoprecipitate will be given.

3. Renal Failure: The etiology of the patient's renal failure is unclear. Possible causes include prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI) progressing to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), glomerulonephritis, or vasculitis. Renal ultrasonography showed no abnormalities, making obstruction unlikely. The patient has had hemodialysis and the ASO titer was positive, suggesting"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 yo with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted
   with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed.
   .
   # Resp failure: good oxygenation on pressure support. Will wean as
   tolerated, w/ plan to trial extubation after HD today.
   - Dialysis occurred late yesterday. Will trial RSBI and SBT, if does
   well, try extubation
   - Sedation switched from propofol to fentanyl/versed due to low BP on
   propofol
   .
   # Variceal bleed: Hct stable. Bleed most likely due to portal
   hypertension, unclear precipitant, infectious w/u negative.
   Predisposing factor is thrombocytopenia, which per Heme may be due to
   Lovenox at OSH plus splenic sequestration. [**Month (only) 60**] also have component of
   uremic plt dysfunction. Received DDAVP on HD1.
   - continue octreotide, PPI drip, ciprofloxacin
   - Per Heme, start EPO 10,000 3x/week for goal Hgb >10.  Will discuss
   dosing w/ renal.
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Fibrinogen checked, normal at 327. Will transfuse cryoprecipitate if
   < 100
   - Cont hemodynamic monitoring, incl CVP
   - Check Hct [**Hospital1 **].
   - GI aware. Not recommending repeat scope while intubated. Will follow
   up recs.
   - No heparin products

   prerenal ARF-> ATN, but workup in place for glomerulonephritis and
   vasculitis. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]/ANCA negative. ASO positive. CRP elevated at 73.3.
   Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass,
   making obstruction very unlikely. Min urine (~20cc/hr). Careful volume
   resuscitation as CHF hx.
   - HD line placed [**3-22**] and HD performed.
   - ASO titer positive. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of post-streptococcal GN.
   - Renal following.
   .
   # CHF: 2.5L removed during HD [**5-20**] and required levophed during
   dialysis. Plan for repeat HD today for goal -1 to 1.5 L.
   - ECHO once more stable
   - monitor CVP, mixed o2 sat
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, npo
   .
   # Prophylaxis: ppi [**Hospital1 **], no sc hep, but pneumoboots, hold home cardiac
   meds until stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, and respiratory failure admitted with a new variceal bleed. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 108/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and creatinine levels, as well as thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 46,000/mm3. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and he is receiving insulin therapy. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. The need for ongoing respiratory support suggests a potential risk of continued respiratory failure.
2. Variceal Bleeding: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding, which is a complication of portal hypertension often seen in patients with cirrhosis. There is a risk of re-bleeding and further gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of renal failure, and his current renal function is compromised with elevated creatinine levels. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is significantly low"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 yo F with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted
   with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed.
   .
   # Resp failure: Event this morning likely flash pulmonary edema in the
   setting of hypertension and continued volume overload.  Patient
   improved on CPAP and now is back on face mask and doing well.
   - discuss with nephrology doing additional HD today
   - CPAP if additional episodes of respiratory distress, will try to
   avoid reintubation if possible
   - consider restarting patient
s home anti-hypertensives given HTN last
   night and now patient appears more stable hemodynamically as bleeding
   is currently resolved.
   .
   # Variceal bleed: Patient with continued multiple episodes of small
   volume melena overnight.  Hct stable.  Initial bleed most likely due to
   portal hypertension.  Predisposing factor is thrombocytopenia and may
   also have a component of uremic plt dysfunction. Received DDAVP on HD1.
   Per GI, d/c
d octreotide [**3-23**], cipro [**3-24**].
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg PO daily x 2 weeks.
   - Carafate 1g QID x 1 week
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Check Hct [**Hospital1 **], more often if increased melena or frank bleeding.
   .
   # Renal failure: currently etiology unclear. Differential includes
   prerenal ARF-> ATN, but workup in place for glomerulonephritis and
   vasculitis. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]/ANCA negative. ASO positive. CRP elevated at 73.3.
   Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass,
   making obstruction very unlikely. Min urine (~20cc/hr). Careful volume
   resuscitation as CHF hx. U/A w/ [**3-22**] RBCs, >50 WBCs.
   - New tunneled HD line placed [**3-22**].
   - ASO titer positive. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of post-streptococcal GN.
   - Last HD [**3-24**] x 2, with -2.2L and -2.5L
   - Appreciate further Renal recs, especially regarding possibility for
   recovery of pt
s renal function.
   .
   # CHF: 2.5L removed during HD [**3-23**], 4.7L during HD [**3-24**]. Did not require
   levophed during 2^nd HD.  Appears to have ongoing pulmonary edema on
   CXR.
   - Continue HD today
   - monitor O2 sats, symptoms
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely due to portal hypertension with splenic
   sequestration.  Per report, heme at OSH concerned patient may have a
   component of HIT due to Lovenox as pt. is known HIT Ab+.  Platelets
   appear stable here.  Of note, she has been receiving heparin flushes
   through her HD catheter.
   - Avoid heparin products. F/U HIT antibody, serotonin release assay per
   Heme.
   - Appreciate input from hematology regarding hx of HIT Ab+ and
   treatment for this patient.  Of note patient does have afib, but would
   like to avoid anticoagulation in the setting of GIB.  Consider whether
   argatroban should be initiated for afib or avoided due to GIB.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely both chronic and acute components.  Hct currently
   stable. On epogen/Fe at transfer.
   - Epo 10000U TIW per heme, ok per Renal.
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Check Hct [**Hospital1 **], more often if increased melena or frank bleeding.
   .
   # T2DM: Blood glucose elevated today. On Lantus 25U qPM at home.
   - ISS w/ QID FS while NPO. Will readdress when Pt has glucose source.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On 50mcg levothyroxine at home.
   - 25mcg IV levothyroxine daily as NPO, will transition to home regimen
   when taking POs.
   .
   # CAD: Known h/o CAD with 3 stents.
   - Lipitor 25mg qAM.
   - Holding ASA given recent GIB and antihypertensives given hypotension.
   .
   # Confusion: Per family, patient sometime becomes confused at night.
   The patient was awake much of last night which may have contributed to
   confusion as well as morphine received for respiratory distress this
   am.
   - limit narcotics
   - soft restraints prn to maintain lines
   - consider zyprexa prn (not needed last night)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes. Currently sips only as patient may
   need reintubation later today if not dialyzed.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI; no sc hep, but pneumoboots
   .
   # Access: Fem line and HD line. Plan to d/c fem line after PICC line
   placement today.  PICC team unable to come by yesterday for placement.
   .
   # Code: full, per HCP as reported by daughter,  family meeting to be
   planned re goals of care
   .
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) **] and husband HCP
   .
   # Dispo: ICU for now; potential call out to floor tomorrow if
   respiratory status remains stable

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, and known HIT antibodies. She was admitted with respiratory failure and a new variceal bleed. The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and endoscopy, which revealed symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function and elevated cardiac index. The patient also had elevated ventricular filling pressures, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and a moderately dilated right ventricle with borderline normal function. There was trivial aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation.

The patient tested positive for HIT antibodies and required dialysis, removing 2.5 liters of fluid. She was successfully extubated and experienced a small amount of melena. The patient's hemoglobin concentration was stable.

The patient received multiple transfusions of platelets and was started on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and sucralfate for gastrointestinal protection. Her epogen dosing was clarified, and she is to receive 10,000 units three times a week.

The patient experienced episodes of tachypnea, hypoxia, and hypertension, for which she received morphine and lasix. She was placed on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and had an arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showing respiratory acidosis.

The patient's physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds, scattered rhonchi"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 yo with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted
   with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed.
   .
   # Resp failure: Good oxygenation on pressure support. Did not tolerated
   [**5-22**] trial this AM, likely in setting of ongoing volume overload per
   CXR. Will attempt to remove more fluid and then trial again on [**5-22**]
   pressure support, check RSBI.
   - Will trial RSBI and SBT, if does well, try extubation
   - Sedation fentanyl/versed.
   .
   # Variceal bleed: Hct stable. Bleed most likely due to portal
   hypertension, unclear precipitant, infectious w/u negative.
   Predisposing factor is thrombocytopenia, which per Heme may be due to
   Lovenox at OSH plus splenic sequestration. [**Month (only) 60**] also have component of
   uremic plt dysfunction. Received DDAVP on HD1. Per GI, d/c
d octreotide
   [**3-23**], cipro [**3-24**]. Also, Heme concern for HIT+ contributing to
   thrombocytopenia.
   - IV pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per Heme, start EPO 10,000 3x/week for goal Hgb >10. Dosing ok with
   renal.
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Cont hemodynamic monitoring, incl CVP
   - Check Hct [**Hospital1 **].
   - F/U results of EGD and further GI Recs.
   - No heparin products. F/U HIT antibody, serotonin release assay per
   Heme.
   - Obtain in-house heme/onc consult regarding ?HIT. Consider argatroban,
   though reticent to start anticoagulation given recent UGIB.
   .
   # Renal failure: currently etiology unclear. Differential includes
   prerenal ARF-> ATN, but workup in place for glomerulonephritis and
   vasculitis. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]/ANCA negative. ASO positive. CRP elevated at 73.3.
   Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass,
   making obstruction very unlikely. Min urine (~20cc/hr). Careful volume
   resuscitation as CHF hx. U/A w/ [**3-22**] RBCs, >50 WBCs.
   - New tunneled HD line placed [**3-22**]. Last HD
   - ASO titer positive. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of post-streptococcal GN.
   - Last HD [**3-24**], with -2.2L.
   - Appreciate further Renal recs, especially regarding possibility for
   recovery of pt
s renal function.
   .
   # CHF: 2.5L removed during HD [**5-20**], -2.2L during HD [**6-20**]. Did not require
   levophed during 2^nd HD.  Appears to have ongoing pulmonary edema on
   CXR.
   - F/U ECHO today.
   - Continue HD today for goal -2L.
   - monitor CVP, mixed o2 sat
   .
   # Anemia: Hct stable. On epogen/Fe at transfer. Per heme, restart
   Epogen 10,000U TID.
   - Epo 10000U TID, ok per Renal.
   .
   # T2DM: Blood glucose elevated today. On Lantus 25U qPM at home.
   - ISS w/ QID FS while NPO. Will readdress when Pt has glucose source.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On 50mcg levothyroxine at home.
   - 25mcg IV levothyroxine daily.
   .
   # CAD: Known h/o CAD with 3 stents.
   - Lipitor 25mg qAM.
   - Holding ASA given recent GIB and antihypertensives given hypotension.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes. Currently NPO. If extubated today,
   will likely trial PO. Otherwise will drop NG Tube for feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: ppi [**Hospital1 **], no sc hep, but pneumoboots, holding home
   antihypertensives until stable
   .
   # Access: Fem line, HD line. Plan to d/c fem line after HD and
   extubation. Add PICC today.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 yo F with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted
   with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed.
   .
   # Resp failure: Event this morning likely flash pulmonary edema in the
   setting of hypertension and continued volume overload.  Patient
   improved on CPAP and now is back on face mask and doing well.
   - discuss with nephrology doing additional HD today
   - CPAP if additional episodes of respiratory distress, will try to
   avoid reintubation if possible
   - consider restarting patient
s home anti-hypertensives given HTN last
   night and now patient appears more stable hemodynamically as bleeding
   is currently resolved.
   .
   # Variceal bleed: Patient with continued multiple episodes of small
   volume melena overnight.  Hct stable.  Initial bleed most likely due to
   portal hypertension.  Predisposing factor is thrombocytopenia and may
   also have a component of uremic plt dysfunction. Received DDAVP on HD1.
   Per GI, d/c
d octreotide [**3-23**], cipro [**3-24**].
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg PO daily x 2 weeks.
   - Carafate 1g QID x 1 week
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Check Hct [**Hospital1 **], more often if increased melena or frank bleeding.
   .
   # Renal failure: currently etiology unclear. Differential includes
   prerenal ARF-> ATN, but workup in place for glomerulonephritis and
   vasculitis. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]/ANCA negative. ASO positive. CRP elevated at 73.3.
   Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass,
   making obstruction very unlikely. Min urine (~20cc/hr). Careful volume
   resuscitation as CHF hx. U/A w/ [**3-22**] RBCs, >50 WBCs.
   - New tunneled HD line placed [**3-22**].
   - ASO titer positive. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of post-streptococcal GN.
   - Last HD [**3-24**] x 2, with -2.2L and -2.5L
   - Appreciate further Renal recs, especially regarding possibility for
   recovery of pt
s renal function.
   .
   # CHF: 2.5L removed during HD [**3-23**], 4.7L during HD [**3-24**]. Did not require
   levophed during 2^nd HD.  Appears to have ongoing pulmonary edema on
   CXR.
   - Continue HD today
   - monitor O2 sats, symptoms
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely due to portal hypertension with splenic
   sequestration.  Per report, heme at OSH concerned patient may have a
   component of HIT due to Lovenox as pt. is known HIT Ab+.  Platelets
   appear stable here.  Of note, she has been receiving heparin flushes
   through her HD catheter.
   - Avoid heparin products. F/U HIT antibody, serotonin release assay per
   Heme.
   - Appreciate input from hematology regarding hx of HIT Ab+ and
   treatment for this patient.  Of note patient does have afib, but would
   like to avoid anticoagulation in the setting of GIB.  Consider whether
   argatroban should be initiated for afib or avoided due to GIB.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely both chronic and acute components.  Hct currently
   stable. On epogen/Fe at transfer.
   - Epo 10000U TIW per heme, ok per Renal.
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Check Hct [**Hospital1 **], more often if increased melena or frank bleeding.
   .
   # T2DM: Blood glucose elevated today. On Lantus 25U qPM at home.
   - ISS w/ QID FS while NPO. Will readdress when Pt has glucose source.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On 50mcg levothyroxine at home.
   - 25mcg IV levothyroxine daily as NPO, will transition to home regimen
   when taking POs.
   .
   # CAD: Known h/o CAD with 3 stents.
   - Lipitor 25mg qAM.
   - Holding ASA given recent GIB and antihypertensives given hypotension.
   .
   # Confusion: Per family, patient sometime becomes confused at night.
   The patient was awake much of last night which may have contributed to
   confusion as well as morphine received for respiratory distress this
   am.
   - limit narcotics
   - soft restraints prn to maintain lines
   - consider zyprexa prn (not needed last night)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes. Currently sips only as patient may
   need reintubation later today if not dialyzed.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI; no sc hep, but pneumoboots
   .
   # Access: Fem line and HD line. Plan to d/c fem line after PICC line
   placement today.  PICC team unable to come by yesterday for placement.
   .
   # Code: full, per HCP as reported by daughter,  family meeting to be
   planned re goals of care
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed. She has been experiencing multiple episodes of small volume melena overnight, and her hemoglobin level is stable. The initial bleed is likely due to portal hypertension, with thrombocytopenia and possible uremic platelet dysfunction contributing to the bleeding. The patient received DDAVP on HD1 and will be on pantoprazole and carafate for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.

The patient also has renal failure with an unclear etiology, including possibilities of pre-renal acute kidney injury progressing to acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis, and vasculitis. The renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass, making obstruction unlikely. The patient had a tunneled hemodialysis line placed on 3/22 and will undergo further renal recommendations.

Additionally, the patient has congestive heart failure with fluid overload, as indicated by the removal of 2.5L and 4.7L during hemodialysis sessions on 3/23 and 3/24, respectively. There is ongoing pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, and the patient will continue with hemodialysis today.

Thrombocytopenia is likely due to portal hypertension with splenic sequestration. The patient is known to be HIT Ab+"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed. She has multiple medical complications including respiratory distress, variceal bleeding, renal failure, congestive heart failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, and confusion. The patient's condition requires careful management and monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient had an episode of hypoxia requiring CPAP due to flash pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory status is necessary.
2. Variceal bleeding: The patient experienced multiple episodes of small volume melena overnight. Continued monitoring for signs of bleeding, and maintaining Hct above 25% if necessary.
3. Renal failure: The etiology of renal failure is unclear. Further workup is needed to determine the cause, and the patient may require ongoing dialysis.
4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient had significant fluid removal during HD sessions. Continued monitoring of fluid balance and pulmonary status is necessary.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low due to portal hypertension with splenic sequestration. Avoidance of heparin products is recommended, and further evaluation for HIT should be done.
6. Anemia: The patient has both chronic and acute"

   [**Known lastname 8357**] is a female with cryptogenic cirrhosis here with variceal
   bleed, now hemodynamically stable with stable Hcts and no evidence on
   ongoing hemorrhage.  Currently on Pantoprazole, nadolol, and carafate
   and checking daily Hcts.  Patient with renal failure, now on HD,
   getting fluid removal with goal of negative 1 L today.  Will callout to
   the [**Doctor Last Name 2504**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] service today.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, and other comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, and confusion. The patient was admitted with respiratory failure and a new variceal bleed.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient had an episode of hypoxia requiring CPAP due to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertension and continued volume overload. However, the patient improved on CPAP and is now back on a face mask and doing well. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status and oxygen saturation levels.

2. Variceal Bleed: The patient has had multiple episodes of small-volume melena overnight. The initial bleed is likely due to portal hypertension, which is a common complication of cirrhosis. Thrombocytopenia and uremic platelet dysfunction may also contribute to the bleeding. The patient received DDAVP on HD1 and was given pantoprazole, carafate, and nadolol. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and transfuse as necessary to keep the Hct >25 unless there are obvious signs of bleeding.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure with an unclear etiology. The differential diagnosis includes preren"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient was admitted to the ICU with an upper gastrointestinal bleed and hemodynamic instability. They have a history of severe rash to cephalexin, allergies to Keflex (Cephalexin Monohydrate), and received blood products in the morning. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/47-148/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient is on multiple medications including Cipro for SBP prophylaxis, Carafate for gastrointestinal protection, and Pantoprazole (Protonix) for longer-term management of the upper GI bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored due to acute renal failure. This can be indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and reduced urine output.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient initially presented with an upper gastrointestinal bleed, which requires ongoing monitoring for re-bleeding or ongoing blood loss. The use of Carafate and Pantoprazole is aimed at preventing further bleeding and protecting the gastrointestinal mucosa.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: There is no specific information provided about impaired skin integrity in the progress note. However, it is important to assess the patient's skin regularly"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 yo F with cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, admitted
   with respiratory failure and new variceal bleed.
   .
   # Resp failure: Extubated successfully [**3-24**]. Episode of hypoxia
   requiring CPAP likely due to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
   hypertension and continued volume overload.  Patient improved on CPAP
   and now is back on face mask and doing well.
   - 3L removed during Ultrafiltration  yesterday w/ continued improvement
   in resp status and blood pressure.
   - CPAP if additional episodes of respiratory distress, will try to
   avoid reintubation if possible
   - consider restarting patient
s home anti-hypertensives if Patient
   consistently hypertensive as she appears more stable hemodynamically as
   bleeding is currently resolved.
   .
   # Variceal bleed: Patient with continued multiple episodes of small
   volume melena overnight on [**3-25**].  Hct stable.  Initial bleed most likely
   due to portal hypertension.  Predisposing factor is thrombocytopenia
   and may also have a component of uremic plt dysfunction. Received DDAVP
   on HD1. Per GI, d/c
d octreotide [**3-23**], cipro [**3-24**].
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg PO daily (discharge home on PPI)
   - Carafate 1g QID x 7days (Day 1= [**2125-3-24**])
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Check Hct [**Hospital1 **], more often if increased melena or frank bleeding.
   .
   # Renal failure: currently etiology unclear. Differential includes
   prerenal ARF-> ATN, but workup in place for glomerulonephritis and
   vasculitis. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]/ANCA negative. ASO positive. CRP elevated at 73.3.
   Renal U/S showed no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass,
   making obstruction very unlikely. Min urine (~20cc/hr). Careful volume
   resuscitation as CHF hx. U/A w/ [**3-22**] RBCs, >50 WBCs.
   - New tunneled HD line placed [**3-22**].
   - ASO titer positive. [**Month (only) 60**] have component of post-streptococcal GN.
   - Last HD (ultrafiltration) [**3-25**] w/ -3L. Per renal next HD [**3-27**] unless
   requires more fluid off today.
   - Appreciate further Renal recs, especially regarding possibility for
   recovery of pt
s renal function.
   .
   # CHF: 2.5L removed during HD [**3-23**], 4.7L during HD [**3-24**], 3L during HD
   [**3-25**]. Had not required levophed during HD since [**3-24**].  Appears to have
   ongoing pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Continue HD today
   - monitor O2 sats, symptoms
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely due to portal hypertension with splenic
   sequestration.  Per report, heme at OSH concerned patient may have a
   component of HIT due to Lovenox as pt. is known HIT Ab+.  Of note, she
   has been receiving heparin flushes through her HD catheter. Received 2U
   platelets [**3-24**] w/ appropriate bump, but plts again decreased to 30.
   - Avoid heparin products. F/U HIT antibody, serotonin release assay per
   Heme.
   - Appreciate input from hematology regarding hx of HIT Ab+ and
   treatment for this patient.  Of note patient does have afib, but would
   like to avoid anticoagulation in the setting of GIB.  Consider whether
   argatroban should be initiated for afib or avoided due to GIB.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely both chronic and acute components.  Hct currently
   stable. On epogen/Fe at transfer.
   - Epo 10000U TIW per heme, ok per Renal.
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >30
   - Check Hct [**Hospital1 **], more often if increased melena or frank bleeding.
   .
   # T2DM: On Lantus 25U qPM at home.
   - ISS w/ QID FS while NPO. Will readdress when Pt has glucose source.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On 50mcg levothyroxine at home.
   - 25mcg IV levothyroxine daily as NPO, will transition to home regimen
   when taking POs.
   .
   # CAD: Known h/o CAD with 3 stents.
   - Lipitor 25mg qAM.
   - Holding ASA given recent GIB and antihypertensives given hypotension.
   .
   # Confusion: Per family, patient sometime becomes confused at night.
   The patient was awake much of last night which may have contributed to
   confusion as well as morphine received for respiratory distress this
   am.
   - limit narcotics
   - soft restraints prn to maintain lines
   - consider zyprexa prn (not needed last night)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, renal failure, and known coronary artery disease. She was admitted with respiratory failure and a new variceal bleed. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, variceal bleed, renal failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), thrombocytopenia, anemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypothyroidism, and confusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had an episode of hypoxia requiring CPAP due to flash pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of respiratory status is necessary to prevent reintubation.
2. Variceal Bleed: The patient has had multiple episodes of small-volume melena. Pantoprazole and Carafate have been prescribed to prevent further bleeding.
3. Renal Failure: The etiology of renal failure is unclear, but it may be due to pre-renal acute kidney injury (AKI) progressing to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Further evaluation and management are required.
4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has been diuresed with a total of 2.5L, 4.7L, and 3L during dialysis sessions. Ongoing pulmonary edema on chest X-ray suggests continued volume"
