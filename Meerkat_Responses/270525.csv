   FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube distal tip projects approximately 4 cm
   above
   the carinal bifurcation.  Please note that the tracheal cuff is
   overinflated.
   The right central line terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  In the
   interim,
   there is worsening of pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions, although
   the
   lung bases are not included on this radiograph.  There are significant
   degenerative changes involving both shoulders with dislocation of the
   left
   shoulder joint.
   IMPRESSION:
   1.  Worsening edema and effusion in both lungs.
   2.  The tracheal cuff is overinflated.
   3.  Left shoulder dislocation with significant degenerative changes.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Oxygenation improved today, good RSBI. Plan for SBT today. Patient
   received aggressive volume resuscitation yesterday, so to facilitate
   vent wening will diurese today goal 1L negative. Will also increase
   beta blockade for improved rate control, as poorly controlled afib may
   also limit coming off vent.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Doing well off of pressors. Most likely secondary to pneumonia. Goal
   MAP>65, replace foley to follow urine output.
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   CXR without lobar infiltrate, does show pulmonary edema. Nevertheless
   pna not excluded esp. atypical or viral [**Doctor Last Name **]. Cultures pending, sputum
   ordered and viral panel pending. Would continue current antibiotics for
   now given good clinical response to meropenem, azithromycin,
   vancomycin. Reculture if febrile and follow up cultures.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Cr improved today, placing foley to follow urine output more
   accurately, follow Cr.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Beta blocker and CCB held yesterday in setting of hypotension with
   pressor requirement. Will resume today, as tolerated by BP.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Continue insulin drip. Can resume SQ insulin when awake and taking PO.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   h/o ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella [**3-2**] urine, should be covered by
   meropenem. Follow up cultures.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Resume beta blockers as above, diuresing 1L negative as above.
 ANEMIA
   Transfused yesterday per sepsis protocol to increase SVO2. Hct stable,
   no evidence of active bleeding. Transfuse Hb>7.
 Left shoulder dislocation, suspected
   Repeat shoulder imaging to better assess, follow up with ortho if
   needed

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Pt currently in septic shock. Currently on sepsis protocol. Has had 5L
   of NS thus far. Also on pressors. Will start dobumatine as cardiac
   functioning impaired. No urgent indication for PA catheter at this
   time. Goal MAP > 65, SvO2 > 70%, glucose 80-150. Will treat for
   suspected pulmonary and urinary source with vancomycin, meropenem, and
   azithromycin. Urgent A-line placement. Cortisol simulation but will
   empirically treat with steroids given clinical history and recent
   therapy with Megace. Will give one dose of dexamethasone now while
   awaiting cortisol level. Transfuse 1 unit of blood, goal HCT 30. BCx
   pending, will obtain UCx, U/A grossly positive. Will send influenza,
   c.diff, and sputum culture. CXR with evidence of B/L infiltrates, once
   ABG and assessment of oxygenation, may need to switch to ARDS net
   protocol for ventilation.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Most likely [**3-5**] to PNA/septic shock. Also concern for cardiogenic shock
   given pt
s longstanding cardiac disease and intravascular depletion.
   Wean FiO2 as tolerated. STAT ABG and placement of A-line. Consider ARDS
   net ventilation if difficulty with oxygenation. ABx regimen vancomycin
   (IV for HAP, PO for c.diff), meropenem, azithromycin. Will send sputum
   and respiratory cultures.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Baseline 0.7, currenly 1.1. Renal dose meds, dose vancomycin by level.
   Aggressive IVF resustitation. Goal urine output at least 30 mL/hour.
   Will send urine lytes and UCx.
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   Cover broadly given patient frequently in hospital and rehab.
   Vancomycin, meropenem, and azithromycin. Will send sputum culture and
   respiratory cultures.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Hold antihypertensives for now given septic shock. Monitor HR. Continue
   ASA and Plavix.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Insulin gtt given need for tight glycemic control in the setting of
   septic shock.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Cover with meropenem given h/o ESBL. Will send UCx.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Will start dobutamine given cardiac dysfunction in setting of septic
   shock. Repeat TTE today. Continue ASA and Plavix. BNP extremely
   elevated.
   ANEMIA
   Transfuse to keep HCT 30.

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and atrial fibrillation (afib) who presents from rehab with respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction and is currently in septic shock. He is on pressors and receiving fluid resuscitation. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 128/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient has been placed on invasive ventilation and has an arterial line, presep catheter, and central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16,000 cells/mmÂ³, elevated lactate level of 2.3 mmol/L, and signs of renal dysfunction with an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 29.6 mg/dL and creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. 

Chest X-ray shows evidence of bilateral infiltrates, suggesting possible pneumonia. Urine culture is positive, indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem, and azithromycin. He is also receiving dobutamine for cardiac"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with respiratory failure and septic shock. The note details the patient's medical history, current vital signs, laboratory results, and ongoing treatments.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which may worsen if there are issues with ventilation or oxygenation.

2. Septic shock: The patient is also in septic shock, which can lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction, hypotension, and tissue perfusion issues.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): There is suspicion of a urinary tract infection, which could progress to a more serious infection if not treated appropriately.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, and if left untreated, it could result in worsening lung function and other complications.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient has shown signs of acute renal failure in the past, which may reoccur if kidney function is compromised.

6. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type II: The patient has a history of diabetes, and poor glycemic control can increase the risk of complications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with respiratory failure and septic shock, likely related to a urinary and/or pulmonary source. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. Complications such as organ dysfunction, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and septic shock may occur.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Complications such as abscess formation or pleural effusion can occur.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient is also diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, which can lead to complications such as pyelonephritis or urosepsis if it becomes systemic.

5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration leading to chronic kidney disease.

6. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type II: The patient has a pre-existing diagnosis of type II diabetes, and poor glycemic control can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.

7. Heart failure (CHF),"

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate to
   severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %). No masses
   or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber
   size is normal with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
   valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
   There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-10-18**], there has
   been marked/diffuse biventricular systolic dysfunction c/w diffuse
   process (toxin, metabolic, cannot exclude multivessel CAD but less
   likely as no focality to dysfunction). The left pleural effusion is now
   much larger.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Initial dyspnea likely due to influenza, patient now with increased
   pulmonary edema following aggressive volume resuscitation for sepsis.
   Oxygenation improved today, good RSBI
 but failed SBT yesterday
   secondary to hypoxia. Will wean to PSV today and reassess respiratory
   status later today for consideration of repeat SBT. Will continue
   diuresis to goal negative 1-2liters, increase rate control with
   titration up of metoprolol. Will continue vancomycin now pending sputum
   culture results as patient at risk for staph superinfection in setting
   of influenza. Given elevated vancomycin trough today will hold
   vancomycin today and repeat trough in AM, goal trough 15-20. Can D/C
   azithromycin.  Meropenem will be continued as well for UTI.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Doing well off of pressors. Most likely secondary to pneumonia. Goal
   MAP>65, follow urine output.
 Influenza
   Respiratory virus screen positive for influenza B antigen, cx pending.
   Day 2 of [**Last Name (LF) 1071**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue for 5 day course.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Cr slightly elevated from yesterday, making good amount s of urine.
   Follow for now.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Patient on both diltiazem and metoprolol at home, neither of which at
   maximum dose, uncertain why patient on both of these. Increase
   metoprolol as above. Apparently not on anticoagulation at [**Hospital 1072**], but will review records
 in any case INR supratherapeutic at
   5.4 today.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Continue SQ insulin with fingersticks, glucose under fair control, goal
   fingersticks<150.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   h/o ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella [**3-2**] urine, should be covered by

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Oxygenation improved today, good RSBI. Plan for SBT today. Patient
   received aggressive volume resuscitation yesterday, so to facilitate
   vent wening will diurese today goal 1L negative. Will also increase
   beta blockade for improved rate control, as poorly controlled afib may
   also limit coming off vent.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Doing well off of pressors. Most likely secondary to pneumonia. Goal
   MAP>65, replace foley to follow urine output.
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   CXR without lobar infiltrate, does show pulmonary edema. Nevertheless
   pna not excluded esp. atypical or viral [**Doctor Last Name **]. Cultures pending, sputum
   ordered and viral panel pending. Would continue current antibiotics for
   now given good clinical response to meropenem, azithromycin,
   vancomycin. Reculture if febrile and follow up cultures.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Cr improved today, placing foley to follow urine output more
   accurately, follow Cr.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Beta blocker and CCB held yesterday in setting of hypotension with
   pressor requirement. Will resume today, as tolerated by BP.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Continue insulin drip. Can resume SQ insulin when awake and taking PO.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   h/o ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella [**3-2**] urine, should be covered by
   meropenem. Follow up cultures.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Resume beta blockers as above, diuresing 1L negative as above.
 ANEMIA
   Transfused yesterday per sepsis protocol to increase SVO2. Hct stable,
   no evidence of active bleeding. Transfuse Hb>7.
 Left shoulder dislocation, suspected
   Repeat shoulder imaging to better assess, follow up with ortho if
   needed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted to the hospital with respiratory distress and has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's recent events include being rate controlled and diuresed, but failing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday. A viral panel came back positive for influenza B, and he has been started on tamiflu. There is also a question about a clot removed from his urethra. Additionally, the patient has a dislocated left shoulder, and imaging will be repeated when he is more stable. Due to sedation, the patient is unable to provide a medical history.

The patient's allergies include Bactrim (oral) with a rash and Remeron with an unknown reaction. His last dose of antibiotics was Azithromycin 500mg IV daily on day 3, Meropenem 500mg IV q6h daily 3, and Vancomycin 1g IV daily on day 3.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Oxygenation improved today, good RSBI. Plan for SBT today. Patient
   received aggressive volume resuscitation yesterday, so to facilitate
   vent wening will diurese today goal 1L negative. Will also increase
   beta blockade for improved rate control, as poorly controlled afib may
   also limit coming off vent.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Doing well off of pressors. Most likely secondary to pneumonia. Goal
   MAP>65, replace foley to follow urine output.
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   CXR without lobar infiltrate, does show pulmonary edema. Nevertheless
   pna not excluded esp. atypical or viral [**Doctor Last Name **]. Cultures pending, sputum
   ordered and viral panel pending. Would continue current antibiotics for
   now given good clinical response to meropenem, azithromycin,
   vancomycin. Reculture if febrile and follow up cultures.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Cr improved today, placing foley to follow urine output more
   accurately, follow Cr.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Beta blocker and CCB held yesterday in setting of hypotension with
   pressor requirement. Will resume today, as tolerated by BP.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Continue insulin drip. Can resume SQ insulin when awake and taking PO.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   h/o ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella [**3-2**] urine, should be covered by
   meropenem. Follow up cultures.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Resume beta blockers as above, diuresing 1L negative as above.
 ANEMIA
   Transfused yesterday per sepsis protocol to increase SVO2. Hct stable,
   no evidence of active bleeding. Transfuse Hb>7.
 Left shoulder dislocation, suspected
   Repeat shoulder imaging to better assess, follow up with ortho if
   needed

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with respiratory distress and has been diagnosed with influenza B. The patient has had several medical complications including a clot in his urethra, dislocated left shoulder, decreased ejection fraction (EF), and acute renal failure (ARF). He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been treated with antibiotics, sedatives, and pain medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains sedated and unable to provide a history. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a positive viral panel for influenza B and shows signs of pulmonary edema on the chest X-ray. It is important to continue current antibiotics and monitor for any changes in respiratory status.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his bacterial pneumonia and positive blood cultures. Close monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and laboratory values is necessary.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure. Continued monitoring of renal function and adjustment of fluid and electrolyte management are needed.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can contribute to poor rate control and further complications. Beta-blockers should be resumed as tolerated.

   TTE
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate to
   severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %). No masses
   or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber
   size is normal with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
   valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
   There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-10-18**], there has
   been marked/diffuse biventricular systolic dysfunction c/w diffuse
   process (toxin, metabolic, cannot exclude multivessel CAD but less
   likely as no focality to dysfunction). The left pleural effusion is now
   much larger.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Initial dyspnea likely due to influenza, patient now with increased
   pulmonary edema following aggressive volume resuscitation for sepsis.
   Oxygenation improved today, good RSBI
 but failed SBT yesterday
   secondary to hypoxia. Will wean to PSV today and reassess respiratory
   status later today for consideration of repeat SBT. Will continue
   diuresis to goal negative 1-2liters, increase rate control with
   titration up of metoprolol. Will continue vancomycin now pending sputum
   culture results as patient at risk for staph superinfection in setting
   of influenza. Given elevated vancomycin trough today will hold
   vancomycin today and repeat trough in AM, goal trough 15-20. Can D/C
   azithromycin.  Meropenem will be continued as well for UTI.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Doing well off of pressors. Most likely secondary to pneumonia. Goal
   MAP>65, follow urine output.
 Influenza
   Respiratory virus screen positive for influenza B antigen, cx pending.
   Day 2 of [**Last Name (LF) 1071**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue for 5 day course.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Cr slightly elevated from yesterday, making good amount s of urine.
   Follow for now.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Patient on both diltiazem and metoprolol at home, neither of which at
   maximum dose, uncertain why patient on both of these. Increase
   metoprolol as above. Apparently not on anticoagulation at [**Hospital 1072**], but will review records
 in any case INR supratherapeutic at
   5.4 today.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Continue SQ insulin with fingersticks, glucose under fair control, goal
   fingersticks<150.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   h/o ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella [**3-2**] urine, should be covered by
   meropenem. s/p ~7 day course gentamicin. Repeat urinalysis/culture.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   EF depressed on TTE yesterday, suspect influenza related myocarditis.
   No evidence of new ischemic event as patient ruled out for MI by
   biomarkers. Can consider repeat TTE as outpatient to assess for
   recovery of pump function. Continue beta blockers, diuresis as above.
 Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 5.4 today, with PTT stable, elevated ~45. Concern for
   DIC given recent sepsis, so will check fibrinogen, smear, FDP. Will
   give PO vitamin K and repeat coags in afternoon. Discontinue
   subcutaneous heparin.
 ANEMIA
   No evidence of active bleeding. Had normal iron studies [**2-8**], normal
   B12 and folate [**10-9**].
   Transfused yesterday per sepsis protocol to increase SVO2. Hct stable,
   no evidence of active bleeding. Transfuse Hb>7.

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory distress from another hospital. The patient's condition has been unstable, with rate-controlled and diuresed but failed spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday. The viral panel came back positive for influenza B, and he has been started on tamiflu. There is also a question about a clot removed from the urethra. The patient has a dislocated left shoulder, which will be reimaged when more stable. Due to sedation, the patient is unable to provide any history.

The patient has multiple allergies, including Bactrim (oral) causing a rash and Remeron with an unknown reaction. The last doses of antibiotics given were meropenem, azithromycin, and vancomycin. The patient is currently on infusions of fentanyl and midazolam (versed), as well as other medications.

The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. The flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 20 mmHg, cardiac output (CO)"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old male with influenza B, presenting with shock and hypoxic respiratory failure due to flu, pulmonary edema from global hypokinesis. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, severe sepsis, bacterial pneumonia, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, and acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure with a possible myocardial infarction.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure leading to ARDS, further deterioration of renal function, progression of sepsis and septic shock, development of complications related to atrial fibrillation such as stroke or heart rhythm disturbances, worsening of diabetes control, progression of urinary tract infection, and worsening of heart failure.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygenation, renal function, blood glucose levels, and coagulation profile. Promptly addressing any changes in the patient's condition and adjusting the treatment plan accordingly is crucial. Additionally, the patient's code status of full code should be respected, and efforts should be made to optimize cardiac function, manage fluid balance, and prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with influenza B, presenting with shock and hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza and pulmonary edema from new global hypokinesis. The patient has multiple medical complications including heart failure, coagulopathy, urinary tract infection, anemia, and general ICU care. The patient's current treatment plan includes diuresis, continuing Tamiflu and empiric antibiotics, cardiac optimization, and continuing assisted ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to influenza and pulmonary edema. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and potential cardiovascular collapse.
2. Heart failure: The patient's global hypokinesis suggests acute systolic heart failure. If left untreated, this can progress to cardiogenic shock and multiorgan dysfunction.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and PTT, indicating a coagulopathy. This increases the risk of bleeding complications. Monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management is crucial.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The presence of yeast in the urine suggests a UTI. If not treated promptly, it can lead to systemic infection and sepsis.
5. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which may worsen over time. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and appropriate management is necessary.
6. General ICU care: The patient requires general ICU care, including"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Initial dyspnea likely due to influenza, patient now with increased
   pulmonary edema following aggressive volume resuscitation for sepsis.
   On repeat SBT today breathing became more labored so now back on AC.
   CXR shows persistent pulmonary edema. Patient needs continued diuresis,
   goal net negative 1-2 liters today. Will also aim for improved rate
   control, titrate metoprolol. Continue antibiotic coverage for now,
   follow up cultures. Holding vancomcyin today given elevated trough,
   would redose tomorrow for trough <20.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Doing well off of pressors. Most likely secondary to pneumonia. Goal
   MAP>65, follow urine output.
 Influenza
   Respiratory virus screen positive for influenza B antigen, cx pending.
   Day 3 of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue for 5 day course.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Cr stable, making good amount s of urine. Follow for now.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Patient on both diltiazem and metoprolol at home, neither of which at
   maximum dose, uncertain why patient on both of these. Increase
   metoprolol as above. Start heparin for anticoagulation for INR<2 today.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Continue SQ insulin with fingersticks, glucose under fair control, goal
   fingersticks<150.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Repeat UA with pyuria, only yeast isolated on recent cx, foley changed
   yesterday. Would not treat yeast in urine.
   Follow up repeat urine culture.
   h/o ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella [**3-2**] urine, should be covered by
   meropenem. s/p ~7 day course gentamicin.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   EF depressed on TTE yesterday, suspect influenza related myocarditis.
   No evidence of new ischemic event as patient ruled out for MI by
   biomarkers. Can consider repeat TTE as outpatient to assess for
   recovery of pump function. Continue beta blockers, diuresis as above.
   Start captopril for afterload reduction, titrate up as BP tolerates.
 Coagulopathy
   Upon further history patient was indeed taking warfarin at home.
   Elevation may have been secondary to antibiotics vs nutrition. INR
   reversed successfully following vitamin K. Labs yesterday suggestive of
   possible low level DIC, will follow closely for evidence of bleeding.
 ANEMIA
   No evidence of active bleeding. Had normal iron studies [**2-8**], normal
   B12 and folate [**10-9**].
   Transfused yesterday per sepsis protocol to increase SVO2. Hct stable,
   no evidence of active bleeding. Transfuse Hb>7.
 Left shoulder dislocation, suspected
   Repeat shoulder imaging in [**3-6**] weeks to better assess per ortho recs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: restart tube feeds, holding after midnight for ?extubation
   tomorrow.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Initial dyspnea likely due to influenza, patient now with increased
   pulmonary edema following aggressive volume resuscitation for sepsis.
   Oxygenation improved today, good RSBI
 but failed SBT yesterday
   secondary to hypoxia. Will wean to PSV today and reassess respiratory
   status later today for consideration of repeat SBT. Will continue
   diuresis to goal negative 1-2liters, increase rate control with
   titration up of metoprolol. Will continue vancomycin now pending sputum
   culture results as patient at risk for staph superinfection in setting
   of influenza. Given elevated vancomycin trough today will hold
   vancomycin today and repeat trough in AM, goal trough 15-20. Can D/C
   azithromycin.  Meropenem will be continued as well for UTI.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Doing well off of pressors. Most likely secondary to pneumonia. Goal
   MAP>65, follow urine output.
 Influenza
   Respiratory virus screen positive for influenza B antigen, cx pending.
   Day 2 of [**Last Name (LF) 1071**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue for 5 day course.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Cr slightly elevated from yesterday, making good amount s of urine.
   Follow for now.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Patient on both diltiazem and metoprolol at home, neither of which at
   maximum dose, uncertain why patient on both of these. Increase
   metoprolol as above. Apparently not on anticoagulation at [**Hospital 1072**], but will review records
 in any case INR supratherapeutic at
   5.4 today.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Continue SQ insulin with fingersticks, glucose under fair control, goal
   fingersticks<150.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   h/o ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella [**3-2**] urine, should be covered by
   meropenem. s/p ~7 day course gentamicin. Repeat urinalysis/culture.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   EF depressed on TTE yesterday, suspect influenza related myocarditis.
   No evidence of new ischemic event as patient ruled out for MI by
   biomarkers. Can consider repeat TTE as outpatient to assess for
   recovery of pump function. Continue beta blockers, diuresis as above.
 Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 5.4 today, with PTT stable, elevated ~45. Concern for
   DIC given recent sepsis, so will check fibrinogen, smear, FDP. Will
   give PO vitamin K and repeat coags in afternoon. Discontinue
   subcutaneous heparin.
 ANEMIA
   No evidence of active bleeding. Had normal iron studies [**2-8**], normal
   B12 and folate [**10-9**].
   Transfused yesterday per sepsis protocol to increase SVO2. Hct stable,
   no evidence of active bleeding. Transfuse Hb>7.
 Left shoulder dislocation, suspected
   Repeat shoulder imaging to better assess, follow up with ortho if
   needed

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and CHF admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. He was found to have influenza and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has been diuresed, switched to pressure support ventilation, and given IV vitamin K due to being on Coumadin at home. The patient's allergies include Bactrim and Remeron. He is currently on multiple medications including heparin sodium, furosemide, meropenem, vancomycin, and propofol. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the inability to answer pain questions. His vital signs show tachycardia and mild hypotension. The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, warm skin, and irregularly irregular tachyarrhythmia. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils, elevated troponin T, elevated D-dimer, and abnormal renal function tests. The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, influenza, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, urinary tract infection, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, coagulopathy, anemia, and left shoulder dislocation. The plan includes continuing diuresis to goal negative 1-2 liters, increasing rate control with titration up of metoprolol, continuing vancomycin pending s"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with several medical complications. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU includes:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and failed a spontaneous breathing test (SBT). He is sedated and intubated.

2. Systolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has developed new systolic CHF, which is likely related to his current critical illness.

3. Shock from Influenza: The patient previously experienced shock due to influenza, but it has since resolved.

4. Influenza B Infection: The patient tested positive for influenza B.

5. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis, likely secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

6. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, but there is improvement noted.

7. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has atrial fibrillation, which requires rate control.

8. Type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient has type II diabetes, which is currently being managed with SC insulin as needed.

9. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): There is a mention of a urinary tract infection, but no specific treatment plan is mentioned.

","The patient is an 85-year-old man with respiratory failure, new systolic congestive heart failure, and resolved shock from influenza. He failed a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) today and exhibits shallow and rapid breathing with paradoxical movement of his chest wall. This suggests either congestive heart failure (CHF) or respiratory failure-related breathing pattern, rather than sedation-related.

Based on the assessment and plan, the patient has multiple medical complications including:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the combination of influenza-induced pneumonia and acute heart failure.

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute: The patient has developed acute systolic heart failure, which may be contributing to his respiratory failure.

3. Sepsis, Severe (with Organ Dysfunction): The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, likely secondary to bacterial pneumonia.

4. Pneumonia, Bacterial, Community Acquired (CAP): The patient has community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, which may have led to the development of sepsis.

5. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): The patient has acute renal failure, possibly as a result of sepsis or dehydration.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Initial dyspnea likely due to influenza, now key issue likely pulmonary
   edema following aggressive volume resuscitation for sepsis.  Given
   labored breathing and RSBI of 110 not yet ready for extubation.  ABG
   c/w respiratory alkalosis
 increase sedation, may need to resume AC.
   Repeat ABG this morning.
   CXR shows persistent pulmonary edema. Patient needs continued diuresis,
   goal net negative 1-2 liters today. Check PM electrolytes given
   diuresis. Will also aim for improved rate control, titrate metoprolol.
   Will also seek to optimize rate control for afib and afterload
   reduction given systolic HF, increasing metoprolol and captopril today.
   Sputum shows S. aureus, sensitivites of which are pending will be
   covered by current vancomycin. Would continue antibiotics  for 8 day
   course. Dose vancomcyin today, goal trough 15-20. Can d/c meropenem as
   no evidence for gram negative infection.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Doing well off of pressors. Most likely secondary to pneumonia. Goal
   MAP>65, follow urine output.
 Influenza
   Respiratory virus screen positive for influenza B antigen, cx pending.
   Day 4 of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue for 5 day course.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Cr stable, making good amount s of urine. Follow for now.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Patient on both diltiazem and metoprolol at home, neither of which at
   maximum dose, uncertain why patient on both of these. Increase
   metoprolol as above. Continue IV heparin.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Continue SQ insulin with fingersticks, glucose under fair control, goal
   fingersticks<150.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Recent [**3-2**] ESBL E coli and Klebsiella, s/p gentamicin and recently
   meropenem.
   Repeat urine cx with yeast only. Kidney imaging without evidence of
   hydronephrosis, abscess
 would hold off on treating funguria as no
   evidence of benefit.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   EF depressed on TTE yesterday, suspect influenza related myocarditis.
   No evidence of new ischemic event as patient ruled out for MI by
   biomarkers. Can consider repeat TTE as outpatient to assess for
   recovery of pump function. Continue beta blockers, diuresis as above.
   Increase captopril for afterload reduction, titrate up as BP tolerates.
 Coagulopathy
   Upon further history patient was indeed taking warfarin at home.
   Elevation may have been secondary to antibiotics vs nutrition. INR
   reversed successfully following vitamin K.
 ANEMIA
   No evidence of active bleeding. Had normal iron studies [**2-8**], normal
   B12 and folate [**10-9**].
   Hct stable, transfuse Hb>7.
 Left shoulder dislocation, suspected
   Repeat shoulder imaging in [**3-6**] weeks to better assess per ortho recs

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and CAD. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress due to influenza. He failed a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) and was placed back on assisted ventilation (AC). The patient has persistent candiduria, and a renal ultrasound showed an angiomyolipoma of the right kidney. Family meetings were held to discuss the patient's poor long-term prognosis, although he may recover from this acute illness. The patient has allergies to Bactrim and Risperidone, and his last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 03/25/2018 at 02:00 AM and meropenem on 03/26/2018 at 02:00 AM. Other medications include review of systems unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial dyspnea likely due to influenza has now progressed to acute respiratory failure, possibly secondary to pulmonary edema following aggressive volume resuscitation for sepsis. The patient is not yet ready for extubation, and ABG results show respiratory alkalosis. Continued diuresis is needed to manage pulmonary edema, and sedation may need to be increased.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, likely secondary to pneumonia. Antibiotics are being continued for an 8-day course, and vancomycin"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and CAD who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and diagnosed with influenza. He failed a spontaneous breathing trial due to labored breathing and was placed back on assisted ventilation. The patient has a poor long-term prognosis but may recover from this acute illness. He also has renal dysfunction and has shown signs of candiduria, but an ultrasound revealed only angiomyolipoma. The patient has allergies to Bactrim and Remeron, and his last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin and meropenem. His review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for pain, which he is unable to answer. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 105/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a central venous pressure of 12 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,478 mL and output of 3,720 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,242 mL. The patient is receiving CPAP/PPS ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL and respiratory system resistance of 110. ABG results indicate pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 25 mmHg, PaO2/FiO"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Initial dyspnea likely due to influenza, patient now with pulmonary
   edema following aggressive volume resuscitation for sepsis.  Given
   labored breathing and RSBI of 110 not yet ready for extubation.
   CXR shows persistent pulmonary edema. Patient needs continued diuresis,
   goal net negative 1-2 liters today. Will also aim for improved rate
   control, titrate metoprolol.
   Sputum shows S. aureus, sensitivites of which are pending. Would
   continue vancomycin. Dose vancomcyin today, goal trough 15-20. Can d/c
   meropenem.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   Doing well off of pressors. Most likely secondary to pneumonia. Goal
   MAP>65, follow urine output.
 Influenza
   Respiratory virus screen positive for influenza B antigen, cx pending.
   Day 3 of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue for 5 day course.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Cr stable, making good amount s of urine. Follow for now.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Patient on both diltiazem and metoprolol at home, neither of which at
   maximum dose, uncertain why patient on both of these. Increase
   metoprolol as above. Start heparin for anticoagulation for INR<2 today.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Continue SQ insulin with fingersticks, glucose under fair control, goal
   fingersticks<150.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Repeat UA with pyuria, only yeast isolated on recent cx, foley changed
   yesterday. Would not treat yeast in urine.
   Follow up repeat urine culture.
   h/o ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella [**3-2**] urine, should be covered by
   meropenem. s/p ~7 day course gentamicin.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   EF depressed on TTE yesterday, suspect influenza related myocarditis.
   No evidence of new ischemic event as patient ruled out for MI by
   biomarkers. Can consider repeat TTE as outpatient to assess for
   recovery of pump function. Continue beta blockers, diuresis as above.
   Increase captopril for afterload reduction, titrate up as BP tolerates.
 Coagulopathy
   Upon further history patient was indeed taking warfarin at home.
   Elevation may have been secondary to antibiotics vs nutrition. INR
   reversed successfully following vitamin K.
 ANEMIA
   No evidence of active bleeding. Had normal iron studies [**2-8**], normal
   B12 and folate [**10-9**].
   Transfused yesterday per sepsis protocol to increase SVO2. Hct stable,
   no evidence of active bleeding. Transfuse Hb>7.
 Left shoulder dislocation, suspected
   Repeat shoulder imaging in [**3-6**] weeks to better assess per ortho recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and CAD admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress due to influenza. The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial and was placed back on assisted ventilation. A family meeting was held to discuss the patient's poor long-term prognosis, although he may pull through this acute illness. Renal ultrasound showed only an angiomyolipoma. The patient has allergies to Bactrim and Remeron. He received vancomycin and meropenem as antibiotics. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/56 mmHg to 170/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. The patient has atrial fibrillation. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,478 mL and output of 3,720 mL. 

Respiratory support includes CPAP/PPS mode on the ventilator with set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 13 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas values are pH 7.50, PaCO2 25 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio 287, and ventilation rate of 7.2 L/min. 

Physical examination reveals the patient to be thin, with clear breath sounds and paradoxical breathing. He has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's extremities are absent pulses on both sides. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 320 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's coagulation profile indicates an INR of 1.5 and PTT of 150. Chest X-ray shows right upper lobe opacity, left-sided effusion, and decreased vascular markings. 

Assessment and plan include respiratory failure, severe sepsis, influenza, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, urinary tract infection, heart failure, coagulopathy, and anemia. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and he is currently in the ICU."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. They have been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, community-acquired pneumonia, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure, and acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with high heart rate, fluctuating blood pressure, low respiratory rate, and low oxygen saturation. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and is volume overloaded. They have a history of chronic anemia, coagulopathy, and chronic kidney disease. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows pulmonary edema, and microbiology tests reveal yeast in the urine and sparse Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and multiple other medications for their various conditions. They have a do not resuscitate (DNR) order in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure has not shown progress, and they remain on mechanical ventilation. They appear to be volume overloaded, which could further exacerbate their respiratory distress.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis with organ dysfunction indicates that"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and CAD. He was admitted with respiratory distress and influenza. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, urinary tract infection, heart failure (both systolic and diastolic), coagulopathy, and chronic anemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying COPD and influenza infection. The presence of bilateral pleural effusion on the chest X-ray suggests possible fluid overload, which could indicate worsening heart failure or fluid management issues.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.

The patient's medications include antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin) for bacterial pneumonia and MRSA infection, antiviral medication (oseltamivir) for influenza, anticoagulants (heparin), and other supportive medications for various conditions.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of respiratory support, fluid balance, antibiotic therapy, and treatment for other comorbidities."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient has a history of chronic anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, heart failure (both systolic and diastolic), renal failure, atrial fibrillation, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. FiO2 has been decreased to 35%. The patient has shown improvement in oxygenation but remains tachypneic. Sedation attempts with fentanyl/versed resulted in decreased blood pressure to 60/40, but the patient tolerated some fentanyl with improvement in ABG values. The patient's allergies include Bactrim (oral), Remeron (oral), and an unknown medication. The last doses of antibiotics administered were meropenem and vancomycin. The patient is receiving heparin sodium, midazolam (versed), and fentanyl infusions. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (protonix) and furosemide (lasix). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8 C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 104/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, SpO2 of 99%, and a heart rhythm of atrial fibrillation. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,898 mL and output of 2,659 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 8.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL,"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, CHF, and CAD. He was admitted with respiratory distress and diagnosed with respiratory failure due to influenza, volume overload, and bacterial pneumonia. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic anemia, severe sepsis, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, and acute systolic heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and underlying COPD increase the risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters are necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and signs of infection are crucial.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires careful monitoring of renal function and electrolyte balance. Fluid management and potential renal replacement therapy may be needed.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation should be managed with appropriate antiarrhythmic medications and close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's type II diabetes mellitus needs to be managed with insulin therapy and blood glucose monitoring to prevent hyperglycemia.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory distress admitted to the ICU. He has a history of chronic anemia, type II diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, urinary tract infection, systolic and diastolic heart failure, and a recent influenza infection. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, bacterial pneumonia, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and acute myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure due to influenza and Staphylococcus pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory complications if not managed appropriately.

2. Sepsis: The patient has had severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic inflammatory response. This can lead to organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has bacterial pneumonia, which may require continued antibiotic therapy and monitoring for any worsening respiratory symptoms.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, which can be caused by severe sepsis, dehydration, or other factors. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation, which may require anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events. Management of this condition should involve rate control and consideration of rhythm control strategies.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o M with COPD, CHF & CAD admitted for respiratory distress with
   influenza B complicated by MRSA PNA.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE: etiology likely [**3-5**] to influenza c/b secondary
   MRSA PNA, now an element of volume overload from volume resuscitation
   and depressed EF.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions seen on CXR
   today.  Pt currently vented on [**6-11**], RSBI <100 but pt having
   significant apneic episodes and ABG shows resp alkalosis thought due to
   agitation vs vent settings & high MV.
   - decreasing MMV today and recheck ABG in pm & repeat SBT again today
   - will start olanzapine [**Hospital1 **] for possible delirium contributing to resp
   alkalosis
   - completed 5 days of oseltamivir
   - continue Vancomycin for MRSA (am level of 21, holding pm dose)
   - ongoing d/w family re plan for care after extubation if pt unable to
   tolerate.
   - off pressors, no e/o sepsis
LABILE BP: Pt with intermittent hypertension/hypotension, extremely
   medication sensitive and agitation contributing to vascular
   hyperresponsiveness.
   - short acting BB Metoprolol 50mg TID with hold parameters
   - Captopril 6.25mg q6hrs
   - starting olanzapine [**Hospital1 **] for concern of delirium, avoid increasing
   sedation to avoid hypotension
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: HR not well controlled between 100-130s due BP
   lability in response to BB
   - starting digoxin today, will monitor for rate control, continue
   Metoprolol 50mg TID
   - heparin gtt
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II: insulin sliding scale
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): yeast growing from cultures and
   urethral swab.
   - day [**2-3**] of CBI with Amphotericin, monitor UOP
   - will recheck UA on [**3-30**]
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF &
   Echo on [**3-23**] showed new systolic failure with EF of 25-30%,
   presumptively related to influenza myocarditis vs mild troponin leak in
   setting of sepsis, likely demand ischemia
   - likely to improve with resolution of infection, would repeat echo in
   6-8wks
 Coagulopathy: Admitted with supratherapeutic INR on Coumadin as
   outpt, corrected with Vit K
   -  INR currently 1.5 likely due to poor nutrition.  Continue Heparin
   gtt for A.Fib
 Anemia: likely due to chronic disease, hct current 26, monitor daily
   and transfuse for hct <21
 L shoulder dislocation: noted incidentally on CXR, per ortho- better
   to defer management until pt stable to undergo better imaging. Started
   Oxycodone 5mg via g-tube, monitoring for response.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and CAD admitted for respiratory distress due to influenza B complicated by MRSA pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with an RSBI of 50. The patient's blood pressure has been labile, dropping to the 50s after increasing Versed to 0.5 mg/hour, but improved with a 500cc bolus. The patient is also experiencing grimacing to verbal and physical stimuli, responds intermittently to commands, and has been biting and pulling at the endotracheal tube. The patient has allergies to Bactrim and Remeron, and is currently receiving midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and heparin infusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to influenza B complicated by MRSA pneumonia. There is also evidence of volume overload from recent volume resuscitation and depressed EF. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are seen on the CXR today.
2. Labile Blood Pressure: The patient has intermittent hypertension/hypotension, which is medication-sensitive and aggravated by agitation, contributing to vascular hyperresponsiveness.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rate is not well-controlled between 100-130s due to BP lability in response to beta-blocker medication.
4. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type II: The patient has a history of DM and requires insulin sliding scale management.
5. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Yeast is growing from cultures and urethral swab, indicating a UTI.
6. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute: The patient has new systolic failure with an EF of 25-30%, likely related to influenza myocarditis or mild troponin leak in the setting of sepsis.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient was admitted with a supratherapeutic INR on Coumadin, which was corrected with Vit K.
8. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to chronic disease, with a current Hct of 26%. Daily monitoring and transfusion for Hct <21 is planned.
9. Shoulder Dislocation: An incidental finding of shoulder dislocation is noted on the CXR, and orthopedic management will be deferred until the patient is stable enough for better imaging.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o M with COPD, CHF & CAD admitted for respiratory distress with
   influenza B complicated by MRSA PNA.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE: etiology likely [**3-5**] to influenza c/b secondary
   MRSA PNA, now an element of volume overload from volume resuscitation
   and depressed EF.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions seen on CXR
   today.  Pt currently vented on [**6-11**], RSBI <100 but pt having
   significant apneic episodes and ABG shows resp alkalosis thought due to
   agitation vs vent settings & high MV.
   - decreasing MMV today and recheck ABG in pm & repeat SBT again today
   - will start olanzapine [**Hospital1 **] for possible delirium contributing to resp
   alkalosis
   - completed 5 days of oseltamivir
   - continue Vancomycin for MRSA (am level of 21, holding pm dose)
   - ongoing d/w family re plan for care after extubation if pt unable to
   tolerate.
   - off pressors, no e/o sepsis
LABILE BP: Pt with intermittent hypertension/hypotension, extremely
   medication sensitive and agitation contributing to vascular
   hyperresponsiveness.
   - short acting BB Metoprolol 50mg TID with hold parameters
   - Captopril 6.25mg q6hrs
   - starting olanzapine [**Hospital1 **] for concern of delirium, avoid increasing
   sedation to avoid hypotension
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: HR not well controlled between 100-130s due BP
   lability in response to BB
   - starting digoxin today, will monitor for rate control, continue
   Metoprolol 50mg TID
   - heparin gtt
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II: insulin sliding scale
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): yeast growing from cultures and
   urethral swab.
   - day [**2-3**] of CBI with Amphotericin, monitor UOP
   - will recheck UA on [**3-30**]
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF &
   Echo on [**3-23**] showed new systolic failure with EF of 25-30%,
   presumptively related to influenza myocarditis vs mild troponin leak in
   setting of sepsis, likely demand ischemia
   - likely to improve with resolution of infection, would repeat echo in
   6-8wks
 Coagulopathy: Admitted with supratherapeutic INR on Coumadin as
   outpt, corrected with Vit K
   -  INR currently 1.5 likely due to poor nutrition.  Continue Heparin
   gtt for A.Fib
 Anemia: likely due to chronic disease, hct current 26, monitor daily
   and transfuse for hct <21
 L shoulder dislocation: noted incidentally on CXR, per ortho- better
   to defer management until pt stable to undergo better imaging. Started
   Oxycodone 5mg via g-tube, monitoring for response.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and CAD admitted for respiratory distress caused by influenza B complicated by MRSA pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has moderate bilateral pleural effusions and a reduced ejection fraction of 25-30%. The patient's blood pressure is labile, requiring frequent adjustments in medication. He also has atrial fibrillation and is being started on digoxin for rate control. The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by yeast and is being treated with amphotericin. He also has type II diabetes mellitus and is on an insulin sliding scale. The patient has a history of systolic heart failure and is likely to improve with resolution of the infection. Coagulopathy is present due to supratherapeutic INR on Coumadin, which has been corrected with Vitamin K. Anemia is likely due to chronic disease. The patient has a dislocated shoulder, which will be managed after stabilization. He is receiving pain management through a g-tube with oxycodone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by influenza B and MRSA pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the infection spreads or if there are complications related to the mechanical ventilation.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has systolic heart failure with a reduced e"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure, severe sepsis, bacterial pneumonia, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, and acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

24-hour events include a family meeting to discuss plans for extubation and management if re-intubation is needed. The patient's blood pressure dropped to the 50s after increasing the dose of Versed, but improved with a 500cc bolus. The patient's medications were adjusted, including half-dosing of metoprolol and captopril, and starting liquid oxycodone for pain management.

Infusions include midazolam (Versed) at 1 mg/hour, fentanyl at 25 mcg/hour, and heparin sodium at 700 units/hour. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) and midazolam (Versed), which were administered on [**2185-3-27**] at 08:00 AM and 08:45 PM, respectively. Fentanyl infusion was discontinued on [**2185-3-27**] at 11:00 PM.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.4Â°F) with a current temperature of 35.9Â°C (96.6Â°F), heart rate of 120 bpm with a range of 99-133 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/68 mmHg to 173/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with a range of 10-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a heart rhythm of AF.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,322 mL with 566 mL given in the last 24 hours. Output includes 1,067 mL through the gastrointestinal tract, 287 mL through the urinary tract, and 1,925 mL through intravenous fluids with 164 mL output in the last 24 hours. Blood product transfusion was given totaling 2,817 mL with 560 mL given in the last 24 hours. Urine output is 2,817 mL with 560 mL in the last 24 hours.

Respiratory support includes ventilation mode of MMV/PSV/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen of 35%, respiratory system compliance index of 50, and partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of 394. The arterial blood gas analysis shows pH of 7"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has been experiencing volatile blood pressure and agitation/delirium, which have made patient-ventilator interactions difficult.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/68 mmHg to 173/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature of 37.1Â°C. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction, acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, acute systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, Clostridium difficile infection, and chronic anemia.

The plan of care includes continuing ventilatory support, adjusting the ventilator settings based on the ABG results, maintaining gentle diuresis, administering appropriate antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia and MRSA coverage, managing heart failure medications, providing rate control for atrial fibrillation, monitoring renal function, managing diabetes, treating urinary tract infection, and addressing agitation/delirium.

   Total time spent:
","The patient is an 85-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has had difficult ventilator interactions, with volatile blood pressure and agitation/delirium. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute and not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Ventilatory support will be continued for now, with adjustments made as needed.

2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Antibiotics, specifically vancomycin dosed by level for MRSA level, have been initiated and will be continued for a total of 10 days.

3. Renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure, which has since resolved.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and rate control measures will be implemented. Heparin has been started to prevent thromboembolic events.

5. Diabetes mellitus, type II: The patient has diabetes mellitus, which will require ongoing management and monitoring of blood glucose levels.

6. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection, for which antibiotic treatment will be administered.

7. Heart failure: The patient has acute systolic heart failure, presumably related to influenza. Diuretics and afterload reduction will be continued. Captopril will be maintained at a low dose.

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has multiple medical complications including anemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), severe sepsis (with organ dysfunction), bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute renal failure (ARF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), urinary tract infection (UTI), Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) infection, acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure (CHF), and acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF). The patient also had a recent myocardial infarction (AMI).

The patient's vital signs show labile blood pressure, elevated heart rate, and slightly low respiratory rate. The oxygen saturation is within normal limits. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with controlled tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and a low respiratory system resistance and compliance.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, normal electrolyte levels, and elevated D-dimer levels. Imaging shows persistent bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's care plan includes continuing ventilatory support, decreasing minute ventilation due to respiratory alkalosis, continuing diuresis for CHF, treating sepsis with appropriate antibiotics, monitoring renal function, controlling AFib rate, managing diabetes, treating UTI, addressing C. Diff infection, managing CHF with afterload reduction and medication adjustments, and monitoring for complications related to recent AMI. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and elevation of head of bed (HOB) to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of sepsis with organ dysfunction, exacerbation of heart failure, development of kidney injury, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, worsening diabetes control, progression of urinary tract infection, recurrence of C. Diff infection, and potential complications related to recent myocardial infarction."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): etiology multifactorial
   but includes influenza A complicated by MRSA PNA and volume overload
   [**3-5**] resuscitation and depressed EF.  CXR shows stable moderate
   bilateral pleural effusions, no increase in pulm edema.  Pt vented on
   [**11-6**], MMV decreased to 3L overnight, ABG improved this am with pH of
   7.46 & CO2 of 38.  However, sedation was held o/n and pt was somnolent
   & minimally responsive to commands this am, likely not able to tolerate
   extubation.  Complete 5/5 days oseltamivir
   -will advance tube today & recheck placement
   -will attempt to d/c MMV and provide pressure support with 5/5, recheck
   ABG
   -continue Vancomycin day [**9-11**], dosing by level, f/u am level
   -transfuse with 1upRBCs and lasix, goal i/os neg 500cc
   -still working with family about goals post extubation
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION with LABILE BPs: Pt with chronic A.Fib continues
   to have intermittent hyper/hypotension with agitation/delirium.  HR not
   well controlled, ranging from 99-133.
   - continue Captopril 6.25mg q6hrs
   - titrate up Metoprolol currently 75mg TID
   - continue Digoxin
   - Olanzapine 5mg [**Hospital1 **] for delirium
   - continue Heparin gtt with goal PTT of 60-80
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF &
   ECHO on [**3-23**] showed new systolic failure with EF of 25-30%
   presumptively related to influenza vs mild troponin leak in setting of
   demand ischemia.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION: Urine Cultures + yeast, currently day [**3-6**]
   for amphotericin continuous bladder irrigation
   - continue CBI for 1 more day, monitor UOP
   - check UA in am after d/c CBI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. These include respiratory failure, acute atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressures, acute systolic heart failure, urinary tract infection, type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic diastolic heart failure. 

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and includes influenza A complicated by MRSA pneumonia and volume overload. The patient has been intubated and ventilated on assist-control mode with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory system resistance of 78. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows an improved pH of 7.46 and CO2 of 38, indicating better ventilation. However, the patient remains somnolent and minimally responsive to commands, suggesting that they may not be able to tolerate extubation.

The patient also has acute atrial fibrillation with intermittent hyper/hypotension during periods of agitation or delirium. The heart rate is not well controlled, ranging from 99-133 beats per minute. Medications such as captopril, metoprolol, digoxin, and olanzapine are being continued to manage this condition.

Additionally, the patient has acute systolic heart failure with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 25-30%, which is presumptively related to influenza versus mild troponin leak in the setting of demand ischemia. The patient's baseline diastolic heart failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, pneumonia, diabetes mellitus type II, urinary tract infection, acute systolic heart failure, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, and a history of myocardial infarction. The patient is currently in the ICU and is intubated. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.1Â°C (98.8Â°F), heart rate ranging from 115 to 121 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102 to 153/57 to 89 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 10 to 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is being monitored with hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support through mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and new infiltrates on chest x-ray is important.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT and subsequently PE. Prophylactic heparin is being administered to reduce this risk.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at higher risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, community-acquired pneumonia, type II diabetes, urinary tract infection, acute systolic heart failure, and chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to pneumonia and potential complications from mechanical ventilation.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as thromboembolism (stroke) if not adequately anticoagulated.

3. Chronic Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which may contribute to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and potentially worsen organ dysfunction.

4. Community-Acquired Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia, which requires prompt and appropriate antibiotic therapy to prevent worsening of the infection and potential sepsis.

5. Type II Diabetes: The patient has type II diabetes, which needs to be managed carefully to avoid hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, both of which can have significant adverse effects on the patient's health.

6. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which should be treated promptly to prevent the progression of the infection and associated complications like urosepsis.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): etiology multifactorial
   but includes influenza A complicated by MRSA PNA and volume overload
   [**3-5**] resuscitation and depressed EF.  CXR shows stable moderate
   bilateral pleural effusions, no increase in pulm edema.  Pt vented on
   [**11-6**], MMV decreased to 3L overnight, ABG improved this am with pH of
   7.46 & CO2 of 38.  However, sedation was held o/n and pt was somnolent
   & minimally responsive to commands this am, likely not able to tolerate
   extubation.  Complete 5/5 days oseltamivir
   -will advance tube today & recheck placement
   -will attempt to d/c MMV and provide pressure support with 5/5, recheck
   ABG
   -continue Vancomycin day [**9-11**], dosing by level, f/u am level
   -transfuse with 1upRBCs and lasix, goal i/os neg 500cc
   -still working with family about goals post extubation
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION with LABILE BPs: Pt with chronic A.Fib continues
   to have intermittent hyper/hypotension with agitation/delirium.  HR not
   well controlled, ranging from 99-133.
   - continue Captopril 6.25mg q6hrs
   - titrate up Metoprolol currently 75mg TID
   - continue Digoxin
   - Olanzapine 5mg [**Hospital1 **] for delirium
   - continue Heparin gtt with goal PTT of 60-80
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF &
   ECHO on [**3-23**] showed new systolic failure with EF of 25-30%
   presumptively related to influenza vs mild troponin leak in setting of
   tachycardia & sepsis.  No RWMA & global depression of EF may be due to
   sepsis & is likely to improve with resolution of infection.  Moderate
   bilateral pleural effusions & pulm edema present of CXR since volume
   resussitation.
   - will need f/u ECHO in 6-8wks
   - diurese with Lasix 80mg IV with RBCs, goal I/Os neg 500cc
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION: Urine Cultures + yeast, currently day [**3-6**]
   for amphotericin continuous bladder irrigation
   - continue CBI for 1 more day, monitor UOP
   - check UA in am after d/c CBI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and is currently experiencing acute systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25-30%. This decline in EF may be due to influenza or mild troponin leak in the setting of tachycardia and sepsis. The patient also has chronic atrial fibrillation with intermittent hyper/hypotension and agitation/delirium. 

The patient was initially intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure secondary to influenza A complicated by MRSA pneumonia and volume overload. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/81 to 172/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low potassium and magnesium. The patient's renal function is impaired with an elevated creatinine level. The liver function tests are within normal limits, but the patient has elevated lactate levels.

The patient's chest X-ray shows mild-to-moderate right-sided pleural effusion and atelectasis in the left lower"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): Due to influenza, pleural
   effusions, weakness, CHF, and MRSA VAP. Difficult wean likely
   complicated by delerium.
   - Will attempt to wean pressure support, lighten sedation, use PRNs for
   agitation or discomfort
   - Advance ETT
   - Will need to discuss tracheostomy with his family since progress is
   slow
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Anticoagulated, on b-blocker. Started on
   digoxin [**2185-3-28**].
   - Will continue to advance B-blocker for goal HR 60-80
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC: Continues to drift down.
   - Will transfuse to HCT > 30 given his CHF and CAD
   - Lasix with PRBCs
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   - Day [**9-11**] of Vanco, which is dosed by level
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   - ISS
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Yeast, treating with ampho bladder
   washes.
   - D/C bladder washes tomorrow.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE: New systolic failure,
   presumptively related to influenza.
   - Continue to monitor fluid balance, with goal -500/day.
   - Low dose captopril
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC: Previous dx of
   diastolic failure
   - Rate control as above
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): Likely demand
   - Continue ASA and Plavix, beta blocker
   - Hct > 30.
   * Delerium:
   - Continue olanzapine, attempt to wean fentanyl/versed
   * HYPOTHYROID: Mild, and difficult to assess in setting of critical
   illness.
   - Continue synthroid at current dosing.
   Other issues discussed with housestaff, with whose assessments and
   plans I agree with.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic conditions including atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, heart failure (both systolic and diastolic), and a possible myocardial infarction. The patient also has an active infection with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and a yeast infection in the bladder. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and an irregular heart rhythm. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support, and there are concerns about weaning the patient off the ventilator due to delirium. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and D-dimer levels, as well as abnormal kidney function. Imaging shows blunting of the right greater than left costophrenic angles, indicating possible pleural effusions. 

The patient's plan includes advancing the endotracheal tube, discussing a tracheostomy with the family, continuing anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, transfusing for anemia, treating the infections, managing heart failure, and providing glycemic control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Difficult wean from mechanical ventilation due to delirium.
2. Pleural effusions.
3. Chronic anemia requiring transfusion.
4. Infections (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, yeast infection).
5. Heart failure (both systolic"

   Assessment and Plan
   85M with hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, VAP, CHF.
   Agitation and delirium
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): Due to influenza, pleural
   effusions, weakness, CHF, and MRSA VAP. Difficult wean likely
   complicated by delirium.
   - Will attempt to wean pressure support, lighten sedation, use PRNs for
   agitation or discomfort
   - Advance ETT
   - Discuss tracheostomy with his family since progress is slow and
   mental status, secretion, weakness contributing to poor wean candidate
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Anticoagulated, on b-blocker. Started on
   digoxin [**2185-3-28**].
   - Will continue to advance B-blocker for improved heart rate control
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC: Continues to drift down.
   - Will transfuse to HCT > 30 given his CHF and CAD
   - Lasix with PRBCs
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   - Day [**9-11**] of Vanco, which is dosed by level
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   - ISS
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Yeast, treating with ampho bladder
   washes.
   - D/C bladder washes tomorrow.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE: New systolic failure,
   presumptively related to influenza.
   - Continue to monitor fluid balance, with goal -500/day.
   - Low dose captopril
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC: Previous dx of
   diastolic failure
   - Rate control as above
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): Likely demand
   - Continue ASA and Plavix, beta blocker
   - Hct > 30.
   * Delirium:
   - Continue olanzapine, attempt to wean fentanyl/versed
   * HYPOTHYROID: Mild, and difficult to assess in setting of critical
   illness.
   - Continue synthroid at current dosing.
   Other issues discussed with housestaff, with whose assessments and
   plans I agree with.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has volatile blood pressure, agitation, and delirium, making it difficult to wean off the ventilator. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, and a suspected acute myocardial infarction.

The patient is currently on various medications including metoprolol, digoxin, diuretics, and antibiotics for VAP. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated respiratory rate. The patient's oxygen saturation is within normal limits. The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in electrolyte levels, kidney function, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers.

Imaging shows persistent blunting of right greater than left costophrenic angles, with an elevated endotracheal tube and other lines appearing okay. The patient's nutritional support includes tube feeds. The plan includes attempting to wean pressure support, advancing the endotracheal tube, discussing tracheostomy, and managing the patient's conditions such as atrial fibrillation, anemia, diabetes, UTI, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 85-year-old man who was admitted with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and labile blood pressure and heart rate, which is thought to be due to agitation and sensitivity to medications. The patient also has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and was found to have a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25-30% on admission, possibly related to viral myocarditis or sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. No regional wall motion abnormalities were seen.

The patient has been aggressively volume resuscitated with a depressed ejection fraction and continues to have moderate bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. He is able to tolerate minimal ventilator support for 3-4 hours at a time, but then develops tachypnea and alkalosis of unknown etiology. It is unclear if this is due to agitation or severely decompensated respiratory status and poor baseline functioning. The patient is not likely to be extubated today, and a plan for a family meeting with the attending regarding possible tracheostomy has been made.

The patient is receiving Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and will recheck arterial blood gas (ABG) this morning. The respiratory therapists are working on addressing the patient's tachypnea and alkalosis. The patient received 1"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), and agitation. The patient's respiratory failure is complicated by delirium, making him a poor candidate for extubation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 100.6Â°F
- Heart rate: 93 bpm
- Blood pressure: 118/64 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 99%
- Atrial fibrillation (irregular heart rhythm)

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 63.

The patient has a history of chronic anemia, type II diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by yeast, acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, and a possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The patient also has delirium and chronic Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 10.8 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 9.4 K/uL
- Platelet count: 390 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 125 mg/dL
- Sodium: 137 mEq/L
- Potassium: 4.3 mEq/L
- Chloride: 103 mEq/L
- Calcium: 8.3 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's imaging shows an endotracheal tube at 3 cm above the carina, right internal jugular (IJ) line in good position, and bilateral pleural effusions layering, rotated.

The plan includes discussing tracheostomy with the family due to the patient's slow progress, mental status, secretion, and weakness contributing to poor weaning. Efforts will be made to diurese the effusions. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being anticoagulated with heparin, and blood pressures and rates seem better controlled. The patient's chronic anemia will be monitored. The patient's antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) will be completed today. The patient's type II diabetes will continue to be managed. The urinary tract infection will be rechecked with a urinalysis. The patient's heart failure will be monitored with a goal fluid balance of -500 mL per day, and low-dose captopril will be continued. The patient's delirium will be managed with"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o man admitted with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA
   PNA.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology multifactorial, pt was admitted with
   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA.  Pt was aggressively volume
   resussitated with a depressed EF and continues to moderate bilateral
   pleural effusions and pulm edema.  Pt able to tolerate minimal vent
   support [**6-6**] for 3-4 hrs at a time, then develops tachypnea & alkalosis
   of unknown etiology. It is unclear if this is due to agitation vs
   severely decompensated resp status and poor baseline functionning.  Not
   likely to extubate today, plan for family meeting with Attg regarding
   possible trach.
   - continue Vancomycin for MRSA PNA, currently day [**10-12**]
   - will recheck ABG this am, working with RT to [**Month (only) 38**] tachypnea &
   alkalosis, continue Olanzapine [**Hospital1 **]
   - s/p 1upRBCs overnight, IV lasix for goal neg 0.5-1L today
   - supportive care, possible planning for trach placement
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BPS: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs/HR thought due to agitation and extreme sensitivity to
   medications.  Pt started on Digoxin [**3-28**] & increased BB overnight,
   acheiving better rate control.
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg IV daily & check am level
   - continue heparin gtt for anticoag goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo.  CXR continues to show stable
   volume overload, attempting to diurese.
   - continue Captopril 6.25mg q6hr for afterload reduction
   - diuresis with IV lasix, goal neg 0.5-1L daily
   .
   # UTI: Urine cultures positive for yeast, currently day [**4-4**] for
   Amphotericin CBI.
   - f/u UA this evening after completion of CBI
   .
   # DM TYPEII: continue ISS with TF
   .
   # ANEMIA: likely [**3-5**] chronic disease, s/p 1uPRBCs overnight.  Hct
   bumped appropriately, continue to monitor.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Pt p/w supratherapeutic INR, corrected with Vit K.  INR
   still elevated at 1.5 likely due to poor nutrition
   - d/w nutrition regarding Vit K supplementation in TF
   .
   # Left shoulder dislocation: incidentally seen on CXR, per ortho,
   deferring management until medically stable to tolerate MRI.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and was found to have a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25-30%. The patient also has chronic atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure and heart rate, which is thought to be due to agitation and extreme sensitivity to medications. 

The patient's current condition includes moderate bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. He is able to tolerate minimal ventilator support for 3-4 hours at a time but develops tachypnea and alkalosis of unknown etiology. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2Â°C (98.9Â°F), a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/94 to 100/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.0 K/uL, an elevated lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L, and elevated D-dimer levels. Other lab results indicate hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.

The patient's plan includes continuing vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia, rechecking"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure and sepsis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. He has been aggressively volume resuscitated but continues to have moderate bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure and heart failure with a depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 25-30%. He is currently on various medications including vancomycin, digoxin, metoprolol, heparin, and others. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a concern for ongoing respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation may be required.

2. Sepsis: Although the patient has completed a course of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia, he remains at risk for sepsis due to other potential sources of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and cultures will be necessary to detect any signs of recurrent or new infections.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, which can lead to hemodynamic instability. It is important to optimize rate control and anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events.

4. Heart Failure: The patient's depressed EF indicates significant impairment of left ventricular function, placing him at risk for worsening heart failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o man admitted with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA
   PNA.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology multifactorial, pt was admitted with
   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA.  Pt was aggressively volume
   resussitated with a depressed EF and continues to moderate bilateral
   pleural effusions and pulm edema.  Pt able to tolerate minimal vent
   support [**6-6**] for 3-4 hrs at a time, then develops tachypnea & alkalosis
   of unknown etiology. It is unclear if this is due to agitation vs
   severely decompensated resp status and poor baseline functionning.  Not
   likely to extubate today, plan for family meeting with Attg regarding
   possible trach.
   - completed course of Vancomycin for MRSA PNA, currently day [**11-11**]
   - will recheck ABG this am, after spending a few hrs on AC
   - continue Olanzapine [**Hospital1 **]
   - s/p 1upRBCs overnight, IV lasix for goal neg 0.5-1L today
   - supportive care, possible planning for trach placement
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BPS: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs/HR thought due to agitation and extreme sensitivity to
   medications.  Pt started on Digoxin [**3-28**] & increased BB overnight,
   acheiving better rate control.
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg IV daily & check am level
   - continue heparin gtt for anticoag goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo.  CXR continues to show stable
   volume overload, attempting to diurese.
   - continue Captopril 6.25mg q6hr for afterload reduction
   - diuresis with IV lasix, goal neg 0.5-1L daily
   .
   # UTI: Urine cultures positive for yeast, currently day [**4-4**] for
   Amphotericin [**Month/Day (4) 1247**].
   - f/u UA this evening after completion of [**Month/Day (4) 1247**]
   .
   # DM TYPEII: continue ISS with TF
   .
   # ANEMIA: likely [**3-5**] chronic disease, s/p 1uPRBCs overnight.  Hct
   bumped appropriately, continue to monitor.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Pt p/w supratherapeutic INR, corrected with Vit K.  INR
   still elevated at 1.5 likely due to poor nutrition
   - d/w nutrition regarding Vit K supplementation in TF
   .
   # Left shoulder dislocation: incidentally seen on CXR, per ortho,
   deferring management until medically stable to tolerate MRI.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure, possibly secondary to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He has been aggressively volume resuscitated but continues to have moderate bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. The patient is able to tolerate minimal ventilator support for a few hours before developing tachypnea and alkalosis of unknown etiology. It is unclear if this is due to agitation or severely decompensated respiratory status and poor baseline functioning. The patient is not likely to be extubated today, and a plan for a family meeting with Attg regarding possible tracheostomy placement has been made.

The patient has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure and heart rate, which is thought to be due to agitation and extreme sensitivity to medications. He has been started on digoxin and increased beta-blocker overnight to achieve better rate control. He is currently on metoprolol 100mg TID and digoxin 0.125mg IV daily, and his digoxin level will be checked.

The patient also has heart failure with a depressed ejection fraction of 25-30% on admission, possibly related to viral myocarditis or sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. No regional wall motion abnormalities were seen, and his cardiac function is expected to recover in 6-8 weeks. Follow-up echocardiogram is needed. The patient's chest X-ray shows"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): Due to influenza, pleural
   effusions, weakness, CHF, and MRSA VAP.
      Remains very poor extubation candidate given rsbi, extreme
   weakness,  poor mental status/agitation and secretions, volume
   overload/CHF, and fatigue, now on day 9 of intubation
   -          will continue discussion with family regarding  tracheostomy
   as feel that pt will be prolonged vent wean, will involve ethics c/s
   for assistance
   -          Continue diuresis for effusions, CHF (goal 500 neg per
   day)--follow metabolic status, consider adding diamox if metabolic
   alkalosis/contraction worsens
    Continue  ACV given fatigue--follow abg and adjust to address
   alkalosis
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): blood pressures and rates better
   controlled with increased metoprolol dose/digoxin
                   Anticoagulated with hep ggt (goal 60-80 on lwoer side
   given bloody pulm secretions)
                   Check digoxin level
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE: New systolic failure,
   presumptively related to influenza, post viral myocarditis.

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, VAP, CHF, agitation, and delirium. He remains a very poor extubation candidate given his RSBI, extreme weakness, poor mental status/agitation, and secretions, volume overload/CHF, and fatigue. He has been intubated for 9 days and will continue discussion with the family regarding tracheostomy as it is felt that he will have a prolonged ventilator wean. Ethics consultation will be involved in the decision-making process.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains very poor for extubation due to various factors. The plan is to continue discussion with the family regarding tracheostomy, as it is believed that the patient will require prolonged ventilator support. Ethics consultation will assist in the decision-making process.
2. CHF: The patient has acute systolic heart failure, likely related to influenza and post-viral myocarditis. The plan is to continue monitoring fluid balance with a goal of -500 mL/day (generally lasix) and continue low-dose captopril.
3. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure. Rate control measures will be continued as before.
4. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia continues to drift down due to chronic illness and blood draws. Monitoring is recommended.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation, and delirium. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been intubated for 9 days. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 110/66 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is also in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.0 K/uL, an elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. 

The patient's imaging shows pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions layering. The patient's urine culture is pending, but there are large leukocytes observed. The patient's chest X-ray is unchanged with mild pulmonary vascular edema and bilateral layering effusions.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains a poor candidate for extubation due to an extremely low respiratory system compliance index (RSBI), extreme weakness, poor mental status/agitation,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation, and delirium. He remains very poor extubation candidate given his low respiratory system compliance index (RSBI), extreme weakness, poor mental status/agitation, and secretions and volume overload/CHF. He has been intubated for 9 days and will likely require a prolonged ventilator wean. Tracheostomy will be discussed with the family as a possible option. The patient's atrial fibrillation (AFIB) is being managed with increased metoprolol dose/digoxin. He is anticoagulated with heparin due to bloody pulmonary secretions. His heart failure, both systolic and diastolic, is being treated accordingly. He also has chronic anemia, type II diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection (UTI), and a history of myocardial infarction. Delirium, chronic C. difficile infection, hypothyroidism, and other issues are also being addressed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He was aggressively volume resuscitated with a depressed ejection fraction and continues to have moderate bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. The patient's work of breathing (WOB) is increased, and he is experiencing tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 115, indicating that extubation is not likely to be tolerated. The family is being consulted regarding the possibility of tracheostomy placement.

The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure and heart rate, which is thought to be due to agitation and extreme sensitivity to medications. Digoxin and metoprolol have been started for rate control, and heparin is being administered for anticoagulation.

The patient also has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, and a depressed ejection fraction of 25-30% was noted on admission. This may be related to viral myocarditis or sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. Diuretics are being used for volume overload, and follow-up echocardiogram is planned.

The patient's urine cultures were positive for yeast, and he has completed three days of amphotericin B therapy. Repeat urine analysis shows no yeast present.

The patient has a diagnosis of type II diabetes mellitus and chronic disease-related anemia. His"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure and sepsis from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. The patient has been aggressively volume resuscitated due to depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and continues to have moderate bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's chest X-ray shows mildly improved pulmonary vascular congestion.

The patient did not tolerate pressure support with respiratory alkalosis and was maintained on assisted ventilation overnight. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 115, indicating that the patient is not likely to tolerate extubation. Ongoing family meetings are being held with the attending physician regarding the possibility of tracheostomy placement and code status.

The patient has completed a course of Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia, currently on day 11. The patient diuresed well overnight and appears contracted on morning labs, aiming for a net input/output balance. Supportive care is being provided, and planning for possible tracheostomy placement has been consulted with the ethics committee.

The patient has low-grade fevers and atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure. The patient's chronic atrial fibrillation is better controlled on Digoxin and Metoprolol 100mg TID. Rate control is still being worked on, ranging from 90-120 beats per minute currently. Heparin is being continued for anticoagulation,"

   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology multifactorial, pt was admitted with
   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA.  Pt was aggressively volume
   resussitated with a depressed EF and continues to moderate bilateral
   pleural effusions. CXR from this am is mildly improved with [**Month (only) 38**] pulm
   vascular congestion. Pt did not tolerate pressure support with resp
   alkalosis and was maintained on AC overnight. RSBI 115 on [**3-31**]. Pt not
   likely to tolerated extubation, ongoing family meetings with Attg
   regarding trach placement and code status.
   - f/u NIFF today to assess inspiratory strength

   - diuresed well overnight and appears contracted on am labs, goal for
   net i/os even
   - supportive care, planning for possible trach placement, consulted
   ethics
   .
   # ID: Low grade fevers & rising WBC count very concerning for VAP in pt
   that has been intubated for 9 days.
   - sending blood, urine & trach sputum cultures
   - given increased bloody secretions, will get Head CT to r/o sinus
   infection
   - start empiric Abx with Vanc/Zosyn for coverage of VAP with plan to
   d/c if all cultures negative
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs that have been better controlled on Digoxin & Metoprolol 100mg
   TID.  Still working on better rate control, ranging from 90-120s
   currently.
   - will start Diltiazem 30mg q6hrs today for better rate control
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg IV daily & check am level
   - continue heparin gtt for anticoag goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo.  Diuresed well overnight, CXR
   shows [**Month (only) 38**] volume overload, improved costophrenic angles.
   - continue Captopril 6.25mg q6hr for afterload reduction
   - contracted on am labs, goal net even i/os

   # UTI: Urine cultures form [**3-27**] + for yeast, now completed 3 days of
   Amphotericin CBI.  Repeat UA +leuks & WBCs, no yeast.
   - Urine culture NGTD.  Will repeat UA & Culture today
   .
   # DM TYPEII: continue ISS with TF
   .
   # ANEMIA: etiology likely [**3-5**] chronic disease, s/p 1uPRBCs [**3-29**] and hct
   bumped appropriately, continue to monitor.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure due to sepsis from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. He has been intubated for 9 days and is at high risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, heart failure with a depressed ejection fraction, and a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and diastolic congestive heart failure. Additionally, the patient has a urinary tract infection caused by yeast, diabetes mellitus type II, anemia, and a coagulopathy with a supratherapeutic INR. The patient also has a left shoulder dislocation, which will be managed after he is medically stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of VAP, worsening heart failure, worsening atrial fibrillation, worsening anemia, worsening coagulopathy, and worsening diabetes control.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygen saturation levels, respiratory status, fluid balance, and laboratory values to detect any potential complications early on and intervene promptly."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure and sepsis from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. He has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation, heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and anemia. The patient has been aggressively volume resuscitated due to depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and continues to have moderate bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3Â°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 119/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving various medications, including midazolam, heparin, and others. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and several abnormal values in electrolytes and kidney function tests. The patient has a history of left shoulder dislocation, which will be managed after he is medically stable. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition indicates ongoing respiratory failure due to multifactorial etiology, including influenza and secondary MRSA pneumonia. There is a possibility of worsening respiratory status leading to further respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has already experienced sepsis from MRSA pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing sepsis"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): Due to influenza, pleural
   effusions, weakness, CHF, and MRSA VAP
   Remains very poor extubation candidate given rsbi, extreme weakness,
   poor mental status/agitation and secretions, volume overload/CHF, and
   fatigue, now on day 10 of intubation though cxr appears somewhat
   imrpoved with small effusions b/l and reduced edema
      - will continue discussion with family regarding  tracheostomy as
   feel that pt will be prolonged vent wean if continued ongoing
   aggressive care is desired, will involve ethics c/s for assistance
       - Continue diuresis for effusions, CHF (goal 500 neg per
   day)--follow metabolic status, consider adding diamox if metabolic
   alkalosis/contraction worsens
        - Continue  ACV given fatigue--follow abg and adjust to address
   alkalosis
   FTW--suspect that poor nbutirion, deconditioning and waekness are
   likely cause for FTW, post-polio syndrome possibly with some underlying
   muscle weakness, no evidence to suggest diapragmatic elevation, would
   check NIF, concerned that new infaction is breving given tamp last
   night and increased WBC

   secretions from oral and suctioning, now just off of vanco
        would reculture blood urine and sputum and check head ct b/c of
   mainly oral sinusitis, highest concern is of sinuisitis verses new VAP

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): blood pressures and rates better
   controlled with increased metoprolol dose/digoxin but still in low 100
   range
                   - Anticoagulated with hep ggt
                   - follow digoxin level
                     start low dose diltiazem
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE: New systolic failure,
   presumptively related to influenza, post viral myocarditis.
          - Continue to monitor fluid balance, with goal -500/day (gentle
   lasix) as cr tolerates, has been negative and developing a metabolic
   alkalosis, would hold on additonal diuresis
           - cont low dose captopril at current dose for after load
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC: Previous dx of
   diastolic failure

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a complex medical history who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, chronic heart failure (both systolic and diastolic), chronic anemia, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and a history of myocardial infarction.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation, and delirium. The patient has been intubated for 10 days and requires ongoing mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with an elevated temperature, tachycardia, and hypertension. The patient's blood gases show respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia and hypercapnia. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be addressed. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains a poor candidate for extubation due to an elevated respiratory system resistance index (RSBI), extreme weakness, poor mental status, secretions, volume overload/CHF, and fatigue. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and a discussion regarding tracheostomy placement should be considered.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation, and delirium. The patient has been unable to be weaned from the ventilator. 

24-hour events include the insertion of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line and removal of a presep catheter. The patient had a temperature of 100.9 degrees Fahrenheit and was not extubated. 

The patient has allergies to Bactrim and Remeron. The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 03/30/2018 at 1:43 PM. The patient is receiving midazolam and heparin infusions, as well as other ICU medications.

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, current temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/65 to 136/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,848 mL, including 852 mL of IV fluids, 1,090 mL of tube feedings, and 518 mL of oral intake. Total output includes 1,865 mL of urine, 190 mL of blood products, and 662 mL of drain output. The fluid balance is -17 mL.

Respiratory support consists of mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 15 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 11.9 to 13.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 437 to 498 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 25 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, and glucose levels ranging from 128 to 145 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated D-dimer levels and low fibrinogen levels.

Imaging shows slightly improved vascular congestion and pleural effusions bilaterally. Microbiology results indicate a negative urine culture.

Assessment and Plan:
The main issues remaining include respiratory failure, acute on chronic CHF, agitation, delirium, and failure to wean from the ventilator. The patient has low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis, suggesting a new infection. The plan includes continuing antibiotic therapy, checking head and chest CT scans, and repeating blood, urine, and sputum cultures.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation, for which anticoagulation and rate control medications are being used. The patient has acute systolic heart failure due to presumed influenza and post-viral myocarditis. Diurese is being held, and low-dose captopril is being continued for afterload reduction.

The patient has chronic anemia and chronic diastolic heart failure. Myocardial infarction is likely secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis. Aspirin and Plavix are being continued, along with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors.

Delirium has improved with the use of olanzapine and minimal versed. Chronic Clostridium difficile infection is being treated with vancomycin. Other issues discussed with the house staff, with whose assessments and plans I agree. 

ICU care includes nutrition support with a pulmonary formula and glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale. Prophylactic measures include systemic anticoagulation and stress ulcer prophylaxis."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o man admitted with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA
   PNA.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology multifactorial, pt was admitted with
   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA.  s/p aggressive volume resuscitation
   with depressed EF, pt continues to have moderate bilateral pleural
   effusions. Pt with ongoing resp alkalosis and was maintained on AC
   overnight. Increased sedation this am to [**Month (only) 38**] overbreathing vent. Pt not
   likely to tolerate extubation (NIFF -1, last RSBI 115). Ongoing
   discussions with family regarding trach placement.
   - completed 10 day course of Vancomycin for MRSA PNA
   - concern for VAP given low grade temps & elev WBC, now day 2
   Vanc/Zosyn
   - BP dipped down after Fentanyl bolus, responded to 500cc bolus & stim
   - supportive care, planning for possible trach placement, consulted
   ethics
   .
   # ID: Low grade fevers & rising WBC count concerning for VAP in pt
   intubated for 10 days.
   - blood & urine Cx NGTD
   - trach sputum cultures + [**Last Name (LF) 1302**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue Vanc/Zosyn for now
   - hct trended down & increased bloody secretions, concern for sinus
   infection
   - Head CT to r/o sinus infection & chest CT to better evaluate
   effusions
   - currently day 2 of Vanc/Zosyn for empiric coverage of VAP
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs that have been better controlled on Digoxin & Metoprolol 100mg
   TID.  Better rate control on 3 agents.
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID & Diltiazem 30mg q6hr
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg IV daily & f/u am level
   - due to hct drop & ongoing bloody secretions from oropharynx, will d/c
   heparin today (daily risk of CVA in pt with A. Fib very low)
   .
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo.
   - continue Captopril 6.25mg q6hr for afterload reduction
   - contracted on am labs, goal net to even i/os
   .
   # UTI: Urine cultures form [**3-27**] + for yeast, now completed 3 days of
   Amphotericin CBI.  Repeat UAs +leuks & >100 WBCs, no yeast.  Will
   change out foley today
   - Urine culture NGTD
   # DM TYPEII: continue ISS with TF
   # ANEMIA: etiology likely [**3-5**] chronic disease. Hct trended down
   overnight, likely due to loss from oropharynx vs volume expansion.
   - f/u pm hct and transfuse prn
   # Left shoulder dislocation: incidentally seen on CXR, per ortho,
   deferring management until medically stable to tolerate MRI.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He has been aggressively volume resuscitated with a depressed ejection fraction and continues to have moderate bilateral pleural effusions. The patient has continued respiratory alkalosis and was maintained on assisted ventilation overnight. He is sedated and not responding to commands this morning after receiving a fentanyl bolus. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated for 10 days and has low-grade fevers and an elevated white blood cell count, which raises concern for VAP. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the patient is being started on empiric antibiotics with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam.

2. Sinus infection: The patient has increased bloody secretions, and a head CT is ordered to rule out a sinus infection.

3. Atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation and labile blood pressures that have been better controlled on digoxin and metoprolol. Rate control is still being worked on, ranging from 90-120 beats per minute currently.

4. Heart failure: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and was found to have a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25-30% on admission. This could be related to viral myocarditis or sepsis-induced"

   Active issues remain:
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]) with failure to wean:
   [**3-5**] combination of  pleural effusions, CHF, and probable VAP/infection,
   though significant  weakness  seems main issue with wean, on treatment
   for hypothyroid (labs checked recently ands/o chronic illness picture)
   NIF checked and -1 suggesting significant weakness of respiratory
   muscles likely from post-polio verses icu myopathy
          Remains very poor extubation candidate and now on day 11 of
   intubation
          Now with low grade temps and increasing WBC ct suggesting new
   infection
                   Continue discussion with family regarding tracheostomy
   as feel that pt will be prolonged vent wean if continued

   completed course of vanco for MRSA pna
          f/u repeat cx's,
          remains on c diff treatment
          continue empiric coverage of ? VBAP/sinuisits with vanco /zosyn

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation, and delirium. He has been unable to be weaned from the ventilator. The patient has a history of chronic illnesses, including hypothyroidism and possible post-polio syndrome. He has had multiple infections and is currently on treatment for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). There are concerns about new infections, as indicated by low-grade fever and increasing white blood cell count (WBC). The patient's respiratory alkalosis is stable, but there is a need for further evaluation of his condition. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to be weaned from the ventilator indicates ongoing respiratory failure. This may be due to a combination of pleural effusions, CHF, and probable VAP/infection.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest possible kidney dysfunction.
3. Sepsis: The presence of low-grade fever and increasing WBC count indicates a potential new infection, which could lead to sepsis.
4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's chronic illness picture and decreasing hemoglobin levels suggest underlying kidney issues.
5. Myocardial infarction: There is a suspicion of ischemia leading to a possible myocardial infarction, which is being"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 85-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation, and delirium. The main issues remaining are respiratory failure, acute on chronic CHF, and probable VAP/infection. The patient remains a very poor extubation candidate and has been intubated for 11 days. There is concern for a new infection, as indicated by low-grade temperatures and increasing white blood cell count. 

The patient's atrial fibrillation (AFIB) is better controlled with increased metoprolol dose/digoxin, but the patient is still tachycardic. Anticoagulation with heparin has been stopped due to ongoing bloody oral secretions. 

The patient has acute systolic heart failure, presumptively related to influenza and post-viral myocarditis. Monitoring fluid balance and holding on diuretics is recommended. 

The patient also has chronic diastolic heart failure, with previous diagnosis. Rate control as mentioned above is advised. 

Chronic anemia continues to drift down/chronic illness, and blood draws on heparin will be discontinued. 

There is a suspicion of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), likely demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis. ASA and Plavix should be continued, along with beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o man admitted with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA
   PNA.

   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology multifactorial, pt was admitted with
   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA.  s/p aggressive volume resuscitation
   with depressed EF, pt continues to have moderate bilateral pleural
   effusions. Pt with ongoing resp alkalosis and was maintained on AC
   overnight. Increased sedation this am to [**Month (only) 38**] overbreathing vent. Pt not
   likely to tolerate extubation (NIFF -1, last RSBI 115). Ongoing
   discussions with family regarding trach placement.
   - completed 10 day course of Vancomycin for MRSA PNA
   - concern for VAP given low grade temps & elev WBC, now day 2
   Vanc/Zosyn
   - BP dipped down after Fentanyl bolus, responded to 500cc bolus & stim
   - supportive care, planning for possible trach placement, consulted
   ethics
   .
   # ID: Low grade fevers & rising WBC count concerning for VAP in pt
   intubated for 10 days.
   - blood & urine Cx NGTD
   - trach sputum cultures + [**Last Name (LF) 1302**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue Vanc/Zosyn for now
   - hct trended down & increased bloody secretions, concern for sinus
   infection
   - Head CT to r/o sinus infection & chest CT to better evaluate
   effusions
   - currently day 2 of Vanc/Zosyn for empiric coverage of VAP
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs that have been better controlled on Digoxin & Metoprolol 100mg
   TID.  Better rate control on 3 agents.
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID & Diltiazem 30mg q6hr
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg IV daily & f/u am level
   - due to hct drop & ongoing bloody secretions from oropharynx, will d/c
   heparin today (daily risk of CVA in pt with A. Fib very low)
   .
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo.
   - continue Captopril 6.25mg q6hr for afterload reduction
   - contracted on am labs, goal net to even i/os
   .
   # UTI: Urine cultures form [**3-27**] + for yeast, now completed 3 days of
   Amphotericin CBI.  Repeat UAs +leuks & >100 WBCs, no yeast.  Will
   change out foley today
   - Urine culture NGTD
   # DM TYPEII: continue ISS with TF
   # ANEMIA: etiology likely [**3-5**] chronic disease. Hct trended down
   overnight, likely due to loss from oropharynx vs volume expansion.
   - f/u pm hct and transfuse prn
   # Left shoulder dislocation: incidentally seen on CXR, per ortho,

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He has been intubated for 10 days and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has ongoing respiratory alkalosis and moderate bilateral pleural effusions. His sedation level has increased, and he is not likely to tolerate extubation. There are ongoing discussions with the family regarding tracheostomy placement. The patient has completed a 10-day course of Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and is now being treated with Piperacillin/Tazobactam for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial respiratory failure was multifactorial, including influenza and secondary MRSA pneumonia. Despite aggressive volume resuscitation, the patient continues to have moderate bilateral pleural effusions, and respiratory alkalosis has been maintained overnight. The patient is not likely to tolerate extubation, and there are ongoing discussions regarding tracheostomy placement.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's low-grade fevers and rising white blood cell count are concerning for VAP. Blood and urine cultures have been sent, and the patient is currently on empiric coverage with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Labile Blood Pressure: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation with"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o man admitted with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA
   PNA now with Klebsiella VAP.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology multifactorial, pt was admitted with
   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA.  s/p aggressive volume resuscitation
   with depressed EF, pt continues to have moderate bilateral pleural
   effusions. Pt with ongoing resp alkalosis and was maintained on AC
   overnight. Increased sedation this am to [**Month (only) 38**] overbreathing vent. Pt not
   likely to tolerate extubation (NIFF -1, last RSBI 84). Ongoing
   discussions with family regarding trach placement.
   - completed 10 day course of Vancomycin for MRSA PNA
   - concern for VAP given low grade temps & elev WBC, now day [**4-8**]
   Vanc/Zosyn
   - supportive care, planning for possible trach placement, consulted
   ethics
   .
   # ID: Low grade fevers & rising WBC count concerning for VAP in pt
   intubated for 10 days.
   - blood & urine Cx NGTD
   - trach sputum cultures + Klebsiella, will continue Vanc/Zosyn
   - hct trended down & increased bloody secretions, concern for sinus
   infection
   - Head CT to r/o sinus infection- c/w sinusisitis v mastoiditis
   - will call ENT to see if sinus worth tapping, if not, can peel off
   vanc
   - Chest CT possible RLL PNA
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs that have been better controlled on Digoxin & Metoprolol 100mg
   TID.  Now bradycardic, with SBPs<100.
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID; d/c Diltiazem
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg IV daily
   - due to hct drop & ongoing bloody secretions from oropharynx, will d/c
   heparin today (daily risk of CVA in pt with A. Fib very low)
   .
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure secondary to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia, now with Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has ongoing respiratory alkalosis and was maintained on assisted ventilation overnight. He is not likely to tolerate extubation, with a NIF score of 1 and last respiratory support burden index (RSBI) of 84. There are ongoing discussions with the family regarding possible tracheostomy placement.

The patient completed a 10-day course of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia but has low-grade fevers and rising white blood cell count, which is concerning for VAP. Blood and urine cultures have been sent, and tracheostomy sputum cultures grew Klebsiella, so the patient will continue on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration has trended down, and there are increased bloody secretions, raising concern for sinus infection. A head CT has been ordered to rule out sinus infection, which could be related to sinusitis and/or mastoiditis. ENT consultation will be sought to determine if the sinus is worth tapping.

A chest CT showed possible right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, better controlled on digoxin and metoprolol 100mg TID. However, the patient is now bradycardic with systolic blood pressures"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation, and delirium. He has a history of chronic illness and is currently on day 12 of intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with klebsiella pneumonia and sinusitis. He is receiving treatment for hypothyroidism and has a previous diagnosis of diastolic heart failure. The patient is also being treated for C. difficile and has a history of post-polio syndrome. His current condition includes respiratory failure, anemia, atrial fibrillation, acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure, delirium, and chronic C. difficile.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to a combination of pleural effusions, CHF, and probable VAP/infection. This makes him a poor candidate for extubation.
2. Nosocomial infection: The patient has developed a new nosocomial infection, specifically klebsiella pneumonia, which is resistant to antibiotics.
3. Heart failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure and diastolic heart failure. These conditions can worsen and lead to further complications if not managed properly.
4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be associated with infections, medications, or other underlying medical"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of influenza, NSTEMI, CHF, respiratory failure, and failure to wean. He is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, VAP, CHF, agitation, delirium, and a new nosocomial infection, probable sinusitis, and klebsiella pneumonia. The patient has been intubated for 12 days and is a poor candidate for extubation. There is ongoing discussion about performing a tracheostomy to facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, anemia, atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, and a possible myocardial infarction. He also has chronic diarrhea and delirium. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, low-grade fever, elevated D-dimer, and elevated troponin levels. Imaging studies reveal a probable right lower lobe pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions, and signs of chronic illness. 

The patient's treatment plan includes ongoing antibiotic therapy for klebsiella pneumonia, continuation of C. difficile treatment, and close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes. The patient is on a combination of medications for heart failure, including low-dose captopril for afterload reduction, beta-blockers for rate control, and aspirin and Plavix for antiplatelet therapy.

   along the lateral aspect of the right hemithorax are no longer seen and

   effusions are noted, left greater than right.  There is persistent pulm

   underlying atelectasis and the effusion, difficult to exclude pneumonia
   .  The

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 77/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with no evidence of pneumothorax. The patient's blood cultures are positive for Klebsiella, which is sensitive to Zosyn.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low (77/44 mmHg), indicating hypotension. This may be due to sepsis or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows right lower lobe pneumonia. This could be a result of aspiration or hospital-acquired infection.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which may be due to congestive heart failure, infection, or other underlying conditions.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels suggest possible acute kidney injury, which can be caused by sepsis or dehydration.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is"

   along the lateral aspect of the right hemithorax are no longer seen and
    most
   likely represented bedding material.  The radiolucencies now project ov
   er the
   left hemithorax.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Persistent bilateral pleura
   l
   effusions are noted, left greater than right.  There is persistent pulm

   edema.  A left retrocardiac opacity is again noted, likely secondary to
   underlying atelectasis and the effusion, difficult to exclude pneumonia
   .  The
   supporting lines are stable.  There is persistent interstitial edema.
   The
   supporting lines are stable and in satisfactory positions.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure and sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He now has Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has completed a 10-day course of Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia. The patient is intubated for 12 days and has low-grade fevers and rising white blood cell count, likely indicating VAP. Blood and urine cultures are pending.

The patient has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, which has been better controlled on Digoxin and Metoprolol. The patient experienced an episode of bradycardia, and Diltiazem was discontinued. The heart rate is stable in the 80s.

The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and globally depressed ejection fraction of 25-30% on admission. The function is expected to recover in 6-8 weeks, and a follow-up echo will be needed.

The patient's urine cultures initially grew yeast, but after completing 3 days of Amphotericin B, the repeat urine analysis showed no yeast. Foley catheter was changed.

The patient has chronic anemia likely due to chronic disease, with blood loss from the oropharynx. He received 1 unit of packed red blood cells overnight and his hemoglobin concentration increased from 23"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, suspected to be caused by sepsis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. The patient has now developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Klebsiella.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, with initial admission related to influenza and subsequent MRSA pneumonia. Despite aggressive volume resuscitation, the patient continues to have moderate bilateral pleural effusions. The patient is also experiencing respiratory alkalosis and requires ongoing mechanical ventilation support.
2. Infection: The patient has completed a 10-day course of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia. There are concerns for VAP given low-grade fevers and an elevated white blood cell count. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the patient is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to chronic disease and possible blood loss from the oropharynx. A transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells was given overnight, resulting in an increase in hematocrit from 23.5% to 25%.
4. UTI: The patient initially had a urine culture positive for yeast, but subsequent urinalysis showed no yeast, indicating resolution of the urinary tract"

   effusions are noted, left greater than right.  There is persistent pulm

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o man admitted with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA
   PNA now with Klebsiella VAP.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology multifactorial, pt was admitted with
   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA.  s/p aggressive volume resuscitation
   with depressed EF, pt continues to have moderate bilateral pleural
   effusions. Pt with ongoing resp alkalosis and was maintained on AC
   overnight. Increased sedation this am to [**Month (only) 38**] overbreathing vent. Pt not
   likely to tolerate extubation (NIFF -1, last RSBI 84). Ongoing
   discussions with family regarding trach placement.
   - completed 10 day course of Vancomycin for MRSA PNA
   - concern for VAP given low grade temps & elev WBC, now day [**5-9**]
   Vanc/Zosyn
   - supportive care, planning for possible trach placement, consulted
   ethics
   .
   # ID: Low grade fevers & rising WBC count concerning for VAP in pt
   intubated for 10 days.
   - blood & urine Cx NGTD
   - trach sputum cultures + Klebsiella, will continue Vanc/Zosyn
   - hct trended down & increased bloody secretions, concern for sinus
   infection
   - Head CT to r/o sinus infection- c/w sinusisitis vs mastoiditis
   - will call ENT to see if sinus worth tapping, if not, can peel off
   vanc
   - Chest CT possible RLL PNA
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs that have been better controlled on Digoxin & Metoprolol 100mg
   TID.  Now bradycardic, with SBPs<100.
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID; d/c Diltiazem
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg IV daily
   - due to hct drop & ongoing bloody secretions from oropharynx, will d/c
   heparin today (daily risk of CVA in pt with A. Fib very low)
   .
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo.
   - continue Captopril 6.25mg q6hr for afterload reduction
   .
   # UTI: Urine cultures form [**3-27**] + for yeast, now completed 3 days of
   Amphotericin CBI.  Repeat UAs +leuks & >100 WBCs, no yeast.  Foley
   changed out [**4-2**]
   - Urine cultures NGTD
   # DM TYPEII: continue ISS with TF
   # ANEMIA: etiology likely [**3-5**] chronic disease, blood loss from
   oropharynx?.  Transfused 1 upRBCs overnight & went from 23.5 to 25.
   Will recheck pm hct

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure, sepsis from MRSA pneumonia, and now with Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient has ongoing respiratory alkalosis and was maintained on assisted ventilation overnight. Increased sedation this morning due to overbreathing on the ventilator.
- The patient is not likely to tolerate extubation (NIFF -1, last Respiratory System Biochemical Index (RSBI) 84). Ongoing discussions with the family regarding tracheostomy placement.
- The patient completed a 10-day course of Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia.
- There are concerns for VAP given low-grade fevers and elevated white blood cell count.
- Blood and urine cultures are pending.
- The patient has a trend of decreasing hematocrit and increased bloody secretions, which may indicate a sinus infection.
- A head CT was ordered to rule out sinus infection, consistent with sinusitis or mastoiditis.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure is being managed with metoprolol and digoxin.
- Heparin was held due to the patient's drop in hemoglobin and ongoing bloody secretions from the oropharynx.
- The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and a depressed ejection fraction on admission, possibly related to viral myocarditis or sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation, delirium, failure to wean, and a new nosocomial infection, probable sinusitis, and klebsiella pneumonia. The patient has been intubated for 13 days and remains a poor candidate for extubation. There is ongoing discussion with the family regarding the possibility of a tracheostomy.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 15 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient has pleural effusions, CHF, and probable VAP/infection, with significant weakness being the main issue with weaning. The patient's NIF (negative inspiratory force) is -1, suggesting significant weakness of respiratory muscles likely from post-polio versus ICU myopathy. The patient is now on day 13 of intubation and remains very poor for extubation.

   85 y/o man admitted with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA
   PNA now with Klebsiella VAP, planning for possible trach placement.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology multifactorial, pt was admitted with
   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA. Aggressively volume resussitated with
   depressed EF & continues to have bilateral pulm effusions. Pt
   developped low grade temps s/p 10 days of  Vanc & sputum was
   +klebsiella.  Pt now day [**6-8**] Vanc/Zosyn for VAP. Pt not likely to
   tolerate extubation                    (NIFF-1, RSBI ranging from
   80-120) Family has agreed to trach placement, consulting surgery today.
   - completed 10 day course of Vancomycin for MRSA PNA
   - day [**6-8**] Zosyn for VAP (klebsiella [**Last Name (un) **] to zosyn)
   - ABG this am pH 7.52/31/106, continue to show resp alkalosis, unclear
   etiology for overbreathing vent
   - surgery consult for trach today
   #iD: Pt developped low grade temps, elevated WBC ct s/p 10 days of vanc
   for MRSA PNA. Chest CT showed possible RLL PNA, now day [**5-9**] of Zosyn
   for VAP, sputum Cx + for klebsiella [**Last Name (un) **] to Zosyn
   - blood & urine Cx NGTD
   - Head CT c/w sinusisitis vs mastoiditis, presumably covered by Zosyn
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs that have been better controlled on Digoxin & Metoprolol 100mg
   TID.  Pt had an episode of bradycardia on [**2185-4-3**] and Diltiazem was
   d/c
d. HR stable today in 80s
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg & low dose ASA 81mg
   - holding anticoagulation, hct drop with ongoing bloody secretions from
   oropharynx
    (daily risk of CVA in pt with A. Fib very low)
   .
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo.
   -continue Captopril 6.25mg q6hr for afterload reduction
   .
   # OROPHARYNGEAL BLEED: Apprec ENT consult, likely [**3-5**] skin
   breakdown/abrasions under ETT
   - reposition frequently, avoid heparin gtt for now
   - working towards trach and monitor for acute bleed
   .
   # UTI: Urine cultures form [**3-27**] + for yeast, now completed 3 days of
   Amphotericin CBI.  Repeat UAs +leuks & >100 WBCs, no yeast.  Foley
   changed out [**4-2**]
   - Urine cultures NGTD
   # DM TYPEII: continue ISS with TF
   # ANEMIA: etiology likely [**3-5**] chronic disease. Hct stable this am at 27
   -stools guaiac negative
   # C. Diff: pt with h/o relapsing/recurrent c.diff on a slow taper as
   outpt.  Curbsided ID, plan to give treatment dose po Vancomycin 125mg
   q6hr while on Zosyn & resume taper post Abx.
   # Left shoulder dislocation: incidentally seen on CXR, per ortho,
   deferring management until medically stable to tolerate MRI.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, an 85-year-old man, was admitted with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He is now experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Klebsiella.
- The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and globally depressed left ventricular ejection fraction of 25-30%.
- He has developed oropharyngeal mucosal breakdown likely due to endotracheal tube (ETT) placement and is planning for possible tracheostomy placement.
- The patient has been on aggressive volume resuscitation but continues to have bilateral pulmonary effusions.
- His recent blood cultures are negative for any organisms, and his urine cultures are also negative.
- He has completed a 10-day course of Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and is currently on day 6-8 of Zosyn for VAP.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure has been better controlled with Digoxin and Metoprolol.
- He has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and may have developed septic-induced cardiomyopathy.
- The patient has anemia likely secondary to chronic disease, and his glycemic control is being managed with ISS.
- He is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and VAP.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheostomy-related complications such as bleeding or pneumothorax.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by multidrug-resistant organisms.
3. Cardiac complications like atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, heart failure, and septic-induced cardiomyopathy.
4. Oropharyngeal bleeding due to skin breakdown under the ETT.
5. Pneumonia-related complications such as septicemia or worsening pulmonary effusions.
6. Anemia progression or worsening of glycemic control.
7. Clostridium difficile infection due to antibiotic use.
8. Left shoulder dislocation management."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation, and delirium. The patient has failed weaning from the ventilator and now presents with a new nosocomial infection, sinusitis, and klebsiella VAP. The patient's condition remains poor, and there are concerns about prolonged weaning and potential chronic ventilator support. The decision has been made to pursue tracheostomy surgery. The patient's leukocytosis and low-grade temperatures have improved after initiation of empirical antibiotics. The patient's atrial fibrillation is better controlled, and heart failure management is ongoing. The patient also has delirium, chronic Clostridium difficile infection, and previous diagnoses of systolic and diastolic heart failure. The patient's mental status and agitation have improved, and treatment for chronic C. difficile infection will continue while on antibiotics. Ethical and palliative care consultations have been conducted for ongoing family discussions regarding goals of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure has not improved, and there are concerns about prolonged weaning from the ventilator.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed a new nosocomial infection, klebsiella VAP, which requires antibiotic treatment.
3. Sinusitis: The patient has developed sinusitis,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation, delirium, failure to wean, sinusitis, and klebsiella VAP. The patient has been intubated for 14 days and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory failure is severe, and he is not a good candidate for extubation. The decision has been made to pursue a tracheostomy surgery as the prolonged wean may require chronic ventilatory support. The patient's other medical issues include atrial fibrillation, anemia, acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, and chronic C. difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged ventilation and weaning difficulties: The patient's failure to wean from mechanical ventilation indicates severe respiratory muscle weakness, which may be related to post-polio syndrome or ICU myopathy. This increases the risk of prolonged ventilation and potential complications associated with it.
2. Tracheostomy surgery complications: The planned tracheostomy surgery carries risks such as bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding structures.
3. Klebsiella VAP: The patient has an ongoing infection with klebsiella, an antibiotic-resistant organism. Changing antibiotics to an appropriate one is necessary to treat the infection effectively.
4. CHF exacerbation: The patient's CHF"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He has been intubated for 14 days and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has developed a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Klebsiella, which is an ESBL-producing strain. The family has agreed to tracheostomy placement for long-term airway management. The patient's atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure has been stable on digoxin and metoprolol. He also has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure with a globally depressed ejection fraction. The patient has experienced an oropharyngeal bleed related to the endotracheal tube, and an ENT consultation has been obtained. He has completed a 10-day course of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and is currently on day [6-8] of ABX for VAP, switching to meropenem due to ESBL-producing Klebsiella. The patient's urine cultures were positive for yeast but have now cleared after completing three days of amphotericin B. He has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and chronic disease-related anemia. The patient also has a history of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, and curbsided ID consultation has been obtained.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure and sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He now has Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is planning for possible tracheostomy placement. The patient has a history of post-polio syndrome causing weakened respiratory muscles, making extubation unlikely. He is currently on day 15 of intubation, with a negative inspiratory force (NIF) of -2 and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) ranging from 80-120. The patient has completed a 10-day course of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and is now on meropenem for ESBL-producing Klebsiella VAP. His arterial blood gas (ABG) continues to show respiratory alkalosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient already has Klebsiella VAP and is being treated with meropenem. It is important to continue aggressive lung hygiene measures and consider tracheostomy placement to reduce the risk of further respiratory infections.
2. Tracheostomy complications: There is a risk of bleeding during the procedure, especially given the patient's oropharyngeal bleeding and recent use of anticoagulation.
3. Atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation and labile blood pressures. Close monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure is necessary. Medications such as"

   likely to tolerate extubation.  NPO for trach placement today  (ETT low
   on CXR, plan for removal later today)
   - completed 10 day course of Vancomycin for MRSA PNA
   - day [**7-9**] ABx for VAP, switched to Meropenem due to ESBL producing
   Klebsiella
   - ABG continues to show resp alkalosis, will reassess ABG after trach
   placement & consider lower tidal volumes for resp alka.
   #iD: Pt developed low grade temps, elevated WBC count s/p 10 days of
   vanc for MRSA PNA. Chest CT showed possible RLL PNA, now day [**7-9**] of
   Zosyn for VAP, sputum Cx + for klebsiella [**Last Name (un) **] to Zosyn, but ESBL
   producing, pt was switched to Meropenem for last 2 days of Abx
   course.

   - holding anticoagulation, hct now stable with [**Month (only) 38**] bloody secretions
   from oropharynx, will revisit anti-coagulatn after trach
    (daily risk of CVA in pt with A. Fib very low)
   .
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo as outpt
   -continue Captopril 6.25mg q6hr for afterload reduction
   # OROPHARYNGEAL BLEED: Apprec ENT consult, likely [**3-5**] skin
   breakdown/abrasions under ETT
   - reposition frequently, avoid heparin gtt for now

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He has developed Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently receiving meropenem for the infection. The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. He is also on various other medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, captopril, digoxin, metoprolol, olanzapine, and synthroid.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2Â°C (98.9Â°F)
- Heart rate: 81 bpm (64-90 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 134/60 mmHg (84/45-183/85 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute (15-28 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on FiO2 40%

The patient has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and labile blood pressures, which have been better controlled on digoxin and metoprolol. He also has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, found to have a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25-30% on admission, possibly related to viral myocarditis or sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.

The patient is at risk for several medical complications, including:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia"

   Microbiology: Sputum from [**3-/2106**] + Klebsiella ESBL producing.
   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o man admitted with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA
   PNA now with Klebsiella VAP day [**7-9**] ABx, NPO for trach placement today.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology multifactorial, pt was admitted with
   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA. Aggressively volume resussitated with
   depressed EF & continues to have bilateral pulm effusions. Then
   developped low grade temps with Sputum +klebsiella.  Pt currently day
   [**7-9**] Abx for Kleb VAP, Kleb is ESBL producing, on Meropenem now. Pt
   currently day 15 of intubation, repeat NIFF of -7, RSBI ranging from
   80-120 & h/o post polio syndrome causing weakened resp muscles, pt not
   likely to tolerate extubation.  NPO for trach placement today  (ETT low
   on CXR, plan for removal later today)
   - completed 10 day course of Vancomycin for MRSA PNA
   - day [**7-9**] ABx for VAP, switched to Meropenem due to ESBL producing
   Klebsiella
   - ABG continues to show resp alkalosis, will reassess ABG after trach
   placement & consider lower tidal volumes for resp alka.
   #iD: Pt developed low grade temps, elevated WBC count s/p 10 days of
   vanc for MRSA PNA. Chest CT showed possible RLL PNA, now day [**7-9**] of
   Zosyn for VAP, sputum Cx + for klebsiella [**Last Name (un) **] to Zosyn, but ESBL
   producing, pt was switched to Meropenem for last 2 days of Abx
   course.
   - blood & urine Cx NGTD
   - Head CT c/w sinusisitis vs mastoiditis, presumably covered by
   Meropenem
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs that have been better controlled on Digoxin & Metoprolol 100mg
   TID.  Pt had an episode of bradycardia on [**2185-4-3**] and Diltiazem was
   d/c
d. HR stable today in 80-100s
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg & low dose ASA 81mg
   - holding anticoagulation, hct now stable with [**Month (only) 38**] bloody secretions
   from oropharynx, will revisit anti-coagulatn after trach
    (daily risk of CVA in pt with A. Fib very low)
   .
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo as outpt
   -continue Captopril 6.25mg q6hr for afterload reduction
   # OROPHARYNGEAL BLEED: Apprec ENT consult, likely [**3-5**] skin
   breakdown/abrasions under ETT
   - reposition frequently, avoid heparin gtt for now
   - NPO for trach placement today and monitor for acute bleed
   - perform better OG exam after ETT removed
   .
   # UTI: Urine cultures form [**3-27**] + for yeast, now completed 3 days of
   Amphotericin CBI.  Repeat UAs +leuks & >100 WBCs, no yeast.  Foley
   changed out [**4-2**]
   - Urine cultures NGTD
   # DM TYPEII: continue ISS with TF
   # ANEMIA: etiology likely [**3-5**] chronic disease. Hct stable at 26.6
   -stools guaiac negative
   # C. Diff: pt with h/o relapsing/recurrent c.diff on a slow taper as
   outpt.  Curbsided ID, plan to give treatment dose po Vancomycin 125mg
   q6hr while on broad spect Abx & resume taper post Rx.
   # Left shoulder dislocation: incidentally seen on CXR, per ortho,
   deferring management until medically stable to tolerate MRI.
   -fentanyl prn pain/agitation, may need to start po oxycodone s/p trach
   -will review films & MSK exam when pt more alert s/p trach

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation, and delirium. The patient has been intubated for 15 days and is a poor candidate for extubation. The patient has a history of sinusitis and klebsiella VAP. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and there is a concern for continued weakness of respiratory muscles, likely from post-polio syndrome or ICU myopathy. 

2. Pleural effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which may worsen due to CHF and VAP.

3. Chronic diaphragmatic weakness: The patient may have chronic diaphragmatic weakness, which may contribute to the difficulty in weaning off the ventilator.

4. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has AFIB, which requires monitoring of blood pressures and rates. The patient is on digoxin and metoprolol, and follow-up of digoxin levels is needed.

5. Heart failure (CHF): The patient has acute systolic heart failure due to presumed influenza and post-viral myocarditis. Fluid balance should be closely monitored, and diuretics may be held. The patient is also on low-dose captopril for afterload reduction.

   agitation and delirium, failure to wean, w/ sinusitis and resolving
   klebsiella VAP
   Active issues remain:
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]) with failure to wean,
   VAP/sinusitis
   [**3-5**] combination of  pleural effusions, CHF, and probable VAP/infection,
   though significant  weakness  seems main issue with wean, NIF checked
   and -1 suggesting significant weakness of respiratory muscles likely
   from post-polio syndrome, chronic diaphragmatic weakness verses icu
   myopathy
                  Kleb (esbl)  VAP on [**Last Name (un) 430**], day [**6-8**] antibx

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure due to influenza complicated by secondary MRSA pneumonia. He has been aggressively volume resuscitated but continues to have bilateral pulmonary effusions. The patient developed low-grade temperatures after 10 days of Vancomycin and sputum was positive for Klebsiella. Currently, he is on day 8 of antibiotic coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the antibiotic has been switched from Zosyn to Meropenem due to an ESBL-producing Klebsiella infection. The patient has also undergone a tracheostomy on [**2185-4-6**]. His arterial blood gas (ABG) continues to show mild respiratory alkalosis, and he remains agitated and overbreathing. Sedation will be weaned slowly, and a fentanyl patch has been started. Vent weaning is being considered in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included respiratory failure, and he required intubation for 16 days. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to ongoing bilateral pulmonary effusions and the presence of a tracheostomy.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is a common complication in mechanically ventilated patients. There is a risk of worsening lung infection and potential spread of the infection to other parts of the body.

    85 y/o man admitted with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA
   PNA now with Klebsiella VAP, planning for possible trach placement.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology multifactorial, pt was admitted with
   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA. Aggressively volume resussitated with
   depressed EF & continues to have bilateral pulm effusions. Pt
   developped low grade temps s/p 10 days of  Vanc & sputum was
   +klebsiella.  Pt currently day [**6-8**] Zosyn for VAP, but Kleb is ESBL
   producing and will likely develop resistance to Zosyn. Pt currently day
   15 of intubation, given NIFF of -1, RSBI ranging from 80-120 & h/o post
   polio syndrome causing weakened resp muscles, pt was trached on [**2185-4-6**].
   - completed 10 day course of Vancomycin for MRSA PNA
   - day [**8-8**] ABx for VAP coverage, switched from Zosyn to Meropenem today
   due to ESBL producing Klebsiella
   - ? follow up CT
   #iD: Pt developped low grade temps, elevated WBC count s/p 10 days of
   vanc for MRSA PNA. Chest CT showed possible RLL PNA, now day [**8-8**] of
   Zosyn for VAP, sputum Cx + for klebsiella [**Last Name (un) **] to Zosyn, but ESBL
   producing, was switched to Meropenem for last 2 days of Abx course.
   - d/c Abx after last dose today
   - blood & urine Cx NGTD
   - Head CT c/w sinusisitis vs mastoiditis, presumably covered by
   Meropenem

   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs that have been better controlled on Digoxin & Metoprolol 100mg
   TID.  Pt had an episode of bradycardia on [**2185-4-3**] and Diltiazem was
   d/c
d. HR has been stable today in 80-100s
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID, Digoxin 0.125mg & low dose ASA 81mg
   - ?holding anticoagulation, recent hct drop with ongoing bloody
   secretions from oropharynx
    (daily risk of CVA in pt with A. Fib very low)
   .
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globa lly
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He now has Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is planned for possible tracheostomy placement.
- The patient was aggressively volume resuscitated with depressed ejection fraction and continues to have bilateral pulmonary effusions. He developed low-grade temperatures after 10 days of Vancomycin and sputum was positive for Klebsiella.
- The patient is currently on day 15 of intubation, with a negative inspiratory force (NIFF) of -1, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) ranging from 80-120, and a history of post-polio syndrome causing weakened respiratory muscles.
- The patient completed a 10-day course of Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and is now on day 8 of antibiotic therapy for VAP, switched from Zosyn to Meropenem due to an ESBL-producing Klebsiella infection.
- The patient has developed low-grade temperatures, elevated white blood cell count, and a chest CT showing possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure is being managed with Digoxin and Metoprolol. Bradycardia episodes have been observed, and Diltiazem was discontinued.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation, and delirium. He has been unable to be weaned from the ventilator and has a history of sinusitis and resolving klebsiella VAP. The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy on POD 1. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure and has been unable to wean off the ventilator. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially worsen his condition.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of klebsiella VAP, which may recur, leading to further lung infections and complications.
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has evidence of CHF, which can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs and worsen his respiratory status.
4. Delirium: The patient is agitated and delirious, which can increase the risk of complications such as falls, self-extubation, and difficulty with weaning from mechanical ventilation.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of multiple infections including sinusitis, klebsiella VAP, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. There is a risk of developing new infections or complications related to his current conditions.

   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA. Aggressively volume resussitated with
   depressed EF & continues to have bilateral pulm effusions. Then
   developped low grade temps with Sputum +klebsiella.  Pt currently day
   [**7-9**] Abx for Kleb VAP, Kleb is ESBL producing, on Meropenem now. Pt
   currently day 15 of intubation, repeat NIFF of -7, RSBI ranging from
   80-120 & h/o post polio syndrome causing weakened resp muscles, pt not
   likely to tolerate extubation.  s/p tracheostomy.
   - completed 10 day course of Vancomycin for MRSA PNA
   - day [**8-8**] ABx for VAP, switched to Meropenem due to ESBL producing
   Klebsiella
   - ABG continues to show resp alkalosis,  will attempt pressure support
   trial today
   #ID: Pt developed low grade temps, elevated WBC count s/p 10 days of
   vanc for MRSA PNA. Chest CT showed possible RLL PNA, now day [**7-9**] of
   Zosyn for VAP, sputum Cx + for klebsiella [**Last Name (un) **] to Zosyn, but ESBL
   producing, pt was switched to Meropenem for last 2 days of Abx course.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure due to influenza complicated by secondary MRSA pneumonia. He was aggressively volume resuscitated but continues to have bilateral pulmonary effusions. The patient then developed low-grade temperatures with sputum positive for Klebsiella, which is an ESBL-producing strain. He has been receiving meropenem for this infection since day 7. The patient is currently on day 15 of intubation and is not likely to tolerate extubation due to post-polio syndrome causing weakened respiratory muscles. A tracheostomy has been performed.

The patient completed a 10-day course of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and is now on day 8 of antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), switched to meropenem due to the ESBL-producing Klebsiella. His arterial blood gases continue to show respiratory alkalosis, and pressure support trials will be attempted today.

The patient developed low-grade temperatures and an elevated white blood cell count after 10 days of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia. A chest CT showed possible right lower lobe pneumonia, and he is now on day 9 of Zosyn for VAP, with sputum culture positive for Klebsiella. However, this strain is also ESBL-producing, and the patient was switched to meropenem for the last two days of antibiotic therapy. The meropenem course is now complete, with blood"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure due to influenza and secondary MRSA pneumonia. He was aggressively volume resuscitated and continues to have bilateral pulmonary effusions.

2. The patient developed low-grade temperatures and sputum positive for Klebsiella, which is an ESBL-producing strain. He was switched to Meropenem for antibiotic therapy.

3. The patient is currently day 15 of intubation, with negative inspiratory force (NIFF) of -7 and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) ranging from 80-120. He has a history of post-polio syndrome causing weakened respiratory muscles, and it is unlikely that he will tolerate extubation.

4. The patient is now NPO for tracheostomy placement today. His arterial blood gas (ABG) continues to show mild respiratory alkalosis, and he will reassess the ABG after tracheostomy placement and consider lower tidal volumes for respiratory alkalosis.

5. The patient developed low-grade temperatures, elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, and a possible right lower lobe pneumonia. He is now on Zosyn for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and sputum culture is positive for Klebsiella. However, it is an ESBL-producing strain, so he was switched to Meropen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a prolonged course of hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation, and delirium. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has failed to wean. The patient has a history of resolving klebsiella VAP, sinusitis, and tracheostomy placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to wean off mechanical ventilation indicates ongoing respiratory failure. This could be due to factors such as pleural effusions, CHF, and probable VAP/infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels suggest possible acute kidney injury, which can occur in the setting of hypotension, sepsis, or other factors.
3. Chronic Diaphragmatic Weakness: The patient's significant weakness and inability to wean may be related to post-polio syndrome or chronic diaphragmatic weakness.
4. ICU Myopathy: Prolonged immobilization and neuromuscular blocking agents used during mechanical ventilation can lead to ICU myopathy, contributing to the patient's weakness and difficulty weaning.
5. Delirium: The patient remains agitated and delirious, requiring ongoing management with antipsychotic medication and minimizing sedation.
6. CHF: The patient's presentation of acute"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation, and delirium. The patient has a history of sinusitis and resolving klebsiella VAP. He underwent a tracheostomy on POD 2.

The patient remains actively struggling with respiratory failure, failure to wean from the ventilator, and sinusitis/VAP. There is a combination of pleural effusions, CHF, and probable VAP/infection. Significant weakness seems to be the main issue with weaning, possibly due to post-polio syndrome, chronic diaphragmatic weakness, or ICU myopathy.

The patient has klebsiella VAP, which remains negative for ESBL production. He is still in atrial fibrillation with normal white blood cell count and no change in oxygenation or secretions. The patient continues to experience respiratory alkalosis, likely related to ongoing pain and agitation. The plan is to attempt pressure support weaning today and assess progress with airway access for rest.

The patient has chronic bilateral pleural effusions, optimizing heart failure medications, mobilizing fluids, and continuing diuresis. Pain control is a concern, and the patient is off fentanyl drip, initiating morphine via PCA.

Other issues include chronic Clostridium difficile infection, treatment with vancomycin while on antibiotics, then resume slow taper;"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He has since developed Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has been on various antibiotics including Vancomycin and Meropenem. The patient has a history of post-polio syndrome causing weakened respiratory muscles, making extubation unlikely. He underwent tracheostomy placement and is currently on pressure support ventilation. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, heart failure with a depressed ejection fraction, oropharyngeal bleed, urinary tract infection (resolved), diabetes mellitus type II, anemia (likely chronic disease), Clostridium difficile infection, and a left shoulder dislocation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's weakened respiratory muscles due to post-polio syndrome and prolonged intubation pose a risk for ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already developed Klebsiella VAP, which increases the risk for further infections.
3. Atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure: The patient's chronic atrial fibrillation and labile blood pressure require careful monitoring and management to prevent complications such as stroke or hypotension.
4. Heart failure: The patient's depressed ejection fraction indicates a risk for worsening heart failure and potential complications like pulmonary edema or fluid overload.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o man admitted with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA
   PNA now with Klebsiella VAP day [**7-9**] ABx, NPO for trach placement today.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology multifactorial, pt was admitted with
   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA. Aggressively volume resussitated with
   depressed EF & continues to have bilateral pulm effusions. Then
   developped low grade temps with Sputum +klebsiella.  Pt currently day
   [**7-9**] Abx for Kleb VAP, Kleb is ESBL producing, on Meropenem now. Pt
   currently day 15 of intubation, repeat NIFF of -7, RSBI ranging from
   80-120 & h/o post polio syndrome causing weakened resp muscles, pt not
   likely to tolerate extubation.  s/p tracheostomy.
   - completed 10 day course of Vancomycin for MRSA PNA
   - day [**8-8**] ABx for VAP, switched to Meropenem due to ESBL producing
   Klebsiella
   - ABG continues to show resp alkalosis,  will attempt pressure support
   trial today
   #ID: Pt developed low grade temps, elevated WBC count s/p 10 days of
   vanc for MRSA PNA. Chest CT showed possible RLL PNA, now day [**7-9**] of
   Zosyn for VAP, sputum Cx + for klebsiella [**Last Name (un) **] to Zosyn, but ESBL
   producing, pt was switched to Meropenem for last 2 days of Abx course.
   Meropenem now complete
   - blood & urine Cx NGTD
   - Head CT c/w sinusisitis vs mastoiditis, presumably covered by
   Meropenem
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs that have been better controlled on Digoxin & Metoprolol 100mg
   TID.  Pt had an episode of bradycardia on [**2185-4-3**] and Diltiazem was
   d/c
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg & low dose ASA 81mg
   - holding anticoagulation, hct now stable
    (daily risk of CVA in pt with A. Fib very low)
   .
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo as outpt
   -continue Captopril 6.25mg q6hr for afterload reduction
   # OROPHARYNGEAL BLEED: Apprec ENT consult, likely [**3-5**] skin
   breakdown/abrasions under ETT
   - reposition frequently, avoid heparin gtt for now
   - perform better OG exam after ETT removed
   .
   # UTI: Urine cultures form [**3-27**] + for yeast, now completed 3 days of
   Amphotericin CBI.  Repeat UAs +leuks & >100 WBCs, no yeast.  Foley
   changed out [**4-2**]
   - Urine cultures NGTD

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He now has Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has been receiving antibiotics. The patient has been intubated for 15 days and is not likely to tolerate extubation. A tracheostomy was performed. The patient completed a 10-day course of Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and is currently on Meropenem due to an ESBL-producing Klebsiella infection.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was admitted with influenza and secondary MRSA pneumonia. He has bilateral pulmonary effusions and developed low-grade temperatures with sputum positive for Klebsiella. The patient is currently on antibiotics for VAP and has a history of post-polio syndrome causing weakened respiratory muscles.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Labile Blood Pressure: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation and labile blood pressures that have been better controlled on Digoxin and Metoprolol.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and was found to have a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25-30% on admission. This could be related to viral myocarditis or sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.
4. Oropharyngeal Bleed: The patient has a history of oropharyngeal bleed likely due"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure caused by influenza, VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), CHF (congestive heart failure), agitation, and delirium. The patient has a prolonged course of illness with multiple comorbidities including chronic anemia, type II diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, and a history of myocardial infarction. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic pleural effusions, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pain, weakness, delirium, and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics for resolving klebsiella VAP, diuretics for heart failure, digoxin for atrial fibrillation, pain management, and optimizing heart failure medications. The patient is critically ill and has been placed on DNR (do not resuscitate) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure is already present and may worsen if there is a failure to wean from the ventilator.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which needs to be managed with medications such as digoxin and beta-blockers.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has both systolic and diastolic heart failure, which"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a prolonged course of hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), agitation, and delirium. He has a history of chronic anemia, type II diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, acute myocardial infarction, and resolving klebsiella VAP. Active issues remain, including acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), resolving VAP, pleural effusions, chronic diaphragmatic weakness, possible ICU myopathy, and chronic bilateral pleural effusions. The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and is currently intubated. There is a concern for ongoing weakness of respiratory muscles, possibly due to post-polio syndrome, chronic diaphragmatic weakness, or ICU myopathy. Failure to wean from the ventilator may indicate significant respiratory muscle weakness.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has chronic bilateral pleural effusions, which can be associated with heart failure or infection. Optimizing heart failure medications, mobilizing fluids, and continuing diuretics are recommended.
3. Delirium: The patient remains agitated and delirious. Pain control and minimizing sedation are important in managing delirium.
4. Chronic Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient has chronic C. difficile infection, and treatment with vancomycin will"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure secondary to sepsis from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. He completed 10 days of vancomycin and then developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Klebsiella. After being aggressively volume-resuscitated, the patient continues to have bilateral pulmonary effusions. He was intubated for 16 days and unable to wean. The patient has a history of influenza, post-polio syndrome, and weakened respiratory muscles. A tracheostomy was placed on [**2185-4-6**]. The patient's ABG improved, but breathing patterns suggest Cheyne-Stokes respiration, likely a central process.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including influenza and secondary MRSA pneumonia. He has been aggressively volume-resuscitated but continues to have bilateral pulmonary effusions. The patient's history of post-polio syndrome and weakened respiratory muscles makes weaning from the ventilator challenging.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Labile Blood Pressure: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation and labile blood pressures that have been better controlled on digoxin and metoprolol. The patient experienced an episode of bradycardia on [**2185-4-3**] and diltiazem was discontinued. Continuing met"

The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of these conditions. The patient's arterial line stopped at midnight, but they did better on pressure support trial overnight. The patient is receiving various medications, including morphine sulfate, digoxin, metoprolol, captopril, colace, bisacodyl, senna, levothyroxine, PO Vanc, heparin, ASA, and a statin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/48-124/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450-692 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 109.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure due to sepsis from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. He has been on mechanical ventilation for 16 days and is unable to wean. The patient has a history of post-polio syndrome, which weakens his respiratory muscles. He also has atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, oropharyngeal bleed, urinary tract infection, diabetes mellitus type II, anemia, Clostridium difficile infection, and a left shoulder dislocation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to wean off mechanical ventilation puts him at risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged intubation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
3. Klebsiella Infection: The patient has been treated for MRSA pneumonia but developed a Klebsiella infection, which is an ESBL-producing strain.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BP: The patient's atrial fibrillation and labile blood pressure require close monitoring to prevent complications such as stroke.
5. Heart Failure: The patient's globally depressed ejection fraction indicates heart failure, which may lead to worsening cardiac function if not managed appropriately.

   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology multifactorial, pt was admitted with
   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA. Aggressively volume resussitated with
   depressed EF & continues to have bilateral pulm effusions. Then
   developped low grade temps with Sputum + ESBL klebsiella, completed
   course of Abx.
   Pt was intubated for 16 days and was unable to wean with very poor NIF
   of -1 to -7, RSBIs ranging from 80-120 & h/o post polio syndrome
   causing weakened resp muscles. Now s/p tracheostomy on [**2183-4-6**].
   #ID: Pt developed low grade temps, elevated WBC count s/p 10 days of
   vanc for MRSA PNA. Chest CT showed possible RLL PNA, now day [**7-9**] of
   Zosyn for VAP, sputum Cx + for klebsiella [**Last Name (un) **] to Zosyn, but ESBL
   producing, pt was switched to Meropenem for last 2 days of Abx course.
   Meropenem now complete
   - blood & urine Cx NGTD
   - Head CT c/w sinusisitis vs mastoiditis, presumably covered by
   Meropenem
   - completed 10 day course of Vancomycin for MRSA PNA and 7 day course
   of Zosyn/Meropenem
   - continue working on vent weaning
   # Atrial Fibrillation with labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs that have been better controlled on Digoxin & Metoprolol 100mg TID.
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg & low dose ASA 81mg

   with A. Fib low)
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo as outpt.

","The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure secondary to sepsis from MRSA. He completed a 10-day course of Vancomycin, but then developed Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), for which he received a course of Zosyn/Meropenem. The patient has a tracheostomy in place.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressures and is on digoxin and metoprolol.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation (MV) with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 109, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 16 cmH2O, and the spontaneous respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination shows a cachectic appearance, clear breath sounds, and slightly more distended abdomen with upper quadrant tenderness. The patient is not communicative and has absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC"

   85 y/o man adm with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA PNA
   completed 10 days Vanc, then developed Klebsiella VAP, now s/p 7days of
   Zosyn/Meropenem.  Trach placed on [**2185-4-6**], working on vent weaning.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology multifactorial, pt was admitted with
   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA. Aggressively volume resussitated with
   depressed EF & continues to have bilateral pulm effusions. Then
   developped low grade temps with Sputum +klebsiella.  Completed 7 days
   Abx for Kleb VAP. Pt was intubated for 16 days and was unable to wean.
   Now s/p tracheostomy on [**2185-4-6**], all cell lines up today including WBC
   ct. However, pt has been afebrile, no new infiltrate on CXR.  This is
   unlikely a new infectious process, will continue to monitor.
   - repeat ABG today after being on PS of [**11-6**] overnight.
   - continue working on vent weaning with PS & back up MMV
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs that have been better controlled on Digoxin & Metoprolol 100mg
   TID.  Pt had an episode of bradycardia on [**2185-4-3**] and Diltiazem was
   d/c
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg & low dose ASA 81mg
   - holding anticoagulation, hct now stable
    (daily risk of CVA in pt with A. Fib very low)
   #Pain: Pt appears comfortable, but grimaces whenever examined or
   disturbed.  KUB showed non-specific bowel gas pattern, LFTs WNL &
   tolerating TFs with regular BMs
   - started fentanyl patch, with liquid morphine & tylenol standing
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo as outpt
   - continue Lisinopril 10mg daily
   # OROPHARYNGEAL BLEED: resolved. apprec ENT consult, likely [**3-5**] skin
   breakdown/abrasions under ETT
   - continue holding systemic anticoagulation
   # UTI: Urine cultures form [**3-27**] + for yeast, now completed 3 days of
   Amphotericin CBI.  Repeat UAs +leuks & >100 WBCs, no yeast.  Foley
   changed out [**4-2**]
   - Urine cultures NGTD
   .
   # DM TYPEII: continue ISS with TF
   # ANEMIA: etiology likely [**3-5**] chronic disease. Hct stable at 28
   -stools guaiac negative
   .
   # C. Diff: pt with h/o relapsing/recurrent c.diff on a slow taper as
   outpt.
   - begin slow po Vancomycin taper currently 125mg TID
   .
   # Left shoulder dislocation: incidentally seen on CXR, per ortho,
   deferring management until medically stable to tolerate MRI.  L
   shoulder films show DJD, not able to assess for dislocation
   -po morphine, fentanyl patch & tylenol for pain.

","The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to sepsis from Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. He completed 10 days of vancomycin, then developed Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and has since been treated with 7 days of meropenem. The patient underwent a tracheostomy on 4/6 and is currently being weaned off the ventilator.

The patient has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, which has been better controlled on digoxin and metoprolol. He had an episode of bradycardia on 4/3 and diltiazem was discontinued. The patient's pain is being managed with a fentanyl patch, liquid morphine, and Tylenol.

The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and was found to have a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25-30% on admission. This could be related to viral myocarditis or sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. No regional wall motion abnormalities were observed, and the patient's function is likely to recover within 6-8 weeks. He will need a follow-up echocardiogram as an outpatient. The patient is currently taking lisinopril 10mg daily.

The patient also has a history of oropharyngeal bleeding, which has resolved. An ENT"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   85 y/o man adm with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA PNA
   completed 10 days Vanc, then developed Klebsiella VAP, now s/p 7days of
   Zosyn/Meropenem.  Trach placed on [**2185-4-6**]
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology multifactorial, pt was admitted with
   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA. Aggressively volume resussitated with
   depressed EF & continues to have bilateral pulm effusions. Then
   developped low grade temps with Sputum +klebsiella.  Completed 7 days
   Abx for Kleb VAP. Pt was intubated for 16 days and was unable to wean.
   NIFF of -1 to -7, RSBIs ranging from 80-120 & h/o post polio syndrome
   causing weakened resp muscles. Now s/p tracheostomy on [**2185-4-6**], WBC ct
   elevated today? etiology unclear
   ABG improved, but breathing pattern suggestive of cheynes [**Doctor Last Name **],
   likely a central process
   - continue working on vent weaning with PS & back up MMV
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs that have been better controlled on Digoxin & Metoprolol 100mg
   TID.  Pt had an episode of bradycardia on [**2185-4-3**] and Diltiazem was
   d/c
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg & low dose ASA 81mg
   - holding anticoagulation, hct now stable
    (daily risk of CVA in pt with A. Fib very low)
   #Pain: Pt noted to be grimacing throughout exam and unable to localize
   pain.  Abd possibly more distended but no elev in WBC & afebrile.   Pt
   with low TF residuals and having regular BMs.  Pt has a h/o pseudogout
   and may be having joint pain
   - will get KUB to rule out obstruction, add on LFTs, amylase/lipase
   - start fentanyl patch for better sustained pain control & tylenol
   standing (unable to crush oxycontin for g-tube)
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo as outpt
   - continue Lisinopril 10mg daily
   # OROPHARYNGEAL BLEED: resolved. apprec ENT consult, likely [**3-5**] skin
   breakdown/abrasions under ETT
   - continue holding systemic anticoagulation
   # UTI: Urine cultures form [**3-27**] + for yeast, now completed 3 days of
   Amphotericin CBI.  Repeat UAs +leuks & >100 WBCs, no yeast.  Foley
   changed out [**4-2**]
   - Urine cultures NGTD

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He has a history of influenza and developed Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), for which he received 7 days of meropenem antibiotics. The patient was intubated for 16 days and unable to wean. He has a tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support (PS) and backup mandatory minute volume (MMV). 

The patient also has atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, pain, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, oropharyngeal bleed, urinary tract infection (UTI), diabetes mellitus type II, anemia, Clostridium difficile infection, and a left shoulder dislocation. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C (98.8Â°F), heart rate of 90 bpm (within normal range), blood pressure of 164/71 mmHg (elevated systolic), respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (within normal range), oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 of 40%, and an ECG showing atrial fibrillation. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Other lab results indicate some abnormalities in electrolytes, liver function tests, and kidney function. Imaging reveals nonspecific"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 120/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on the ventilator. The patient is unresponsive and unable to provide history.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently being treated with digoxin and metoprolol. He also has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, with an ejection fraction of 25-30% on admission. The cause of the decreased ejection fraction is uncertain, but it could be related to viral myocarditis or sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. The patient is also being treated for chronic kidney disease and has a Foley catheter in place.

The patient has a history of diabetes type 2 and is being managed with insulin subcutaneously. He also has a history of anemia, likely due to chronic disease, and Clostridium difficile infection. Additionally, the patient has a left shoulder dislocation, which will be managed once he is medically stable to undergo an MRI.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o man admitted with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA
   PNA
   Resp failure: trached, stable, will continue to wean
   ID: slight increase in his wbc. will watch for signs of infection. CXR
   unchanged with bilat effusions
   - completed 10 days Vanc
   - completed 7 day course of Zosyn/Meropenem for Klebsiella VAP
   - continue working on vent weaning
   # Atrial Fibrillation with labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs that have been better controlled on Digoxin & Metoprolol 100mg TID.
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg & low dose ASA 81mg
   - holding anticoagulation, hct now stable.
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo as outpt.
   -continue Captopril for afterload reduction
   # OROPHARYNGEAL BLEED: Apprec ENT consult, likely [**3-5**] skin
   breakdown/abrasions under ETT
   - reposition frequently, avoid heparin for now.
   # UTI: Urine cultures form [**3-27**] + for yeast, now completed 3 days of
   Amphotericin CBI.  Repeat UAs +leuks & >100 WBCs, no yeast.  Foley
   changed out [**4-2**]
   - Urine cultures NGTD
   # DM TYPE II: continue ISS with TF
   # ANEMIA: etiology likely [**3-5**] chronic disease. Hct stable at 26
   -stools guaiac negative
   # C. Diff: pt with h/o relapsing/recurrent c.diff on a slow taper as
   outpt.  Curbsided ID, plan to give treatment dose po Vancomycin 125mg
   q6hr while on broad spect Abx & resume taper post Rx.
   # Left shoulder dislocation: incidentally seen on CXR, per ortho,
   deferring management until medically stable to tolerate MRI.  L

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male who was admitted with respiratory failure and sepsis caused by MRSA pneumonia. He has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are relatively stable, but he has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and labile blood pressure. He also has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction of 25-30%. The patient has experienced several medical complications during his stay in the ICU, including oropharyngeal bleed, urinary tract infection, Clostridium difficile infection, anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and a dislocated left shoulder. He is currently receiving multiple medications and treatments, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, cardiac medications, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already been treated for Klebsiella VAP and is at risk for developing further infections while on mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots in his legs due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the tracheostomy tube can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
4. Delirium: ICU stay and multiple medications can increase the risk of delirium, especially in older"

   Imaging: CT head:
   Evaluation is limited secondary to patient motion.  Allowing for
   these limitations, there is no evidence for intracranial hemorrhage or
   mass
   effect.  The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are prominent secondary to
   involutional changes.  Periventricular white matter hypodensities are
   the
   sequela of chronic small vessel infarction and area of encephalomalacia
   in the
   left occipital lobe indicates prior infarction.  There is dense
   atherosclerotic disease of the cavernous carotid arteries.  The
   visualized
   paranasal sinuses are clear.  There is partial opacification of the
   mastoid
   air cells.
   IMPRESSION:  _____ limited, and no evidence for intracranial
   hemorrhage.  MR
   is more sensitive for the evaluation of acute brain ischemia.
   CXR [**4-11**]:
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of a patient with respiratory failure
   and
   tracheostomy.
   Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2185-4-8**] obtained at
   05:28.
   The tracheostomy is at the midline with its tip projecting 7.4 cm above
   the
   carina.  The heart size is mildly enlarged and stable.  There is no
   interval
   change in bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral large layering pleural
   effusions, left more than right.  Underlying mild-to-moderate pulmonary
   edema
   is unchanged.

   Imaging: CT head:
   Evaluation is limited secondary to patient motion.  Allowing for
   these limitations, there is no evidence for intracranial hemorrhage or
   mass
   effect.  The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are prominent secondary to
   involutional changes.  Periventricular white matter hypodensities are
   the
   sequela of chronic small vessel infarction and area of encephalomalacia
   in the
   left occipital lobe indicates prior infarction.  There is dense
   atherosclerotic disease of the cavernous carotid arteries.  The
   visualized
   paranasal sinuses are clear.  There is partial opacification of the
   mastoid
   air cells.
   IMPRESSION:  _____ limited, and no evidence for intracranial
   hemorrhage.  MR
   is more sensitive for the evaluation of acute brain ischemia.
   CXR [**4-11**]:
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of a patient with respiratory failure
   and
   tracheostomy.
   Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2185-4-8**] obtained at
   05:28.
   The tracheostomy is at the midline with its tip projecting 7.4 cm above
   the
   carina.  The heart size is mildly enlarged and stable.  There is no
   interval
   change in bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral large layering pleural
   effusions, left more than right.  Underlying mild-to-moderate pulmonary
   edema
   is unchanged.
   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o man adm with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA PNA
   completed 10 days Vanc, then developed Klebsiella VAP, now s/p 7days of
   Zosyn/Meropenem.  Trach placed on [**2185-4-6**], working on vent weaning.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Etiology multifactorial, pt was admitted with
   Influenza c/b secondary MRSA PNA. Aggressively volume resussitated with
   depressed EF & continues to have bilateral pulm effusions. Then
   developped low grade temps with Sputum +klebsiella.  Completed 7 days
   Abx for Kleb VAP. Pt was intubated for 16 days and was unable to wean.
   Now s/p tracheostomy on [**2185-4-6**], all cell lines up today including WBC
   ct. However, pt has been afebrile, no new infiltrate on CXR.  This is
   unlikely a new infectious process, will continue to monitor.
   - repeat ABG today after being on PS of [**11-6**] overnight.
   - continue working on vent weaning with PS & back up MMV
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs that have been better controlled on Digoxin & Metoprolol 100mg
   TID.  Pt had an episode of bradycardia on [**2185-4-3**] and Diltiazem was
   d/c
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg & low dose ASA 81mg
   - holding anticoagulation, hct now stable
    (daily risk of CVA in pt with A. Fib very low)
   #Pain: Pt appears comfortable, but grimaces whenever examined or
   disturbed.  KUB showed non-specific bowel gas pattern, LFTs WNL &
   tolerating TFs with regular BMs
   - started fentanyl patch, with liquid morphine & tylenol standing
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo as outpt
   - continue Lisinopril 10mg daily
   # Hyperkalemia: repeating chem 7 today
   # DM TYPEII: continue ISS with TF
   # ANEMIA: etiology likely [**3-5**] chronic disease. Hct stable at 28
   -stools guaiac negative
   .
   # C. Diff: pt with h/o relapsing/recurrent c.diff on a slow taper as
   outpt.
   - begin slow po Vancomycin taper currently 125mg TID
   .
   # Left shoulder dislocation: incidentally seen on CXR, per ortho,
   deferring management until medically stable to tolerate MRI.  L
   shoulder films show DJD, not able to assess for dislocation
   -po morphine, fentanyl patch & tylenol for pain.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He developed Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has been on Zosyn/Meropenem for 7 days. The patient had a tracheostomy placed on 4/6 and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of influenza with secondary MRSA pneumonia, low-grade temperatures with sputum positive for Klebsiella, and bilateral pulmonary effusions. The patient has been aggressively volume resuscitated with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and continues to have bibasilar atelectasis and large layering pleural effusions, left more than right.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was admitted with respiratory failure, initially due to influenza complicated by secondary MRSA pneumonia. He then developed Klebsiella VAP and has been treated with antibiotics. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is working on weaning.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Labile Blood Pressure: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressures that have been better controlled on digoxin and metoprolol. The patient had an episode of bradycardia, and diltiazem was discontinued.
3. Pain: The patient appears comfortable but grimaces when examined or disturbed. Non-specific bowel gas pattern is seen on KUB"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He initially had sepsis from MRSA pneumonia, which was treated with vancomycin for 10 days. He then developed Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and received meropenem for 7 days. The patient had a tracheostomy placed on [**2185-4-6**] and has been experiencing low-grade temperatures and rising WBC counts. He is still on mechanical ventilation and has been unable to wean. There are concerns for new VAP, so blood, urine, and sputum cultures will be sent today. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with metoprolol and digoxin. His pain is being managed with morphine and tylenol. He has hyperkalemia, which may be related to increased ACE-I or new renal tubular acidosis. His heart failure is due to a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25-30%, possibly related to viral myocarditis or sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. He will need follow-up echo as an outpatient. Other issues include diabetes type II, anemia of chronic disease, Clostridium difficile infection, and a left shoulder dislocation that will be managed once he is medically stable. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and his disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already developed two episodes of VAP, and there are concerns for a new infection. Proper management and culture analysis are crucial to prevent further complications.
2. Atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure: The patient's chronic atrial fibrillation needs to be closely monitored, especially with labile blood pressures. Appropriate medication adjustments may be necessary to maintain stability.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels require further investigation and treatment to prevent potential cardiac complications.
4. Heart failure: The patient has a depressed ejection fraction, indicating heart failure. Close monitoring and follow-up are needed to manage this condition effectively.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia should be managed appropriately to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient's history of recurrent C. diff infection needs to be addressed through appropriate antibiotic stewardship and consideration for treatment options.
7. Left shoulder dislocation: The patient's shoulder dislocation should be managed once he is medically stable to prevent further complications and ensure proper alignment.
8. Pain management: The patient's agitation and discomfort when moved or touched suggest the need for effective pain management to improve his comfort and reduce agitation.

The patient's complex medical history and current conditions require careful monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and optimize his overall health outcome."

   Imaging: CT head:
   Evaluation is limited secondary to patient motion.  Allowing for
   these limitations, there is no evidence for intracranial hemorrhage or
   mass
   effect.  The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are prominent secondary to
   involutional changes.  Periventricular white matter hypodensities are
   the
   sequela of chronic small vessel infarction and area of encephalomalacia
   in the
   left occipital lobe indicates prior infarction.  There is dense
   atherosclerotic disease of the cavernous carotid arteries.  The
   visualized
   paranasal sinuses are clear.  There is partial opacification of the
   mastoid
   air cells.
   IMPRESSION:  limited, and no evidence for intracranial hemorrhage.  MR
   is more sensitive for the evaluation of acute brain ischemia.
   CXR [**4-11**]:
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of a patient with respiratory failure
   and
   tracheostomy.
   Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2185-4-8**] obtained at
   05:28.
   The tracheostomy is at the midline with its tip projecting 7.4 cm above
   the
   carina.  The heart size is mildly enlarged and stable.  There is no
   interval
   change in bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral large layering pleural
   effusions, left more than right.  Underlying mild-to-moderate pulmonary
   edema
   is unchanged.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o man admitted with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA
   PNA
   1. Resp failure: trached, stable but vent dependent, will continue to
   wean. Bilat effusions, question of etiology, likely CHF. [**Month (only) 60**] benefit
   from thoracentesis or more aggressive diuresis.
   2. ID: slight increase in his wbc, may be recurrent VAP. CXR unchanged
   with bilat effusions.
   - completed 10 days Vanc, completed 7 day course of Zosyn/Meropenem for
   Klebsiella VAP
   3. Atrial Fibrillation with labile BP: better controlled on Digoxin &
   Metoprolol 100mg TID. Hypertension will likely respond to diuresis
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID, Digoxin 0.125mg & low dose ASA 81mg
   - hold anticoagulation, hct now stable.
   4. CHF:  Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally depressed EF
   of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral myocarditis vs sepsis
   induced CMP.  Will need follow up echo as outpt.
   - d/c ACE d/t hyperkalemia
   5. Previous UTI: urine cultures form [**3-27**] + for yeast, tx with
   Amphotericin CBI.  Repeat UAs +leuks & >100 WBCs, no yeast.  Foley
   changed out [**4-2**]. Urine cultures NGTD
   6. DM Type 2: continue ISS with TF
   7. Anemia: etiology likely from chronic disease.
   8. Cdiff: pt with h/o relapsing/recurrent c.diff now on PO vanco slow
   taper.
   9. Left shoulder dislocation: incidentally found on CXR, per ortho,
   deferring management until medically stable to tolerate MRI.  L
   shoulder films show DJD, not able to assess for dislocation
   -po morphine for pain
   10. Hyperkalemia - ACE d/c'd. To be diuresed

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure and sepsis from MRSA PNA. He is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications and conditions that require attention.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is tracheally intubated and ventilator-dependent. His bilateral effusions suggest a possible etiology of congestive heart failure (CHF). Thoracentesis or more aggressive diuresis may be beneficial.

2. Infection: There is a slight increase in white blood cell count, which may indicate recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The chest X-ray remains unchanged with bilateral effusions. The patient has completed a 10-day course of vancomycin and a 7-day course of Zosyn/Meropenem for Klebsiella VAP.

3. Atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure: The patient's atrial fibrillation is better controlled on digoxin and metoprolol 100mg TID. Hypertension will likely respond to diuretics. It is recommended to continue metoprolol 100mg TID, digoxin 0.125mg, and low-dose aspirin 81mg. Anticoagulation should be held due to the patient's stable hematocrit level.

4. CHF: The patient has a history of diastolic CHF and was found to have a globally depressed ejection fraction of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure, initially due to influenza complicated by secondary MRSA pneumonia. He has been aggressively volume resuscitated with depressed EF and continues to have bilateral pulmonary effusions. He then developed low-grade temperatures with sputum positive for Klebsiella, for which he completed seven days of antibiotics. The patient was intubated for 16 days and was unable to wean. He subsequently underwent a tracheostomy on [**2185-4-6**]. His WBC count has been slowly rising, and he had a low-grade temperature overnight. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures were sent today due to concerns for new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Lasix 40mg was administered to address the effusions and edema. A family meeting was held today.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to influenza complicated by secondary MRSA pneumonia. He required aggressive volume resuscitation and has ongoing bilateral pulmonary effusions. He then developed low-grade temperatures with sputum positive for Klebsiella, for which he received seven days of antibiotics. The patient was intubated for 16 days but was unable to wean. He underwent a tracheostomy on [**2185-4-6**]. There is a concern for new VAP, and cultures have been sent. Lasix 40mg was given"

   approximately 7.2 cm above the carina.  The heart is mildly enlarged
   and
   stable.  Since yesterday's examination, there is no interval change in
   the
   bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral large layering pleural effusions.
   The
   left-sided effusion is larger than the right.  There is also mild- to-
   moderate pulmonary edema which is unchanged since yesterday's
   examination.
   IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change.  Comparison between
   yesterday's
   and today's diffuse edematous pattern does not show new evidence of
   pneumonia.

   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt continues to have bilateral pulm effusions &
   weak resp muscles from post polio syndrome.  Unable to tolerated PS for
   long periods of time, currently resting on AC.  Pt had a low grade temp
   on [**4-12**] and rising WBC ct, pan cultures are NGTD and WBC ct trending
   down today.  Maintaining sats well on AC.
   - f/u blood/urine & sputum cultures
   - hold off on vent weaning, rest on AC given agitation & tachypnea
   - lasix 40mg now in effort to [**Month (only) 38**] effusions/edema (goal neg 1L today)
   # HCT DROP: Pt with underlying anemia of chronic disease. Hct has been
   stable at 28 and dropped to 22.9 this am.  Etiology unclear, will
   recheck hct and transfuse if remains at 23.
   - guaic all stools
   - start PPI
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and labile
   BPs that have been better controlled on Digoxin & Metoprolol 100mg
   TID.  Pt had an episode of bradycardia on [**2185-4-3**] and Diltiazem was
   d/c
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg & low dose ASA 81mg
   - holding anticoagulation (daily risk of CVA in pt with A. Fib very
   low)
   #Pain/MS: Pt appears agitated and uncomfortable when moved/touched.
   KUB showed non-specific bowel gas pattern, LFTs WNL & tolerating TFs
   with regular BMs.  Non-contrast head CT showed e/o small vessel
   ischemic dz, no acute intracran pathology, EEG pending, Vit B12 WNL.
   Initial concern for new infection given low grade Temp but WBC ct
   trending down
   - f/u cultures, sputum

   - add nitrate if necessary for BP control
   # HEART FAILURE: Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally
   depressed EF of 25-30% on admission, possible related to viral
   myocarditis vs sepsis induced CMP.  No RWMA, function likely to recover
   in 6-8wks, will need follow up echo as outpt

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA and subsequently developed Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient underwent tracheostomy on [**2185-4-6**]. 

The patient continues to have bilateral pulmonary effusions and weak respiratory muscles from post-polio syndrome. He is unable to tolerate positive end-expiratory pressure (PS) for long periods of time and is resting on assist-control (AC) ventilation. The patient had a low-grade temperature on [**4-12**] and rising white blood cell count, but cultures are pending and the count is trending down today. The patient's oxygen saturation is well maintained on AC ventilation.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's bilateral pulmonic effusions and weak respiratory muscles will be monitored. He will be maintained on AC ventilation, and blood, urine, and sputum cultures will be followed up. Weaning from the ventilator will be held off due to agitation and tachypnea. Lasix 40mg will be given to reduce effusions and edema.

2. Hematocrit drop: The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 28 to 22.9. The cause is unclear, but it may be due to anemia of chronic disease. A repeat hematocrit will be done, and transfusion will be considered"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o man admitted with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA
   PNA
   1. Resp failure: trached, stable but vent dependent, will continue to
   diurese for bilat effusions, etiology likely CHF. [**Month (only) 60**] benefit from
   thoracentesis.
   2. ID: wbc is decreased today. [**Month (only) 60**] have been recurrent VAP - not on
   Abx. CXR unchanged with bilat effusions.
   - completed 10 days Vanc, completed 7 day course of Zosyn/Meropenem for
   Klebsiella VAP
   3. Atrial Fibrillation with labile BP: better controlled on Digoxin &
   Metoprolol 100mg TID. Hypertension will likely respond to diuresis
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID, Digoxin 0.125mg & low dose ASA 81mg
   - hold anticoagulation, hct now stable.
   4. CHF:  Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally depressed EF
   of 25-30% on admission, probable viral induced CMP. Will need follow up
   echo as outpt.
   - d/c ACE d/t hyperkalemia
   5. Previous UTI: urine cultures form [**3-27**] + for yeast, tx with
   Amphotericin CBI.  Repeat UAs +leuks & >100 WBCs, no yeast.  Foley
   changed out [**4-2**]. Urine cultures NGTD
   6. DM Type 2: continue ISS with TF
   7. Anemia: impressive decrease in hct despite being negative vol
   balance, question of active bleed. Recheck and follow.
   8. Cdiff: pt with h/o relapsing/recurrent c.diff now on PO vanco slow
   taper.
   9. Left shoulder dislocation: incidentally found on CXR, per ortho,
   deferring management until medically stable to tolerate MRI.  L

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure and sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is tracheally intubated and dependent on mechanical ventilation. Efforts are being made to wean him off the ventilator, but he still requires assistance. The cause of his respiratory failure is likely congestive heart failure (CHF).

2. Infection (ID): The patient's white blood cell count is decreased, indicating a possible ongoing infection. He has had recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and his chest X-ray shows bilateral effusions. Antibiotics have been completed, but there is no change in the chest X-ray.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with labile Blood Pressure: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a variable blood pressure. It is better controlled on digoxin and metoprolol. Hypertension will likely respond to diuresis. 

4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of diastolic CHF and was found to have a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25-30% on admission. This is likely due to viral-induced cardiomyopathy. He will need a follow-up echo as an outpatient.

5. Previous Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient had a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient has been diagnosed with an infection indicated by positive blood cultures showing gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, as well as budding yeast. The source of the infection is suspected to be the PICC line. 

The patient also has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), indicating an immune response to the infection. The platelet count is low, which may be a result of the infection or other factors such as sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient's respiratory status is being supported by mechanical ventilation, and there is evidence of inflammation in the lungs as shown by increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending, but the respiratory support index (RSBI) is within normal range, suggesting adequate oxygenation.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and the heart rhythm remains unchanged. The vital signs are relatively stable with normal temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. However, there is a mention of low urine output, which could indicate renal impairment or dehydration.

The patient's renal function tests show an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level and creatinine level, suggesting potential renal dysfunction. The liver function tests are within normal limits, but there are elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), suggesting tissue damage or breakdown"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure, initially due to sepsis from MRSA, then Klebsiella VAP, and now with tracheostomy. He has bilateral pulmonary effusions and weak respiratory muscles due to post-polio syndrome. He is unable to tolerate prolonged periods of spontaneous breathing and is resting on assisted ventilation. The patient had a low-grade temperature on 4/12 and rising white blood cell count, but cultures are negative and the count is trending down. He is maintaining good oxygen saturation levels on assisted ventilation.

The patient has been diagnosed with fungemia/bacteremia, with blood cultures growing gram-positive cocci and yeast. Yeast is also seen in the urine and sputum. The patient has been afebrile with only a minimal increase in white blood cell count. He will be started on caspofungin in addition to vancomycin.

His hematocrit (Hct) has dropped from 28 to 22, but has since returned to 29. This fluctuation in Hct levels is unclear and will be rechecked. The patient has underlying anemia of chronic disease.

The patient has atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure. He is currently on digoxin and metoprolol, but had an episode of bradycardia previously. Diltiazem was discontinued, and the patient will continue on metoprolol and digoxin"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, sepsis from MRSA, and now presents with a positive blood culture indicating a possible new infection. The low-grade temperature and rising white blood cell count suggest an ongoing inflammatory response.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The presence of fever and increased white blood cell count could indicate a possible infection in the lungs.

3. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): The patient has a positive urine culture showing the presence of yeast, which can be indicative of a urinary tract infection.

4. Heart failure: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and an ejection fraction of 25-30%, indicating reduced heart function. This puts the patient at risk for fluid overload and pulmonary edema.

5. Hyperkalemia: The patient had an episode of elevated potassium levels, which resolved after stopping ACE inhibitors. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

6. Atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation and labile blood pressure. This condition requires careful management to prevent complications such as thromboembolism or cardiac arrhythmias.

   Metoprolol 100mg TID. Hypertension will likely respond to diuresis.
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID, Digoxin 0.125mg & low dose ASA 81mg
   - hold anticoagulation, hct now stable.
   4. CHF:  Pt with h/o diastolic CHF, found to have globally depressed EF
   of 25-30% on admission, probable viral induced CMP. Will need follow up

","The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with prolonged respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He is currently ventilator-dependent and has positive blood cultures indicating bacteremia/fungemia. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, bacteremia/fungemia sepsis, atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type 2, anemia, Clostridium difficile infection, left shoulder dislocation, hyperkalemia, and delirium.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, septic shock, arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbation, uncontrolled diabetes, further decrease in hemoglobin levels, Clostridium difficile colitis flare-up, dislocation of the left shoulder, electrolyte imbalances, and persistent delirium.

Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient has been critically ill and requires ongoing intensive care.
- He has shown small improvement in mental status.
- His respiratory failure continues, and he remains ventilator-dependent.
- Blood cultures indicate bacteremia/fungemia, for which he is being treated with vancomycin and will also start caspofungin empirically.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure is being managed with digoxin and metoprolol.
- CHF is present, likely due to viral-induced myocarditis, and a follow-up echo will be"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA pneumonia. He is now positive for blood cultures and has developed yeast and GPC infections. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been diuresed for bilateral effusions, likely secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF). He also has atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, which is better controlled on digoxin and metoprolol. The patient has a history of diastolic CHF and a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction of 25-30%. He previously had a urinary tract infection (UTI) treated with amphotericin B and now has negative urine cultures. The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and is on insulin sliding scale therapy. He also has anemia, Clostridium difficile infection, and a left shoulder dislocation. His mental status is improving, but he still has some responsiveness issues. He is on various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, diuretics, and pain management. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he remains critically ill."

   Labs / Radiology
   EEG performed [**4-13**]
   ABNORMALITY #1: The background rhythm remained slow and disorganized,
   typically reaching a 6 Hz maximum in most areas. Much of the record was
   obscured by movement artifact.
   HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
   INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
   SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen.
   CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed an irregularly irregular rhythm.
   IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized
   background throughout the tracing. This suggests a widespread
   encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are
   among the most common causes. There were no areas of prominent focal
   slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There were no
   epileptiform features. An abnormal cardiac rhythm was noted.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, sepsis from MRSA, and subsequent Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a history of post-polio syndrome, atrial fibrillation, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus type II, Clostridium difficile infection, and a dislocated left shoulder. The patient's current condition includes widespread encephalopathy indicated by abnormal EEG findings, bacteremia/fungemia with positive blood cultures for Gram-positive cocci and yeast, bilateral pulmonary effusions, agitation, tachypnea, and labile blood pressure.

Potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient is experiencing bacteremia/fungemia with positive blood cultures for Gram-positive cocci and yeast. This indicates an ongoing infection that needs to be addressed with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral pulmonary effusions and weak respiratory muscles due to post-polio syndrome. This puts him at risk for further respiratory failure and may require ongoing ventilatory support.
3. Atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation with episodes of bradycardia and labile blood pressure. It is important to monitor his heart rhythm and blood pressure closely and adjust medication dosages as needed.
4. Heart failure: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. He is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure, initially due to sepsis from MRSA and later complicated by Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He underwent tracheostomy on 04/06/2185. The patient has a history of post-polio syndrome, making him unable to tolerate prolonged periods of physical therapy. Currently, he is resting on assisted coughing. 

Recent findings include:
1. Low-grade temperature on 04/12/2185.
2. Blood culture positive for Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and fungemia.
3. Yeast also detected in urine and sputum.
4. The patient's white blood cell count has only slightly increased.

Plan:
1. Continue vancomycin and caspofungin for two more days.
2. Hold off on weaning from the ventilator due to agitation and tachypnea.
3. Administer lasix 40mg to help reduce effusions and edema.
4. Monitor fungal blood culture results.
5. Consider underlying anemia of chronic disease as the cause of hematocrit (HCT) drop.
6. Investigate potential sources of infection, including urine.
7. Discontinue digoxin and metoprolol for atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure.
8. Continue low-dose aspirin and check digoxin levels.
9. Hold anticoagulation due to risk"

   EEG performed [**4-13**]
   ABNORMALITY #1: The background rhythm remained slow and disorganized,
   typically reaching a 6 Hz maximum in most areas. Much of the record was
   obscured by movement artifact.
   HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
   INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
   SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen.
   CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed an irregularly irregular rhythm.
   IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized
   background throughout the tracing. This suggests a widespread
   encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are
   among the most common causes. There were no areas of prominent focal
   slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There were no
   epileptiform features. An abnormal cardiac rhythm was noted.

","The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure, initially due to sepsis from MRSA, then complicated by Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and subsequently underwent tracheostomy on 4/6. The patient has a history of post-polio syndrome and bilateral pulmonary effusions. 

The patient presented with a low-grade fever on 4/12 and blood cultures are now positive for Gram-positive cocci and fungemia. The sputum gram stain shows >25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes and <10 epithelial cells per 100X field, with 3+ Gram-positive cocci in pairs. The preliminary respiratory culture results are pending, while the fungal culture from the line-pick is also pending. 

The patient's current medications include vancomycin and caspofungin, which will be continued. It is planned to hold off on weaning from the ventilator and allow the patient to rest on the adult chest. Lasix has been started in an effort to reduce the effusions and edema. 

The patient's condition includes respiratory failure, fungemia/bacteremia, HCT drop, atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, pain/muscle weakness, heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, Clostridium difficile, and a left shoulder dislocation. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's condition suggests the following possibilities:

   EEG performed [**4-13**]
   ABNORMALITY #1: The background rhythm remained slow and disorganized,
   typically reaching a 6 Hz maximum in most areas. Much of the record was
   obscured by movement artifact.
   HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
   INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
   SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen.
   CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed an irregularly irregular rhythm.
   IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized
   background throughout the tracing. This suggests a widespread
   encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are
   among the most common causes. There were no areas of prominent focal
   slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There were no
   epileptiform features. An abnormal cardiac rhythm was noted.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA, followed by Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and subsequently underwent tracheostomy on April 6th. He has a history of post-polio syndrome, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and chronic atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fungemia/bacteremia, atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, HCT drop, pain/muscle weakness, heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, Clostridium difficile infection, and left shoulder dislocation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised due to post-polio syndrome, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and previous respiratory infections. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which may require mechanical ventilation support.

2. Fungemia/Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures have grown Gram-positive cocci and yeast, indicating a fungal and bacterial infection in the bloodstream. This can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction if not effectively managed with appropriate antibiotics.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Labile Blood Pressure: The patient has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation, characterized by irregular heart rhythm and fluctuating blood pressure. This condition increases the risk of embolic events such as stroke or transient ischemic attacks.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA, followed by Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and now presents with tracheostomy. He has a history of recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary effusions and weak respiratory muscles due to post-polio syndrome. He is currently on non-invasive ventilation (AC) and has positive blood cultures for bacteria and fungus, as well as a positive sputum culture for Klebsiella, which is consistent with new VAP.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has bilateral pulmonary effusions and weak respiratory muscles, making it difficult for him to tolerate prolonged periods of pressure support ventilation (PSV). He is currently on assisted control (AC) mode.
2. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing bacteremia and fungemia. His blood cultures are positive for bacteria and fungus, indicating ongoing infections.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of recurrent VAP, and his current sputum culture is positive for Klebsiella, which is likely causing new VAP.
4. Fungemia: The patient has yeast seen in urine and sputum, and his blood cultures are positive for fungus.
5. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for Enterococcus species and Klebsiella pneumoniae, indicating a bacterial infection. Additionally, there is evidence of fungemia and yeast present in the urine culture. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc and Meropenem) and antifungal medication (Caspofungin). It is important to closely monitor the patient's response to these treatments and adjust accordingly.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation support. The respiratory support parameters, such as FiO2 and PEEP, are being adjusted to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Continuous monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary to optimize ventilator settings and prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.

3. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at high risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility and critical illness. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, are being implemented. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and surveillance for signs of DVT or PE should be performed.

4. Fluid balance: The patient has an ongoing fluid deficit, as indicated by the negative fluid balance over the past 24 hours. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, sepsis, tracheostomy, and recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), bacteremia, and fungemia. He is currently in the ICU with ongoing bilateral pulmonary effusions, atrial fibrillation, delirium, heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has multiple comorbidities including post-polio syndrome and anemia of chronic disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of recurrent VAP, and current sputum cultures show growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is a common cause of VAP.
2. Fungemia/bacteremia: Blood cultures are positive for yeast and bacteria, indicating ongoing systemic infection.
3. Heart failure: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, and ongoing bilateral pulmonary effusions suggest fluid overload.
4. Atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation, and his blood pressure is labile, possibly due to agitation or pain.
5. Delirium: The patient appears agitated when disturbed and has intermittent eye-opening but does not interact with staff or family. Delirium may be contributing to his overall condition.
6. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient has diabetes, and his blood glucose levels need"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to sepsis from MRSA, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and currently experiencing tracheostomy. The patient has a history of recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. He has been diagnosed with MRSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and yeast infections. The patient is on multiple antibiotics and antifungals, including vancomycin, caspofungin, and meropenem. His current condition includes respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, pain/mental status changes, heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, Clostridium difficile infection, and diastolic congestive heart failure with global depression of left ventricular ejection fraction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has had recurrent episodes of VAP, which is a serious complication associated with mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's condition started with sepsis due to MRSA and later progressed to Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia and fungemia. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Fungemia: The presence of yeast in the blood indicates fungemia, which can cause systemic infection and may require antifungal treatment.
4. Heart failure: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with influenza, MRSA pneumonia, tracheostomy, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and fungemia. The patient's medical history includes a PICC line insertion and removal, positive sputum culture for Klebsiella, and negative opthalmic fungal infection evaluation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.6Â°C (99.7Â°F), heart rate 101 bpm (normal range 71-101 bpm), blood pressure 139/60 mmHg (normal range 95/46-160/103 mmHg), respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute (normal range 12-27 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation 100%, and atrial fibrillation rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,272 mL and output of 1,477 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 795 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST, set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, set respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 12 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI)"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of influenza, MRSA pneumonia, tracheostomy, likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and fungemia. He has been in the ICU and requires respiratory support. The patient has multiple comorbidities including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, requiring mechanical ventilation. He has likely VAP, which is a common complication in patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Enterococcal Bacteremia: The patient has enterococcal bacteremia, which may have originated from his recent pneumonia or other sources. He is being treated with vancomycin, an appropriate antibiotic for MRSA.

3. Klebsiella VAP: The patient also has Klebsiella VAP, for which he is receiving meropenem, an effective antibiotic against this organism.

4. Fungal Infection: The patient has fungemia, likely due to Candida species. He is being treated with caspofungin, an antifungal medication.

5. Heart Failure: The patient's recent systolic heart failure is presumed to be related to his influenza infection. Digoxin has been started for management of atrial fibrillation.

6. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease requires careful monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to sepsis from MRSA, then complicated by Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a history of recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. Current medications include linezolid, caspofungin, meropenem, lasix, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and olanzapine. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 179/82 mmHg and heart rate of 100 bpm. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on 50% FiO2. The patient has diffuse patchy opacifications of both lungs with bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and elevated lactate levels. The patient is expected to have further evaluation and management for the identified medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has recurrent VAP, which is a common complication in patients on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. Treatment includes appropriate antibiotic therapy and weaning off the ventilator if possible.
2. Fungemia/Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures for yeast and VRE, indicating a systemic fungal and bacterial infection. The patient is already receiving antifungal (caspofungin) and antibiotic ("

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, sepsis from MRSA, and subsequent Klebsiella pneumoniae ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been diagnosed with recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. The patient's current condition includes bilateral pulmonary effusions, weak respiratory muscles due to post-polio syndrome and deconditioning, atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, anemia of chronic disease, and heart failure with a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. The patient is also diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus, Clostridium difficile colitis, and delirium. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) order in place and is currently receiving treatment for his multiple infections, including linezolid, caspofungin, and meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation due to recurrent VAP and weak respiratory muscles.
2. Development of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO) such as VRE and yeast, contributing to bacteremia and fungemia.
3. Persistent bilateral pulmonary effusions due to heart failure and underlying chronic conditions.
4. Agitation and delirium secondary to multiple infections and encephalopathy.
5. Potential complications related to atrial fibrillation, including labile blood pressure and the risk of thromboembolic events.

","The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of influenza, MRSA pneumonia, now tracheostomized with likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fungemia. The patient is unable to tolerate weaning from the ventilator due to respiratory failure and requires further treatment for VAP before considering further weaning. The patient is also on treatment for Enterococcal bacteremia identified as Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Klebsiella VAP, and fungal infection. The patient's fluid status is being monitored closely with a goal of 500cc for fluid intake. Medications include digoxin for atrial fibrillation and vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection prophylaxis. The patient is also being managed for heart failure, which is presumed to be related to influenza. The patient has been placed on a pulmonary nutrition formula and is being monitored for glycemic control. Prophylactic measures include a PICC line for medication administration, deep vein thrombosis prevention, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with influenza, MRSA pneumonia, tracheostomy likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and fungemia. 

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics for his infections, including vancomycin, linezolid, meropenem, and caspofungin. He is also on heparin for prophylaxis, morphine sulfate for pain management, and other medications for various conditions.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6Â°C (97.8Â°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/54 mmHg to 217/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is intubated.

The patient's laboratory results indicate low white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine, and low potassium levels. The imaging shows large bilateral layering effusions.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, VAP, fungemia, possible heart failure related to influenza, and enteral nutrition issues. 

In summary, the patient is an elderly male with multiple comorbidities, including respiratory failure, VAP, fungemia, and potential heart failure. He is receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment and supportive care in the ICU."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and now s/p tracheostomy. The patient has recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has bilateral pulmonary effusions and weak respiratory muscles from post-polio syndrome and deconditioning. This increases the risk of respiratory failure.

2. Infections: The patient has been diagnosed with multiple infections, including MRSA, Klebsiella VAP, Enterococcus bacteremia, and fungal infection. These infections may lead to further complications and require appropriate antibiotic and antifungal treatment.

3. Fungemia/Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures are positive for VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) and yeast, indicating ongoing bacteremia/fungemia. This increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock.

4. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and globally depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30%. The presence of bilateral pulmonary effusions suggests ongoing heart failure.

5. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which is likely due to multiple factors, including infections, medication"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA, followed by Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and now switched to a tracheostomy. The patient has recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. 

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary effusions and weak respiratory muscles from post-polio syndrome and deconditioning. He is currently on assisted controlled ventilation (AC) due to intolerance to pressure support (PS). Blood cultures are now positive for Enterococcus and fungus, while sputum is positive for Klebsiella, which is consistent with a new VAP.

The patient has been switched from vancomycin to linezolid due to the presence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Caspofungin has been initiated on day 5 for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1656**] and meropenem has been started on day 4 to treat recurrent Klebsiella pneumonia.

The patient's goals include weaning from the ventilator, achieving negative fluid balance, and monitoring the trend of white blood cell count (WBC). The patient's infections are likely contributing to his unimproved mental status (MS) and delirium.

The patient's other medical issues include a drop in hemoglobin (HCT"

","The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of influenza, MRSA pneumonia, and now tracheostomy with Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fungemia. He remains critically ill.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.1Â°C (98.7Â°F), heart rate of 78 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 104/48 mmHg to 179/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator support.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,656 mL and output of 1,555 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,101 mL.

The patient is receiving several medications including antibiotics for VRE bacteremia, Klebsiella VAP, and C. Glabrata fungemia, as well as a tapering course of vancomycin for recurrent C. difficile. He is also on digoxin for atrial fibrillation and receiving tube feeds with Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 45 mL/hour.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 9.9 to 11.6 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with platelet counts ranging from 420 to 467 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 0.7 to 1"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of influenza, MRSA pneumonia, now tracheostomized with Klebsiella VAP and fungemia. He remains critically ill. The patient is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) with occasional apnea episodes, which may be periodic breathing or central sleep apnea. It is planned to switch from mandatory minute ventilation (MMV) to PSV and wean as tolerated. He requires an 8-day course of levofloxacin for his ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient needs improved nutrition before he can tolerate further weaning. He has VRE bacteremia, Klebsiella VAP, and C. glabrata fungemia, all of which are being treated with appropriate antibiotics. He also has recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, for which vancomycin is being tapered. The patient's fluid balance goal is to achieve negative balance. He has atrial fibrillation and is on digoxin. In the ICU, the patient is receiving tube feeds and has a PICC line placed. Prophylactic measures include DVT boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor, and VAP precautions including head of bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status and is expected to remain in the ICU. The total critical care time spent on the patient is 30 minutes"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o M with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA then c/b
   Klebsiella VAP, now s/p Trach on [**2185-4-6**].  Recurrent VAP, bacteremia &
   fungemia.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: bilateral pulm effusions & weak resp muscles
   from post polio syndrome.  Blood Cx from [**4-12**] + for Enterrococcus &
   fungus, Sputum +Klebsiella c/w new VAP. Pt appears to be tolerating
   pressure support with MMV trial, changed to PS 5/5 and tolerating
   well.  Will attempt on trach collar today
   - check ABG and VBG so VBG can be used propotionally to check
   ventillation status
   - Continue Abx currently day [**6-15**] linezolid, Day [**8-15**] Caspofungin, day
   [**9-9**] Meropenem
   - I/O goal negative 500c to 1L, have been unsuccessful in acheiving
   goals w/ lasix bolus and will consider starting gtt
   - will attempt to ween patient to SBT of 5/0 and hopefully transition
   to trach [**Last Name (un) 1696**]
   #Fungemia/bacteremia:  [**4-12**] Blood cultures +VRE and +Yeast.  Sputum
   from [**4-12**] + Klebsiella.  Yeast + urine & sputum.  Pt has been afebrile
   and WBC ct trending down, Blood Cx since [**4-12**] are NGTD on
   Vanc/Caspofungin.  PICC changed out on [**4-15**].  Infections likely
   contributing to unimproved MS & delirium.
   --per ID, day [**6-15**] linezolid, Day [**8-15**] Caspofungin, day [**7-10**] Meropenem
   --per optho, no ophthalmic involvemt with fungemia
   --ECHO-no e/o fungal vegetations
   --f/u urine c/x since repacement of foley to assure that it has cleared
   #Anemia: Pt with underlying anemia of chronic disease, wide hct
   variation seen on daily labs, no acute indication for transfusion
   - guaic all stools (neg currently)
   - continue PPI
   # Atrial Fibrillation with Labile BP: Pt with chronic A.Fib and BP
   continues to be labile
   - continue Metoprolol 100mg TID, ASA 81mg
   - continue Digoxin 0.125mg
   #Pain/MS: appears less agitated today, but still not interacting with
   staff or family. Non-contrast head CT showed e/o small vessel ischemic
   dz, no acute intracran pathology, EEG showed diffuse slowing suggestive
   of encephalopathy, NR rpr, normal Vb12/ammonia, repleted thiamine.
   - continue ABx for bacteremia/fungemia, likely contributing to delirium
   - continue Olanzapine TID, f/u Pain & palliative care recs
   - continue morphine & tylenol standing
   # HEART FAILURE: h/o diastolic CHF but ECHO  from [**4-18**] shows
   significant improvement in LVEF since adm, likely globally depressed EF
   on adm was due to sepsis/cytokine induced injury, now resolved.
   Bilateral effusions still present on CXR
    - will consider starting lasix gtt with goal I/O neg 500cc to 1L
   # DM TYPEII: continue ISS with TF
   # C. Diff: h/o relapsing/recurrent c.diff on a slow taper as outpt.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, sepsis from MRSA, then Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), tracheostomy, recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. The patient has been tolerating pressure support with minimal mechanical ventilation (MMV) trial and has been changed to pressure support 5/5, tolerating well. The patient's ABG and VBG are being monitored to check ventilation status. 

The patient is currently on antibiotics for bacteremia/fungemia, including linezolid, caspofungin, and meropenem. The goal is to achieve negative fluid balance of 500cc to 1L, and Lasix bolus has been unsuccessful so far. 

The patient's infections are likely contributing to unimproved mental status and delirium. Blood cultures have been negative since April 12th, and the PICC line was changed on April 15th. 

Other issues include anemia, atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, pain/motor syndrome, heart failure, diabetes type II, Clostridium difficile infection, and code status as do not resuscitate (DNR)."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to sepsis from MRSA and subsequent Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a history of post-polio syndrome, which has contributed to weak respiratory muscles.

The patient's current condition includes bilateral pulmonary effusions, delirium, anemia of chronic disease, atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, and pain/mini-stroke symptoms. The patient also has a history of heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, Clostridium difficile infection, and previous episodes of relapsing/recurrent C. difficile.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 144/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The patient's neurological status is described as not attentive, not following simple commands, and responding to stimulation.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, there is evidence of elevated D-dimer levels and abnormal liver function tests. Microbiology cultures are pending for urine, blood, and catheter tip-IV wound.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing current antibiotics for MRSA, Klebsiella VAP, and fungal infection. The goal is to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of influenza, MRSA pneumonia, tracheostomy, and Klebsiella VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), currently critically ill. He has been treated for VRE bacteremia, Klebsiella VAP, and C. Glabrata fungemia. The patient also has recurrent C. Difficile infection, for which he is being treated with oral vancomycin. His fluid balance goal is to achieve negative balance. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on digoxin. He is on long-term antibiotics and antifungal therapy. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient remains critically ill and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a need to monitor ABG/VBG and consider a tracheostomy collar trial.
2. Septicemia/fungemia: The patient has multiple antibiotic-resistant infections, including VRE bacteremia, Klebsiella VAP, and C. Glabrata fungemia. Close monitoring and adjustment of the antibiotic regimen will be necessary.
3. Recurrent C. Difficile infection: The patient has recurrent C. Difficile infection, which requires continued treatment with oral vancomycin.
4. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance goal is to achieve negative balance, indicating the need for careful monitoring and management of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure due to sepsis caused by MRSA and subsequently Klebsiella pneumoniae ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been admitted to the ICU for tracheostomy placement on April 6th. The patient has recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. His current condition includes respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary effusions and weak respiratory muscles due to post-polio syndrome. Blood cultures from April 12th were positive for Enterococcus and fungus, while sputum cultures showed Klebsiella, indicating a new VAP. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and a chest X-ray has been ordered for today. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has bilateral pulmonary effusions and weak respiratory muscles, which can lead to further respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has had recurrent VAP, and there is evidence of a new infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae. This increases the risk of worsening respiratory symptoms and potential spread of infection.
3. Fungemia/Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures have been positive for yeast and Enterococcus, indicating an ongoing infection. This can lead to septicemia and organ dysfunction if not treated effectively.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA, followed by Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a history of post-polio syndrome and recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, anemia, heart failure, type II diabetes, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they continue to experience agitation and delirium. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of recurrent VAP, and there is a risk of developing another episode while on mechanical ventilation.
2. Fungemia/Bacteremia: The patient has ongoing bacteremia and fungemia, which can lead to septic shock and organ dysfunction.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has signs of heart failure, including bilateral pulmonic effusions and a history of diastolic congestive heart failure.
4. Type II Diabetes: The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, which increases the risk of infections and complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure secondary to sepsis from MRSA, followed by Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and now with a tracheostomy. The patient has recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. The patient's condition includes bilateral pulmonary effusions, weak respiratory muscles due to post-polio syndrome, anemia of chronic disease, atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure, pain and cognitive impairment, heart failure with improved left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus type II, Clostridium difficile infection, and do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent VAP: The patient has had multiple episodes of VAP, which can lead to further respiratory failure and prolonged ICU stay.
2. Fungemia/Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures for yeast and Enterococcus, indicating ongoing infection and potential sepsis.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, and although his left ventricular ejection fraction has improved, he still has bilateral effusions on chest X-ray.
4. Delirium: The patient's cognitive impairment and agitation may be due to infections, medication side effects, or underlying neurological conditions.
5. Pain Management: The patient continues to have pain and requires ongoing assessment and management for pain control.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure secondary to sepsis caused by MRSA, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and currently suffering from recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. He has been intubated and tracheostomized. His vital signs are stable, but he remains in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent VAP: The patient has a history of recurrent VAP, which increases the risk of further respiratory infections and worsening lung function.
2. Bacteremia and Fungemia: The patient is currently experiencing bacteremia and fungemia, indicating an ongoing systemic infection. This can lead to septic shock and organ dysfunction if not properly managed.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). This places him at risk for fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
4. Anemia: The patient has underlying anemia of chronic disease, which may worsen due to chronic inflammation or ongoing bleeding.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation with labile blood pressure. Agitation and stress can contribute to this condition and increase the risk of thromboembolic events.
6. Pain and Symptom Management: The patient requires ongoing pain and symptom management, including the use of opioids and ant"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to sepsis from MRSA, followed by Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and now has tracheostomy in place. The patient has had recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. The patient failed a tracheostomy collar trial on [4-23] with acute desaturation and profound bradycardia, responding to suctioning and high FiO2. The patient was rested on PS 10/5 overnight, continued to have intermittent bradycardia overnight but sats >95%. The patient continues to have bilateral pulmonary effusions. Blood cultures from [4-12] were positive for Enterococcus and fungus. Sputum from [4-12] was positive for Klebsiella, consistent with new VAP, now completed a course of meropenem. The patient is oxygenating well on minimal settings but has recurrent apneic episodes. 

The patient has a history of labile blood pressure, agitation, and atrial fibrillation difficult to rate control. However, the patient developed bradycardia during a hypoxic episode on [4-22] and had continued intermittent bradycardia overnight, with heart rates in the 40-60s.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA and subsequent Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has undergone tracheostomy and central catheter placement. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: The patient has a temperature of 36.4 C (97.6 F), heart rate of 71 bpm (with episodes of bradycardia), blood pressure ranging from 106/60 to 218/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheostomy mask with CPAP/PSV ventilation.
- Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,254 mL of fluids, including 1,082 mL through the oral route, 962 mL through intravenous fluids, and 299 mL through total parenteral nutrition. The patient has lost a total of 2,650 mL of fluids, including 1,082 mL through urine, 840 mL through blood products, and 389 mL through drains.
- Respiratory support: The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 50%.
- Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count ranges from 8.5 to 11.5 K/uL, hemoglobin levels range from 8.1 to 9.2 g/dL, platelet count ranges from 417 to 436 K/uL, blood glucose levels vary between 57 and 137 mg/dL, sodium levels range from 137 to 145 mg/dL, potassium levels range from 0.8 to 3.8 mEq/L, and creatinine levels range from 0.9 to 1.0 mg/dL.
- Imaging: A recent chest X-ray shows little overall change in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications with substantial left apical capping and tracheostomy and central catheters in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has had multiple episodes of VAP, and there is a risk of further infections.
2. Fungemia/bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures for yeast and Enterococcus, indicating a possible fungal and bacterial bloodstream infection.
3. Heart failure: The patient has evidence of anemia and fluid overload, which can lead to heart failure.
4. Bradycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of profound bradycardia, which may require further investigation and management.
5. Anemia: The patient has underlying anemia of chronic disease, and there may be a"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo man with influenza, MRSA pna, now trached with Klebs VAP,
   fungemia.
   1. Acute Respiratory Failure: now tolerating MMV but not trach collar.
   Has prolonged apneas, likely central.
   - will need 8 day course of [**Last Name (un) 430**] for his VAP. Keep even to negative
   balance if possible. Would d/c lasix drip.
   - appears to have a resolving myopathy.
   - consider in-line PMV for speech but likely won't tolerate it.
   2. Septicemia/Fungemia
   VRE bacteremia: on linezolid day [**9-15**], klebsiella VAP: on meropenem d
   [**9-9**], C Glabrata fungemia: on caspofungin day [**11-15**]
   3. Recurrent C.Diff: po vanco taper
   4. FEN: d/c lasix drip, K to be repleted.
   5. AF: Digoxin, metoprolol but SVR today. Will d/c dig, check level and
   decrease metoprolol.
   6. Pain control: morphine dose cut in half yesterday. continue as is
   for now with prn.
   Family meeting yesterday. I was present along with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 566**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 567**], [**Name (NI) 39**]
   [**Name (NI) 40**], wife, [**Name (NI) 1367**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1751**] [**Name (NI) 1020**]. Family is considering plan
   of 'no escalation' of care. They are considering discharge with vent to
   home with 24 hr care vs self-pay at facility.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of influenza, MRSA pneumonia, now tracheostomized with Klebsiella VAP and fungemia. The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, tolerating mechanical ventilation but desaturating and becoming bradycardic when removing the tracheostomy collar. The patient also has septicemia/fungemia, recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, and pain control issues.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of Klebsiella VAP, which requires an 8-day course of antibiotics. The patient's tolerance of the tracheostomy collar should be closely monitored to prevent further respiratory issues.

2. Fungal infection: The patient has fungemia caused by Candida glabrata. Treatment with caspofungin is ongoing.

3. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has recurrent C. difficile infection, requiring a vancomycin taper.

4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium levels are low, indicating a need for potassium repletion.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and digoxin and metoprolol have been prescribed. However, the patient's heart rate is stable, so further adjustment of medication may be necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA and subsequent Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been tracheostomized on 04/06/2022. The patient has had recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, anemia, heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, Clostridium difficile infection, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has failed a trial of extubation with acute desaturation and profound bradycardia. He continues to have intermittent bradycardia and bilateral pulmonary effusions. This indicates a high risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. Recurrent VAP: Despite completing a course of meropenem, the patient has a new episode of VAP caused by Klebsiella. This increases the risk of further respiratory complications and potential sepsis.
3. Fungemia/Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and yeast. He also has positive sputum cultures for Klebsiella. This indicates a high risk for ongoing bacteremia and fungemia.
4. Anemia: The patient has an underlying anemia of chronic disease with wide hematocrit variation seen on daily labs. This suggests the"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure secondary to sepsis from MRSA, followed by Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been mechanically ventilated since April 6th and has experienced recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and intermittent bradycardia. The patient is being treated with antibiotics and antifungal medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent VAP: The patient has had multiple episodes of VAP, which can be a complication in mechanically ventilated patients. It is important to continue aggressive pulmonary hygiene measures and consider changes in antibiotic therapy if necessary.
2. Fungemia/bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures for Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and yeast, indicating an ongoing infection. The current treatment with linezolid and caspofungin should be continued, and repeat blood cultures should be monitored.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has experienced intermittent bradycardia, which can be a side effect of certain medications or a complication of sepsis. Close monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of medications may be necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient has an underlying anemia of chronic disease. Transfusion may not be indicated unless there is significant symptomatic anemia.

   85 yo man with influenza, MRSA pna, now trached with Klebs VAP,
   fungemia.
   1. Acute respiratory failure: now tolerating MMV but not trach collar.
   Has prolonged apneas, likely central.
   - will need 8 day course of [**Last Name (un) 430**] for his VAP. Keep even to negative
   balance if possible. Would d/c lasix drip.
   - appears to have a resolving myopathy.
   - consider in-line PMV for speech but likely won't tolerate it.
   2. Septicemia/Fungemia
   VRE bacteremia: on linezolid day [**10-16**]
   C Glabrata fungemia: on caspofungin day [**12-16**].
   Recent non-ESBL klebsiella VAP: completed course of meropenem on [**4-23**]
   3. Recurrent C.Diff: po vanco taper
   4. FEN: d/c lasix drip, K to be repleted. on tube feeds
   5. AF: Digoxin, metoprolol but SVR today. Will d/c dig, check level and
   decrease metoprolol.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of influenza, MRSA pneumonia, now tracheostomized with Klebsiella VAP and fungemia. He is experiencing acute respiratory failure, tolerating MMV but not the tracheal collar, with prolonged apneas likely central. He has a resolving myopathy and is being considered for in-line PMV for speech but may not tolerate it. The patient has VRE bacteremia on linezolid, C Glabrata fungemia on caspofungin, recent non-ESBL klebsiella VAP completed with meropenem, recurrent C. Diff, and FEN. He is also dealing with atrial fibrillation, for which he is on digoxin and metoprolol but has a high systolic blood pressure today. His pain control has been reduced, and the family is considering the plan of 'no escalation' of care, with options of discharge with vent to home with 24-hour care or self-pay at the facility. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, PICC line placement, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and VAP prevention measures. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he is currently in the ICU.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with respiratory failure following influenza, in the setting of multiple chronic debilitating conditions. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, which may lead to further deterioration in lung function and oxygenation.

2. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient has an irregular heart rhythm, which can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.

3. Anemia: The patient has low hemoglobin levels, indicating a decreased ability of the blood to carry oxygen. This may result in fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.

4. Bacterial pneumonia (CAP): The patient may develop a secondary bacterial infection in the lungs, leading to worsening respiratory symptoms and increased risk of sepsis.

5. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type II: The patient's blood sugar levels need to be closely monitored to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, both of which can have serious consequences.

6. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient is at risk of developing a UTI, which can lead to symptoms such as frequent urination, urgency, and discomfort.

7. Heart failure (CHF), systolic and diastolic: The patient has acute and chronic heart failure, which can result in fluid accumulation in the lungs, causing shortness of breath and coughing.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is an 85-year-old man with respiratory failure following influenza.
- He has multiple chronic debilitating conditions and has undergone tracheostomy.
- He is currently experiencing Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fungemia.
- The patient's respiratory failure is not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- He is being treated with meropenem for VAP and caspofungin for C. Glabrata fungemia.
- The patient also has recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure.
- His myopathy appears to be improving.
- The patient's family is considering the plan of ""no escalation"" of care and is weighing the option of discharging him with a ventilator to home with 24-hour care or self-paying at the facility.
- The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR).
- The patient remains critically ill. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already critical, and it may further deteriorate if not managed properly.
2. Infection spread: With the presence of Klebsiella VAP and fungemia, there is a risk of the infection spreading to other parts of the body.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has multiple chronic debilitating conditions, including atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA and subsequently Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has undergone a tracheostomy on 4/6 and has had recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. 

The patient failed a tracheal collar trial on 4/23 with acute desaturation and profound bradycardia, responding to suctioning and high FiO2. The patient continues to have bilateral pulmonic effusions, slightly worsened this morning, with approximately 1L positive yesterday. The patient is off the Lasix drip.

Blood cultures from 4/12 were positive for Enterococcus and fungus. Sputum from 4/12 was positive for Klebsiella, which corresponds to a new VAP. The patient has completed a course of Meropenem.

The patient is oxygenating well on minimal settings but has recurrent apneic episodes. Lasix gtt has been discontinued, and the patient will transition to IV bolus to maintain fluid intake of 500-1000cc. Lasix 40mg IV bid will be started.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA and subsequent Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has undergone tracheostomy and has recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. The patient's current condition includes bilateral pulmonary effusions, positive fluid balance, and apneic episodes. The patient is on minimal settings of respiratory support and is oxygenating well. Antibiotics have been adjusted based on blood cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to recurrent VAP and apneic episodes.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance, indicating fluid overload, which can lead to congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema.
3. Bacteremia/Fungemia: The patient has a history of bacteremia and fungemia, which can lead to septicemia and further complications.
4. Anemia: The patient has an underlying anemia of chronic disease, and daily labs show wide hct variation. Acute indication for transfusion is not evident.
5. Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of heart failure with global depression of left ventricular ejection fraction due to sepsis/cytokine-induced injury. Bilateral effusions are present on chest X-ray, indicating ongoing heart failure.
6. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient requires ongoing insulin therapy for diabetes"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to sepsis from MRSA, followed by Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a history of recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. Currently, the patient is unresponsive and intolerant of extubation. He has bilateral pulmonary edema and is receiving diuretic therapy with Lasix. The patient also has a history of heart failure with a globally depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, but this has resolved on repeat echocardiogram. He continues to have bilateral pleural effusions. Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus type II, anemia of chronic disease, and chronic pain management. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics for various infections, including linezolid, caspofungin, and meropenem. He is currently on a regimen of linezolid and caspofungin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current unresponsiveness and intolerance of extubation indicate ongoing respiratory failure. There is a potential risk of further deterioration and the need for continued mechanical ventilation support.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has had recurrent episodes of VAP caused by Klebsiella species. There is a potential risk of developing another episode of VAP, which can lead to worsening respiratory function and increased morbidity and mortality.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure due to sepsis from MRSA, followed by Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been experiencing recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation (MMV) with a decreased FiO2 from 50% to 40%. The patient also has bilateral pulmonary edema and is being treated with Lasix to reduce fluid overload. 

The patient's blood cultures showed positive for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and yeast. The sputum culture from April 12th was positive for Klebsiella. The patient's urine culture from April 21st showed no growth. 

The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, with readings up to 170 and lows in the 120s. No changes have been made to the current medications, but an attempt is being made to maintain higher blood pressure levels to support hemodialysis (HD). 

The patient has an underlying anemia of chronic disease, with wide HCT variation seen on daily labs. There is no acute indication for transfusion at this time. 

The patient's pain management plan includes Olanzapine TID and Morphine 15mg q8hrs with breakthrough dosing q3hr as needed. 

The patient's heart failure is attributed to sepsis/cytokine-induced injury, which has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure following influenza. He has multiple chronic debilitating conditions and has undergone tracheostomy (trach) with Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fungemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. It is essential to continue monitoring and managing his respiratory status closely.

2. Sepsis/Fungemia: The patient has been diagnosed with VRE bacteremia and C. Glabrata fungemia. He is already on appropriate antibiotic therapy with linezolid for VRE bacteremia and caspofungin for C. Glabrata fungemia. Close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to ensure adequate response to treatment.

3. Recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff): The patient has a history of recurrent C. diff infection, and he is currently on vancomycin. It is crucial to monitor for any signs or symptoms of C. diff recurrence, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, or fever.

4. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has chronic AF, which is adequately controlled with digoxin and metoprolol. Regular monitoring of his heart rhythm and electrolyte levels is important to maintain the stability of his cardiac status.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, MRSA sepsis, Klebsiella VAP, and now VRE bacteremia. He has severe myopathy and is currently on caspofungin. The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial and is on CPAP, now switched to pressure support with mandatory minute volume (MMV). Furosemide was increased to 60 mg IV TID but failed to meet the I/O goal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to failed spontaneous breathing trial and the need for mechanical ventilation support. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Volume Overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating volume overload. This can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiac dysfunction.

3. Myopathy: The patient has severe myopathy, which may impair his ability to wean off mechanical ventilation and increase the risk of respiratory failure.

4. Fungemia/Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures for VRE/yeast, sputum positive for Klebsiella/yeast, and urine positive for yeast. This indicates ongoing infection, and there is a risk of spreading the infection or developing septic shock.

5. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient has atrial fibrillation and an irregular rhythm. There is a risk of embolic events or worsening cardiac function.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y/o M with respiratory failure [**3-5**] to sepsis from MRSA then c/b
   Klebsiella VAP, now s/p Trach on [**2185-4-6**].  Recurrent VAP, bacteremia &
   fungemia.
    # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt tolerating MMV with FiO2 decreased yesterday
   from 50% to 40%.  Oxygenating well.
   Contributing factors: 1) volume overload 2) deconditioning 3) VAP
   Volume: Pt continues to have bilateral pulm edema, worse on CXR
   yesterday. With Lasix 40mg IV bid, approx 350cc negative, however
   already +200cc since midnight.
   VAP
 Klebsiella PNA: completed a course of Meropenem on [**4-23**].
   - trial off of PS/PEEP, maintain on vent with backup for prolonged
   apnea. If not maintaining pressures or pulling adequate TV will resume
   MMV as before
   - increase Lasix to 40mg IV tid with goal -500cc-1L negative
   - Cont. MMV with PEEP 5 today, hold off on weaning
   - Continue Abx currently day [**12-16**] linezolid, Day 13/14 Caspofungin
   #Fungemia/bacteremia:  [**4-12**] Blood cultures +VRE and +Yeast.  Sputum
   from [**4-12**] + Klebsiella.  Yeast + urine & sputum.  Repeat Blood Cx since
   [**4-12**] are NGTD on current regimen. PICC changed out on [**4-15**]. Per Optho,
   no e/o fungal ocular involvment, echo showed no e/o vegetations
   - per ID, day [**12-16**] linezolid, Day 13/14 Caspofungin, completed [**9-9**] of
   Meropenem on [**4-23**]
   - urine culture from [**4-21**] no growth
   # CV: BP fluctuates with brief periods up to 170, with lows in 120s. No
   change today to current meds, try to maintain BP on higher side to
   support HD.
   - Metoprolol to 25mg TID
   - continue ASA 81mg
   #Anemia: Pt with underlying anemia of chronic disease, wide HCT
   variation seen on daily labs, no acute indication for transfusion
   - guaiac all stools (neg currently)
   -no GI bleed H2 blocker for PPx
   - recheck HCT in am, if <23 would consider transfusing 1u pRBCs
    #Pain/MS: much improved, pt more interactive this am, responding to
   questions by nodding etc
   - continue Olanzapine TID
   - continue standing regimen of Morphine 15mg q8hrs with breakthrough
   q3hr prn (hold for sedation)
    # HEART FAILURE: LV was globally depressed EF on adm was due to
   sepsis/cytokine induced injury, resolved on repeat ECHO [**4-18**], no e/o
   vegetations. Bilateral effusions still present on CXR, slightly worse.
   - diuresis as above
    # DM TYPEII: continue ISS with TF
    # C. Diff: h/o relapsing/recurrent c.diff on a slow taper as outpt.
   - continued Vanc taper 125mg TID for 2wks, [**Month (only) 38**] to 125mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**4-27**] for
   2wks, then qdaily for 2wks.
   # Hypernatremia: Increase free water flushes in feeding tube.
   Calculated deficit 2L with Na of 148 O/N, improved this am to 145.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to sepsis from MRSA, followed by Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and subsequent tracheostomy. The patient has a history of recurrent VAP, bacteremia, and fungemia. 

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a decreased FiO2 from 50% to 40%. Oxygenation is well maintained. Contributing factors include volume overload, deconditioning, and VAP. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation with a backup for prolonged apnea. If not maintaining pressures or pulling adequate tidal volume, resume mandatory minute volume (MMV) as before.

2. Volume Overload: The patient continues to have bilateral pulmonary edema, worse on chest X-ray yesterday. With Lasix 40mg IV bid, approximately 350cc negative, however, already +200cc since midnight. The goal is to maintain negative fluid balance of -500cc-1L.

3. VAP: The patient has completed a course of Meropenem for Klebsiella PNA. The plan is to trial off of PS/PEEP, maintain on vent with backup for prolonged apnea. If not maintaining pressures or pulling adequate TV, resume MMV as before. Continue MMV with PEEP 5 today,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure due to MRSA sepsis, Klebsiella VAP, and VRE bacteremia. He is currently on caspofungin for severe myopathy. The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial and is now on CPAP, with subsequent progression to pressure support with mandatory minute volume (MMV). Furosemide was increased to 60 mg IV TID, but the patient still did not meet the I/O goal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and failure of spontaneous breathing trial indicate a potential risk for continued respiratory distress or failure.
2. Volume overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance, which suggests the possibility of volume overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory status.
3. Myopathy: The patient is experiencing severe myopathy as a side effect of the caspofungin treatment. This can impair muscle function and potentially affect respiratory effort.
4. Fungemia/Bacteremia: The presence of VRE and yeast in the blood cultures indicates ongoing fungemia/bacteremia. If left untreated, this can lead to further systemic infection and sepsis.
5. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient is being treated for C. diff with an outpatient regimen and vancomycin. If not managed appropriately, C. diff can cause severe colitis and gastrointestinal complications.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure due to MRSA sepsis and Klebsiella VAP. He has undergone multiple interventions including tracheostomy, central line placement, and administration of various antibiotics. The patient is currently on furosemide diuresis to manage volume overload and is being treated for VRE bacteremia, C. Glabrata fungemia, and ICU myopathy. He has stable cardiovascular status with atrial fibrillation and is on metoprolol, continues furosemide diuresis, and takes ASA for ischemia risk. The patient also has stable Clostridium difficile infection, anemia, pain management, diabetes mellitus type 2, and is dispositioned to rehabilitation pending family meeting.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's previous episodes of respiratory failure indicate a high risk of recurrence, especially considering his ongoing respiratory support and volume overload.
2. Volume Overload: The patient's current management includes furosemide diuresis to achieve a negative fluid balance. If not effectively managed, it can lead to further respiratory compromise.
3. ICU Myopathy: The patient's severely contracted ICU myopathy may impact his ability to wean off mechanical ventilation and potentially delay his recovery.
4. Fungemia/Bacteremia: The patient's positive blood cultures for VRE/yeast, sputum positive for Klebsiella/ye"

s wife and son [**Name (NI) 1367**] today.  Reviewed Mr. [**Known lastname 1020**]
   course:  I have seen him three times, spaced apart by weeks to months.
   He is clearly dwindling.  We confirmed that they would not pursue
   resumption of vasopressors if shock recurred.  They are considering the
   idea that he does not have to be reconnected to the ventilator if
   problems develop, and state that in fact he would tell us not to do
   it.  However, they do not wish to pursue that limit at present.
   We will begin to arrange teaching and home services, with a plan for
   discharge (likely with hospice, per family
s wishes) mid-to-late next
   week.

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure following influenza, in the setting of multiple chronic debilitating conditions. He has undergone tracheostomy and is currently experiencing Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fungemia, both of which are nearing the end of their treatment courses.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which may worsen if the underlying causes are not effectively managed. This could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has a history of recurrent C. diff infection, which increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as diarrhea and colitis.

3. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which may contribute to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue perfusion.

4. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient has adequately controlled type II diabetes, but fluctuations in blood glucose levels can occur due to stress and illness. This may require adjustments in insulin therapy.

5. Heart failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic heart failure, both systolic and diastolic. Cardiac function should be closely monitored, and fluid balance must be managed carefully to prevent exacerbations of heart failure.

6. Infection control: Given the patient's recent infections (Klebsiella VAP and fungemia), there is a risk of developing new infections or"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure following influenza. The patient has multiple chronic debilitating conditions and has undergone tracheostomy (trach) with Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fungemia, both of which are nearing the end of their treatment courses.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. It may be related to the recent VAP and previous myopathy.

2. Sepsis/Fungemia: The patient had VRE bacteremia and C. glabrata fungemia, both of which are being treated with appropriate antibiotics. Once the treatment courses are completed, there is a risk of relapse or development of drug-resistant infections.

3. Recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff): The patient has a history of recurrent C. diff infections, and it is important to monitor for symptoms and prevent further episodes.

4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has adequately controlled AFib, but it is essential to monitor the heart rhythm and adjust treatment as needed.

5. Chronic Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which appears to be stable. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels and appropriate management are necessary.

6. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type II: The patient's diabetes is adequately controlled, and it is crucial to maintain glyc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic anemia, type II diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, heart failure (both systolic and diastolic), and pneumonia. The patient is currently being treated in the ICU and is on various medications including caspofungin, tracheal collar, ranitidine, heparin sodium, furosemide, and digoxin. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but they show signs of atrial fibrillation. The patient's lab results indicate abnormalities in kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated levels of D-dimer.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is abnormal, and if left untreated, it can lead to further complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory symptoms and increase the risk of secondary infections.
4. Heart failure: Both systolic and diastolic heart failure are present, and acute exacerbations may occur due to underlying conditions or infections.
5. Myocardial infarction: Although not explicitly stated, the patient's cardiac history and symptoms could increase the risk of a myocardial infarction (heart"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, MRSA sepsis, and Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has undergone percutaneous tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has VRE bacteremia, which has been treated with linezolid, and C. Glabrata fungemia, which has been treated with caspofungin. He has a severely contracted ICU myopathy. The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, volume overload, fungemia/bacteremia, mental status changes, cardiovascular stability, Clostridium difficile infection, anemia, pain management, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient's disposition is pending a family meeting at a rehabilitation hospital.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate further due to his underlying conditions and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Volume overload: The patient may continue to experience fluid overload, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory function.
3. Fungemia/bacteremia: There is a risk of recurrence or development of new infections, particularly with resistant organisms like VRE and yeast.
4. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status may continue to decline or remain stable, potentially impacting his ability to communicate and respond to commands.
5. Cardiovascular stability: The patient's cardiovascular system may experience further strain, especially"

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, MRSA sepsis, Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), tracheostomy, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. The patient has been in the ICU for approximately 3-5 weeks and has completed courses of meropenem, linezolid, and caspofungin. The patient's current condition includes volume overload, fungemia/bacteremia, mental status changes, cardiovascular stability, Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) infection, anemia, pain management, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and the current disposition is rehabilitation at another hospital.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Pulmonary complications: The patient has a history of VAP and ongoing consolidation in the right lower lobe. There is also evidence of bilateral pleural effusion, which could lead to further respiratory issues.

2. Infection-related complications: The patient has had multiple infections, including MRSA sepsis, VRE bacteremia, and C. Diff infection. These infections can complicate the patient's clinical course and may require additional treatment or interventions.

3. Cardiovascular complications: Although the patient's cardiovascular status is currently stable, the presence of atrial fibrillation"

 DISPOSITION
   If he continues to tolerate spontaneous breathing, would consider
   calling out to the floor in the next day or two.  His family wishes to
   take him home, but will need substantial training even if he remains
   off the ventilator.

   DNR.  Per family
s instructions, we would not treat major
   decompensations such as the development of shock (see family meeting
   note from yesterday).  They would want to reconnect  to ventilator if
   needed.  Appreciate social work, case management, and palliative care
   assistance.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure following influenza, in the setting of multiple chronic debilitating conditions. He has undergone tracheostomy and is now on mechanical ventilation due to Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fungemia, both of which are nearing the end of their treatment courses.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may be multifactorial and could be due to recent VAP treatment.
2. Sepsis/Fungemia: The patient had VRE bacteremia and C. Glabrata fungemia, both of which are currently being treated.
3. Recurrent Clostridium Difficile Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent C. Diff infection and is being treated with oral vancomycin taper.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has adequately controlled atrial fibrillation.
5. Chronic Anemia: The patient has stable chronic anemia.
6. Type II Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes is adequately controlled.
7. Acute and Chronic Heart Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure.
8. Disposition: The family wishes to take the patient home, but substantial training will be required even if he remains off the ventilator. The patient's code status is DNR.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of chronic conditions including respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, pneumonia, type II diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, and acute and chronic heart failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for management of acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 109/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on tracheal mask ventilation. The patient has been off the ventilator all day with a splint on his arms. The patient has received various medications including ranitidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis and regular insulin for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's history of community-acquired pneumonia suggests a possible ongoing infection in the lungs. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially develop into sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's history of both systolic and diastolic heart failure increases the risk of fluid overload and cardiac complications. Close monitoring of fluid balance and cardiac function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Diabetes Complications: The patient's type II diabetes mellitus puts him at risk for hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels and appropriate"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male who has a history of respiratory failure due to MRSA sepsis. He has undergone multiple treatments for various infections, including Klebsiella VAP, VRE bacteremia, and C. Glabrata fungemia. The patient is also suffering from severely contracted ICU myopathy. Currently, he is on a tracheostomy and breathing spontaneously with the help of a tracheal collar. His vital signs are relatively stable, but there are concerns regarding his fluid status, potential infection, and other medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation, anemia, pain management, diabetes mellitus type 2, and DNR status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dehydration: The patient's fluid status is concerning due to the increasing levels of creatinine and all CBC lines. It is important to address this issue by adjusting the diuretic dosage and ensuring appropriate fluid balance.

2. Infection: The elevated WBC count suggests a possible infection. Further investigations, such as a differential WBC count, blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine cultures, are recommended to identify the source of infection and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has a history of recent antibiotic use, which increases the risk of C. diff infection. Restarting the vancomycin taper is an appropriate step in managing this condition.

4. Respiratory status: Although the"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with respiratory failure following influenza, in the setting of multiple chronic debilitating conditions. He has been intubated and mechanically ventilated due to severe respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fungemia, both of which are nearing the end of their treatment courses. His leukocyte count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. He has improved from being on mechanical ventilation and is now extubated and talking on partial mandatory ventilation (PMV). The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1Â°C, blood pressure ranging from 121/51 to 158/122 mmHg, heart rate between 92 and 106 bpm, respiratory rate between 16 and 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is adequately controlled. He has several chronic conditions, including anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and heart failure, which are all stable. The patient's family wishes to take him home, but he will require substantial training even if he remains off the ventilator. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and the family has agreed to reconnect him to the ventilator if needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and current condition indicate a potential risk of recurrent respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and remains off ventilator, talking on partial mandatory ventilation (PMV). The patient has allergies to Bactrim (oral) and Remeron (oral). The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin at 08:00 AM. The patient is receiving various infusions and medications, including ranitidine for prophylaxis and other ICU medications. The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, are unchanged from admission except where noted.

Vital signs include a temperature range of 35.7-36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 92 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 121/51 to 158/122 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on tracheal mask with SpO2 of 98%. The patient's weight is 57.3 kg, and height is 69 inches. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,846 mL total in, including 842 mL PO, 1,081 mL TF, and 75 mL IVF. Output includes 1,950 mL total out, consisting of 1,100 mL urine, -104 mL drain balance, and -258 mL drain balance.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on PMV with SpO2 of 98% and ABG results of ///31/. Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, movement, tone, and other parameters. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal range, but glucose levels are variable. Other lab results show elevated D-dimer, lactic acid, LDH, and normal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters.
2. Infection: The elevated WBC count and D-dimer levels suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection or inflammation, which needs further investigation and appropriate antibiotic treatment if necessary.
3. Thromboembolic events: The use of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis indicates a concern for thromboembolic events, which should be monitored closely, especially in the context of immobilization.
4. Fluid balance: The significant fluid input and output imbalance may require careful monitoring and adjustment to maintain appropriate fluid balance and prevent complications such as fluid overload or dehydration.
5. Glycemic control: The variable glucose levels indicate the need for close monitoring and management to maintain tight glycemic control and prevent both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
6. Renal function: While the creatinine levels are"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure following influenza, in the setting of multiple chronic debilitating conditions. He has undergone tracheostomy and is currently being treated for Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fungemia, both of which are nearing the end of their treatment courses. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, and he is producing increased secretions. His respiratory failure has resolved, and his myopathy is slowly improving. He is now on a tracheal collar, having been taken off the ventilator overnight. He has a history of chronic anemia, type II diabetes mellitus, acute and chronic heart failure, and recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. His atrial fibrillation is adequately controlled. The patient's creatinine level is 1.1, and it is planned to decrease Lasix dosage to three times a day, monitoring intake and output closely. The patient's family wishes to take him home, but substantial training will be required even if he remains off the ventilator. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the family would want to reconnect him to the ventilator if needed. The ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and elevation of the head of bed to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, MRSA sepsis, tracheostomy, linezolid for VRE bacteremia, caspofungin for C. Glabrata fungemia, and severely contracted ICU myopathy. The patient is currently afebrile and has yellowish mucous from tracheostomy and mouth. There is a concern for infection or dehydration, as indicated by elevated white blood cell count. The patient's fluid status shows a rising creatinine level, which may indicate dehydration. The plan includes following up on sputum culture and sensitivity, changing furosemide dosage, aiming for a net even fluid balance, and restarting vancomycin taper. The patient's respiratory status is stable, and he is breathing comfortably on the tracheostomy collar. Cardiovascular status is stable with atrial fibrillation, and the patient is on metoprolol, furosemide, and aspirin. Anemia is stable, and the patient will be transfused for a hemoglobin level below 23. Pain management and diabetes management are also stable. The patient is being discharged home with hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has elevated white blood cell count and yellowish mucous from tracheostomy and mouth, which may suggest an ongoing infection.
2. Dehydration: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, and the rising creat"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure following influenza, multiple chronic debilitating conditions, and recent tracheostomy. He has been diagnosed with Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fungemia, both of which are nearing the end of their treatment courses. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, indicating leukocytosis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36Â°C, blood pressure of 193/158 mmHg, heart rate of 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The levels of creatinine, glucose, and other electrolytes are within normal range.

The patient has been treated for VRE bacteremia with linezolid and C Glabrata fungemia with caspofungin. His recurrent C. Difficile infection is being managed with vancomycin taper. The patient's diabetes, heart failure (both systolic and diastolic), and chronic anemia are all stable.

The patient's family wishes to take him home, but substantial training will be required even if he remains off the ventilator. The patient's code status is DNR, and the family has indicated that they would want to reconnect to the ventilator if needed.

He has been treated for Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fungemia, both of which are at the end of their treatment courses. The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, and he is now off the ventilator but still on a tracheostomy collar.

The patient's myopathy is slowly improving, but he remains dependent on the tracheostomy collar. His chest X-ray shows worsening right lower lobe infiltrate, indicating a possible worsening infection. The patient is being encouraged to engage in pulmonary toilet, including using an exsufflator every two hours and receiving frequent suctioning as needed.

The patient had bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and candidemia caused by Candida glabrata. Both infections are being treated with linezolid and caspofungin, respectively. The patient also has recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which is being treated with a course of vancomycin that will be tapered over several weeks. The patient will be monitored for persistent leukocytosis or diarrhea, which may indicate a need for repeat testing for C. diff.

","The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of multiple chronic debilitating conditions, who presented with respiratory failure following influenza. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation but has since been successfully extubated and is now on a tracheostomy collar.

The patient's recent events include staying off the ventilator, talking with partial mechanical ventilation (PMV), and requiring frequent suctioning in the morning. His allergies include a rash from Bactrim and Remeron, with unknown allergies to other medications. His last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.0Â°C (96.8Â°F)
- Heart rate: 99 bpm (range: 77-110 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 193/158 mmHg (range: 83-112 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute (range: 9-26 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 96%
- Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient's physical examination findings include a cachetic male lying in bed, more difficult to awaken this morning. He has a tracheostomy with condyloma in place, partial mechanical ventilation in use, and a gastric tube. His abdomen is soft with a slightly distended bladder. His extremities show signs of wasting. Neurologically, he is alert and able to answer simple questions and follow commands.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male who has a history of respiratory failure due to MRSA sepsis, s/p meropenem for Klebsiella VAP, tracheostomy (s/p linezolid for VRE bacteremia, s/p caspofungin for C. Glabrata fungemia), and severely contracted ICU myopathy. The patient is currently breathing spontaneously on a tracheostomy collar with decreased secretions. The patient's WBC count is elevated but showing a decreasing trend, and he is afebrile. His fluid status is stable, and he is being given furosemide to manage fluid balance. The patient's contraction myopathy is being managed with physical therapy and occupational therapy. He has stable conditions such as Clostridium difficile, cardiovascular status, anemia, pain management, diabetes mellitus type 2, and disposition to go home with hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's history of respiratory failure and VAP, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening of his current condition.

2. Infection: The patient has a history of multiple infections including MRSA sepsis, Klebsiella VAP, VRE bacteremia, and C. Glabrata fungemia. Therefore, there is a risk of developing new infections or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, MRSA sepsis, tracheostomy, linezolid for VRE bacteremia, and caspofungin for C. Glabrata fungemia. The patient also has severe contracted ICU myopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has elevated white blood cell count, mucous production, and increased CBC lines, which could indicate an ongoing infection. Further evaluation is needed, including sputum culture and sensitivity.

2. Dehydration: The patient's creatinine levels are trending up, and all CBC lines are increased, suggesting possible dehydration. The goal is to achieve a net even fluid balance. The plan includes changing furosemide from 120mg QID to 120mg TID.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient had a previous episode of C. diff, and the vancomycin taper was restarted on [**4-29**]. The original taper plan involved gradually reducing vancomycin dosage over a period of two weeks.

4. Respiratory status: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but ongoing measures for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention and mouth care are necessary.

5. Cardiovascular (CV) status: The patient is stable with atrial fibrillation, managed with metoprolol 25mg TID. Other medications include furo"

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with respiratory failure following influenza, in the setting of multiple chronic debilitating conditions. He has undergone tracheostomy and was diagnosed with Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fungemia, which have since resolved. The patient's respiratory failure has also improved. He is currently on a tracheal collar and is weaned off the ventilator.

The patient has a history of myopathy, which is slowly improving. He has worsening right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, and his secretions need to be managed with pulmonary toilet, including using an exsufflator and performing suctioning as needed. The patient is encouraged to stay out of bed and in a chair.

The patient had VRE bacteremia and C. Glabrata fungemia, both of which have been treated successfully. He also has recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, for which he will be given oral vancomycin tapering over several weeks starting today. If persistent leukocytosis or diarrhea occurs, repeat C. difficile testing will be performed.

The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is adequately controlled.

The patient has chronic anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and acute-on-chronic heart failure with systolic and diastolic dysfunction. His creatinine level is 1.1, and he will decrease Lasix to three times a day while monitoring his intake and output. He should maintain a slightly positive"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, tracheostomy, and multiple comorbidities including MRSA sepsis, Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), linezolid for VRE bacteremia, caspofungin for C. glabrata fungemia, and severely contracted ICU myopathy. The patient is currently breathing spontaneously on a tracheostomy collar with decreased secretions. There is an elevated white blood cell count, which is unclear why, possibly due to atelectasis. The patient's chest X-ray has improved from previous days. Sputum and urine cultures have been ordered. The patient is also experiencing contraction myopathy and will continue with physical therapy and occupational therapy for splinting and stretching. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is stable, and vancomycin taper has been restarted. The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, with a rhythm of atrial fibrillation and controlled blood pressure. The patient has anemia of chronic disease and will be transfused for hemoglobin concentration below 23. Pain management and diabetes management are also being addressed. The patient's disposition is home with hospice care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of Klebsiella VAP. There is a risk of recurrence or development of new VAP due to prolonged intubation and immobility"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, MRSA sepsis, tracheostomy, and multiple infections. The patient has been in the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 131/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a history of myopathy. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and normal creatinine levels. The patient has been receiving various medications for pain, diabetes, and other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient's tracheostomy and previous ventilator-associated infections indicate a higher risk for this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous lines increase the risk of DVT. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin to prevent this complication.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers. The patient's contracture myopathy may further contribute to the risk.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient"
