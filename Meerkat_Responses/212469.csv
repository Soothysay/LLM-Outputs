   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female from [**Hospital3 **] where she had presentation with worsening
   hypoxemia and now has had progression to respiratory failure with
   recurrent hypoxia and lung collapse.  In the recent past patient has
   had SBO and prolonged hosptial course including trach and PEG placement
   and transfer to rehab and has been unable to return to full
   independence since that time.  She had worsening respiratory status and
   bilateral LL and upper lobe opacities and was treated with Levo/Ceftaz
   for possible pneumonia but progressed to hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and transfer to [**Hospital1 19**] for further care.
   1)       RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])-This is a
   significant combination of weakness, deconditioning, inability to clear
   secretions and certainly will require careful optimization prior to any
   attempt at extubation.  With infiltrate, prolonged hospitalizations and
   intubation certainly broad spectrum antibiotics.
   -Will pursue bronchoscopy to evaluate airway patency and obtain
   protected specimen for culture and clear any proximal plugs
   -Will continue with PSV support this am
   -Continue broad spectrum abx-_Vanco/Cefepime
   2)Acute/Chronic Renal Failure-Persistent and modest
   -Will continue dialysis on regular schedule
   -Would like to remove volume if possible at HD given overall anasarca
   3)Anasarca
Has previous ultrasound without clear deep venous thrombosis
   and has poor oncotic pressure contributing.  Will move to negative
   fluid removal as possible.
   4)Thrombocytopenia-HIT has been sent and is pending at this time
   although time course is unusual.
   -Will follow up HIT
   -Would be likely medications and infection
   -Will avoid new heparin products until is negative as possible
   -Will repeat LENI given concern for DVT and move to argatroban if seen
   -In absence of new thrombosis will continue to monitor until HIT Ab
   returns
   4)EKG Changes-Non-specific, no change in CK and discussed with
   cardiology at admission by housestaff
   -ECHO today
   -Follow CK
   -Concern for possible inferior wall insult

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of worsening hypoxemia, respiratory failure, bilateral lung collapse, and an extended hospital course including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anasarca, thrombocytopenia, and EKG changes.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Progressive respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is described as worsening, with recurrent hypoxia and lung collapse. Continuous monitoring and management of the patient's ventilation support will be necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of infiltrates on imaging and the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics suggest a possible infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and adjustment of antibiotic therapy may be required.
3. Chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is described as persistent and modest. Dialysis will need to be continued regularly, and efforts should be made to optimize fluid balance given the patient's anasarca.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of anasarca, which increases the risk of thrombosis. The concern for DVT is further highlighted by the positive Lower Extremity Venous Ultrasound (LENI) and the plan to move to argatroban if a DVT is seen.
5. HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia): The"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with
   respiratory distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
   distal to stent.  Given that OSH CT from [**3-15**] shows bilateral lower lobe
   collapse, concern for malignancy as etiology is low.  Has elevated WBC
   and chronic cough (per daugher) without fever, but suspicious for HAP
   as well.  Reccurent sympotoms in the setting of severe deconditioning
   also raises the possibility of recurrent aspiration.
   - vanco/cefepime to cover HAP
   - sputum culture
   - f/u OSH sputum culture
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - consider bronch in AM
   - review OSH chest CT, but consider re-imaging here
   - f/u glucan & galactomannan
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - taper steroids instituted at OSH
   - increase PEEP
   - clarify pcn allergy with husband
   .
   2.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source of leukocytosis is PNA, however,
   reportedly had yeast in urine.  Was getting amphotericin bladder washes
   at OSH, however, unlikley to be pathogenic.  More likely to be
   secondary to long-term broad spectrum Abx.
   - repeat UA/UCx
   - change foley
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - f/u blood cultures
   - stop amphotericin bladder washes
   .
   3.  Anasarca.  Patient is total body volume overlaoded in setting of
   severe malnutrition (colectomy, poor PO intake).  Getting volume
   removed at dailaysis at rehab.  However, extremities are cool and
   patient has low-normal blood pressure.  Would favor keeping patient
   even at dialysis in setting of infection.
   - nutrition consult
   - tube feeds
   .
   3.  Thrombocytopenia.  Patient has 5 points (2 points for
   thrombocyptopenia, 1 point for timing, 0 for thrombosis, 2 for other
   causes) on the 4Ts scale, but has been on heparin for > 7 months due to
   dialysis.  No history of liver disease.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to infection.
   - check peripheral smear
   - check DIC labs
   - trend platelet count
   - hold heparin products
   - sent HIT
   - f/u OSH hit which is currently pending
   .
   4. ESRD on HD.  Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.
   Gets dialysis MWF.
   - notify renal of patient's arrival
   - nephrocaps
   .
   5. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home.
   - hold antihhypertensives for now and monitor BP overnight; consider
   resuming in AM
   .
   6. HL.  Reportedly has history of hyperlipidemia, though not on any
   lipid lowering medications.
   - confirm med list with [**Hospital 997**] rehab

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe (RLL) lobar collapse. The possible causes of the RLL collapse include tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration with mucous plugging, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight remains unchanged since admission.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 23.6 thousand cells/mm3, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 101 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels of 1.8 mmol/L. Other laboratory values are within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely secondary to the RLL collapse. The initial plan includes sending sputum for culture, following up with an outpatient sputum culture, and considering bronchoscopy in the morning. Antibiotics have been started to cover HAP, and the patient's fever curve and white blood cell count will be monitored.

There is also evidence of leukoc"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with
   respiratory distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
   distal to stent.  Given that OSH CT from [**3-15**] shows bilateral lower lobe
   collapse, concern for malignancy as etiology is low.  Has elevated WBC
   and chronic cough (per daugher) without fever, but suspicious for HAP
   as well.  Recurrent symptoms in the setting of severe deconditioning
   also raises the possibility of recurrent aspiration.
   - vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP
   - fluconzole (D1 [**4-10**]) to cover mold in sputum
   - f/u glucan & galactomannan
   - f/u OSH sputum culture
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - review OSH chest CT, but consider re-imaging here
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - taper steroids instituted at OSH
   .
   2.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source of leukocytosis is PNA, however,
   reportedly had yeast in urine at OSH.  Was getting amphotericin bladder
   washes at OSH, however, unlikley to be pathogenic.  More likely to be
   secondary to long-term broad spectrum Abx.  Urine culture here with no
   growth.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - f/u blood cultures
   - stool for C. diff. given prolonged time on antibiotics
   .
   3. ESRD on HD.  Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.
   Gets dialysis MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - dialysis today [**4-10**]
   - vancomycin with dialysis
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   .
   4.  Anasarca.  Patient is total body volume overlaoded in setting of
   severe malnutrition (colectomy, poor PO intake).  Getting volume
   removed at dailaysis at rehab.  However, extremities are cool and
   patient has low-normal blood pressure.  Would favor keeping patient
   even at dialysis in setting of infection.
   - nutrition consult
   - tube feeds
   .
   5.  Thrombocytopenia.  Patient has 5 points (2 points for
   thrombocyptopenia, 1 point for timing, 0 for thrombosis, 2 for other
   causes) on the 4Ts scale, but has been on heparin for > 7 months due to
   dialysis.  No history of liver disease.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to infection.
   HIT negative here.  DIC labs and peripheral smear negative.
   - trend platelet count
   - hold heparin products
   - f/u OSH HIT test which is currently pending
   .
   6. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home.
   - hold antihhypertensives for now as patient is being dialyzed and
   monitor BP overnight; consider resuming in AM
   .
   7. HL.  Reportedly has history of hyperlipidemia, though not on any
   lipid lowering medications.
   - confirm med list with [**Hospital 997**] rehab

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female from [**Hospital3 **] where she had presentation with worsening
   hypoxemia and now has had progression to respiratory failure with
   recurrent hypoxia and lung collapse.  In the recent past patient has
   had SBO and prolonged hospital course including trach and PEG placement
   and transfer to rehab and has been unable to return to full
   independence since that time.  She had worsening respiratory status and
   bilateral LL and upper lobe opacities and was treated with Levo/Ceftaz
   for possible pneumonia but progressed to hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and transfer to [**Hospital1 19**] for further care.
    1)  Acute respiratory failure - this is a significant combination of
   weakness, deconditioning, inability to clear secretions and agree, she
   will require careful optimization prior to any attempt at extubation.
   On broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - will continue with vent support
   - BAL
 3+ pms, no organisms, mold
   - Vanco/Cefepime
   - B-glucan pending, would start Fluc for mold in BAL
   2) ESKD on HD
   -Will continue dialysis on regular schedule
   -Would like to remove volume if possible at HD given overall anasarca
   3) Anasarca
Has previous ultrasound without clear deep venous
   thrombosis and has poor oncotic pressure contributing (alb 2.5).  Will
   move to negative fluid removal as possible.
   4) Thrombocytopenia
   - HIT Ab negative.
   - Would be likely medications and infection
   - Will avoid new heparin products until is negative as possible

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a history of recurrent episodes of respiratory failure. She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109-124/30-52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is sedated and her neurological status is assessed as sedated.

Physical examination reveals crackles in the left lower lung fields and a few crackles on the right. There are no wheezes or signs of chest pain. The patient's extremities show 1+ edema in both the right and left legs. Her skin is not assessed due to sedation. The patient's weight remains unchanged since admission.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated platelet count. Kidney function tests indicate a decrease in creatinine levels. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and magnesium are within normal range. The patient's blood glucose levels are also within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Acute respiratory failure - The patient requires careful optimization before attempting extubation. She will continue on broad-spectrum antibiotics and mechanical ventilation support.
2) ESKD on HD"

 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
   81 yo female from [**Hospital3 **] where she had presentation with worsening
   hypoxemia and now has had progression to respiratory failure with
   recurrent hypoxia and lung collapse.  In the recent past patient has
   had SBO and prolonged hosptial course including trach and PEG placement
   and transfer to rehab and has been unable to return to full
   independence since that time.  She had worsening respiratory status and
   bilateral LL and upper lobe opacities and was treated with Levo/Ceftaz
   for possible pneumonia but progressed to hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and transfer to [**Hospital1 19**] for further care.
   1)       Acute respiratory failure - This is a significant combination
   of weakness, deconditioning, inability to clear secretions and
   certainly will require careful optimization prior to any attempt at
   extubation.  With infiltrate, prolonged hospitalizations and intubation
   certainly broad spectrum antibiotics.
   -Will pursue bronchoscopy to evaluate airway patency and obtain
   protected specimen for culture and clear any proximal plugs
   -Will continue with PSV support this am
   -Continue broad spectrum abx-_Vanco/Cefepime
   2)Acute/Chronic Renal Failure-Persistent and modest
   -Will continue dialysis on regular schedule
   -Would like to remove volume if possible at HD given overall anasarca
   3) Anasarca
Has previous ultrasound without clear deep venous
   thrombosis and has poor oncotic pressure contributing.  Will move to
   negative fluid removal as possible.
   4) Thrombocytopenia-HIT has been sent and is pending at this time
   although time course is unusual.
   -Will follow up HIT
   -Would be likely medications and infection
   -Will avoid new heparin products until is negative as possible
   -Will repeat LENI given concern for DVT and move to argatroban if seen
   -In absence of new thrombosis will continue to monitor until HIT Ab
   returns
   4)EKG Changes-Non-specific, no change in CK and discussed with
   cardiology at admission by housestaff
   -ECHO today
   -Follow CK
   -Concern for possible inferior wall insult

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who has recurrent episodes of respiratory failure. She has been admitted multiple times, including a recent hospitalization where she developed worsening hypoxemia and progressed to acute respiratory failure. The patient has had a prolonged hospital course with tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible pneumonia but continued to deteriorate and required transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's significant weakness, deconditioning, and inability to clear secretions require careful optimization prior to any attempt at extubation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being pursued, along with bronchoscopy to evaluate airway patency, obtain a protected specimen for culture, and clear any proximal plugs. The patient will continue with pressure support ventilation (PSV) support.

2. Acute/Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has persistent and modest renal failure. Dialysis will be continued on a regular schedule, and efforts will be made to remove volume if possible during hemodialysis, considering the overall anasarca (generalized swelling).

3. Anasarca: The patient has poor oncotic pressure contributing to the anasarca. Negative fluid removal will be moved as possible.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with
   respiratory distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
   distal to stent.  Given that OSH CT from [**3-15**] shows bilateral lower lobe
   collapse, concern for malignancy as etiology is low.  Has elevated WBC
   and chronic cough (per daugher) without fever, but suspicious for HAP
   as well.  Recurrent symptoms in the setting of severe deconditioning
   also raises the possibility of recurrent aspiration.
   - vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP
   - fluconzole (D1 [**4-10**]) to cover mold in sputum

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on dialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress. She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to right lower lobe collapse, which could be caused by tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration with mucous plugging, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress, making it difficult to determine the exact cause. Possible etiologies include TBM, aspiration, or HAP. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and cefepime to cover for HAP, as well as fluconazole to cover for mold in the sputum.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is likely due to a recent pulmonary infection. It is important to follow up with blood cultures and consider the possibility of C. difficile infection given prolonged antibiotic use.

3. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Hemodialysis: The patient has been on dialysis since a recent colectomy and receives dialysis three times a week. Nephrology is following up with the patient's renal issues.

4. Anasarca: The patient is experiencing fluid overload, possibly due to severe malnutrition and poor oral"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with
   respiratory distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
   distal to stent.  Given that OSH CT from [**3-15**] shows bilateral lower lobe
   collapse, concern for malignancy as etiology is low.  Has elevated WBC
   and chronic cough (per daugher) without fever, but suspicious for HAP
   as well.  Recurrent symptoms in the setting of severe deconditioning
   also raises the possibility of recurrent aspiration.
   - vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP
   - fluconzole (D1 [**4-10**]) to cover mold in sputum
   - f/u glucan & galactomannan
   - f/u OSH sputum culture
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - review OSH chest CT, but consider re-imaging here
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - taper steroids instituted at OSH
   .
   2.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source of leukocytosis is PNA, however,
   reportedly had yeast in urine at OSH.  Was getting amphotericin bladder
   washes at OSH, however, unlikley to be pathogenic.  More likely to be
   secondary to long-term broad spectrum Abx.  Urine culture here with no
   growth.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - f/u blood cultures
   - stool for C. diff. given prolonged time on antibiotics
   .
   3. ESRD on HD.  Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.
   Gets dialysis MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - dialysis today [**4-10**]
   - vancomycin with dialysis
   - nephrocaps

   severe malnutrition (colectomy, poor PO intake).  Getting volume
   removed at dailaysis at rehab.  However, extremities are cool and
   patient has low-normal blood pressure.  Would favor keeping patient
   even at dialysis in setting of infection.
   - nutrition consult
   - tube feeds
   .
   5.  Thrombocytopenia.  Patient has 5 points (2 points for
   thrombocyptopenia, 1 point for timing, 0 for thrombosis, 2 for other
   causes) on the 4Ts scale, but has been on heparin for > 7 months due to

   HIT negative here.  DIC labs and peripheral smear negative.
   - trend platelet count
   - hold heparin products
   - f/u OSH HIT test which is currently pending
   .
   6. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home.
   - hold antihhypertensives for now as patient is being dialyzed and
   monitor BP overnight; consider resuming in AM
   .

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress due to right lower lobe lobar collapse. The patient is currently intubated and being treated for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and cefepime. She also has an elevated white blood cell count and chronic cough, which raises suspicion for tuberculosis (TBM) or aspiration pneumonia.

The patient has a history of long-term broad-spectrum antibiotic use, leading to leukocytosis, and her urine culture showed yeast but no growth. She is on dialysis three times a week and has anasarca (generalized swelling) with severe malnutrition. Her extremities are cool, and she has low-normal blood pressure.

The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 121,000/mm³, and the 4Ts scale indicates a score of 5 points. She is on heparin for dialysis, but her HIT test is negative. DIC labs and peripheral smear are negative.

The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia but is not on any lipid-lowering medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure due to recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
2. Leukocytosis most likely secondary to pneumonia or long-term broad-spectrum antibiotic use.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with
   respiratory distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
   distal to stent.  Given that OSH CT from [**3-15**] shows bilateral lower lobe
   collapse, concern for malignancy as etiology is low.  Has elevated WBC
   and chronic cough (per daugher) without fever, but suspicious for HAP
   as well.  Recurrent symptoms in the setting of severe deconditioning
   also raises the possibility of recurrent aspiration.
   - vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP
   - fluconzole (D1 [**4-10**]) to cover mold in sputum
   - f/u glucan & galactomannan
   - f/u OSH sputum culture
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - review OSH chest CT, but consider re-imaging here
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - taper steroids instituted at OSH
   .
   2.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source of leukocytosis is PNA, however,
   reportedly had yeast in urine at OSH.  Was getting amphotericin bladder
   washes at OSH, however, unlikley to be pathogenic.  More likely to be
   secondary to long-term broad spectrum Abx.  Urine culture here with no
   growth. BAL showing 3+ PMNs, but culture with no growth to date.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - f/u blood cultures
   - C. diff neg x 1
   - Check vanc level in AM
   .
   3. ESRD on HD.  Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.
   Gets dialysis MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - vancomycin with dialysis/ check levels
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   .
   4.  Anasarca.  Patient is total body volume overlaoded in setting of
   severe malnutrition (colectomy, poor PO intake).  Getting volume
   removed at dailaysis at rehab.  However, extremities are cool and
   patient has low-normal blood pressure.  Would favor keeping patient
   even at dialysis in setting of infection.
   - nutrition consult
   - tube feeds
   .
   5.  Thrombocytopenia.  Patient has 5 points (2 points for
   thrombocyptopenia, 1 point for timing, 0 for thrombosis, 2 for other
   causes) on the 4Ts scale, but has been on heparin for > 7 months due to
   dialysis.  No history of liver disease.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to infection.
   HIT negative here.  DIC labs and peripheral smear negative.
   - trend platelet count
   - Add back Hep SQ
   .
   6. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home.
   - hold antihhypertensives for now as patient is likely intravascularly
   volume depleted and within normotensive range at this time.
   .
   7. HL.  Reportedly has history of hyperlipidemia, though not on any
   lipid lowering medications.
   - confirm med list with [**Hospital 997**] rehab
   .
   8. RUQ swelling
 check U/S to r/o DVT

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo female from [**Hospital3 **] where she had presentation with worsening
   hypoxemia and now has had progression to respiratory failure with
   recurrent hypoxia and lung collapse.  In the recent past patient has
   had SBO and prolonged hospital course including trach and PEG placement
   and transfer to rehab and has been unable to return to full
   independence since that time.  She had worsening respiratory status and
   bilateral LL and upper lobe opacities and was treated with Levo/Ceftaz
   for possible pneumonia but progressed to hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and transfer to [**Hospital1 19**] for further care. Bronch
d [**4-9**] showed thick
   secretions bilat, patent left sided airways, narrowing of [**Hospital1 **] with
   collapse.
   1)  Acute respiratory failure - this is a significant combination of
   weakness, deconditioning, inability to clear secretions. She will
   require careful optimization prior to any attempt at extubation. On
   broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - will continue with vent support. Trial of PS 0/5 today. Suspect she
   may benefit from another trach. Overall unfavorable prognosis from
   respiratory point of view.
   - BAL
 3+ pms, no organisms, mold
   - Vanco/Cefepime
   - B-glucan pending, on Fluc for mold in BAL
   - taper steroids by 20 mg q2d
   2) ESKD on HD
   -Will continue dialysis on regular schedule with volume removal
   3) Anasarca
Has previous ultrasound without clear deep venous
   thrombosis and has poor oncotic pressure contributing (alb 2.5).  Will
   move to negative fluid removal as possible.
   4) Thrombocytopenia
   - HIT Ab negative. Would add back SCH
   5) Hypertension
 well controlled off BP meds
   6) Leukocytosis

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with worsening hypoxemia and respiratory failure. She has a history of bowel obstruction, prolonged hospitalization, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient's respiratory status deteriorated despite treatment for possible pneumonia, leading to transfer to another hospital.

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, exacerbated by weakness, deconditioning, and inability to clear secretions. She requires careful optimization before any attempt at extubation and will continue on ventilator support. A trial of pressure support (PS) of 0/5 was attempted today. The attending physician suspects that the patient may benefit from another tracheostomy. Overall, the prognosis from a respiratory standpoint is unfavorable.

The patient also has end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring dialysis, anasarca (generalized edema), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), hypertension (well-controlled off BP medications), and leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count). Cultures are pending, and she is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco/Cefepime/Fluc).

The patient's nutritional status is being managed with a pulmonary formula, and glycemic control is maintained through regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has multiple lines in place, including a PICC line and dialysis catheter. Prophylactic measures"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, acute renal failure, bacteremia, and hypotension. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 148/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 40%. The patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for 1.5 hours but had a rise in respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) from 50 to 80. He is back on partial support with PS 8 cmH2O. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungal agents, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. His recent labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and lactate levels, along with abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient has a history of bacteremia and acute renal failure, with ongoing hypotension. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with
   respiratory distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
   distal to stent.  OSH CT from [**3-15**] shows bilateral lower lobe collapse.
   Concern for malignancy as etiology is low.  Has elevated WBC and
   chronic cough (per daugher) without fever, but suspicious for HAP as
   well.  Recurrent symptoms in the setting of severe deconditioning also
   raises the possibility of recurrent aspiration.
   -plan for bronch today or tomorrow to evaluate TBM and potential for
   further intervention
   - vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP
   - fluconzole (D1 [**4-10**]) to cover mold in sputum
   - f/u glucan & galactomannan
   - f/u OSH sputum culture
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - slow taper of steroids instituted at OSH
   .
   #.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source of leukocytosis is PNA, however,
   reportedly had yeast in urine at OSH.  Was getting amphotericin bladder
   washes at OSH, however, unlikley to be pathogenic.  More likely to be
   secondary to long-term broad spectrum Abx.  Urine culture here with no
   growth. BAL showing 3+ PMNs, but culture with no growth to date.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - f/u blood cultures
   - reculture with HD
   - C. diff neg x 1
   - Check vanc level per HD protocol
   .
   #. NSVT/Afib. Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the
   episodes of NSVT coinciding with dialysis.
   - Given 150mg x1 and is now on drip.
   - If ectopy improves, can d/c drip and let patient auto-taper.
   #. ESRD on HD.  Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.
   Gets dialysis MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - vancomycin with dialysis/ check levels
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   .
   #.  Anasarca.  Patient is total body volume overlaoded in setting of
   severe malnutrition (colectomy, poor PO intake).  Getting volume
   removed at dailaysis at rehab.  However, extremities are cool and
   patient has low-normal blood pressure.  Would favor keeping patient
   even at dialysis in setting of infection.
   - nutrition consult
   - tube feeds
   .
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.  Patient has 5 points (2 points for
   thrombocyptopenia, 1 point for timing, 0 for thrombosis, 2 for other
   causes) on the 4Ts scale, but has been on heparin for > 7 months due to
   dialysis.  No history of liver disease.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to infection.
   HIT negative here.  DIC labs and peripheral smear negative.
   - trend platelet count
   - back on Hep SQ
   .
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home.
   - hold antihhypertensives for now and will manage intravascular volume
   with HD.
   .
   #. HL.  Reportedly has history of hyperlipidemia, though not on any
   lipid lowering medications.
   - confirm med list with [**Hospital 997**] rehab

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe (RLL) lobar collapse. The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress, which may lead to further deterioration in lung function and respiratory failure.

2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient is at risk for developing HAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and exposure to hospital environment. The plan includes antibiotics coverage for HAP.

3. Tuberculosis (TBM): The patient reportedly has TBM, but the left-sided lesion is too distal to stent. There is concern for malignancy as the etiology is low. A bronchoscopic evaluation is planned to evaluate TBM and potential for further intervention.

4. Aspiration: Recurrent symptoms in the setting of severe deconditioning raise the possibility of recurrent aspiration. Frequent suctioning and albuterol/atrovent nebs are part of the management plan.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, most likely due to pneumonia. The source of leukocytosis is likely to be pneumonia, but there was also yeast in the urine at the previous facility. Long-term broad-s"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and malnutrition. She was admitted to the ICU for recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe collapse, which may be due to tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration with mucous plugging, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's recurrent lobar collapse and respiratory distress indicate a high risk of ongoing respiratory failure. The underlying cause needs to be addressed promptly.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient is at risk for HAP due to prolonged intubation and exposure to the hospital environment. Antibiotics have been initiated to cover this possibility.
3. Tuberculosis (TBM): The patient reportedly has TBM, but the left-sided lesion is too distal to stent. Monitoring for progression of TBM is essential.
4. Aspiration: Given the patient's severe deconditioning and recurrent symptoms, there is a possibility of recurrent aspiration leading to further respiratory compromise.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has elevated white blood cell counts, likely due to pneumonia, but further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
6. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis: The patient requires ongoing management of her ESRD"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with
   respiratory distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
   distal to stent.  OSH CT from [**3-15**] shows bilateral lower lobe collapse.
   Concern for malignancy as etiology is low.  Has elevated WBC and
   chronic cough (per daugher) without fever, but suspicious for HAP as
   well.  Recurrent symptoms in the setting of severe deconditioning also
   raises the possibility of recurrent aspiration.
   -plan for bronch today or tomorrow to evaluate TBM and potential for
   further intervention
   - vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP
   - fluconzole (D1 [**4-10**]) to cover mold in sputum
   - f/u glucan & galactomannan
   - f/u OSH sputum culture
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - slow taper of steroids instituted at OSH
   .
   #.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source of leukocytosis is PNA, however,
   reportedly had yeast in urine at OSH.  Was getting amphotericin bladder
   washes at OSH, however, unlikley to be pathogenic.  More likely to be
   secondary to long-term broad spectrum Abx.  Urine culture here with no
   growth. BAL showing 3+ PMNs, but culture with no growth to date.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - f/u blood cultures
   - reculture with HD
   - C. diff neg x 1
   - Check vanc level per HD protocol
   .
   #. NSVT/Afib. Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the
   episodes of NSVT coinciding with dialysis.
   - Given 150mg x1 and is now on drip.
   - If ectopy improves, can d/c drip and let patient auto-taper.
   #. ESRD on HD.  Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.
   Gets dialysis MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - vancomycin with dialysis/ check levels
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   .
   #.  Anasarca.  Patient is total body volume overlaoded in setting of
   severe malnutrition (colectomy, poor PO intake).  Getting volume
   removed at dailaysis at rehab.  However, extremities are cool and
   patient has low-normal blood pressure.  Would favor keeping patient
   even at dialysis in setting of infection.
   - nutrition consult
   - tube feeds
   .
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.  Patient has 5 points (2 points for
   thrombocyptopenia, 1 point for timing, 0 for thrombosis, 2 for other
   causes) on the 4Ts scale, but has been on heparin for > 7 months due to
   dialysis.  No history of liver disease.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to infection.
   HIT negative here.  DIC labs and peripheral smear negative.
   - trend platelet count
   - back on Hep SQ
   .
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home.
   - hold antihhypertensives for now and will manage intravascular volume
   with HD.
   .
   #. HL.  Reportedly has history of hyperlipidemia, though not on any
   lipid lowering medications.
   - confirm med list with [**Hospital 997**] rehab
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis, malnutrition, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted with recurrent respiratory distress due to right lower lobe collapse, possibly due to tuberculosis, aspiration pneumonia, or hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse and respiratory distress, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated and on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has swelling in the right upper extremity, and an ultrasound confirmed a DVT in the brachial vein. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding with anticoagulation, so there is a risk of bleeding complications if anticoagulation therapy is initiated.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolytes are slightly abnormal, indicating a potential risk for electrolyte imbalance.
6. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to an ongoing infection. There is a need to monitor for any signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, and hyponatremia. The patient is currently sedated and intubated, with a stable vital sign profile. 

Upon admission, the patient had a run of ventricular tachycardia and was given an amiodarone bolus and started on amiodarone infusion, which helped to stabilize the ectopy. The patient also has swelling in the right upper extremity, and an ultrasound revealed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the brachial vein. However, anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated due to the patient's history of bleeding with anticoagulation. 

The patient's last dose of antibiotics was cefepime on [**2190-4-12**] 06:00 PM. The patient is currently on multiple medications including amiodarone, lansoprazole, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and fentanyl. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated creatinine level. Other lab abnormalities include low potassium and sodium levels, as well as elevated liver enzymes. 

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory system infection ruled out."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with
   respiratory distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
   distal to stent.  OSH CT from [**3-15**] shows bilateral lower lobe collapse.
   Concern for malignancy as etiology is low.  Has elevated WBC and
   chronic cough (per daugher) without fever, but suspicious for HAP as
   well.  Recurrent symptoms in the setting of severe deconditioning also
   raises the possibility of recurrent aspiration. Now has positive
   galactomannan.
   - plan for bronch today or tomorrow to evaluate TBM and potential for
   further intervention
   - vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP, fluconzole
   (D1 [**4-10**]) to cover mold in sputum
   - ID consult re:treatment for fungus
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - slow taper of steroids instituted at OSH
   .
   #.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source of leukocytosis is PNA, however,
   reportedly had yeast in urine at OSH.  Was getting amphotericin bladder
   washes at OSH, however, unlikley to be pathogenic.  More likely to be
   secondary to long-term broad spectrum Abx.  Urine culture here with no
   growth. BAL showing 3+ PMNs, but culture with no growth to date.
   C.diff. negative x1.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - f/u blood cultures
   - reculture with HD
   - resend C. diff
   - Check vanc level per HD protocol
   .
   #. NSVT/Afib. Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the
   episodes of NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1
   yesterday and continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has
   improved.
   - d/c drip and let patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio
   especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   .
   #. ESRD on HD.  Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.
   Gets dialysis MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - vancomycin with dialysis/ check levels
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   .
   #.  Anasarca.  Patient is total body volume overlaoded in setting of
   severe malnutrition (colectomy, poor PO intake).  Getting volume
   removed at dailaysis at rehab.  However, extremities are cool and
   patient has low-normal blood pressure.  Would favor keeping patient
   even at dialysis in setting of infection.
   - nutrition consult
   - tube feeds
   .
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.  Patient has 5 points (2 points for
   thrombocyptopenia, 1 point for timing, 0 for thrombosis, 2 for other
   causes) on the 4Ts scale, but has been on heparin for > 7 months due to
   dialysis.  No history of liver disease.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to infection.
   HIT negative here.  DIC labs and peripheral smear negative.
   - trend platelet count
   - back on Hep SQ
   .
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home.
   - hold antihhypertensives for now and will manage intravascular volume
   with HD.
   .
   #. HL.  Reportedly has history of hyperlipidemia, though not on any
   lipid lowering medications.
   - confirm med list with [**Hospital 997**] rehab

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe lobar collapse. She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient has elevated white blood cell count, positive galactomannan, and is receiving vancomycin, cefepime, and fluconazole for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and fungal infection. She also has a history of atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, and hyperlipidemia.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent respiratory distress and lobar collapse raise concerns about ongoing respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygenation parameters is necessary.

2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient is at risk for HAP due to her prolonged hospital stay, invasive procedures, and immunocompromised state. Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on culture results and clinical response.

3. Fungal Infection: The positive galactomannan indicates a possible fungal infection, which should be treated accordingly. Antifungal therapy should be continued until there is evidence of resolution.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of platelet levels and appropriate management to"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with
   respiratory distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
   distal to stent.  OSH CT from [**3-15**] shows bilateral lower lobe collapse.
   Concern for malignancy as etiology is low.  Has elevated WBC and
   chronic cough (per daugher) without fever, but suspicious for HAP as
   well.  Recurrent symptoms in the setting of severe deconditioning also
   raises the possibility of recurrent aspiration. Now has positive
   galactomannan.
   - plan for bronch today or tomorrow to evaluate TBM and potential for
   further intervention
   - vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP, fluconzole
   (D1 [**4-10**]) to cover mold in sputum
   - ID consult re:treatment for fungus
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - slow taper of steroids instituted at OSH
   .
   #.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source of leukocytosis is PNA, however,
   reportedly had yeast in urine at OSH.  Was getting amphotericin bladder
   washes at OSH, however, unlikley to be pathogenic.  More likely to be
   secondary to long-term broad spectrum Abx.  Urine culture here with no
   growth. BAL showing 3+ PMNs, but culture with no growth to date.
   C.diff. negative x1.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - f/u blood cultures
   - reculture with HD
   - resend C. diff
   - Check vanc level per HD protocol
   .
   #. NSVT/Afib. Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the
   episodes of NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1
   yesterday and continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has
   improved.
   - d/c drip and let patient auto-taper.
   - restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. ESRD on HD.  Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.
   Gets dialysis MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - vancomycin with dialysis/ check levels
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   .
   #.  Anasarca.  Patient is total body volume overlaoded in setting of
   severe malnutrition (colectomy, poor PO intake).  Getting volume
   removed at dailaysis at rehab.  However, extremities are cool and
   patient has low-normal blood pressure.  Would favor keeping patient
   even at dialysis in setting of infection.
   - nutrition consult
   - tube feeds
   .
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.  Patient has 5 points (2 points for
   thrombocyptopenia, 1 point for timing, 0 for thrombosis, 2 for other
   causes) on the 4Ts scale, but has been on heparin for > 7 months due to
   dialysis.  No history of liver disease.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to infection.
   HIT negative here.  DIC labs and peripheral smear negative.
   - trend platelet count
   - back on Hep SQ
   .
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home.
   - hold antihhypertensives for now and will manage intravascular volume
   with HD.
   .
   #. HL.  Reportedly has history of hyperlipidemia, though not on any
   lipid lowering medications.
   - confirm med list with [**Hospital 997**] rehab
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and malnutrition. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe (RLL) lobar collapse, which is suspected to be caused by tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient also has leukocytosis and positive galactomannan, indicating a possible fungal infection.

The patient's medical complications include non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), atrial fibrillation (AFib), thrombocytopenia, anasarca (total body edema), and hyperlipidemia. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and cefepime for HAP, fluconazole for mold in sputum, amiodarone for NSVT/Afib, and heparin for ESRD on HD.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress due to further lobar collapse or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is also a risk of bloodstream infection due to the presence of indwelling lines and catheters. The patient's thrombocytopenia should be monitored closely, and there is a possibility"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with
   respiratory distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
   distal to stent.  OSH CT from [**3-15**] shows bilateral lower lobe collapse.
   Concern for malignancy as etiology is low.  Has elevated WBC and
   chronic cough (per daugher) without fever, but suspicious for HAP as
   well.  Recurrent symptoms in the setting of severe deconditioning also
   raises the possibility of recurrent aspiration. Now has positive
   galactomannan. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may
   ultimately require another trach and PEG.
   - plan for bronch today or tomorrow to evaluate TBM and potential for
   further intervention
   - vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP, fluconzole
   (D1 [**4-10**]) to cover mold in sputum
   - ID consult re:treatment for fungus
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - slow taper of steroids instituted at OSH, drop to 40qday
   .
   #.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source of leukocytosis is PNA, however,
   reportedly had yeast in urine at OSH.  Was getting amphotericin bladder
   washes at OSH, however, unlikley to be pathogenic.  More likely to be
   secondary to long-term broad spectrum Abx.  Urine culture here with no
   growth. BAL showing 3+ PMNs, but culture with no growth to date.
   C.diff. negative x1.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - f/u blood cultures
   - reculture with HD
   - resend C. diff
   - Check vanc level per HD protocol
   .
   #. NSVT/Afib. Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the
   episodes of NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1
   yesterday and continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has
   improved.
   - d/c drip and let patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio
   especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   .
   #. RUE DVT: DVT seen on U/S. plan to start heparin drip after bronch.
   No bolus and monitor for signs of bleeding as patient has had previous
   epistaxsis and trach bleed.
   #. ESRD on HD.  Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.
   Gets dialysis MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - vancomycin with dialysis/ check levels
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   .
   #.  Anasarca.  Patient is total body volume overlaoded in setting of
   severe malnutrition (colectomy, poor PO intake).  Getting volume
   removed at dailaysis at rehab.  However, extremities are cool and
   patient has low-normal blood pressure.  Would favor keeping patient
   even at dialysis in setting of infection.
   - tube feeds
   .
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.  Patient has 5 points (2 points for
   thrombocyptopenia, 1 point for timing, 0 for thrombosis, 2 for other
   causes) on the 4Ts scale, but has been on heparin for > 7 months due to
   dialysis.  No history of liver disease.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to infection.
   HIT negative here.  DIC labs and peripheral smear negative.
   - trend platelet count
   - back on Hep SQ
   .
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home.
   - on captopril, will titrate as needed today
   - manage intravascular volume with HD.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe collapse, which raises concerns for tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The presence of positive galactomannan also supports the possibility of an active fungal infection.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has elevated white blood cell count, likely due to a pulmonary infection. The source of leukocytosis could be pneumonia or a urinary tract infection, but the urine culture here shows no growth.

3. Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or unstable angina (UA): The patient has known atrial fibrillation and experiences episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) during dialysis. The administration of amiodarone has improved ectopy.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed DVT in the right upper extremity, which requires anticoagulation therapy.

5. Anasarca: The patient exhibits signs of fluid overload, with cool extremities and low-normal blood pressure. This may be related to severe malnutrition and inadequate fluid removal during dialysis.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be due to prolonged heparin therapy during dialysis. However"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension (HTN), heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and malnutrition. She presented with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe (RLL) lobar collapse, which could be due to tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration with mucous plugging, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Recent interventions and assessments include:
1. Bronchoscopy planned for today or tomorrow to evaluate TBM and potential for further intervention.
2. Initiation of vancomycin and cefepime to cover HAP, as well as fluconazole to cover mold in sputum.
3. Infectious disease (ID) consult for treatment of fungus.
4. Follow-up blood culture.
5. Albuterol/atrovent nebs, frequent suctioning, and slow taper of steroids.
6. Leukocytosis is most likely due to pneumonia (PNA), but there is also a history of yeast in urine at OSH. The patient was receiving amphotericin bladder washes, but it is unlikely to be pathogenic. Urine culture here shows no growth, and BAL showing 3+ PMNs but culture with no growth to date. Clo"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with
   respiratory distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
   distal to stent.  OSH CT from [**3-15**] shows bilateral lower lobe collapse.
   Concern for malignancy as etiology is low.  Has elevated WBC and
   chronic cough (per daugher) without fever, but suspicious for HAP as
   well.  Recurrent symptoms in the setting of severe deconditioning also
   raises the possibility of recurrent aspiration. Now has positive
   galactomannan. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may
   ultimately require another trach and PEG.
   - bronch yesterday showed diffuse tracheomalacia, BAL obtained but
   little potential for further intervention
   - vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP, fluconzole
   discontinued
   - f/u ID recs
   - CT chest
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - slow taper of steroids instituted at OSH, drop to 30qday
   .
   #.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source of leukocytosis is PNA, however,
   reportedly had yeast in urine at OSH.  Was getting amphotericin bladder
   washes at OSH, however, unlikley to be pathogenic.  More likely to be
   secondary to long-term broad spectrum Abx.  Urine culture here with no
   growth. BAL showing 3+ PMNs, but culture with no growth to date.
   C.diff. negative x2.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Check vanc level per HD protocol
   .
   #. NSVT/Afib. Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the
   episodes of NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**]
   and continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now
   off drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio
   especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   - would try beta-blocker initially to cover tachy episodes during HD
   .
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however today will switch to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker
   given concurrent rhythm issues.
   - manage with single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker as much as possible
   - manage intravascular volume with HD.
   .
   #. RUE DVT: DVT seen on U/S. plan to decrease heparin drip after PTT of
   150. Will have goal for PTT in 40-50 range and monitor for signs of
   bleeding as patient has had previous epistaxsis and trach bleed.
   .
   #. ESRD on HD.  Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.
   Gets dialysis MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - vancomycin with dialysis/ check levels
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   .
   #.  Anasarca.  Patient is total body volume overlaoded in setting of
   severe malnutrition (colectomy, poor PO intake).  Getting volume
   removed at dailaysis at rehab.  However, extremities are cool and
   patient has low-normal blood pressure.  Would favor keeping patient
   even at dialysis in setting of infection.
   - tube feeds
   .
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.  Patient has 5 points (2 points for
   thrombocyptopenia, 1 point for timing, 0 for thrombosis, 2 for other
   causes) on the 4Ts scale, but has been on heparin for > 7 months due to
   dialysis.  No history of liver disease.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to infection.
   HIT negative here.  DIC labs and peripheral smear negative.
   - trend platelet count now back on Hep gtt

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for recurrent respiratory failure secondary to right lower lobe collapse. The differential diagnosis includes tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and malignancy. The patient has a positive galactomannan, which suggests an invasive fungal infection. 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has tracheomalacia. She is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for suspected HAP, and fluconazole has been discontinued. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she has leukocytosis. The source of leukocytosis is likely pneumonia, but there is also a history of yeast in the urine. The patient has negative C. diff tests and a negative stool culture. 

The patient also has a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and atrial fibrillation. She was given amiodarone and then placed on a beta-blocker to manage the rhythm issues during hemodialysis. 

Additionally, the patient has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is being treated with heparin. Her blood pressure is well-controlled on nitro paste and amlodipine, and she"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy due to ongoing bronchomalacia and had BAL sent for gram stain and culture, stool sent for C. diff, and ID recommended recheck galactomannan when off steroids, with discontinuation of fluconazole. Heparin drip was started for right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Steroid dose was decreased, and captopril was being held prior to dialysis to allow for more optimal fluid removal with ultrafiltration.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has not been assessed for skin integrity, but given their prolonged stay in the ICU, they may be at risk for pressure ulcers or other skin complications.

2. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT), upper extremity: The patient has been diagnosed with DVT in their right upper extremity. This is indicated by the heparin drip started for RUE DVT and the fact that they are unable to assess peripheral pulses in their upper extremities.

3. Abdominal compartment syndrome/intraabdominal hypertension (ACS/IAH): The patient has a history of ACS/IAH, which is a serious condition that can cause organ dysfunction due to increased pressure within the abdomen.

4. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient requires pain management, both for acute pain and any underlying chronic pain conditions.

5. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient's heart rhythm is currently sinus tachycardia, but they have a history of cardiac dysrhythmia. Monitoring and management of their heart rate and rhythm should be ongoing.

6. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. They have a PaO2 of 99% on FiO2 40% and a respiratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with
   respiratory distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
   distal to stent.  OSH CT from [**3-15**] shows bilateral lower lobe collapse.
   Concern for malignancy as etiology is low.  Has elevated WBC and
   chronic cough (per daugher) without fever, but suspicious for HAP as
   well.  Recurrent symptoms in the setting of severe deconditioning also
   raises the possibility of recurrent aspiration. Now has positive
   galactomannan. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may
   ultimately require another trach and PEG.
   - bronch yesterday showed diffuse tracheomalacia, BAL obtained but
   little potential for further intervention
   - vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP, fluconzole
   discontinued
   - f/u ID recs
   - CT chest
   - f/u blood culture
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - slow taper of steroids instituted at OSH, drop to 30qday
   .
   #.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source of leukocytosis is PNA, however,
   reportedly had yeast in urine at OSH.  Was getting amphotericin bladder
   washes at OSH, however, unlikley to be pathogenic.  More likely to be
   secondary to long-term broad spectrum Abx.  Urine culture here with no

   #. NSVT/Afib. Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the
   episodes of NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**]
   and continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now
   off drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio
   especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   - would try beta-blocker initially to cover tachy episodes during HD
   .
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however today will switch to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker
   given concurrent rhythm issues.
   - manage with single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker as much as possible
   - manage intravascular volume with HD.

   #. RUE DVT: DVT seen on U/S. plan to decrease heparin drip after PTT of
   150. Will have goal for PTT in 40-50 range and monitor for signs of
   bleeding as patient has had previous epistaxsis and trach bleed.

   severe malnutrition (colectomy, poor PO intake).  Getting volume
   removed at dailaysis at rehab.  However, extremities are cool and
   patient has low-normal blood pressure.  Would favor keeping patient
   even at dialysis in setting of infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress. She was admitted with lobar collapse of the right lower lobe, suspected tuberculosis (TBM) or aspiration with mucous plugging, as well as hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's respiratory distress has led to intubation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress, raising concerns about TBM, aspiration, and HAP. 
2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may be due to a pulmonary infection or long-term broad-spectrum antibiotic use. 
3. NSVT/Afib: The patient has known atrial fibrillation and has experienced episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia coinciding with dialysis. 
4. HTN: The patient's blood pressure is poorly controlled despite medications, and there are concerns about managing hypertension during concurrent rhythm issues. 
5. RUE DVT: A deep vein thrombosis was observed on ultrasound, and plans were made to decrease heparin drip after reaching a PTT of 150. 
6. ESRD on HD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and requires dialysis three times a week. 
7. Anasarca: The patient has generalized edema due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with widespread pulmonary infection and bilateral small pleural effusions, with the left side being greater than the right. The patient's condition does not appear to be consistent with an invasive fungal infection, so Voriconazole was not started. The patient has been weaned off methylprednisolone and switched to a beta-blocker alone. The patient has allergies to Linezolid and Penicillin G, with the last dose of antibiotics being Cefipime on [**2190-4-14**] at 04:06 PM. The patient is currently receiving infusions of Heparin Sodium at 150 units/hour and Metoprolol. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), a heart rate of 79 bpm with a range of 64-120 bpm, a blood pressure reading of 146/49 mmHg with a range of 80-154/36-94 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with a range of 19-27 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,648 mL with 649 mL given through the PO, 960 mL through TF, and 398 mL through IVF. The total output includes 1,730 mL of blood products and"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with
   respiratory distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
   distal to stent.  CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease, possibly invasive
   fungal infection.  Has elevated WBC and chronic cough (per daugher)
   without fever, but suspicious for HAP as well.  Recurrent symptoms in
   the setting of severe deconditioning also raises the possibility of
   recurrent aspiration. Has positive glucan/galactomannan, and given CT
   on [**4-14**], concerning for invasive aspergilliosis. Due to multiple
   respiratory problems, patient may ultimately require another trach and
   PEG. bronch on [**4-13**] showed diffuse tracheomalacia, BAL obtained but
   little potential for further intervention.
   - vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP, fluconzole
   discontinued
   - would start voriconazole given possibility of invasive fungal
   infection
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - slow taper of steroids instituted at OSH, cont at 30qday
   - on PSV, wean as tolerated today
   .
   #.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source of leukocytosis is PNA, however,
   reportedly had yeast in urine at OSH.  Was getting amphotericin bladder
   washes at OSH, however, unlikley to be pathogenic.  More likely to be
   secondary to long-term broad spectrum Abx.  Urine culture here with no
   growth. BAL showing 3+ PMNs, but culture with no growth to date.
   C.diff. negative x2.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - start vori for possible invasive aspergilliosis
   - f/u cultures
   - vanc per HD protocol
   .
   #. NSVT/Afib. Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the
   episodes of NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**]
   and continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now
   off drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio
   especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   - can titrate beta-blocker to cover tachy episodes during HD, as well
   as control BP
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   .
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given
   concurrent rhythm issues.
   - manage with single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker as much as possible
   - manage intravascular volume with HD.
   .
   #. RUE DVT: DVT seen on U/S. Patient is very sensitive to heparin,
   currently on heparin drip at 150 with a PTT of 65.9. Will discuss with
   family regarding risks and benefits of anticoagulation given her
   tendency to bleed with the heparin.
   .
   #. ESRD on HD.  Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.
   Gets dialysis MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - vancomycin with dialysis/ check levels
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   .
   #.  Anasarca.  Patient is total body volume overlaoded in setting of
   severe malnutrition (colectomy, poor PO intake).  Getting volume
   removed at dailaysis at rehab.  However, extremities are cool and
   patient has low-normal blood pressure.  Would favor keeping patient
   even at dialysis in setting of infection.
   - tube feeds
   .
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.  Patient has 5 points (2 points for
   thrombocyptopenia, 1 point for timing, 0 for thrombosis, 2 for other
   causes) on the 4Ts scale, but has been on heparin for > 7 months due to
   dialysis.  No history of liver disease.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to infection.
   HIT negative here.  DIC labs and peripheral smear negative.
   - trend platelet count now, especially while back on Hep gtt

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress. She is currently intubated and in the ICU due to right lower lobe collapse, possibly due to tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has positive glucan/galactomannan, indicating a possible invasive fungal infection, specifically invasive aspergilliosis. She is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for HAP, and voriconazole for possible invasive aspergilliosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress, making her at risk for further respiratory failure. She may require tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to severe deconditioning and potential recurrent aspiration.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count is likely secondary to pneumonia. However, she also had yeast in her urine at the previous hospital, which may or may not be pathogenic. Further evaluation of cultures and urine sample is needed.
3. NSVT/Afib: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and experienced episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) during dialysis. She was given amiodarone but is now off the drip"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with widespread pulmonary infection and bilateral small pleural effusions. They have a history of allergies to linezolid and penicillin G, and were previously on cefipime antibiotics. The patient is sedated, intubated, and not following commands. 

The vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Respiratory support is provided through CPAP/PSV with an endotracheal tube, with a set volume of 450 mL and spontaneous volume of 327-401 mL. The oxygen delivery device is an endotracheal tube, with a FiO2 of 40% and a respiratory system compliance of 34.6 cmH2O/mL. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient has a history of bacteremia, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure. 

The patient's medical complications may include potential infections due to the widespread pulmonary infection, risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from prolonged immobility, cardiac dysrhythmia, acute renal failure, and pain management."

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and suspected pulmonary aspergillosis. The patient has been on voriconazole, weaned off steroids, and continued on vancomycin and cefipime. Renal recommendations include discontinuing amlodipine and captopril, while continuing metoprolol. The patient underwent dialysis with ultrafiltration of 2 liters, which was tolerated well. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 105/36 to 157/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 362 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen of 40%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,504 mL since midnight. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of creatinine, total bilirubin, and lactate. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and .  CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse
   disease, possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral
   voriconazole on [**2190-4-15**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient
   may ultimately require another trach and PEG.  Will probide her with as
   much advantage for successful vent liberation as possible with ongoing
   UF dialysis. Must also consider that some component of resp failure
   could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate
   anticoagulation.
   - Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP
   - Voriconazole (D1 [**4-16**])
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - Continuing to taper Methylpred, reduce to 20 IV every 24 hours
   - on PSV, wean as tolerated today with ABG and NIF pre and post SBT to
   assess patient
s overall respiratory status
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Was trending down reliably with tapering of steroid and ongoing ABx
   treatment; however, up slightly to 27.9 today from 26 yesterday.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - Continue vori for possible invasive aspergilliosis
   - f/u cultures
   - vanc per HD protocol
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   - can titrate beta-blocker to cover tachy episodes during HD, as well
   as control BP
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   .
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given
   concurrent rhythm issues.
   - manage with single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker as much as possible
   - manage intravascular volume with HD.
   .
   #. RUE DVT: DVT seen on U/S. Patient is very sensitive to heparin,
   currently on heparin drip at 150 with a PTT of 65.9. Will discuss with
   family regarding risks and benefits of anticoagulation given her
   tendency to bleed with the heparin.
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis
   - vancomycin with dialysis/ check levels
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   .
   #.  Anasarca.  Patient is total body volume overlaoded in setting of
   severe malnutrition (colectomy, poor PO intake).  Getting volume
   removed at dailaysis at rehab.  However, extremities are cool and
   patient has low-normal blood pressure.  Would favor keeping patient
   even at dialysis in setting of infection.
   - tube feeds
   .
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.  Patient has 5 points (2 points for
   thrombocyptopenia, 1 point for timing, 0 for thrombosis, 2 for other
   causes) on the 4Ts scale, but has been on heparin for > 7 months due to
   dialysis.  No history of liver disease.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to infection.
   HIT negative here.  DIC labs and peripheral smear negative.
   - trend platelet count now, especially while back on Hep gtt

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and .  CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse
   disease, possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral
   voriconazole on [**2190-4-15**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient
   may ultimately require another trach and PEG.  Will probide her with as
   much advantage for successful vent liberation as possible with ongoing
   UF dialysis. Must also consider that some component of resp failure
   could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate
   anticoagulation.
   - Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP
   - Voriconazole (D1 [**4-16**])
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - Continuing to taper Methylpred, reduce to 20 IV every 24 hours
   - on PSV, wean as tolerated today with ABG and NIF pre and post SBT to
   assess patient
s overall respiratory status
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Was trending down reliably with tapering of steroid and ongoing ABx
   treatment; however, up slightly to 27.9 today from 26 yesterday.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - Continue vori for possible invasive aspergilliosis
   - f/u cultures
   - vanc per HD protocol
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.
   - can titrate beta-blocker to cover tachy episodes during HD, as well
   as control BP
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given
   concurrent rhythm issues.
   - Increase single [**Doctor Last Name **] metoprolol to 37.5 three times daily
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis
   - vancomycin with dialysis/ check levels
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:
   HIT neg and resolving thrombocytopenia.
   - Trend platelet count

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress. She was admitted due to right lower lobe (RLL) lobar collapse, which may be secondary to tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration with mucous plugging, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress. There are concerns about invasive aspergillosis, and she has been started on oral voriconazole. She may require another tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to multiple respiratory problems.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, indicating an ongoing infection. She is receiving antibiotics for HAP and antifungal treatment for possible invasive aspergillosis.
3. Non-sustained Ventricular Tachycardia (NSVT)/Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and experienced episodes of NSVT coinciding with dialysis. She was given amiodarone, which improved ectopic activity. It is planned to restart amiodarone and consider long-term therapy if ectopy returns.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with
   respiratory distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
   distal to stent.  CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease, possibly invasive
   fungal infection.  Has elevated WBC and chronic cough (per daugher)
   without fever, but suspicious for HAP as well.  Recurrent symptoms in
   the setting of severe deconditioning also raises the possibility of
   recurrent aspiration. Has positive glucan/galactomannan, and given CT
   on [**4-14**], concerning for invasive aspergilliosis. Due to multiple
   respiratory problems, patient may ultimately require another trach and
   PEG. bronch on [**4-13**] showed diffuse tracheomalacia, BAL obtained but
   little potential for further intervention.
   - vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP, fluconzole
   discontinued
   - would start voriconazole given possibility of invasive fungal
   infection
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - slow taper of steroids instituted at OSH, cont at 30qday
   - on PSV, wean as tolerated today
   .
   #.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source of leukocytosis is PNA, however,
   reportedly had yeast in urine at OSH.  Was getting amphotericin bladder
   washes at OSH, however, unlikley to be pathogenic.  More likely to be
   secondary to long-term broad spectrum Abx.  Urine culture here with no
   growth. BAL showing 3+ PMNs, but culture with no growth to date.
   C.diff. negative x2.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - start vori for possible invasive aspergilliosis
   - f/u cultures
   - vanc per HD protocol
   .
   #. NSVT/Afib. Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the
   episodes of NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**]
   and continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now
   off drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio
   especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   - can titrate beta-blocker to cover tachy episodes during HD, as well
   as control BP
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   .
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given
   concurrent rhythm issues.
   - manage with single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker as much as possible
   - manage intravascular volume with HD.
   .
   #. RUE DVT: DVT seen on U/S. Patient is very sensitive to heparin,
   currently on heparin drip at 150 with a PTT of 65.9. Will discuss with
   family regarding risks and benefits of anticoagulation given her
   tendency to bleed with the heparin.
   .
   #. ESRD on HD.  Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.
   Gets dialysis MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - vancomycin with dialysis/ check levels
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   .
   #.  Anasarca.  Patient is total body volume overlaoded in setting of
   severe malnutrition (colectomy, poor PO intake).  Getting volume
   removed at dailaysis at rehab.  However, extremities are cool and
   patient has low-normal blood pressure.  Would favor keeping patient
   even at dialysis in setting of infection.
   - tube feeds
   .
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.  Patient has 5 points (2 points for
   thrombocyptopenia, 1 point for timing, 0 for thrombosis, 2 for other
   causes) on the 4Ts scale, but has been on heparin for > 7 months due to
   dialysis.  No history of liver disease.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to infection.
   HIT negative here.  DIC labs and peripheral smear negative.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Pulmonary Aspergillosis: The patient is suspected to have pulmonary aspergillosis given the sputum and CT findings. Voriconazole has been started to cover this possibility.

2. Renal Complications: The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored due to the use of nephrotoxic drugs like vancomycin and cefepime. The dosages of these medications need to be adjusted based on the patient's renal function.

3. Bleeding Complications: The patient is sensitive to heparin and has a history of bleeding. Close monitoring of the PTT levels and consideration of alternative anticoagulants may be necessary.

4. Malnutrition: The patient has severe malnutrition and requires nutritional support. Tube feeds have been initiated to meet the patient's nutritional needs.

5. Fluid Overload: The patient has anasarca (total body volume overload) and requires ongoing management to prevent fluid overload, especially during dialysis.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be due to prolonged heparin use, infection, or other causes. Close monitoring of platelet counts and consideration of alternative anticoagulants may be necessary.

7. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and requires ongoing management with antihypertensive medications"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure.  Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with
   respiratory distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
   distal to stent.  CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease, possibly invasive
   fungal infection.  Has elevated WBC and chronic cough (per daugher)
   without fever, but suspicious for HAP as well.  Recurrent symptoms in
   the setting of severe deconditioning also raises the possibility of
   recurrent aspiration. Has positive glucan/galactomannan, and given CT
   on [**4-14**], concerning for invasive aspergilliosis. Due to multiple
   respiratory problems, patient may ultimately require another trach and
   PEG. bronch on [**4-13**] showed diffuse tracheomalacia, BAL obtained but
   little potential for further intervention.
   - vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP, fluconzole
   discontinued
   - would start voriconazole given possibility of invasive fungal
   infection
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - slow taper of steroids instituted at OSH, cont at 30qday
   - on PSV, wean as tolerated today
   .
   #.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source of leukocytosis is PNA, however,
   reportedly had yeast in urine at OSH.  Was getting amphotericin bladder
   washes at OSH, however, unlikley to be pathogenic.  More likely to be
   secondary to long-term broad spectrum Abx.  Urine culture here with no
   growth. BAL showing 3+ PMNs, but culture with no growth to date.
   C.diff. negative x2.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - start vori for possible invasive aspergilliosis
   - f/u cultures
   - vanc per HD protocol
   .
   #. NSVT/Afib. Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the
   episodes of NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**]
   and continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now
   off drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio
   especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   - can titrate beta-blocker to cover tachy episodes during HD, as well
   as control BP
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   .
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given
   concurrent rhythm issues.
   - manage with single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker as much as possible
   - manage intravascular volume with HD.
   .
   #. RUE DVT: DVT seen on U/S. Patient is very sensitive to heparin,
   currently on heparin drip at 150 with a PTT of 65.9. Will discuss with
   family regarding risks and benefits of anticoagulation given her
   tendency to bleed with the heparin.
   .
   #. ESRD on HD.  Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.
   Gets dialysis MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - vancomycin with dialysis/ check levels
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   .
   #.  Anasarca.  Patient is total body volume overlaoded in setting of
   severe malnutrition (colectomy, poor PO intake).  Getting volume
   removed at dailaysis at rehab.  However, extremities are cool and
   patient has low-normal blood pressure.  Would favor keeping patient
   even at dialysis in setting of infection.
   - tube feeds
   .
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.  Patient has 5 points (2 points for
   thrombocyptopenia, 1 point for timing, 0 for thrombosis, 2 for other
   causes) on the 4Ts scale, but has been on heparin for > 7 months due to
   dialysis.  No history of liver disease.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to infection.
   HIT negative here.  DIC labs and peripheral smear negative.
   - trend platelet count now, especially while back on Hep gtt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to right lower lobe lobar collapse, which may be due to tuberculosis, aspiration with mucous plugging, or hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Complications: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse and respiratory distress. There are concerns for tuberculosis, aspiration pneumonia, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient has a positive glucan/galactomannan, suggesting a possible invasive fungal infection, and given the CT findings, there is concern for invasive aspergillosis. The patient is being started on voriconazole.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is likely secondary to a recent pulmonary infection. However, there is also a history of yeast in the urine at the previous facility, but it is unlikely to be pathogenic. The urine culture here shows no growth.

3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has known atrial fibrillation and episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia during dialysis. She was given amiodarone and is now off the drip, allowing the patient to auto-taper. The ectopy has improved, and efforts"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with likely aspergillosis and epistaxis. They are also experiencing renal failure and respiratory failure. The patient's electrolyte levels are imbalanced, with high potassium (K+) and low magnesium (Mg++). They also have an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), indicating an infection or inflammation.

The patient's vital signs show stable temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate but slightly elevated respiratory rate. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 100% with the use of supplemental oxygen. The patient is sedated and intubated, not following commands.

The physical examination reveals sclera anicteric, intubated, dry blood around the mouth and nares, coarse breath sounds (BS), distant heart sounds, regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops, soft non-tender non-distended abdomen with present bowel sounds, cool extremities, anasarca, and no signs of tenderness or erythema around the lines.

The laboratory results show elevated creatinine (Cr), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), low hemoglobin (Hct), slightly low platelet count (Plt), elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low albumin, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low calcium (Ca++"

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has impaired skin integrity, electrolyte and fluid disorder, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pain control, cardiac dysrhythmia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and a history of bacteremia. The patient is receiving nutrition through Nutren 2.0 at a rate of 40 mL/hour. He has several lines including a PICC line, dialysis catheter, and arterial line. Prophylactic measures have been taken for DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and decreased perfusion.
2. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient's electrolytes and fluid balance need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots in the veins, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if dislodged.
4. Pain control: The patient requires effective pain management to prevent acute and chronic pain.
5. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient may be at risk for arrhythmias due to his medical condition and the use of various medications.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status needs to be closely monitored, and interventions should be"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and .  CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse
   disease, possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral
   voriconazole on [**2190-4-15**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient
   may ultimately require another trach and PEG.  Will probide her with as
   much advantage for successful vent liberation as possible with ongoing
   UF dialysis. Must also consider that some component of resp failure
   could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate
   anticoagulation.
   - Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP
   - Voriconazole (D1 [**4-16**])
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - Continuing to taper Methylpred, reduce to 20 IV every 24 hours
   - on PSV, wean as tolerated today with ABG and NIF pre and post SBT to
   assess patient
s overall respiratory status
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Was trending down reliably with tapering of steroid and ongoing ABx
   treatment; however, up slightly to 27.9 today from 26 yesterday.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - Continue vori for possible invasive aspergilliosis
   - f/u cultures
   - vanc per HD protocol
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.
   - can titrate beta-blocker to cover tachy episodes during HD, as well
   as control BP
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease (ESRD), and malnutrition. She is currently in the ICU due to recurrent respiratory distress caused by right lower lobe (RLL) lobar collapse. The cause of the collapse is uncertain and may be related to tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration with mucous plugging, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She has positive glucan/galactomannan, suggesting invasive aspergillosis. She was started on oral voriconazole on 4/15. The patient is also experiencing leukocytosis, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypertension, and a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse and may ultimately require another tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to ongoing respiratory problems.
2. Invasive Aspergillosis: The patient has positive glucan/galactomannan and diffuse lung disease on CT, indicating a high risk for invasive aspergillosis. Voriconazole has been initiated for treatment.
3. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient's respiratory distress may be secondary to HAP. Vancomycin and c"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may ultimately
   require another trach and PEG.  Will probide her with as much advantage
   for successful vent liberation as possible with ongoing UF dialysis.
   Must also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation.
   - can d/c Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) as now completed
   course for HAP
   - Voriconazole (D1 [**4-16**])
   - f/u ID recs
   - will discuss with ENT re:sinus CT and is there is any concern for
   fungus which would likely require surgery.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - Continuing to taper Methylpred, reduce to 10 IV every 24 hours
   - on PSV, will try SBT again today to assess patient
s overall
   respiratory status however will likely need a trach for prolonged wean
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor.
   - minimize phlebotomy
   - guaiac all stool
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Was trending down reliably with tapering of steroid and ongoing ABx
   treatment; however, up today with still unclear etiology.
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - Continue vori for possible invasive aspergilliosis
   - f/u cultures
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.
   - can titrate beta-blocker to cover tachy episodes during HD, as well
   as control BP
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given
   concurrent rhythm issues.
   - cont single [**Doctor Last Name **] metoprolol to 37.5 three times daily
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:
   HIT neg and resolving thrombocytopenia.
   - Trend platelet count

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. She was admitted with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe collapse, possibly due to tuberculosis, aspiration, or hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was intubated and started on voriconazole for suspected invasive aspergillosis. The patient's medical team is considering stopping vancomycin and cefepime, as the course for hospital-acquired pneumonia is complete. They will provide ongoing ultrafiltration with hemodialysis and closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, as she may require another tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. Other potential medical complications include anemia, leukocytosis, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia/atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. The patient has a history of HIT and resolving thrombocytopenia."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may ultimately
   require another trach and PEG.  Will probide her with as much advantage
   for successful vent liberation as possible with ongoing UF dialysis.
   Must also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation.
   - Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) to cover HAP
   - Voriconazole (D1 [**4-16**])
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - frequent suctioning
   - Continuing to taper Methylpred, reduce to 20 IV every 24 hours
   - on PSV, wean as tolerated today with ABG and NIF pre and post SBT to
   assess patient
s overall respiratory status
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Was trending down reliably with tapering of steroid and ongoing ABx
   treatment; however, up slightly to 27.9 today from 26 yesterday.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - Continue vori for possible invasive aspergilliosis
   - f/u cultures
   - vanc per HD protocol
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.
   - can titrate beta-blocker to cover tachy episodes during HD, as well
   as control BP
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given
   concurrent rhythm issues.
   - Increase single [**Doctor Last Name **] metoprolol to 37.5 three times daily
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis
   - vancomycin with dialysis/ check levels
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:
   HIT neg and resolving thrombocytopenia.
   - Trend platelet count

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe (RLL) lobar collapse. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's recent events include:
- Consider stopping Vanc and cefepime, continue voriconazole, due to suspected aspergillosis and epistaxis.
- Renal recommended ongoing ultrafiltration with hemodialysis (HD), also PTH draw on AM labs.
- Dialysis with UF 1.9 L, tolerated well.
- Had SBT with pre-SBT ABG of 7.52/35/156 and post-SBT ABG of 7.50/39/119. NIF was -13.
- Had sinus CT in the evening without incident.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Tcurrent: 36.1 C (96.9 F)

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and malnutrition. She presented with recurrent respiratory distress due to right lower lobe lobar collapse, possibly secondary to tuberculosis, aspiration, or hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress. There is a possibility of invasive aspergilliosis, for which she was started on oral voriconazole. Given her multiple respiratory problems, she may require another tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are trending down. This could be due to ongoing blood loss or inadequate nutrition. Monitoring and minimizing phlebotomy are recommended.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could be a response to infection or inflammation. Ongoing antibiotic treatment and monitoring of cultures are advised.
4. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSVT)/Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has known AFib and experienced episodes of NSVT coinciding with dialysis. She was given amiodarone and is now off the drip, with ectopy improving. Titration of beta-blockers to control heart rate and blood pressure is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may ultimately
   require another trach and PEG.  Will provide her with as much advantage
   for successful vent liberation as possible with ongoing UF dialysis.
   Must also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation.  Improved
   respiratory status, tolerated 2 hour SBT yesterday [**4-17**].
   - completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c on [**4-17**]
   - cont Voriconazole (D1 [**4-16**])
   - f/u ID recs, question of length of treatment with voriconazole.
   - ENT recs CT sinus c/w intubation status, will discuss with radiology
   extent of air/fluid in sinuses.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - d/c steroids today
   - plan extubation today
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor.
   - minimize phlebotomy
   - guaiac all stool
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Was trending down reliably with tapering of steroid and ongoing ABx
   treatment; however, up today with still unclear etiology.
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - Continue vori for possible invasive aspergilliosis
   - f/u cultures
   - will obtain LFTs due to voriconazole
   - B-glucan, galactomannan
   - c.diff negative from [**4-17**]
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.
   - can titrate beta-blocker to cover tachy episodes during HD, as well
   as control BP
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given
   concurrent rhythm issues.
   - cont single [**Doctor Last Name **] metoprolol to 37.5 three times daily
   - will restart amlodipine today
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD on [**4-19**]
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:
   HIT neg and resolving thrombocytopenia.
   - Trend platelet count

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to right lower lobe collapse. There is suspicion of tuberculosis (TBM), invasive aspergilliosis, or aspiration with mucous plugging as potential causes. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and oral voriconazole for possible invasive aspergilliosis. Her current condition is improving, with improved respiratory status and tolerance of a 2-hour spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may ultimately require another tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to multiple respiratory problems. It is important to consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) from known right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), though the patient did not tolerate anticoagulation.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is trending down, but there is no concern for bleeding at present. Monitoring and minimizing phlebotomy, as well as obtaining stool guaiac, are recommended.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is up today with unclear etiology. Ongoing treatment with voriconazole for possible invasive asper"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may ultimately
   require another intubation which she has stated she would want.  Will
   continue to remove fluid with dialysis. Must also consider that some
   component of resp failure could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did
   not tolerate anticoagulation.  Improved respiratory status.  Now off
   steroids. CT sinus showing fluid in mastoids not concerning for
   invasive fungal disease there.
   - completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c on [**4-17**]
   - cont Voriconazole (D1 [**4-16**])
   - f/u ID recs, question of long-term LFT monitoring and vori dosing as
   patient is likely to go to rehab soon.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - PT
   - monitor PO today, consider speech and swallow eval if needed.
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor.
   - minimize phlebotomy
   - guaiac all stool
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Was trending down reliably with tapering of steroid and ongoing ABx
   treatment; however, up today with still unclear etiology.
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - Continue vori for possible invasive aspergilliosis
   - f/u cultures
   - will obtain regular LFTs due to voriconazole
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   - c.diff negative from [**4-17**]
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.
   - can titrate beta-blocker to cover tachy episodes during HD, as well
   as control BP
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given
   concurrent rhythm issues.
   - cont single [**Doctor Last Name **] metoprolol to 37.5 three times daily
   - will avoid additional agents and focus on removing fluids during HD
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   - will consider low-dose Coumadin after acute issues are resolved.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD today
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:
   HIT neg and resolving thrombocytopenia.
   - Trend platelet count
   FEN: NPO for extubation, will try to advance diet today
   Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, PPI, colace, senna
   Dispo: begin planning for rehab to go in the next day or two.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress. She was admitted with lobar collapse in the right lower lobe of the lung, and there is a suspicion of tuberculosis, aspiration, or hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient has positive glucan/galactomannan levels and a CT scan showing diffuse disease, possibly invasive aspergilliosis. She was started on oral voriconazole but may require another intubation due to multiple respiratory problems. The patient also has a known right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis and is not tolerating anticoagulation. Other medical issues include anemia, leukocytosis, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia/atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's recurrent lobar collapse and respiratory distress may lead to further deterioration in her respiratory status, requiring another intubation.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's known right upper extremity DVT increases the risk of pulmonary embolism, especially since she is not tolerating anticoagulation.
3. Invasive aspergilliosis: The positive glucan/galactomannan levels and CT findings suggest invasive aspergilliosis, which can worsen the patient's respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia. The patient is currently extubated and receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. He is on mechanical ventilation with a PSV/SBT mode, set at a tidal volume of 285 mL, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O. His FiO2 is set at 60%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 56-72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137-171 mmHg, and oxygen saturation above 99%. The patient's neurological examination shows no abnormalities.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated blood glucose levels. His kidney function tests show increased creatinine levels. The patient has a history of bacteremia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), chronic pain, cardiac dysrhythmia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, the following potential medical complications may arise:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's recent respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiovascular Complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now intubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may ultimately
   require another trach and PEG.  Will provide her with as much advantage
   for successful vent liberation as possible with ongoing UF dialysis.
   Must also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation.  Improved
   respiratory status, tolerated 2 hour SBT yesterday [**4-17**].
   - completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c on [**4-17**]
   - cont Voriconazole (D1 [**4-16**])
   - f/u ID recs, question of length of treatment with voriconazole.
   - ENT recs CT sinus c/w intubation status, will discuss with radiology
   extent of air/fluid in sinuses.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - d/c steroids today
   - plan extubation today
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor.
   - minimize phlebotomy
   - guaiac all stool
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Was trending down reliably with tapering of steroid and ongoing ABx
   treatment; however, up today with still unclear etiology.
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - Continue vori for possible invasive aspergilliosis
   - f/u cultures
   - will obtain LFTs due to voriconazole
   - B-glucan, galactomannan
   - c.diff negative from [**4-17**]
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.
   - can titrate beta-blocker to cover tachy episodes during HD, as well
   as control BP
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given
   concurrent rhythm issues.
   - cont single [**Doctor Last Name **] metoprolol to 37.5 three times daily
   - will restart amlodipine today
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD on [**4-19**]
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:
   HIT neg and resolving thrombocytopenia.
   - Trend platelet count
   FEN: NPO for extubation, will assess for PO diet once extubated

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, recurrent respiratory distress, and right lower lobe lobar collapse. She was intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and cefepime, and she is still receiving voriconazole for possible invasive aspergilliosis. Her respiratory status has improved, and she tolerated a 2-hour spontaneous breathing trial yesterday. The plan is to extubate her today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's recurrent respiratory distress and right lower lobe lobar collapse pose a risk for ongoing respiratory failure. She may require another tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) if she does not improve.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a known right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is at risk for PE. However, she was intolerant of anticoagulation.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has been trending down. While there is no current concern for bleeding, it will continue to be monitored.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated with unclear etiology. This may indicate an ongoing infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has a history of allergies to linezolid and penicillin G. He was previously taking amlodipine but discontinued it. In the 24 hours leading up to this progress note, the patient underwent hemodialysis with minimal ultrafiltration due to hypotension. The patient also had an attempted nasogastric tube placement but was found to be minimally responsive. The patient's blood sugar levels are normal, and ABG results are acceptable with a slightly lower pH. The patient's body temperature was initially 94.7 axillary but later read as 97.2 rectal after a head CT scan. The patient responded better to simple vocal commands and exhibited improved vital signs with the administration of 500 mL fluid bolus. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, and voriconazole was discontinued. The patient has multiple allergies, and his medical and family history remain unchanged. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may ultimately
   require another intubation which she has stated she would want.  Will
   continue to remove fluid with dialysis. Must also consider that some
   component of resp failure could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did
   not tolerate anticoagulation.  Improved respiratory status.  Now off
   steroids. CT sinus showing fluid in mastoids not concerning for
   invasive fungal disease there.
   - completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c on [**4-17**]
   - cont Voriconazole (D1 [**4-16**])
   - f/u ID recs, question of long-term LFT monitoring and vori dosing as
   patient is likely to go to rehab soon.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - PT
   - monitor PO today, consider speech and swallow eval if needed.
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor.
   - minimize phlebotomy
   - guaiac all stool
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Was trending down reliably with tapering of steroid and ongoing ABx
   treatment; however, up today with still unclear etiology.
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - Continue vori for possible invasive aspergilliosis
   - f/u cultures
   - will obtain regular LFTs due to voriconazole
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   - c.diff negative from [**4-17**]
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.
   - can titrate beta-blocker to cover tachy episodes during HD, as well
   as control BP
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given
   concurrent rhythm issues.
   - cont single [**Doctor Last Name **] metoprolol to 37.5 three times daily
   - will avoid additional agents and focus on removing fluids during HD
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   - will consider low-dose Coumadin after acute issues are resolved.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD today
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:
   HIT neg and resolving thrombocytopenia.
   - Trend platelet count
   FEN: NPO for extubation, will try to advance diet today
   Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, PPI, colace, senna
   Dispo: begin planning for rehab to go in the next few days.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands today, vori is
   discontinued. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may
   ultimately require another intubation which she has stated she would
   want.  Will continue to remove fluid with dialysis. Must also consider
   that some component of resp failure could be PE from known RUE DVT,
   though did not tolerate anticoagulation.  Improved respiratory status.
   Now off steroids. CT sinus showing fluid in mastoids not concerning for
   invasive fungal disease there.
   - completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c on [**4-17**]
   - discontinued Voriconazole (D1 was [**4-16**])
   - f/u ID recs.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - PT
   - monitor mental status today
   - failed speech and swallow eval.
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor.
   - minimize phlebotomy
   - guaiac all stool
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Was trending down reliably with tapering of steroid and ongoing ABx
   treatment; however, up today with still unclear etiology.
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - discontinued vori for possible invasive aspergilliosis
   - f/u cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   - c.diff negative from [**4-17**]
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.
   - can titrate beta-blocker to cover tachy episodes during HD, as well
   as control BP
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given
   concurrent rhythm issues.
   - cont single [**Doctor Last Name **] metoprolol to 37.5 three times daily
   - will avoid additional agents and focus on removing fluids during HD
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   - will consider low-dose Coumadin after acute issues are resolved.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:
   HIT neg and resolving thrombocytopenia.
   - Trend platelet count
   FEN: NPO for now
   Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, PPI, colace, senna
   Dispo: begin planning for rehab to go in the next few days.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe lobar collapse. The patient has been diagnosed with tuberculosis (TBM) and invasive aspergillosis. She was started on oral voriconazole but discontinued due to elevated liver function tests. The patient's respiratory status is improving, and she is now extubated. She has a known right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and may be at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is on dialysis three times a week and has a history of anemia, leukocytosis, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), atrial fibrillation, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's recurrent lobar collapse and respiratory distress could lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's known DVT, there is a risk of PE, especially if anticoagulation is not tolerated.
3. Invasive fungal infection: The patient's elevated LFTs and positive glucan/galactomannan suggest possible invasive aspergilliosis, which requires close monitoring and appropriate treatment.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia should be closely monitored and managed accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   .
   #. Liver:
   Patient has had rising LFT
s with today in the thousands. Med effect
   vs. hypotensive/shock liver. Vori is discontinued with ID to recommend
   potential alternative treatment. Will support pressures to keep SBP
   above 100.
   - hepatology following, improving LFT
   - liver US with dopplers
 Normal right lobe of the liver, limited view
   of the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - ammonia nml
   - cont to trend LFT
   # AMS:
   Given timing with liver damage, likely related. [**Month (only) 51**] be encephalopathy
   vs. hypotension/hypoxia. CT scan negative.  Plan as above for liver.
   Continue to monitor for encephalopathy/signs of stroke.
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands today, vori is
   discontinued. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may
   ultimately require another intubation which she has stated she would
   want.  Will continue to remove fluid as possible with dialysis. Must
   also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation.  Improved
   respiratory status overall though today is tachypnic.  Now off
   steroids. CT sinus showing fluid in mastoids not concerning for
   invasive fungal disease there.
   - completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c on [**4-17**]
   - discontinued Voriconazole (D1 was [**4-16**])
   - f/u ID recs.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - PT
   - monitor mental status today
   - failed speech and swallow eval.
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor.
   - minimize phlebotomy
   - guaiac all stool
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Trending down with tapering of steroid and ongoing ABx treatment; down
   today with still unclear etiology.
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - discontinued vori (was for possible invasive aspergilliosis, and may
   start alternative in the future)
   - f/u cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   - c.diff negative
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.
   - can titrate beta-blocker to cover tachy episodes during HD, as well
   as control BP
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given
   concurrent rhythm issues.
   - cont single [**Doctor Last Name **] metoprolol if needed, IV while without tube (will
   place NG today)
   - will avoid additional agents and focus on removing fluids during HD
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:
   HIT neg and resolving thrombocytopenia.
   - Trend platelet count
   - consider sending DIC labs, though PTT remains normal
   FEN: NPO for now, plan to place NG today

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe lobar collapse. She presented with rising liver function tests (LFTs), non-verbal status, tachycardia, hypotension, and anasarca. The patient has been diagnosed with invasive aspergillosis and has been on voriconazole therapy, which was discontinued due to elevated LFTs. She also has positive glucan/galactomannan, and a CT scan showing diffuse disease, possibly invasive aspergillosis. The patient's respiratory status is improving overall, although she is tachypnic. She is off steroids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic/shock liver: The patient's rising LFTs indicate possible liver damage, which could be due to hypotensive or shock conditions.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the timing with liver damage, it is likely that the patient's non-verbal status is related to hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for encephalopathy/signs of stroke is important.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress. It is important to consider invasive aspergillosis as a possible cause of the respiratory failure. The patient may ultimately require another intubation.

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. However, based on the information given, it appears that the patient has experienced significant changes in their health condition over the past few days.

From the 24-hour events section, it can be inferred that the patient underwent an ultrasound and an EKG. The results of the ultrasound showed a normal right lobe of the liver, limited view of the left lobe, no portal vein thrombosis, and echogenic kidneys consistent with parenchymal disease. The EKG findings are not mentioned in the provided information.

The patient's condition seems to have worsened overnight, as they became non-verbal and previously were speaking in full sentences. Liver function tests (LFTs) increased to thousands, and the medication voriconazole was discontinued. A nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed, and tube feeds were started. Neo (likely meant to be neomycin) was started briefly for blood pressure support but was discontinued due to tachycardia.

The patient has allergies to linezolid, penicillin G, and an unknown allergy. The last dose of antibiotics, voriconazole, was given on [**2190-4-19**] at 12:00 AM.

In terms of vital signs, the patient has a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 106 bpm with a normal range of 82-114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/42 (63) to 155/126 (133) mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute with a normal range of 31-38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's weight remains stable at 65.6 kg, with no significant changes in height. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,186 mL and output of 1,156 mL, indicating a positive balance of 30 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 130. Physical examination reveals that the patient is awake but non-verbal, tachypneic, opens eyes to command, and does not move limbs to command. There are coarse breath sounds with expiratory wheezes, distant heart sounds with regular rate and rhythm, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, with present bowel sounds, and no rebound tenderness or guarding. The extremities are cool, and there is anasarca (generalized swelling).

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 27.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 24.1%, platelet count (Plt) of 121, creatinine (Cr) of 2.1,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   .
   #. Liver:
   Patient has had rising LFT
s with today in the thousands. Med effect
   vs. hypotensive/shock liver. Vori is discontinued, currently on
   liposomal amphoterocin. Will support pressures to keep SBP above 100.
   - hepatology following, improving LFT
   - liver US with dopplers
 Normal right lobe of the liver, limited view
   of the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - ammonia nml
   - cont to trend LFT
s, decreasing well since acute elevation yesterday
   # AMS:
   Given timing with liver damage, likely related. [**Month (only) 51**] be encephalopathy
   vs. hypotension/hypoxia. CT scan negative.  Plan as above for liver.
   Continue to monitor for encephalopathy/signs of stroke.
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands today, vori is
   discontinued. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may
   ultimately require another intubation which she has stated she would
   want.  Will continue to remove fluid as possible with dialysis. Must
   also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation.  Improved
   respiratory status overall though today is tachypnic.  Now off
   steroids. CT sinus showing fluid in mastoids not concerning for
   invasive fungal disease there.
   - completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c on [**4-17**]
   - discontinued Voriconazole (D1 was [**4-16**]) due to LFT elevation
   - cont liposomal ampho (D1 was [**4-20**])
   - f/u ID recs.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - PT
   - monitor mental status today
   - failed speech and swallow eval.
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor.
   - minimize phlebotomy
   - guaiac all stool
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Trending down with tapering of steroid, currently off steroids, and
   ongoing ABx treatment.
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - discontinued vori (was for possible invasive aspergilliosis, and may
   start alternative in the future)
   - cont amphotericin
   - f/u cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   - c.diff negative
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.  Received
   metoprolol today before HD
   - will clarify that patient should not receive BB on HD days,
   especially before HD.
   - consider midodrine before HD instead of BB
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given
   concurrent rhythm issues.  In ICU has had very labile hypertensive
   blood pressure
   - will control on metoprolol on non-HD days
   - will avoid additional agents and focus on removing fluids during HD
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:
   HIT neg and resolving thrombocytopenia.
   - Trend platelet count
   - consider sending DIC labs, though PTT remains normal
   FEN: NPO for now, plan to place NG today

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress. She is currently in the ICU due to her condition. The patient has several medical complications including liver damage, acute mental status changes, respiratory failure, anemia, leukocytosis, NSVT/AFib, hypertension, right lower lobe pneumonia, and a deep vein thrombosis in the right upper extremity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Liver Damage: The patient's liver enzymes are significantly elevated, indicating possible liver damage. This could be due to medication side effects or hypotensive/shock liver.
2. Acute Mental Status Changes: The patient has become non-verbal and is experiencing acute mental status changes, which could be related to hepatic encephalopathy or hypoxia.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress. She may require intubation again due to respiratory problems, including possible pulmonary embolism from known right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are trending down, indicating a possible anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is decreasing with tapering of steroids and ongoing antibiotic treatment.
6. NSVT/AFib: The patient has episodes"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-inch tall individual weighing 65.6 kg and admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of allergies to linezolid, penicillin G, and an unknown allergy. The patient was receiving voriconazole until [**2190-4-19**] 12:00 AM.

On [**2190-4-20**] at 01:00 PM, an ultrasound was performed, which showed normal findings in the right lobe of the liver and limited view of the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis was observed, but echogenic kidneys consistent with parenchymal disease were noted. The patient's condition deteriorated overnight, becoming non-verbal and experiencing increased liver function tests (LFTs). Hepatology believes that ischemic/shock liver is likely, possibly due to voriconazole; however, ammonia levels were normal. A nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed, and tube feeds were started.

The patient also experienced hypotension, requiring Neo support; however, they became tachycardic and Neo was discontinued. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/26 mmHg to 132/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nasal cannula"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   .
   #. Liver:
   Patient has had rising LFT
s with today in the thousands. Med effect
   vs. hypotensive/shock liver. Vori is discontinued, currently on
   liposomal amphoterocin. Will support pressures to keep SBP above 100.
   - Hepatology signed off.  LFT
s improving, likely related to ischemic
   liver
   - liver US with dopplers
 Normal right lobe of the liver, limited view
   of the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - ammonia nml
   - cont to trend LFT
   # AMS:
   Given timing with liver damage, likely related. [**Month (only) 51**] be encephalopathy
   vs. hypotension/hypoxia. CT scan negative.  Plan as above for liver.
   Continue to monitor for encephalopathy/signs of stroke.
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands today, vori is
   discontinued. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may
   ultimately require another intubation which she has stated she would
   want.  Will continue to remove fluid as possible with dialysis. Must
   also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation.  Improved
   respiratory status overall though today is tachypnic.  Now off
   steroids. CT sinus showing fluid in mastoids not concerning for
   invasive fungal disease there.
   - completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c on [**4-17**]
   - discontinued Voriconazole (D1 was [**4-16**]) due to LFT elevation
   - cont liposomal ampho (D1 was [**4-20**])
   - f/u ID recs.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - PT
   - monitor mental status today
   - failed speech and swallow eval.
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor.
   - minimize phlebotomy
   - guaiac all stool
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Trending down with tapering of steroid, currently off steroids, and
   ongoing ABx treatment.
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - discontinued vori (was for possible invasive aspergilliosis, and may
   start alternative in the future)
   - cont amphotericin
   - f/u cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   - c.diff negative
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.  Received
   metoprolol today before HD
   - will clarify that patient should not receive BB on HD days,
   especially before HD.
   - consider midodrine before HD instead of BB
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and
   amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given
   concurrent rhythm issues.  In ICU has had very labile hypertensive
   blood pressure
   - will control on metoprolol on non-HD days
   - will avoid additional agents and focus on removing fluids during HD
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:
   HIT neg and resolving thrombocytopenia.
   - Trend platelet count
   - consider sending DIC labs, though PTT remains normal
   FEN: NPO for now, plan to place NG today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension (HTN), heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis (ESRD on HD), malnutrition, and hepatobiliary disorders. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe (RLL) lobar collapse, which may be caused by tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration with mucous plugging, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). 

The patient's recent course includes rising liver function tests (LFTs) in the thousands, leading to discontinuation of voriconazole and initiation of liposomal amphoterocin. The patient also has a history of DVT and is at risk for PE, but she is intolerant to anticoagulation. 

The patient's current medications include amphotericin, midodrine before HD, epogen, and various other medications for her medical conditions. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
- Heart rate: 92 bpm (normal range 67-118 bpm)

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   .
   #. Liver:
   Patient has had rising LFT
s with today in the thousands. Med effect
   vs. hypotensive/shock liver. Vori is discontinued, currently on
   liposomal amphoterocin. Will support pressures to keep SBP above 100.
   Downward trending LFT
s since period of hypotension.
   - Hepatology signed off.  LFT
s improving, likely related to ischemic
   liver
   - liver US with dopplers
 Normal right lobe of the liver, limited view
   of the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - ammonia nml
   - cont to trend LFT
   # AMS:
   Given timing with liver damage, likely related. [**Month (only) 51**] be encephalopathy
   vs. hypotension/hypoxia. CT scan negative.  Plan as above for liver.
   Continue to monitor for encephalopathy/signs of stroke.
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands today, vori is
   discontinued. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may
   ultimately require another intubation which she has stated she would
   want.  Will continue to remove fluid as possible with dialysis. Must
   also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation.  Improved
   respiratory status overall though today is tachypnic.  Now off
   steroids. CT sinus showing fluid in mastoids not concerning for
   invasive fungal disease there.
   - completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c on [**4-17**]
   - discontinued Voriconazole (D1 was [**4-16**]) due to LFT elevation
   - cont liposomal ampho (D1 was [**4-20**])
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - PT
   - failed speech and swallow eval.
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor.
   - minimize phlebotomy
   - will plan to transfuse 1u PRBC with HD tomorrow
   - Iron studies
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Trending down off steroids and ongoing ABx treatment.  Peak WBC had
   been 28, currently 11.
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - discontinued vori (was for possible invasive aspergilliosis, and may
   start alternative in the future)
   - cont amphotericin
   - f/u cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   - c.diff negative
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.  Received
   metoprolol today before HD
   - will clarify that patient should not receive BB on HD days,
   especially before HD.
   - plan to hold metoprolol 6hrs before HD, hold if SBP<120, hold 8am
   dose
   - consider midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN/Hypotension.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on
   captopril and amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **]
   beta-blocker given concurrent rhythm issues.  In ICU has had very
   labile hypertensive blood pressure
   - will control on metoprolol on non-HD days as per above
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:  Resolved.  HIT neg and resolving
   thrombocytopenia.  Daily CBC
   FEN: TF through NGT
   Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, PPI, stooling
   Code: Full

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including hypertension (HTN), heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress. She was admitted with right lower lobe (RLL) lobar collapse, possibly due to tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration with mucous plugging, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime for HAP, voriconazole for possible invasive aspergilliosis, and liposomal amphotericin for fungal infection.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have been elevated in the thousands, indicating potential liver damage. The cause of this elevation could be related to hypotension, ischemic liver, or medication effects. The patient has also had episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and atrial fibrillation (AFib), for which she was given amiodarone.

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, with recurrent lobar collapse and respiratory distress. There is a concern for pulmonary embolism (PE) due to a known right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (RUE DVT). She was unable to tolerate anticoagulation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress due to right lower lobe collapse. She has elevated liver enzymes, possibly related to ischemic liver damage, and her LFTs are improving. She is currently on liposomal amphotericin and being monitored for encephalopathy and signs of stroke.

She also has leukocytosis, trending down with the tapering of steroids, and ongoing antibiotic treatment. Her anemia is trending down but not currently concerned for bleeding. She has a known pulmonary embolism and atrial fibrillation, for which she was started on amiodarone and then switched to a beta-blocker. Her hypertension is being managed with nitropaste and amlodipine at home and metoprolol in the ICU.

She has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis and is at risk for pulmonary embolism but was intolerant of anticoagulation. She is on dialysis three times a week and has thrombocytopenia with resolving platelet count. Her current medications include liposomal amphotericin, midodrine before HD, and epogen.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy due to the elevated liver enzymes.
2. Respiratory failure due to recurrent lobar collapse and invasive aspergill"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   .
   #. Liver:
   Patient has had rising LFT
s with today in the thousands. Med effect
   vs. hypotensive/shock liver. Vori is discontinued, currently on
   liposomal amphoterocin. Will support pressures to keep SBP above 100.
   Downward trending LFT
s since period of hypotension.
   - Hepatology signed off.  LFT
s improving, likely related to ischemic
   liver
   - liver US with dopplers
 Normal right lobe of the liver, limited view
   of the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - ammonia nml
   - cont to trend LFT
   # AMS:
   Given timing with liver damage, likely related. [**Month (only) 51**] be encephalopathy
   vs. hypotension/hypoxia. CT scan negative.  Plan as above for liver.
   Continue to monitor for encephalopathy/signs of stroke.
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands today, vori is
   discontinued. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may
   ultimately require another intubation which she has stated she would
   want.  Will continue to remove fluid as possible with dialysis. Must
   also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation.  Improved
   respiratory status overall though today is tachypnic.  Now off
   steroids. CT sinus showing fluid in mastoids not concerning for
   invasive fungal disease there.
   - completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c on [**4-17**]
   - discontinued Voriconazole (D1 was [**4-16**]) due to LFT elevation
   - cont liposomal ampho (D1 was [**4-20**])
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - PT
   - failed speech and swallow eval.
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor.
   - minimize phlebotomy
   - will plan to transfuse 1u PRBC with HD tomorrow
   - Iron studies
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Trending down off steroids and ongoing ABx treatment.  Peak WBC had
   been 28, currently 11.
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - discontinued vori (was for possible invasive aspergilliosis, and may
   start alternative in the future)
   - cont amphotericin
   - f/u cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   - c.diff negative
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.  Received
   metoprolol today before HD
   - will clarify that patient should not receive BB on HD days,
   especially before HD.
   - plan to hold metoprolol 6hrs before HD, hold if SBP<120, hold 8am
   dose
   - consider midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN/Hypotension.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on
   captopril and amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **]
   beta-blocker given concurrent rhythm issues.  In ICU has had very
   labile hypertensive blood pressure
   - will control on metoprolol on non-HD days as per above
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:  Resolved.  HIT neg and resolving
   thrombocytopenia.  Daily CBC
   FEN: TF through NGT
   Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, PPI, stooling
   Dispo: ICU for now, will plan for acute care facility likely Monday

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, malnutrition, and dialysis dependence. She presented with recurrent respiratory distress due to right lower lobe lobar collapse. Her liver function tests (LFT) have been rising, and she has been diagnosed with ischemic hepatopathy. The patient is on liposomal amphoterocin for suspected invasive aspergilliosis, but her LFTs have caused the discontinuation of voriconazole. She also has anemia, leukocytosis, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypotension, and a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory failure and is expected to be transferred to an acute care facility on Monday morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic hepatopathy: The patient's liver function tests have been trending downward, indicating ongoing liver damage. It is important to continue monitoring liver enzymes and provide supportive care.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent lobar collapses and may require intubation again. It is crucial to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism due to known right upper extremity DVT.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been trending down, which needs to be addressed with appropriate management"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with fluctuations in vital signs and organ function. Recent interventions include the initiation of ambisome therapy, renal replacement therapy, and epogen administration. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube. Lab results indicate abnormalities in liver enzymes, kidney function, electrolytes, and coagulation parameters. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and there are indications of infection with elevated C-reactive protein levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These may include:

1. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and elevated C-reactive protein levels suggest the presence of an ongoing infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased heart rate, increased respiratory rate, and changes in white blood cell count, is crucial.

2. Hepatic dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) indicate hepatic dysfunction. Continued monitoring of liver function and appropriate management of hepatic complications will be necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   .
   #. Liver:
   Patient has had rising LFT
s with today in the thousands. Med effect
   vs. hypotensive/shock liver. Vori is discontinued, currently on
   liposomal amphoterocin. Will support pressures to keep SBP above 100.
   Downward trending LFT
s since period of hypotension.
   - Hepatology signed off.  LFT
s improving, likely related to ischemic
   liver
   - liver US with dopplers
 Normal right lobe of the liver, limited view
   of the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - ammonia nml
   - cont to trend LFT
   # AMS:
   Given timing with liver damage, likely related. [**Month (only) 51**] be encephalopathy
   vs. hypotension/hypoxia. CT scan negative.  Plan as above for liver.
   Continue to monitor for encephalopathy/signs of stroke.
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands today, vori is
   discontinued. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may
   ultimately require another intubation which she has stated she would
   want.  Will continue to remove fluid as possible with dialysis. Must
   also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation.  Improved
   respiratory status overall though today is tachypnic.  Now off
   steroids. CT sinus showing fluid in mastoids not concerning for
   invasive fungal disease there.
   - completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c on [**4-17**]
   - discontinued Voriconazole (D1 was [**4-16**]) due to LFT elevation
   - cont liposomal ampho (D1 was [**4-20**])
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - PT
   - failed speech and swallow eval.
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor.
   - minimize phlebotomy
   - will plan to transfuse 1u PRBC with HD tomorrow
   - Iron studies
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Trending down off steroids and ongoing ABx treatment.  Peak WBC had
   been 28, currently 11.
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - discontinued vori (was for possible invasive aspergilliosis, and may
   start alternative in the future)
   - cont amphotericin
   - f/u cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   - c.diff negative
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.  Received
   metoprolol today before HD
   - will clarify that patient should not receive BB on HD days,
   especially before HD.
   - plan to hold metoprolol 6hrs before HD, hold if SBP<120, hold 8am
   dose
   - consider midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN/Hypotension.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on
   captopril and amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **]
   beta-blocker given concurrent rhythm issues.  In ICU has had very
   labile hypertensive blood pressure
   - will control on metoprolol on non-HD days as per above
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:  Resolved.  HIT neg and resolving
   thrombocytopenia.  Daily CBC
   FEN: TF through NGT
   Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, PPI, stooling

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, malnutrition, and dialysis dependency. She presented with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe (RLL) lobar collapse. The cause of the RLL collapse is uncertain, with possible contributing factors including tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration with mucous plugging, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has been extubated and is now off steroids.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have been rising and are now in the thousands. This could be due to medication effects or hypotensive/shock liver. Voriconazole has been discontinued due to the elevated LFTs, and the patient is currently receiving liposomal amphotericin B. The patient's serum bilirubin levels are also elevated.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). She received a single dose of amiodarone (150mg) on 4/12 and was then placed on a continuous infusion of amiodarone at 1 then 0.5mg per hour. The patient's ectopy has improved, and she is now off the amiodarone drip, allowing her to auto-taper. It is important to avoid beta-blockers on dialysis days, especially before dialysis, as they may cause hypot"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori is discontinued.
   Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may ultimately require
   another intubation which she has stated she would want.  Will continue
   to remove fluid as possible with dialysis. Must also consider that some
   component of resp failure could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did
   not tolerate anticoagulation.  Tenuous respiratory status overall today
   and is visibly tired and tachypnic.  Now off steroids. CT sinus showing
   fluid in mastoids not concerning for invasive fungal disease there.
   - completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c on [**4-17**]
   - discontinued Voriconazole (D1 was [**4-16**]) due to LFT elevation
   - cont liposomal ampho (D1 was [**4-20**])
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - PT
   - failed speech and swallow eval.
   - consider non-invasive ventilation
   - resend ABG
   - consider repeat CT, though patient would not be able to tolerate the
   study at this time.
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.  Did not
   receive metoprolol today before HD
   - will plan for beta-blocker after HD to control afib
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol 6hrs before HD, hold if SBP<120, hold
   8am dose
   - consider midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN/Hypotension.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on
   captopril and amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **]
   beta-blocker given concurrent rhythm issues.  In ICU has had very
   labile hypertensive blood pressure but is hypotensive today
   - will control on metoprolol on non-HD days as per above
   - restart neo to maintain perfusion
   - replace a-line
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. Liver:
   Patient has had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Med effect vs.
   hypotensive/shock liver. Vori is discontinued, currently on liposomal
   amphoterocin. Will support pressures to keep SBP above 100.  Downward
   trending LFT
s since period of hypotension.
   - Hepatology signed off.  LFT
s improving, likely related to ischemic
   liver
   - liver US with dopplers
 Normal right lobe of the liver, limited view
   of the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - ammonia nml
   - cont to trend LFT
   # AMS:
   Given timing with liver damage, likely related. [**Month (only) 51**] be encephalopathy
   vs. hypotension/hypoxia. CT scan negative.  Plan as above for liver.
   Continue to monitor for encephalopathy/signs of stroke.
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor.
   - minimize phlebotomy
   - will plan to transfuse 1u PRBC with HD
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Trending down off steroids and ongoing ABx treatment.  Peak WBC had
   been 28, currently 11.
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - discontinued vori (was for possible invasive aspergilliosis, and may
   start alternative in the future)
   - cont amphotericin
   - f/u cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   - c.diff negative
   - could restart vori for long-term treatment of aspergilliosis
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:  Stable.  HIT neg and resolving
   thrombocytopenia.  Daily CBC
   FEN: TF through NGT
   Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, PPI, stooling

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and malnutrition.
- She is in the ICU for recurrent respiratory distress due to right lower lobe (RLL) lobar collapse, possibly secondary to tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- The patient has positive B-glucan and galactomannan assays, suggesting invasive aspergillosis. She was started on oral voriconazole but had elevated liver function tests (LFTs), so it was discontinued.
- The patient is currently on liposomal amphotericin B and has had recurrent episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) coinciding with dialysis.
- She also has atrial fibrillation (AFib) and has been experiencing labile blood pressure.
- Her LFTs were elevated but are now improving.
- The patient has anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right upper extremity (RUE).
- She is on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) three times a week and has been on dialysis since her recent colectomy.
- The patient has been extubated and is awake but non-verbal, tachypneic, opens eyes to command, and does not move"

   24 Hour Events:
   - During HD, patient became hypotensive and had increased HR to 150's.
   Was given back approximately 700cc but still had net 1500cc removed
   during HD.
   - Levophed was breifly started however after placement of A-line, BP
   was recorded in 130's and Levophed discontinued.
   - Patient was hyperventilating and appeared tired so was placed on mask
   ventilation PSV 15, PEEP 5 during the afternoon which she responded
   well to.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications that can arise. These complications include:

1. Hypotension and increased heart rate during hemodialysis (HD): The patient experienced hypotension and an elevated heart rate during HD. This indicates a potential complication related to fluid shifts or inadequate vascular access during the procedure.

2. Requirement for vasopressor support: The patient required the initiation of Levophed, a vasopressor medication, to maintain blood pressure. This suggests possible cardiovascular instability or poor perfusion.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was placed on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) due to hyperventilation and fatigue. The need for respiratory support indicates respiratory muscle weakness or impaired gas exchange.

4. Altered mental status: The patient is described as having an altered mental status, which may be due to various factors such as sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, or the effects of medications.

5. Liver function abnormalities: Abnormal liver function tests (ALT, AST, Alk Phos, Total Bilirubin) suggest potential liver dysfunction or injury.

6. Impaired skin integrity: The note mentions impaired skin integrity, which could be indicative of pressure ulcers or other skin complications related to immobility or poor perfusion.

7. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte and fluid balance is mentioned as abnormal, indicating a disturbance in electrolyte levels and fluid management.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori is discontinued.
   Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may ultimately require
   another intubation which she has stated she would want.  Will continue
   to remove fluid as possible with dialysis. Must also consider that some
   component of resp failure could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did
   not tolerate anticoagulation.  Tenuous respiratory status overall today
   and is visibly tired and tachypnic.  Now off steroids. CT sinus showing
   fluid in mastoids not concerning for invasive fungal disease there.
   - completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c on [**4-17**]
   - discontinued Voriconazole (D1 was [**4-16**]) due to LFT elevation
   - cont liposomal ampho (D1 was [**4-20**])
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - PT
   - failed speech and swallow eval.
   - consider non-invasive ventilation
   - resend ABG
   - consider repeat CT, though patient would not be able to tolerate the
   study at this time.
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.  Did not
   receive metoprolol today before HD
   - will plan for beta-blocker after HD to control afib
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol 6hrs before HD, hold if SBP<120, hold
   8am dose
   - consider midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN/Hypotension.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on
   captopril and amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **]
   beta-blocker given concurrent rhythm issues.  In ICU has had very
   labile hypertensive blood pressure but is hypotensive today
   - will control on metoprolol on non-HD days as per above
   - restart neo to maintain perfusion
   - replace a-line
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. Liver:
   Patient has had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Med effect vs.
   hypotensive/shock liver. Vori is discontinued, currently on liposomal
   amphoterocin. Will support pressures to keep SBP above 100.  Downward
   trending LFT
s since period of hypotension.
   - Hepatology signed off.  LFT
s improving, likely related to ischemic
   liver
   - liver US with dopplers
 Normal right lobe of the liver, limited view
   of the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - ammonia nml
   - cont to trend LFT
   # AMS:
   Given timing with liver damage, likely related. [**Month (only) 51**] be encephalopathy
   vs. hypotension/hypoxia. CT scan negative.  Plan as above for liver.
   Continue to monitor for encephalopathy/signs of stroke.
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor.
   - minimize phlebotomy
   - will plan to transfuse 1u PRBC with HD
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Trending down off steroids and ongoing ABx treatment.  Peak WBC had
   been 28, currently 11.
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - discontinued vori (was for possible invasive aspergilliosis, and may
   start alternative in the future)
   - cont amphotericin
   - f/u cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   - c.diff negative
   - could restart vori for long-term treatment of aspergilliosis
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress due to right lower lobe collapse. The patient has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and has undergone various interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress, possibly due to tuberculosis (TBM) or invasive aspergillosis. She has been started on oral voriconazole, but it was discontinued due to elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient's tenuous respiratory status may require another intubation.

2. NSVT/Afib: The patient has known atrial fibrillation (AFib) and experienced episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) during hemodialysis. She was given amiodarone, but ectopy improved, and the medication was tapered off. The patient will be monitored for any recurrence of ectopy.

3. Hypertension/Hypotension: The patient has labile hypertension and was on multiple antihypertensive medications. She is currently hypotensive and requires management of intravascular volume with hemodialysis and ultrafiltration.

4. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has rising LFTs, which may be related to ischemic liver injury or medication effects. Voriconazole was discontinued, and the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here
   with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse
   (?TBM vs aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued.
   Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may ultimately require
   another intubation which she has stated she would want.  Will continue
   to remove fluid as possible with dialysis. Must also consider that some
   component of resp failure could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did
   not tolerate anticoagulation.  Tenuous respiratory status overall today
   and is visibly tired and tachypnic.  Now off steroids. CT sinus showing
   fluid in mastoids not concerning for invasive fungal disease there. Did
   benefit from periodic BIPAP yesterday. Has new MRSA growing in sputum.
   - completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c
d on [**4-17**]
   - gave vanc dose for MRSA in sputum, this will last until dialysis
   Monday, check vanc level. Will need to decide over the weekend whether
   to commit to another course of vanc
   - initially discontinued Voriconazole (D1 was [**4-16**]) due to LFT elevation
   now LFT
s normal and will restart vori today ([**4-24**], see below)
   - d/c liposomal ampho (D1 was [**4-20**])
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - PT
   - failed speech and swallow eval.
   - consider non-invasive ventilation, CPAP today at 5 and can go up as
   needed
   - resend ABG
   - consider repeat CT, though patient would not be able to tolerate the
   study at this time.
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:  Dropped today.  HIT neg. Possibly due to
   Amphoterocin.
   - Discontinue amphoterocin and restart vori as LFT
s have improved.
   - cont to monitor
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.  Did not
   receive metoprolol on [**4-23**] before HD
   - will plan for beta-blocker as needed after HD to control afib
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol 6hrs before HD, hold if SBP<120, hold
   8am dose
   - midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN/Hypotension.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on
   captopril and amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **]
   beta-blocker given concurrent rhythm issues.  In ICU has had very
   labile hypertensive blood pressure but is hypotensive
   today/normotensive today
   - will control on metoprolol as needed on non-HD days as per above
   - can restart neo as needed to maintain perfusion
   - maintain a-line for now
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. Liver:
   Patient has had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Med effect vs.
   hypotensive/shock liver. Vori was discontinued, and liposomal
   amphoterocin started. Will cont to support pressures to keep SBP above
   100.  Downward trending LFT
s since period of hypotension.  Now today
   has low platlets, concerning for Amphoterocin effect
   - Hepatology signed off.  LFT
s improving, likely related to ischemic
   liver
   - liver US with dopplers
 Normal right lobe of the liver, limited view
   of the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - ammonia nml
   - cont to trend LFT
   - discontinue amphoterocin and restart vori due to concern for low
   platlets, now that LFT
s are improving vori is restarted
   # AMS:
   Given timing with liver damage, likely related. [**Month (only) 51**] be encephalopathy
   vs. hypotension/hypoxia. CT scan negative.  Plan as above for liver.
   Continue to monitor for encephalopathy/signs of stroke.
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor. Transfused 1u PRBC with HD on [**4-23**].
   - minimize phlebotomy
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Trending down off steroids and ongoing ABx treatment.  Peak WBC had
   been 28. c.diff negative
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - back on vori (for possible invasive aspergilliosis)
   - discontinue amphotericin
   - f/u cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights
   - d/c foley as does not make significant urine

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress. She has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension/hypotension, liver dysfunction, altered mental status, anemia, leukocytosis, and a right lower lobe lung collapse. The patient has been treated with various medications and interventions, including antibiotics, antifungal agents, and hemodialysis. She has also had a central venous catheter placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of recurrent respiratory distress, and her current condition may lead to further respiratory failure. Intubation may be required if her respiratory status worsens.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped, which could be due to medication side effects or other factors. Close monitoring of platelet levels is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has known atrial fibrillation, and her condition may exacerbate this condition. Beta-blockers may be used to control heart rate and rhythm.
4. Hypertension/Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and she is currently hypotensive. Management of blood pressure is essential to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
5. Liver Dysfunction: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has a history of acute respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary to ensure adequate gas exchange.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)/Renal Failure: The patient's urine output is significantly reduced at 33 mL over 24 hours, indicating possible renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolytes, and renal function tests is crucial.

3. Liver Dysfunction: Abnormal liver function tests (elevated ALT, AST, Alk Phos, and total bilirubin) suggest liver impairment. Monitoring liver enzymes and bilirubin levels is essential.

4. Coagulopathy: The prolonged PT/INR and elevated D-dimer indicate a bleeding risk. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and close observation for signs of bleeding are necessary.

5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has imbalances in sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels. Frequent electrolyte monitoring and appropriate correction measures are required.

6. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia and may be at risk for developing further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections. Regular cultures and surveillance for infection signs are necessary.

7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):"

The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation since April 23rd and had an arterial line placed on the same day. The patient's vital signs show hypothermia with a maximum temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius and a current temperature of 35.2 degrees Celsius. Blood pressure is within normal range, but heart rate and respiratory rate are slightly elevated. Oxygen saturation is at 100%. The patient's weight remains unchanged since admission. Fluid balance shows a total input of 961 mL, with 287 mL given intravenously, 564 mL taken through total parenteral nutrition, and 33 mL of urine output. Blood products were transfused with a total output of 883 mL and 50 mL of chest tube output. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume of 562 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen at 70%, and peak inspiratory pressure at 21 cmH2O. Arterial blood gas results are within normal limits. Physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral vascular status, skin,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, cardiac dysrhythmia, respiratory distress, acute renal failure, and a history of bacteremia. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation, arterial line, and dialysis catheter. The patient's vital signs are stable with controlled blood pressure and oxygen saturation, but they remain within normal limits. The patient's weight is unchanged from admission. Fluid balance shows a total input of 961 mL and total output of 883 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 78 mL. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, anti-fungal medication, and other ICU medications. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, lactate, D-dimer, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits except for low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows normal oxygenation and ventilation parameters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed DVT in the upper extremity. This can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creat"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory distress, possibly due to lower lobe volume loss and a suspected invasive aspergillus infection or staphylococcus infection in the sputum. The patient received vancomycin last night and will continue with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) and return to voriconazole. The patient also has liver function abnormalities, which are improving and seem to be ischemic in origin. There is ongoing concern for acute renal failure, and the patient will continue with dialysis while holding anti-hypertensives on dialysis days. Additionally, the patient has thrombocytopenia, likely due to Amphoteracin B (ampho), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, for which anticoagulation is not possible. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen if the suspected invasive aspergillus infection or staphylococcus infection in the sputum is not effectively treated. This could lead to further respiratory compromise and potential failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure could progress if the underlying cause is not identified and addressed. Continued dialysis may be necessary to manage the patient's renal function.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   .
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued.
   Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient may ultimately require
   another intubation which she has stated she would want.  Will continue
   to remove fluid as possible with dialysis. Must also consider that some
   component of resp failure could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did
   not tolerate anticoagulation.  Tenuous respiratory status overall today
   and is visibly tired and tachypnic.  Now off steroids. CT sinus showing
   fluid in mastoids not concerning for invasive fungal disease there. Did
   benefit from periodic BIPAP yesterday. Has new MRSA growing in sputum.
   - completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c
d on [**4-17**]
   - gave vanc dose for MRSA in sputum, this will last until dialysis
   Monday, check vanc level. Will need to decide over the weekend whether
   to commit to another course of vanc
   - initially discontinued Voriconazole (D1 was [**4-16**]) due to LFT elevation
   now LFT
s normal and will restart vori today ([**4-24**], see below)
   - d/c liposomal ampho (D1 was [**4-20**])
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - PT
   - failed speech and swallow eval.
   - consider non-invasive ventilation, CPAP today at 5 and can go up as
   needed
   - resend ABG
   - consider repeat CT, though patient would not be able to tolerate the
   study at this time.
   #.  Thrombocytopenia.:  Dropped today.  HIT neg. Possibly due to
   Amphoterocin.
   - Discontinue amphoterocin and restart vori as LFT
s have improved.
   - cont to monitor
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.  Did not
   receive metoprolol on [**4-23**] before HD
   - will plan for beta-blocker as needed after HD to control afib
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol 6hrs before HD, hold if SBP<120, hold
   8am dose
   - midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN/Hypotension.  On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on
   captopril and amlodipine here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **]
   beta-blocker given concurrent rhythm issues.  In ICU has had very
   labile hypertensive blood pressure but is hypotensive
   today/normotensive today
   - will control on metoprolol as needed on non-HD days as per above
   - can restart neo as needed to maintain perfusion
   - maintain a-line for now
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. Liver:
   Patient has had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Med effect vs.
   hypotensive/shock liver. Vori was discontinued, and liposomal
   amphoterocin started. Will cont to support pressures to keep SBP above
   100.  Downward trending LFT
s since period of hypotension.  Now today
   has low platlets, concerning for Amphoterocin effect
   - Hepatology signed off.  LFT
s improving, likely related to ischemic
   liver
   - liver US with dopplers
 Normal right lobe of the liver, limited view
   of the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - ammonia nml
   - cont to trend LFT
   - discontinue amphoterocin and restart vori due to concern for low
   platlets, now that LFT
s are improving vori is restarted
   # AMS:
   Given timing with liver damage, likely related. [**Month (only) 51**] be encephalopathy
   vs. hypotension/hypoxia. CT scan negative.  Plan as above for liver.
   Continue to monitor for encephalopathy/signs of stroke.
   #. Anemia: Has been trending down. Not currently concerned for bleeding
   however will continue to monitor. Transfused 1u PRBC with HD on [**4-23**].
   - minimize phlebotomy
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Trending down off steroids and ongoing ABx treatment.  Peak WBC had
   been 28. c.diff negative
   - s/p vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - back on vori (for possible invasive aspergilliosis)
   - discontinue amphotericin
   - f/u cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights
   - d/c foley as does not make significant urine

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and malnutrition. She is currently in the ICU for recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe collapse. She has a known diagnosis of tuberculosis but has also shown positive results for glucan/galactomannan, suggesting possible invasive aspergilliosis. The patient has been treated with various medications including voriconazole, which was discontinued due to elevated liver function tests (LFTs). She also received liposomal amphotericin but developed thrombocytopenia, possibly related to the medication. The patient's LFTs are now improving, and voriconazole has been restarted. She is also being treated for MRSA in her sputum and has completed courses of vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is on dialysis for end-stage renal disease and has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She has labile blood pressure, requiring careful management, and has had episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and atrial fibrillation. Her platelet count is low, and she has signs of liver damage but is expected to recover. The patient's WBC count is elevated but trending down, and she is at risk for Clostridium difficile infection. She is also at risk for pulmonary embolism due to her D"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to pneumonia. The patient has a history of altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, impaired skin integrity, electrolyte and fluid disorder, deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremity, pain control, cardiac dysrhythmia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and bacteremia.

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already suspected to have sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is on CPAP support and has a low oxygen saturation level. If not managed properly, this can progress to severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate potential renal dysfunction. This can worsen if not managed appropriately and may require dialysis.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT in the upper extremity. If not treated with appropriate anticoagulation, there is a risk of clot extension or pulmonary embolism.
5. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes suggest liver dysfunction. If not managed properly, it can lead to further liver damage and complications.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has imbalances in sodium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, impaired skin integrity, electrolyte and fluid disorder, deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremity, pain control, cardiac dysrhythmia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and bacteremia. The patient is currently receiving voriconazole for an unidentified infection, CPAP/PSV for respiratory support, and tube feeds for nutrition. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, blood pressure ranging from 124/43 to 108/33 mmHg, heart rate between 89-100 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, liver enzymes, and lactate levels. The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds, distant heart sounds, cool extremities, and anasarca. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ dysfunction. Potential medical complications include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, sepsis secondary to bacteremia, and potential bleeding due to prolonged PTT and INR."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**].
   Completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c
d on [**4-17**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient
   may ultimately require another intubation which she has stated she
   would want.  Will continue to remove fluid as possible with dialysis.
   Must also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation. On periodic
   CPAP Has new MRSA growing in sputum.
   - Vanc dosing at HD protocol
   - Continue voriconazole
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - consider non-invasive ventilation, CPAP at 8 as needed today
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets have dropped acutely from 118 5 days ago to 55 today. HIT
   neg. Possibly due to Amphoterocin. No drop in HCT to suggest TTP,
   though should check a smear.
   - Add-on smear to morning labs
   - Discontinue amphoterocin and restart vori as LFT
s have improved.
   - cont to monitor
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.  Did not
   receive metoprolol on [**4-23**] before HD
   - will plan for beta-blocker as needed after HD to control afib
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol 6hrs before HD, hold if SBP<120, hold
   8am dose
   - midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN/Hypotension:
   On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and amlodipine
   here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given concurrent
   rhythm issues.  In ICU has had labile blood pressure. Normotensive this
   AM.
   - will control on metoprolol as needed on non-HD days as per above
   - can restart neo as needed to maintain perfusion
   - maintain a-line for now
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. Liver:
   Patient had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Though to be shock
   liver due to hypotension following HD. Vori was discontinued, and
   liposomal amphoterocin started. Now that liver enzymes have recovered
   to ALT = 410, AST = 60 have discontinued amphoterocin andrestarted
   voriconazole. Will cont to support pressures to keep SBP above 100.
   Liver ultrasound showed normal right lobe of the liver, limited view of
   the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - cont to trend LFTs now that voriconazole restarted
   # AMS:
   Appears to be related to periods of hypotension.
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Peak WBC had been 28. Is 15 today and has been fluctuating in last 5
   days. Is now back on voriconazole for invasive aspergillosis. Also
   restarted Vancomycin for MRSA positive sputum.
   - follow-up cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress. She was admitted with respiratory failure secondary to right lower lobe collapse, possibly due to tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration with mucous plugging, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has positive glucan/galactomannan and a CT scan showing diffuse disease, possibly invasive aspergillosis. She completed a course of vancomycin and cefepime for HAP but discontinued due to elevated liver function tests. Voriconazole was initially started on 4/15 but discontinued due to elevated LFTs and restarted on 4/24. The patient's platelet count has dropped acutely from 118 to 55, possibly due to amphoterocin. Her known atrial fibrillation has improved with amiodarone. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE), but was intolerant of anticoagulation. She is on hemodialysis three times a week and is being closely monitored for various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress, and may ultimately require another intubation.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped acutely from 118 to 55, possibly due to amphoterocin.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has known atrial fibrillation, which has improved with amiodarone.
4. Hypertension/hypotension: The patient has labile blood pressure and is being managed with medications and adjustments to dialysis.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient had rising liver enzymes, which have now recovered, and voriconazole was restarted after discontinuing amphoterocin.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE), but was intolerant of anticoagulation.
7. Chronic kidney disease: The patient is on hemodialysis three times a week and is being closely monitored for any changes in renal function."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications. 

1. The patient has hypotension, which has improved. It is important to continue monitoring blood pressure.
2. There are liver function abnormalities that are improving and are believed to be ischemic in origin. The patient is tolerating voriconazole well.
3. Thrombocytopenia has developed, possibly due to the off of ampho (amphotericin B) and may be consumptive.
4. The patient has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity and is unable to be anticoagulated.
5. The patient is experiencing respiratory distress related to lower lobe volume loss, possibly due to invasive aspergillus infection or staphylococcus infection in the sputum. The patient received vancomycin last night and will continue on CPAP. Voriconazole will be restarted.
6. The patient has acute renal failure, which will continue with hemodialysis (HD). Anti-hypertensives will be held on HD days.
7. The patient has anemia, which was transfused two days ago and is now stable.
8. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition with Nutren 2.0 (Full) at 40 mL/hour, glycemic control, and various lines such as a PICC line, dialysis catheter, and arterial line.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, respiratory distress, acute renal failure, anemia, and possible pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAF). The patient is currently receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU, including CPAP for respiratory support, voriconazole for suspected invasive aspergillus infection, vancomycin for staphylococcus infection, hemodialysis for acute renal failure, and transfusions for anemia. The patient's vital signs are generally stable, although there have been fluctuations in blood pressure and temperature. The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in liver function tests, platelet count, kidney function, and electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible liver dysfunction. This could lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, or hepatotoxicity from medications.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding or bruising. Close monitoring of bleeding parameters and potential transfusion may be necessary.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed a DVT in the upper extremity. If left untreated, it can lead to pulmonary embol"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**].
   Completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c
d on [**4-17**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient
   may ultimately require another intubation which she has stated she
   would want.  Will continue to remove fluid as possible with dialysis.
   Must also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation. On periodic
   CPAP Has new MRSA growing in sputum.
   - Vanc dosing at HD protocol
   - Continue voriconazole
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - consider non-invasive ventilation, CPAP at 8 as needed today
   #. HTN/Hypotension:
   On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and amlodipine
   here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given concurrent
   rhythm issues.  In ICU has had labile blood pressure.  Significant
   labile BP
s with HD, this AM with hypotension  requiring Neo for BP
   support despite Midodrine given prior to HD.
   - will d/w renal options for better BP control during HD.
   - will control on metoprolol as needed on non-HD days as per above
   - Neo for BP control during HD
   - maintain a-line for now
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets have dropped acutely from 118 5 days ago to 55 today. HIT
   neg. Possibly due to Amphoterocin. No drop in HCT to suggest TTP,
   though should check a smear.
   - Add-on smear to morning labs
   - cont Voriconazole
   - daily LFT
   - cont to monitor
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.  Did not
   receive metoprolol on [**4-23**] before HD
   - will plan for beta-blocker as needed after HD to control afib
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol 6hrs before HD, hold if SBP<120, hold
   8am dose
   - midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. Liver:
   Patient had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Though to be shock
   liver due to hypotension following HD. Vori was discontinued, and
   liposomal amphoterocin started. Now that liver enzymes have recovered
   to ALT = 410, AST = 60 have discontinued amphoterocin andrestarted
   voriconazole. Will cont to support pressures to keep SBP above 100.
   Liver ultrasound showed normal right lobe of the liver, limited view of
   the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - cont to trend LFTs now that voriconazole restarted
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Peak WBC had been 28. Is 15 today and has been fluctuating in last 5
   days. Is now back on voriconazole for invasive aspergillosis. Also
   restarted Vancomycin for MRSA positive sputum.
   - follow-up cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.  Patient with new complaint of bilateral calf pain
   this AM, exam without swelling or cellulitis.
   - BLE U/S for r/o DVT
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to right lower lobe collapse, possibly secondary to tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). 

The patient has been treated with voriconazole for invasive aspergillosis, but it was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes and then restarted. She is currently on liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) for fungal infection. The patient also has MRSA growing in her sputum and is being treated with vancomycin.

The patient's blood pressure has been labile, with episodes of hypotension requiring Neo for support. This could be related to her underlying heart failure or the hemodialysis procedure. 

The patient's platelet count has dropped acutely from 118 to 55, possibly due to Amphoterocin. Her thrombocytopenia should be monitored closely.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). She has received amiodarone for rhythm control but is being tapered off due to her tenuous pulmonary status.

The patient's liver enzymes were elevated in the thousands but have now recovered. She had a liver ultrasound showing no abnormalities.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) now extubated.
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**].
   Completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c
d on [**4-17**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient
   may ultimately require another intubation which she has stated she
   would want.  Will continue to remove fluid as possible with dialysis.
   Must also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation. On periodic
   CPAP Has new MRSA growing in sputum.
   - Vanc dosing at HD protocol
   - Continue voriconazole
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - consider non-invasive ventilation, CPAP at 8 as needed today
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets have dropped acutely from 118 5 days ago to 55 today. HIT
   neg. Possibly due to Amphoterocin. No drop in HCT to suggest TTP,
   though should check a smear.
   - Add-on smear to morning labs
   - Discontinue amphoterocin and restart vori as LFT
s have improved.
   - cont to monitor
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.  Did not
   receive metoprolol on [**4-23**] before HD
   - will plan for beta-blocker as needed after HD to control afib
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol 6hrs before HD, hold if SBP<120, hold
   8am dose
   - midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. HTN/Hypotension:
   On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and amlodipine
   here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given concurrent
   rhythm issues.  In ICU has had labile blood pressure. Normotensive this
   AM.
   - will control on metoprolol as needed on non-HD days as per above
   - can restart neo as needed to maintain perfusion
   - maintain a-line for now
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #. Liver:
   Patient had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Though to be shock
   liver due to hypotension following HD. Vori was discontinued, and
   liposomal amphoterocin started. Now that liver enzymes have recovered
   to ALT = 410, AST = 60 have discontinued amphoterocin andrestarted
   voriconazole. Will cont to support pressures to keep SBP above 100.
   Liver ultrasound showed normal right lobe of the liver, limited view of
   the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - cont to trend LFTs now that voriconazole restarted
   # AMS:
   Appears to be related to periods of hypotension.
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Peak WBC had been 28. Is 15 today and has been fluctuating in last 5
   days. Is now back on voriconazole for invasive aspergillosis. Also
   restarted Vancomycin for MRSA positive sputum.
   - follow-up cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, recurrent respiratory distress, and known right lower lobe lung collapse. She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and is currently extubated. The patient has been diagnosed with invasive aspergillosis and has been treated with voriconazole, which was temporarily discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes and restarted later. She also has a new MRSA infection in her sputum and is receiving vancomycin.

The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count dropping from 118 to 55 today. HIT is negative, and it is suspected that amphotericin may be the cause of the drop in platelet count. The patient has been on hemodialysis since her recent colectomy and is scheduled to receive dialysis on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress. She has a known diagnosis of tuberculosis but the left-sided lesion is distal to stent. She has positive glucan/galactomannan and a CT scan showing diffuse disease, possibly invasive aspergillosis. Voriconazole was started on 04-15 but was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes. Ambisome was started, and voriconazole was restarted on 04-24. The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, impaired skin integrity, electrolyte and fluid disorder, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, pain control (acute and chronic pain), cardiac dysrhythmia, respiratory failure (not ARDS), renal failure (acute renal failure/ARF), history of bacteremia, and other issues.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/38 to 140/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on BiPAP.

The patient has received various treatments and interventions, including nutrition support, glycemic control, arterial line placement, dialysis catheter placement, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood glucose, liver enzymes, kidney function markers, coagulation profile, and other parameters.

It is important to note that the patient's condition is complex, and further assessment and management are required to address each of the identified medical complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of acute respiratory failure, weakness, and chronic conditions such as end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, congestive heart failure, and chronic diastolic failure. The patient was admitted with multifactorial respiratory failure and has been treated for fungal pneumonia, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia, and continues on hemodialysis. The patient has had frequent episodes of hypotension, especially during hemodialysis, for which she requires neorelogical support. The patient's liver function tests were increased last week but are believed to be secondary to shock liver. The patient has now been extubated and is doing well overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right upper extremity: The patient complains of calf pain, which could be a sign of DVT. However, she is not receiving heparin due to a high bleeding risk.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has been extubated for one week and at times looks tenuous but has been overall stable.
3. Hypotension: The patient experiences hypotension associated with hemodialysis. She is receiving midodrine and neorelogical support during HD.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for fungal pneumonia and MRSA pneumonia.
5. Chronic renal failure: The patient is on hemodialysis due"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of acute respiratory failure, chronic renal failure on hemodialysis, chronic heart failure, and end-stage renal disease. She has been admitted to the ICU for multifactorial respiratory failure with intermittent hypotension, especially during hemodialysis, weakness, and acute tubular necrosis. The patient has been extubated and treated for fungal pneumonia, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, and continues on hemodialysis. She is currently doing well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and decreased venous return. Although she complains of calf pain, she is not receiving heparin due to a high bleeding risk. Close monitoring and assessment for signs of DVT are necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure and is at risk for further respiratory complications. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and effort is required.
3. Hypotension: The patient experiences hypotension associated with hemodialysis. Close monitoring of blood pressure and administration of midodrine and neosulfocystamine during HD are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for fungal pneumonia and MRSA pneumonia. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including liver dysfunction, kidney failure, electrolyte imbalance, deep vein thrombosis, cardiac dysrhythmia, respiratory failure, and chronic pain. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to worsening symptoms and required invasive ventilation after experiencing hypotension, back pain, and worsening ABGs. The patient underwent dialysis but became hypotensive again, necessitating the administration of Levophed. The patient also complained of pain, for which low-dose morphine and a Lidocaine patch were initiated. The patient's ABGs continued to worsen, leading to intubation at around 11 pm. Throughout the night, the patient experienced episodes of decreased blood pressure requiring an increase in Neo and fluid boluses. Non-invasive ventilation was attempted but ultimately unsuccessful, prompting the switch to invasive ventilation. The patient's allergies include Linezolid and Penicillin G. Current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, phenylephrine, and morphine sulfate. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/31 to 164/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 1,443 mL in and 1,419 mL out"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) extubated and now reintubated.
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**].
   Completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c
d on [**4-17**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient
   ultimately required another intubation overnight ([**4-26**]) which she
   agreed to.  Will continue to remove fluid as possible with dialysis.
   Must also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation. On periodic
   CPAP Has MRSA growing in sputum.
   - cont vent, did not tolerate increased PEEP from BP standpoint
   - Vanc dosing at HD protocol
   - Continue voriconazole
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - consider trach and PEG, will need to discuss goals of care with
   family.
   #. HTN/Hypotension:
   On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and amlodipine
   here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given concurrent
   rhythm issues.  In ICU has had labile blood pressure.  Significant
   labile BP
s with HD, this AM with hypotension  requiring Neo as well as
   fluid boluses for BP support. Will possibly need two pressors at some
   point.
   - will d/w renal options for better BP control during HD.
   - will rate control on metoprolol as needed on non-HD days as per above
   - Neo for BP control
   - maintain a-line for now
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   - will discuss plan for two pressors, including access issues as she
   only has double lumen PICC at this time.
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets had dropped acutely from 118 5 days ago to 55. HIT neg.
   Possibly due to Amphoterocin which is now discontinued and platelets
   are up again. No drop in HCT to suggest TTP.
   - cont Voriconazole
   - daily LFT
   - cont to monitor
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.  Not
   receiving metoprolol before HD
   - will plan for beta-blocker as needed after HD to control afib
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol 6hrs before HD, hold if SBP<120, hold
   8am dose
   - midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120
   - can restart amio and consider longer-term amio if ectopy returns
   #. Liver:
   Patient had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Though to be shock
   liver due to hypotension following HD. Vori was discontinued, and
   liposomal amphoterocin started. Now that liver enzymes have recovered
   to ALT = 410, AST = 60 have discontinued amphoterocin andrestarted
   voriconazole. Will cont to support pressures to keep SBP above 100.
   Liver ultrasound showed normal right lobe of the liver, limited view of
   the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - cont to trend LFTs now that voriconazole restarted
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Peak WBC had been 28. Is 16.8 today and has been fluctuating in last 5
   days. Is now back on voriconazole for invasive aspergillosis. Also
   restarted Vancomycin for MRSA positive sputum.
   - follow-up cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and malnutrition. She is currently in the ICU for recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe collapse, possibly due to tuberculosis, aspiration, or hospital-acquired pneumonia. She has been intubated multiple times and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient has positive glucan/galactomannan and CT findings consistent with invasive aspergillosis, for which she was initially treated with voriconazole but had elevated liver function tests leading to its discontinuation. She was then started on amphotericin B but restarted on voriconazole after liver enzymes improved. She also has MRSA growing in her sputum.

The patient has labile blood pressure requiring multiple pressors and fluid boluses during hemodialysis. She has thrombocytopenia, likely due to amphotericin B, which improved with discontinuation of the drug. She also has known atrial fibrillation with episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) coinciding with dialysis. She was given amiodarone but is currently off the medication. Her liver enzymes were significantly elevated but have since improved, allowing for the restart of voriconazole.

Other findings include leukocytosis, likely due to ongoing infection, and a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) seen on ultrasound. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, worsening ABGs, tachypnea, and intubation. They have also had episodes of decreased BP requiring increased Neo and fluid boluses. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation, but was switched to invasive ventilation due to worsening respiratory status. The patient has allergies to Linezolid and Penicillin G, and received the last dose of Vancomycin on 04/26/2190 at 04:00 PM. The patient is receiving several infusions and medications in the ICU, including Fentanyl, Midazolam, Phenylephrine, and Morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing repeated episodes of hypotension, which may indicate a cardiovascular issue such as heart failure or septic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening ABGs and tachypnea suggest a respiratory failure, possibly due to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pulmonary edema.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate possible renal dysfunction, potentially secondary to sepsis or hypotension.
4. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, indicating possible hepatic involvement due to sepsis or multiorgan dysfunction syndrome.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) extubated and now reintubated.
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**].
   Completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c
d on [**4-17**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient
   ultimately required another intubation overnight ([**4-26**]) which she
   agreed to.  Will continue to remove fluid as possible with dialysis.
   Must also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation. On periodic
   CPAP Has MRSA growing in sputum.
   - cont vent, did not tolerate increased PEEP from BP standpoint
   - Vanc dosing at HD protocol
   - Continue voriconazole
   - start meropenem
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - start stress dose steroid
   - will need additional access
   - consider trach and PEG, will need to discuss goals of care with
   family.
   #. HTN/Hypotension:
   On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and amlodipine
   here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given concurrent
   rhythm issues.  In ICU has had labile blood pressure.  Significant
   labile BP
s with HD, this AM with hypotension  requiring Neo as well as
   fluid boluses for BP support. Will possibly need two pressors at some
   point.
   - Neo and levo for BP control
   - will need additional access (currently on two-lumen PICC), no
   peripherals. Does have HD catheter
   - maintain a-line for now
   - will d/w renal options for better BP control during HD.
   - will rate control on metoprolol as needed on non-HD days as per above
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets had dropped acutely from 118 5 days ago to 55. HIT neg.
   Possibly due to Amphoterocin which is now discontinued and platelets
   are up again. No drop in HCT to suggest TTP.
   - cont Voriconazole
   - daily LFT
   - cont to monitor
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.  Not
   receiving metoprolol. Currently on pressors.
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol for now
   - midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120 (though currently on pressors)
   - will plan for beta-blocker as needed after HD to control afib (though
   currently on pressors)
   #. Liver:
   Patient had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Though to be shock
   liver due to hypotension following HD. Vori was discontinued, and
   liposomal amphoterocin started. Now that liver enzymes have recovered
   to ALT = 410, AST = 60 have discontinued amphoterocin andrestarted
   voriconazole. Will cont to support pressures to keep SBP above 100.
   Liver ultrasound showed normal right lobe of the liver, limited view of
   the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - cont to trend LFTs now that voriconazole restarted
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Peak WBC had been 28. Is 16.8 today and has been fluctuating in last 5
   days. Is now back on voriconazole for invasive aspergillosis. Also
   restarted Vancomycin for MRSA positive sputum.
   - follow-up cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, malnutrition, recurrent respiratory distress, and suspected tuberculosis with positive glucan/galactomannan. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to respiratory failure, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, liver dysfunction, leukocytosis, and right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient has undergone several interventions including intubation, hemodialysis, antibiotic therapy, antifungal therapy, and stress dose steroids. Her current condition remains unstable with ongoing hypotension, need for pressors, and fluid management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent respiratory distress and lobar collapse suggest a high risk of continued respiratory failure. Factors such as mucous plugging, aspiration, or infection (e.g., pneumonia or tuberculosis) may contribute to this complication. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.

2. Hypotension: The patient's labile blood pressure and requirement for pressors indicate a significant risk of hypotension. Close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic status is crucial. Adjustments in fluid management and vasopressor therapy may be necessary.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped acutely, which can increase the risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and sepsis. She has been admitted to the ICU and requires mechanical ventilation due to worsening respiratory status. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring increasing doses of vasopressors and the addition of meropenem for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient's prognosis is very poor, and the chances of her ever getting home are minimal. The family has been informed about her condition and the limited benefits of aggressive care, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray suggests the development of VAP. This is a common complication in patients on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. VAP increases the risk of mortality and requires appropriate antibiotic therapy, such as the addition of meropenem in this case.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been dropping continuously, necessitating the use of vasopressors like neosynephrine and levophed. Hypotension in critically ill patients can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and contribute to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient"

   chances of her ever getting home are minimal.    Addressed whether she
   would want us to go on with aggressive care given this and whether CPR

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient's condition has worsened over the course of the day, requiring intubation and the use of two pressors (neosynephrine and levophed) to maintain blood pressure. The patient also has a new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's prognosis is described as very poor, with minimal chances of going home due to severe illness, multiple complications, and end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. The family is being consulted regarding goals of care, including the decision to continue aggressive treatment or pursue comfort measures only, considering the unlikely benefit of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is an increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is suspected based on the new infiltrate seen on chest X-ray.
2. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, and the worsening condition may indicate progression or inadequate management of the infection.
3. Hypotension: Despite the use of neosynephrine and levophed, the patient continues to experience hypotension, indicating inadequate blood pressure control and potential organ hypoperfusion.
4. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP):"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient was initially on non-invasive ventilation but required invasive ventilation due to worsening respiratory status. The patient also experienced hypotension, which necessitated the use of vasopressors such as neosynephrine and levophed.

The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient has allergies to linezolid and penicillin G. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. Blood cultures were taken on 04/25/2190 at 07:47 AM and 04/26/2190 at 04:40 AM, with subsequent results showing an increase in white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, liver enzymes, lactate, and D-dimer, along with low albumin and leukocyte count. Chest X-ray revealed a new right lower lobe infiltrate, suggesting a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's condition is critical, and the prognosis is poor. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further deterioration of renal function."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) extubated and now reintubated.
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**] and
   again today with elevated LFT
s. [**Month (only) 51**] be repeat shock liver however Vori
   is again discontinued and Ambisome restarted. Has completed course for
   HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) on [**4-17**]. Due to
   multiple respiratory problems, patient ultimately required another
   intubation overnight ([**4-26**]) which she agreed to.  Will continue to
   remove fluid as possible with dialysis though this does cause large
   blood pressure swings. Must also consider that some component of resp
   failure could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate
   anticoagulation. On periodic CPAP Has MRSA growing in sputum. Now back
   on vanc for g+ve cocci on sputum from [**4-27**].
   - cont vent, did not tolerate increased PEEP from BP standpoint
   - Vanc dosing at HD protocol
   - Continue ambisome (watch platlets)
   - cont meropenem
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - cont stress dose steroid
   - consider trach and PEG, will need to discuss goals of care with
   family.
   #. HTN/Hypotension:
   On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and amlodipine
   here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given concurrent
   rhythm issues.  In ICU has had labile blood pressure.  Significant
   labile BP
s with HD requiring Neo as well as periodic Levophed and
   fluid boluses for BP support.
   - Neo and levo for BP control
   - maintain a-line for now
   - will d/w renal options for better BP control during HD.
   - will rate control with metoprolol as needed
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets had dropped acutely from 118 5 days ago to 55. HIT neg.
   Possibly due to Amphoterocin which was briefly discontinued and
   platelets went up. No drop in HCT to suggest TTP, and today ambisome is
   restarted due to rising LFT
s while on vori
   - cont Ambisome for now and monitor platlets closely
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. would
   try to avoid amio especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   Attempted anticoagulation was not tolerated by patient due to epistaxis
   and IV site bleeding.  Not receiving metoprolol. Currently on pressors.
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol for now
   - midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120 (though currently on pressors)
   - will plan for beta-blocker as needed after HD to control afib (though
   currently on pressors)
   #. Liver:
   Patient had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Though to be shock
   liver due to hypotension following HD. Vori was discontinued, and
   liposomal amphoterocin started. After liver enzymes recovered,
   discontinued amphoterocin and restarted voriconazole. Today
   Amphotericin is restarted and vori discontinued due to rising LFTs.
   Will cont to support pressures to keep SBP above 100. Previous liver
   ultrasound showed normal right lobe of the liver, limited view of the
   left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are consistent
   with parenchymal disease.
   - cont to trend LFTs
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Peak WBC had been 28. Is 22.8 today and has been fluctuating. Is now
   back on amphotericin for invasive aspergillosis. Also restarted
   Vancomycin for g+ve cocci in sputum.
   - follow-up cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, normally HD MWF; will likely miss HD today but
   may require CVVH in future.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) extubated and now reintubated.
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**].
   Completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]), both d/c
d on [**4-17**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient
   ultimately required another intubation overnight ([**4-26**]) which she
   agreed to.  Will continue to remove fluid as possible with dialysis.
   Must also consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from
   known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation. On periodic
   CPAP Has MRSA growing in sputum.
   - cont vent, did not tolerate increased PEEP from BP standpoint
   - Vanc dosing at HD protocol
   - Continue voriconazole
   - start meropenem
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - start stress dose steroid
   - will need additional access
   - consider trach and PEG, will need to discuss goals of care with
   family.
   #. HTN/Hypotension:
   On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and amlodipine
   here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given concurrent
   rhythm issues.  In ICU has had labile blood pressure.  Significant
   labile BP
s with HD, this AM with hypotension  requiring Neo as well as
   fluid boluses for BP support. Will possibly need two pressors at some
   point.
   - Neo and levo for BP control
   - will need additional access (currently on two-lumen PICC), no
   peripherals. Does have HD catheter
   - maintain a-line for now
   - will d/w renal options for better BP control during HD.
   - will rate control on metoprolol as needed on non-HD days as per above
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets had dropped acutely from 118 5 days ago to 55. HIT neg.
   Possibly due to Amphoterocin which is now discontinued and platelets
   are up again. No drop in HCT to suggest TTP.
   - cont Voriconazole
   - daily LFT
   - cont to monitor
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. now off
   drip and letting patient auto-taper; would try to avoid amio especially
   given her tenuous pulmonary status. Attempted anticoagulation was not
   tolerated by patient due to epistaxis and IV site bleeding.  Not
   receiving metoprolol. Currently on pressors.
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol for now
   - midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120 (though currently on pressors)
   - will plan for beta-blocker as needed after HD to control afib (though
   currently on pressors)
   #. Liver:
   Patient had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Though to be shock
   liver due to hypotension following HD. Vori was discontinued, and
   liposomal amphoterocin started. Now that liver enzymes have recovered
   to ALT = 410, AST = 60 have discontinued amphoterocin andrestarted
   voriconazole. Will cont to support pressures to keep SBP above 100.
   Liver ultrasound showed normal right lobe of the liver, limited view of
   the left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are
   consistent with parenchymal disease.
   - cont to trend LFTs now that voriconazole restarted
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Peak WBC had been 28. Is 16.8 today and has been fluctuating in last 5
   days. Is now back on voriconazole for invasive aspergillosis. Also
   restarted Vancomycin for MRSA positive sputum.
   - follow-up cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, plan HD MWF
   - nephrocaps

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various reasons, including suspected tuberculosis (TBM) and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has also been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and invasive aspergillosis.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe (RLL) lobar collapse.
- Hypotension requiring the use of vasopressors.
- Thrombocytopenia with a drop in platelet count from 118 to 55, possibly due to Amphoterocin, which has been discontinued.
- Elevated liver enzymes (LFTs) in the thousands, likely due to shock liver from hypotension following hemodialysis. Voriconazole was discontinued and liposomal Amphoterocin started, but now that the liver enzymes have recovered, voriconazole has been restarted.
- ESRD on HD: The patient has been on dialysis since a recent colectomy and receives dialysis three times a week.
- RUE DVT: The patient has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE), but was intolerant of anticoagulation.
- Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multi-organ failure. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring increased vasopressor support and fluid resuscitation. There have been ongoing discussions with the family regarding the patient's code status, currently set to full code. The patient has been intubated and sedated, with mechanical ventilation in assist-control mode. He is receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and sepsis.

Vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 126/41 mmHg and tachycardia with a heart rate of 74 bpm. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits. Oxygen saturation remains above 99%. Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, acute kidney injury, and coagulopathy. The patient also has an elevated lactate level, suggesting tissue hypoperfusion.

The patient's blood glucose level has been relatively stable, but there are abnormal electrolyte levels, including hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia. Other lab abnormalities include elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein, and markers of liver and renal dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatitis: The elevated liver enzymes suggest liver dysfunction, which may be due to ischemic liver injury or another underlying cause.
2. Malnutrition: The patient has altered nutrition, which could contribute to further complications and prolonged recovery.
3. Hypotension:"

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the provided note. However, the 24-hour events section indicates several significant occurrences.

Firstly, the patient experienced worsening blood pressure, which required an increase in vasopressor therapy with the addition of levophed. The patient received 2.5 liters of normal saline fluids throughout the day while being on neo (norepinephrine) at a dose of 4/levo (levolevobetaxolol) 0.02.

Secondly, the patient's renal function may require continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) tomorrow.

Thirdly, the nutrition recommendation was changed to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) at a rate of 35cc/hr starting from [**Month (only) **].

Fourthly, meropenem was started for the possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

Fifthly, there were family discussions regarding code status, with the current decision still being to maintain full code status.

Lastly, the patient's lactate level decreased from 4.3 to 4.0, and liver function tests (LFTs) increased, leading to the discontinuation of voriconazole and initiation of amphotericin B (ambisome).

The patient has allergies to linezolid and penicillin G. The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin on [**2190-4-26**] at 04:00 PM and meropenem on [**2190-4-27**] at 11:32 AM.

The patient is currently receiving phenylephrine infusion at a rate of 1.5 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications, review of systems, and medical history remain unchanged.

Flow sheet data as of [**2190-4-28**] 07:17 AM shows the following vital signs:
- Temperature (Tmax): 38.3°C (101°F)

The patient's weight remains unchanged at 65.6 kg. Total intake is 5,199 mL with a urine output of 550 mL. The patient has received 534 mL of TF (total parenteral nutrition) and 4,545 mL of IV fluids. Blood product transfusion was not administered, and there was no output recorded for NG (nasogastric) or stool. Drainage from other sources is not mentioned.

Respiratory support includes ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 450-500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The respiratory system compliance and resistance index (RSBI) is 168, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 25 cmH2O, and plateau pressure is 24 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) remains at 99%.

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular status, skin, neurologic status, or tone. However, the patient does respond to stimuli.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.8 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.2 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 47 mg/dL, decreased serum albumin of 2.2 g/dL, elevated lactate level of 5.3 mmol/L, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 370/481 U/L).

Radiology images are not provided in the note.

Assessment and plan include various medical conditions such as hepatitis, ischemic liver, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, impaired skin integrity, electrolyte/fluid disorder, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pain control, cardiac dysrhythmia, respiratory failure, renal failure, and bacteremia.

ICU care involves nutrition, glycemic control, lines (including a multi-lumen catheter), prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) extubated and now reintubated.
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**] and
   again today with elevated LFT
s. [**Month (only) 51**] be repeat shock liver however Vori
   is again discontinued and Ambisome restarted. Has completed course for
   HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) on [**4-17**]. Due to
   multiple respiratory problems, patient ultimately required another
   intubation overnight ([**4-26**]) which she agreed to.  Will continue to
   remove fluid as possible with dialysis though this does cause large
   blood pressure swings. Must also consider that some component of resp
   failure could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate
   anticoagulation. On periodic CPAP Has MRSA growing in sputum. Now back
   on vanc for g+ve cocci on sputum from [**4-27**].
   - cont vent, did not tolerate increased PEEP from BP standpoint
   - Vanc dosing at HD protocol
   - Continue ambisome (watch platlets)
   - cont meropenem
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - cont stress dose steroid
   - consider trach and PEG, will need to discuss goals of care with
   family.
   #. HTN/Hypotension:
   On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and amlodipine
   here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given concurrent
   rhythm issues.  In ICU has had labile blood pressure.  Significant
   labile BP
s with HD requiring Neo as well as periodic Levophed and
   fluid boluses for BP support.
   - Neo and levo for BP control
   - maintain a-line for now
   - will d/w renal options for better BP control during HD.
   - will rate control with metoprolol as needed
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets had dropped acutely from 118 5 days ago to 55. HIT neg.
   Possibly due to Amphoterocin which was briefly discontinued and
   platelets went up. No drop in HCT to suggest TTP, and today ambisome is
   restarted due to rising LFT
s while on vori
   - cont Ambisome for now and monitor platlets closely
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. would
   try to avoid amio especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   Attempted anticoagulation was not tolerated by patient due to epistaxis
   and IV site bleeding.  Not receiving metoprolol. Currently on pressors.
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol for now
   - midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120 (though currently on pressors)
   - will plan for beta-blocker as needed after HD to control afib (though
   currently on pressors)
   #. Liver:
   Patient had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Though to be shock
   liver due to hypotension following HD. Vori was discontinued, and
   liposomal amphoterocin started. After liver enzymes recovered,
   discontinued amphoterocin and restarted voriconazole. Today
   Amphotericin is restarted and vori discontinued due to rising LFTs.
   Will cont to support pressures to keep SBP above 100. Previous liver
   ultrasound showed normal right lobe of the liver, limited view of the
   left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are consistent
   with parenchymal disease.
   - cont to trend LFTs
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Peak WBC had been 28. Is 22.8 today and has been fluctuating. Is now
   back on amphotericin for invasive aspergillosis. Also restarted
   Vancomycin for g+ve cocci in sputum.
   - follow-up cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, normally HD MWF; will likely miss HD today but
   may require CVVH in future.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress.
- The patient has been admitted multiple times for respiratory failure due to right lower lobe collapse, possibly due to tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration with mucous plugging, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- She has completed a course of antibiotics for HAP but still has positive glucan/galactomannan, indicating a possible invasive aspergilliosis infection.
- The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have been elevated, leading to discontinuation of voriconazole and restarting of ambisome.
- She has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 55, possibly due to amphotericin therapy.
- The patient has known atrial fibrillation and experienced episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) coinciding with dialysis.
- She is on stress dose steroids and has been intubated multiple times.
- The patient's blood pressure is labile and requires frequent adjustments.
- She is on hemodialysis three times a week and may require continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) in the future.
- The patient has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE).

   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**] and
   again today with elevated LFT
s. [**Month (only) 51**] be repeat shock liver however Vori
   is again discontinued and Ambisome restarted. Has completed course for
   HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) on [**4-17**]. Due to
   multiple respiratory problems, patient ultimately required another
   intubation overnight ([**4-26**]) which she agreed to.  Will continue to
   remove fluid as possible with dialysis though this does cause large
   blood pressure swings. Must also consider that some component of resp
   failure could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did not tolerate
   anticoagulation. On periodic CPAP Has MRSA growing in sputum. Now back
   on vanc for g+ve cocci on sputum from [**4-27**].
   - cont vent, did not tolerate increased PEEP from BP standpoint
   - Vanc dosing at HD protocol
   - Continue ambisome (watch platlets)
   - cont meropenem
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - cont stress dose steroid
   - consider trach and PEG, will need to discuss goals of care with
   family.
   #. HTN/Hypotension:
   On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and amlodipine
   here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given concurrent
   rhythm issues.  In ICU has had labile blood pressure.  Significant
   labile BP
s with HD requiring Neo as well as periodic Levophed and
   fluid boluses for BP support.
   - Neo and levo for BP control
   - maintain a-line for now
   - will d/w renal options for better BP control during HD.
   - will rate control with metoprolol as needed
   - Manage intravascular volume with HD and UF
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets had dropped acutely from 118 5 days ago to 55. HIT neg.
   Possibly due to Amphoterocin which was briefly discontinued and
   platelets went up. No drop in HCT to suggest TTP, and today ambisome is
   restarted due to rising LFT
s while on vori
   - cont Ambisome for now and monitor platlets closely
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. would
   try to avoid amio especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   Attempted anticoagulation was not tolerated by patient due to epistaxis
   and IV site bleeding.  Not receiving metoprolol. Currently on pressors.
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol for now
   - midodrine 10mg before HD if SBP<120 (though currently on pressors)
   - will plan for beta-blocker as needed after HD to control afib (though
   currently on pressors)
   #. Liver:
   Patient had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Though to be shock
   liver due to hypotension following HD. Vori was discontinued, and
   liposomal amphoterocin started. After liver enzymes recovered,
   discontinued amphoterocin and restarted voriconazole. Today
   Amphotericin is restarted and vori discontinued due to rising LFTs.
   Will cont to support pressures to keep SBP above 100. Previous liver
   ultrasound showed normal right lobe of the liver, limited view of the
   left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are consistent
   with parenchymal disease.
   - cont to trend LFTs
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Peak WBC had been 28. Is 22.8 today and has been fluctuating. Is now
   back on amphotericin for invasive aspergillosis. Also restarted
   Vancomycin for g+ve cocci in sputum.
   - follow-up cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Gets dialysis
   MWF.  Nephrology following.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, normally HD MWF; will likely miss HD today but
   may require CVVH in future.
   - nephrocaps
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - daily weights

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe collapse. She has been admitted multiple times for various issues including suspected tuberculosis, aspiration pneumonia, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications due to positive glucan/galactomannan and CT findings suggestive of invasive aspergillosis. She has had elevated liver function tests (LFTs) leading to discontinuation of voriconazole and restart of ambisome. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension/hypotension, and leukocytosis. She requires ongoing hemodialysis and has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse and respiratory distress, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Invasive Aspergillosis: The positive glucan/galactomannan and CT findings suggest invasive aspergillosis, which can be a life-threatening condition if not treated effectively.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped acutely, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Hypertension/Hypotension: The patient's labile blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) extubated and now reintubated.
   #. Neuro status:
   Received sedation during intubation two days ago, however has not
   received sedation since. Neuro exam not improving which is concerning
   for some possible infarct. Because CVVH is just started, will hold off
   on CT until a stable point can be found to transport for CT. Will
   follow neuro exam closely
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**] and
   again today with elevated LFT
s. [**Month (only) 51**] be repeat shock liver however Vori
   is again discontinued and Ambisome was restarted. Today ([**2190-4-29**]),
   patient has continually dropping platlets, thought to be due to
   Ambisome so this will be discontinued and micafungin started until
   LFT
s come down at which point, plan is to start Voriconazole again.
   Has completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]) on [**4-17**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient ultimately
   required another intubation overnight ([**4-26**]) which she agreed to.  Will
   continue to remove fluid as possible with CVVH today. Must also
   consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from known RUE
   DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation. Has MRSA growing in
   sputum. Now back on vanc for g+ve cocci on sputum from [**4-27**].
   - cont vent, did not tolerate increased PEEP from BP standpoint
   - Vanc dosing per measured levels
   - discontinue ambisome (due to dropping platlets)
   - start micafungin
   - cont meropenem
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - cont stress dose steroid, being wean
   - consider trach and PEG, will need to discuss goals of care with
   family.
   #. HTN/Hypotension:
   On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and amlodipine
   here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given concurrent
   rhythm issues.  In ICU has had labile blood pressure.  Significant
   labile BP
s with HD requiring Neo as well as periodic Levophed and
   fluid boluses for BP support.
   - now off pressors, will use Neo and vasopressin for BP control (had
   tachycardia with levophed)
   - plan for CVVH today as patient had large BP swings with HD.
   - will rate control with metoprolol if needed
   - Manage intravascular volume with CVVH
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets had dropped acutely from 118 to 69. HIT neg. Possibly due to
   Amphoterocin which was briefly discontinued and platelets went up. No
   drop in HCT to suggest TTP, and today ambisome is being discontinued
   due to again dropping platlets.
   - discontinue Ambisome for now and monitor platlets closely
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. would
   try to avoid amio especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   Attempted anticoagulation was not tolerated by patient due to epistaxis
   and IV site bleeding.  Not receiving metoprolol. Currently off
   pressors.
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol for now, but can use as needed to
   control afib
   #. Liver:
   Patient had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Thought to be
   shock liver due to hypotension following HD. Vori was discontinued, and
   liposomal amphoterocin started. After liver enzymes recovered,
   discontinued amphoterocin and restarted voriconazole. Amphotericin was
   again started and vori discontinued due to rising LFTs, however these
   were in the setting of another episode of hypotension. Will cont to
   support pressures as needed to keep SBP above 100. Previous liver
   ultrasound showed normal right lobe of the liver, limited view of the
   left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are consistent
   with parenchymal disease.
   - cont to trend LFTs
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Peak WBC had been 28. Is 22.3 today and has been fluctuating. Is being
   placed on micafungin and stopped on amphotericin due to decreasing
   platlets. She will need months of treatment for invasive aspergillosis.
   Also restarted Vancomycin for g+ve cocci in sputum.
   - follow-up cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Normally gets HD
   MWF.  Nephrology following. Will plan for CVVH today in attempt to
   prevent BP swings.
   - ongoing UF dialysis, normally HD MWF; will likely have CVVH beginning
   today.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and malnutrition. She was admitted with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe (RLL) lobar collapse, which could be due to tuberculosis (TBM), aspiration with mucous plugging, or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has positive glucan/galactomannan, suggesting invasive aspergillosis. She was initially started on oral voriconazole but had to be discontinued due to elevated liver function tests (LFTs). Ambisome was started instead but had to be discontinued again due to dropping platelets. Micafungin has been started until LFTs come down, after which voriconazole will be restarted.

The patient also has MRSA growing in the sputum, so vancomycin has been restarted. She has completed a course of cefepime for HAP. The patient requires another intubation overnight due to respiratory failure, which may be caused by pulmonary embolism from known right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She has been on dialysis since her recent colectomy and normally gets hemodialysis (HD) on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

The patient's medical complications include neuro status concern for possible infarct, respiratory failure with recurrent lobar collapse, thrombocytopenia possibly due to ambisome, hypertension"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) extubated and now reintubated.
   #. Neuro status:
   Received sedation during reintubation, however has not received
   sedation since. Neuro exam improving slightly today however still
   concerning for some possible infarct. Because CVVH is just started,
   will hold off on CT until a stable point can be found to transport for
   CT. Will follow neuro exam closely
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**] and
   again she had elevated LFT
s. [**Month (only) 51**] be repeat shock liver however Vori is
   again discontinued and Ambisome was restarted. On [**2190-4-29**], patient had
   continually dropping platlets, thought to be due to Ambisome so this
   was discontinued and micafungin started until LFT
s come down at which
   point, plan is to start Voriconazole again. Has completed course for
   HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) on [**4-17**]. Due to
   multiple respiratory problems, patient ultimately required another
   intubation overnight ([**4-26**]) which she agreed to.  Will continue to
   remove fluid as possible with CVVH today. Must also consider that some
   component of resp failure could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did
   not tolerate anticoagulation. Has MRSA growing in sputum. Now back on
   vanc for g+ve cocci on sputum from [**4-27**].
   - cont vent, did not tolerate increased PEEP from BP standpoint,
   however will try to switch to pressure support if possible today
   - Vanc dosing per measured levels to continue until the 19^th.
   - cont micafungin
   - cont meropenem until the 22nd
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - cont stress dose steroid, wean to daily dosing
   - consider trach and PEG, will need to discuss goals of care with
   family.
   #. HTN/Hypotension:
   On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and amlodipine
   here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given concurrent
   rhythm issues.  In ICU has had labile blood pressure.  Significant
   labile BP
s with HD requiring Neo as well as periodic Levophed and
   fluid boluses for BP support.
   - now off pressors, will use Neo and vasopressin for BP control (had
   tachycardia with levophed)
   - plan for continued CVVH today as patient had large BP swings with HD.
   - will rate control with metoprolol if needed
   - Manage intravascular volume with CVVH
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets had dropped acutely from 118 to 69 to 50 on [**2190-4-30**]. HIT neg.
   Possibly due to Amphoterocin which was briefly discontinued and
   platelets went up. No drop in HCT to suggest TTP, and ambisome was
   discontinued again due to dropping platlets.
   - off ambisome and monitor platlets closely
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. would
   try to avoid amio especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   Attempted anticoagulation was not tolerated by patient due to epistaxis
   and IV site bleeding.  Not receiving metoprolol. Currently off
   pressors.
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol for now, but can use as needed to
   control afib
   #. Liver:
   Patient had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Thought to be
   shock liver due to hypotension following HD. Vori was discontinued, and
   liposomal amphoterocin started. After liver enzymes recovered,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and malnutrition. She was admitted with recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe lobar collapse. She has a known diagnosis of tuberculosis (TBM) but is experiencing invasive aspergillosis. The patient has been treated with various antifungal medications, including voriconazole and amphotericin B, due to elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's respiratory failure is complicated by MRSA growing in her sputum and recurrent lobar collapse. She has been on different antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) and has completed a course of vancomycin and cefepime. She also has a known right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is at risk for pulmonary embolism.

The patient's cardiac status includes labile blood pressure, requiring norepinephrine and vasopressin for control, and episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) coinciding with dialysis. She has been on amiodarone with improvement in ectopy.

Her liver function tests have been fluctuating, with peaks in the thousands, and she has had episodes of thrombocytopenia. The patient's leukocytosis has been managed with micafungin and she is being followed"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) extubated and now reintubated.
   #. Neuro status:
   Received sedation during intubation two days ago, however has not
   received sedation since. Neuro exam not improving which is concerning
   for some possible infarct. Because CVVH is just started, will hold off
   on CT until a stable point can be found to transport for CT. Will
   follow neuro exam closely
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**] and
   again today with elevated LFT
s. [**Month (only) 51**] be repeat shock liver however Vori
   is again discontinued and Ambisome was restarted. Today ([**2190-4-29**]),
   patient has continually dropping platlets, thought to be due to
   Ambisome so this will be discontinued and micafungin started until
   LFT
s come down at which point, plan is to start Voriconazole again.
   Has completed course for HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1
   [**4-9**]) on [**4-17**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, patient ultimately
   required another intubation overnight ([**4-26**]) which she agreed to.  Will
   continue to remove fluid as possible with CVVH today. Must also
   consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from known RUE
   DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation. Has MRSA growing in
   sputum. Now back on vanc for g+ve cocci on sputum from [**4-27**].
   - cont vent, did not tolerate increased PEEP from BP standpoint
   - Vanc dosing per measured levels
   - discontinue ambisome (due to dropping platlets)
   - start micafungin
   - cont meropenem
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - cont stress dose steroid, being wean
   - consider trach and PEG, will need to discuss goals of care with
   family.
   #. HTN/Hypotension:
   On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and amlodipine
   here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given concurrent
   rhythm issues.  In ICU has had labile blood pressure.  Significant
   labile BP
s with HD requiring Neo as well as periodic Levophed and
   fluid boluses for BP support.
   - now off pressors, will use Neo and vasopressin for BP control (had
   tachycardia with levophed)
   - plan for CVVH today as patient had large BP swings with HD.
   - will rate control with metoprolol if needed
   - Manage intravascular volume with CVVH
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets had dropped acutely from 118 to 69. HIT neg. Possibly due to
   Amphoterocin which was briefly discontinued and platelets went up. No
   drop in HCT to suggest TTP, and today ambisome is being discontinued
   due to again dropping platlets.
   - discontinue Ambisome for now and monitor platlets closely
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. would
   try to avoid amio especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   Attempted anticoagulation was not tolerated by patient due to epistaxis
   and IV site bleeding.  Not receiving metoprolol. Currently off
   pressors.
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol for now, but can use as needed to
   control afib
   #. Liver:
   Patient had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Thought to be
   shock liver due to hypotension following HD. Vori was discontinued, and
   liposomal amphoterocin started. After liver enzymes recovered,
   discontinued amphoterocin and restarted voriconazole. Amphotericin was
   again started and vori discontinued due to rising LFTs, however these
   were in the setting of another episode of hypotension. Will cont to
   support pressures as needed to keep SBP above 100. Previous liver
   ultrasound showed normal right lobe of the liver, limited view of the
   left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are consistent
   with parenchymal disease.
   - cont to trend LFTs
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Peak WBC had been 28. Is 22.3 today and has been fluctuating. Is being
   placed on micafungin and stopped on amphotericin due to decreasing
   platlets. She will need months of treatment for invasive aspergillosis.
   Also restarted Vancomycin for g+ve cocci in sputum.
   - follow-up cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Normally gets HD
   MWF.  Nephrology following. Will plan for CVVH today in attempt to

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, recurrent respiratory distress, and known right lower lobe collapse. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications including pneumonia, aspiration, and sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has a positive glucan/galactomannan indicating invasive aspergillosis, for which she has been treated with antifungal medications (voriconazole and ambisome). However, her platelets have been dropping, and ambisome has been temporarily discontinued. The patient also has a known deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological: The patient has not shown improvement in her neuro exam since sedation during intubation, raising concerns for possible infarct. A CT scan has been planned once the patient is stable.
2. Respiratory: The patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress. She may require another intubation if her respiratory status worsens.
3. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with invasive aspergillosis, and her treatment plan includes various antifungal medications. She also has MRSA growing in her sputum.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure:  Oxygenation is adequate, but mental status is
   still very poor
   antibiotics:  has been on vanco since [**4-24**].  Will d/c vanco on [**5-2**] for
   8 day course.  D/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 614**] on [**5-5**] for 8 day course.
   aspergillus:  on micafungin
   wean stress dose steroids 1 more day then stop
   ESRD of HD:  unable to get fluid off because of HOTN will discuss with
   family. citrate toxicity so will have to stop citrate and may get clots
   in the system
   thrombocytopenia
   PAF:  HR controlled, but in AF
   LFTs trending down
   leukocytosis:  WBC increasing again.  Unclear cause may be due to
   steroids which are weaning down

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) extubated and now reintubated.
   #. Neuro status:
   Received sedation during reintubation, however has not received
   sedation since. Neuro exam improving slightly today however still
   concerning for some possible infarct. Because CVVH is just started,
   will hold off on CT until a stable point can be found to transport for
   CT. Will follow neuro exam closely
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**] and
   again she had elevated LFT
s. [**Month (only) 51**] be repeat shock liver however Vori is
   again discontinued and Ambisome was restarted. On [**2190-4-29**], patient had
   continually dropping platlets, thought to be due to Ambisome so this
   was discontinued and micafungin started until LFT
s come down at which
   point, plan is to start Voriconazole again. Has completed course for
   HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) on [**4-17**]. Due to
   multiple respiratory problems, patient ultimately required another
   intubation overnight ([**4-26**]) which she agreed to.  Will continue to
   remove fluid as possible with CVVH today. Must also consider that some
   component of resp failure could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did
   not tolerate anticoagulation. Has MRSA growing in sputum. Now back on
   vanc for g+ve cocci on sputum from [**4-27**].
   - cont PS, wean vent as tolerated
   - Vanc dosing per levels, d/c date [**5-2**]
   - cont micafungin
   - cont meropenem until [**5-5**]
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - cont steroid taper
   - consider trach and PEG, will need to discuss goals of care with
   family.
   #. HTN/Hypotension:
   On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and amlodipine
   here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given concurrent
   rhythm issues.  In ICU has had labile blood pressure.  Significant
   labile BP
s with HD requiring Neo as well as periodic Levophed and
   fluid boluses for BP support.
   - now off pressors, will use Neo and vasopressin for BP control (had
   tachycardia with levophed)
   - will rate control with metoprolol if needed
   - Unable to continued CVVH due to clot formation.
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets had dropped acutely from 118 to 69 to 50 on [**2190-4-30**]. HIT neg.
   Possibly due to Amphoterocin which was briefly discontinued and
   platelets went up. No drop in HCT to suggest TTP, and ambisome was
   discontinued again due to dropping platlets.
   - off ambisome and monitor platlets closely
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. would
   try to avoid amio especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   Attempted anticoagulation was not tolerated by patient due to epistaxis
   and IV site bleeding.  Not receiving metoprolol. Currently off
   pressors.
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol for now, but can use as needed to
   control afib
   #. Liver:
   Patient had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Thought to be
   shock liver due to hypotension following HD. Vori was discontinued, and
   liposomal amphoterocin started. After liver enzymes recovered,
   discontinued amphoterocin and restarted voriconazole. Amphotericin was
   again started and vori discontinued due to rising LFTs, however these
   were in the setting of another episode of hypotension. Will cont to
   support pressures as needed to keep SBP above 100. Previous liver
   ultrasound showed normal right lobe of the liver, limited view of the
   left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are consistent
   with parenchymal disease. Now off vori though plan is to restart this
   after LFTs improve
   - cont to trend LFTs
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Peak WBC had been 28. Is 22.3 today and has been fluctuating. Is being
   placed on micafungin and stopped on amphotericin due to decreasing
   platlets. She will need months of treatment for invasive aspergillosis.
   Also restarted Vancomycin for g+ve cocci in sputum.
   - follow-up cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Normally gets HD
   MWF.  Nephrology following.  CVVH initiated on [**4-30**] although was not
   continued due to clot formation and inability to take off volume.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) extubated and now reintubated.
   #. Neuro status:
   Received sedation during reintubation, however has not received
   sedation since. Neuro exam improving slightly today however still
   concerning for some possible infarct. Because CVVH is just started,
   will hold off on CT until a stable point can be found to transport for
   CT. Will follow neuro exam closely
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**] and
   again she had elevated LFT
s. [**Month (only) 51**] be repeat shock liver however Vori is
   again discontinued and Ambisome was restarted. On [**2190-4-29**], patient had
   continually dropping platlets, thought to be due to Ambisome so this
   was discontinued and micafungin started until LFT
s come down at which
   point, plan is to start Voriconazole again. Has completed course for
   HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) on [**4-17**]. Due to
   multiple respiratory problems, patient ultimately required another
   intubation overnight ([**4-26**]) which she agreed to.  Will continue to
   remove fluid as possible with CVVH today. Must also consider that some
   component of resp failure could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did
   not tolerate anticoagulation. Has MRSA growing in sputum. Now back on
   vanc for g+ve cocci on sputum from [**4-27**].
   - cont PS, wean vent as tolerated currently 15/5
   - Vanc dosing per levels, d/c date [**5-2**]
   - cont micafungin

   tachycardia with levophed)
   - will rate control with metoprolol if needed
   - Unable to continued CVVH due to clot formation, unable to tolerate
   heparin, became citrate toxic.
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets had dropped acutely from 118 to 69 to 50 on [**2190-4-30**]. HIT neg.
   Possibly due to Amphoterocin which was briefly discontinued and
   platelets went up. No drop in HCT to suggest TTP, and ambisome was
   discontinued again due to dropping platlets.
   - off ambisome and monitor platlets closely
   #. NSVT/Afib:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to various complications.

Recent events include the identification of Clostridium difficile (c-diff) in her stool culture, leading to the continuation of vancomycin and addition of micafungin. Renal recommendations include urine output at 50cc/hr, and continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) was stopped due to impending clot formation. The patient is now on peritoneal dialysis (PD) at a rate of 15/8.

The patient's allergies include linezolid, penicillin G, and an unknown allergy. She has received several antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and micafungin. She is currently receiving lansoprazole (Prevacid) and other medications as per ICU protocol.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 82 bpm (normal range: 66-130 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 150/57 mmHg to 171/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute (normal range: 17-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her weight"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of stool culture results showing Clostridium difficile (c-diff). The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and micafungin. Due to renal recommendations, the patient underwent ultrafiltration at 50cc/hr and continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) was stopped due to impending clot formation. The patient was placed on peritoneal dialysis (PD) at a rate of 15/8 and is tolerating it well. The plan is to discontinue vancomycin on [**5-2**] and continue with steroid tapering from hydrocortisone 50 q24. Stool for c-diff was sent for testing.

Allergies:
The patient has allergies to linezolid, penicillin G, and an unknown allergy.

Medications:
The patient received ambisome on [**2190-4-29**] at 04:00 AM, vancomycin on [**2190-4-30**] at 01:00 PM, meropenem on [**2190-4-30**] at 03:30 PM, and micafungin on [**2190-4-30**] at 04:30 PM. Lansoprazole (Prevacid) was given on [**2190-4-30**] at 08:00 AM.

Infusions:
Other ICU medications and infusions are noted in the flow sheet data.

Medical History:
The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow Sheet Data:
Vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and labs/radiology results are provided in the flow sheet data.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The presence of c-diff indicates an infection, which may lead to worsening symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.

2. Clotting Disorder: The patient had CVVH stopped due to impending clot formation, indicating a possible clotting disorder.

3. Renal Issues: The patient underwent ultrafiltration and renal recommendations were made, suggesting potential renal issues.

4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications and the presence of a dialysis catheter increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

5. Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing VAP.

6. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance indicates a negative balance, suggesting the possibility of fluid overload.

7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's lab results show abnormal electrolyte levels, such as low potassium and low bicarbonate.

8. Hepatic Dysfunction: Elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) may indicate hep"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) extubated and now reintubated.
   #. Neuro status:
   Received sedation during reintubation, however has not received
   sedation since. Neuro exam improving slightly today however still
   concerning for some possible infarct. Will hold off on CT at this point
   as would unlikely change management. Will discuss status and goals of
   care with family today. Will follow neuro exam closely.
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**] and
   again she had elevated LFT
s. [**Month (only) 51**] be repeat shock liver however Vori is
   again discontinued and Ambisome was restarted. On [**2190-4-29**], patient had
   continually dropping platlets, thought to be due to Ambisome so this
   was discontinued and micafungin started until LFT
s come down at which
   point, plan is to start Voriconazole again. Has completed course for
   HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) on [**4-17**]. Due to
   multiple respiratory problems, patient ultimately required another
   intubation overnight ([**4-26**]) which she agreed to.  CVVH now discontinued
   and so will avoid excess fluids as no way to remove fluid. Must also
   consider that some component of resp failure could be PE from known RUE
   DVT, though did not tolerate anticoagulation. Has MRSA growing in
   sputum. Now back on vanc for g+ve cocci on sputum from [**4-27**]. ID
   recommends switching mica back to vori. Will discuss goals of care with
   family today before making this adjustment.
   - cont PS, wean vent as tolerated currently 15/5
   - Vanc dosing per levels, d/c date [**5-2**]
   - cont micafungin, discuss treatment goals with family, consider
   switching to vori.
   - cont meropenem until [**5-5**]
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - cont hydrocortisone taper (was 50mg q24, will taper to 25mg q24).
   - consider trach and PEG, will need to discuss goals of care with
   family.
   #. HTN/Hypotension:
   On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and amlodipine
   here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given concurrent
   rhythm issues.  In ICU has had labile blood pressure.  Significant
   labile BP
s with HD requiring Neo as well as periodic Levophed and
   fluid boluses for BP support.
   - now off pressors, will use Neo and vasopressin for BP control (had
   tachycardia with levophed)
   - will rate control with metoprolol if needed
   - Unable to continued CVVH due to clot formation, unable to tolerate
   heparin, became citrate toxic.
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets had dropped acutely from 118 to 69 to 50 on [**2190-4-30**]. HIT neg.
   Possibly due to Amphoterocin which was briefly discontinued and
   platelets went up. No drop in HCT to suggest TTP, and ambisome was
   discontinued again due to dropping platlets. These have risen today
   - off ambisome and monitor platlets closely
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. would
   try to avoid amio especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   Attempted anticoagulation was not tolerated by patient due to epistaxis
   and IV site bleeding.  Not receiving metoprolol. Currently off
   pressors.
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol for now, but can use as needed to
   control afib
   #. Liver:
   Patient had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Thought to be
   shock liver due to hypotension following HD. Vori was discontinued, and
   liposomal amphoterocin started. After liver enzymes recovered,
   discontinued amphoterocin and restarted voriconazole. Amphotericin was
   again started and vori discontinued due to rising LFTs, however these
   were in the setting of another episode of hypotension. Will cont to
   support pressures as needed to keep SBP above 100. Previous liver
   ultrasound showed normal right lobe of the liver, limited view of the
   left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are consistent
   with parenchymal disease. Now off vori though plan is to restart this
   as above, depending on outcome of family meetings
   - cont to trend LFTs
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Peak WBC had been 28. Is 22.3 today and has been fluctuating. Is being
   placed on micafungin and stopped on amphotericin due to decreasing
   platlets. She will need months of treatment for invasive aspergillosis.
   Also restarted Vancomycin for g+ve cocci in sputum.
   - follow-up cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Normally gets HD
   MWF.  Nephrology following.  CVVH initiated on [**4-30**] although was not
   continued due to clot formation and inability to take off volume.
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - nephrocaps
   - daily weights
   - unable to tolerate citrate or heparin, problems with CVVH due to clot
   formation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe collapse, and possible invasive aspergillosis. She has been admitted multiple times and has undergone several interventions including reintubation, CVVH, and changes in antifungal therapy. The patient's current condition includes neuro status concerns, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, hypertension/hypotension, NSVT/afib, elevated liver enzymes, leukocytosis, right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The patient's care plan includes weaning from the ventilator, adjusting antifungal therapy, managing blood pressure, addressing thrombocytopenia, controlling arrhythmias, monitoring liver enzymes, and addressing leukocytosis. The patient's disposition is pending family discussion, and she will remain in the ICU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of recurrent respiratory distress and right lower lobe collapse. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration, which may require tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Invasive aspergillosis: The patient has positive glucan/galactomannan and a CT scan showing diffuse disease, possibly"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He is also receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and has multiple lines inserted for medication administration and dialysis. The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and liver cirrhosis. He is currently experiencing multiorgan dysfunction, including liver, kidney, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs and lab values. There is a concern for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis, cardiac dysrhythmia, and pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and Doppler ultrasound of the extremities can help detect any clot formation.
2. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient's history of ischemic heart disease puts him at risk for arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring of the heart rate and rhythm is essential to detect any abnormality promptly.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and proper skin care are crucial to prevent these ulcers.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolytes, and daily urine output is necessary to manage renal function.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further, requiring close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters. Weaning off mechanical ventilation and providing adequate lung support are essential.
6. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels suggest ongoing liver dysfunction. Monitoring liver function tests and providing appropriate supportive care are necessary.
7. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised, increasing the risk of infection. Regular assessment of vital signs, temperature, white blood cell count, and surveillance cultures can help identify any infection early.
8. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure and abnormal electrolyte levels indicate potential fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring and careful management of fluid and electrolyte intake and output are crucial.
9. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of bacteremia and multiorgan dysfunction, sepsis remains a concern. Early recognition and aggressive management of infection are essential to prevent further deterioration.
10. Multiorgan dysfunction: The patient's multiple organ failures require close monitoring and individualized management for each organ system involved.

The patient's complex medical condition and the potential complications highlight the need for comprehensive care, close monitoring, and multidisciplinary involvement in the ICU setting."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yo f with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD, malnutrition, here with
   recurrent respiratory distress secondary to RLL lobar collapse (?TBM vs
   aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) extubated and now reintubated.
   #. Neuro status:
   Received sedation during reintubation, however has not received
   sedation since. Neuro exam improving slightly today however still
   concerning for some possible infarct. Because of CVVH, will hold off on
   CT until a stable point can be found to transport for CT. Will follow
   neuro exam closely
   #.  Respiratory failure:
   Patient has recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory distress.
   Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too distal to stent. Has
   positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on [**4-14**] showing diffuse disease,
   possibly invasive aspergilliosis. Was started on oral voriconazole on
   [**2190-4-15**], but with elevated LFT
s to thousands; vori was discontinued
   and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on [**2190-4-24**] and
   again she had elevated LFT
s. [**Month (only) 51**] be repeat shock liver however Vori is
   again discontinued and Ambisome was restarted. On [**2190-4-29**], patient had
   continually dropping platlets, thought to be due to Ambisome so this
   was discontinued and micafungin started until LFT
s come down at which
   point, plan is to start Voriconazole again. Has completed course for
   HAP with Vancomycin (D1 [**4-10**]) & cefepime (D1 [**4-9**]) on [**4-17**]. Due to
   multiple respiratory problems, patient ultimately required another
   intubation overnight ([**4-26**]) which she agreed to.  Will continue to
   remove fluid as possible with CVVH today. Must also consider that some
   component of resp failure could be PE from known RUE DVT, though did
   not tolerate anticoagulation. Has MRSA growing in sputum. Now back on
   vanc for g+ve cocci on sputum from [**4-27**].
   - cont PS, wean vent as tolerated currently 15/5
   - Vanc dosing per levels, d/c date [**5-2**]
   - cont micafungin
   - cont meropenem until [**5-5**]
   - f/u ID recs, cultures, fever curve, wbc
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - cont hydrocortisone (was 50mg q24, will taper again).
   - consider trach and PEG, will need to discuss goals of care with
   family.
   #. HTN/Hypotension:
   On nitropaste and amlodipine at home. Was on captopril and amlodipine
   here, however switched to single [**Doctor Last Name **] beta-blocker given concurrent
   rhythm issues.  In ICU has had labile blood pressure.  Significant
   labile BP
s with HD requiring Neo as well as periodic Levophed and
   fluid boluses for BP support.
   - now off pressors, will use Neo and vasopressin for BP control (had
   tachycardia with levophed)
   - will rate control with metoprolol if needed
   - Unable to continued CVVH due to clot formation, unable to tolerate
   heparin, became citrate toxic.
   #.  Thrombocytopenia:
   Platelets had dropped acutely from 118 to 69 to 50 on [**2190-4-30**]. HIT neg.
   Possibly due to Amphoterocin which was briefly discontinued and
   platelets went up. No drop in HCT to suggest TTP, and ambisome was
   discontinued again due to dropping platlets.
   - off ambisome and monitor platlets closely
   #. NSVT/Afib:
   Patient does have known pafib and appears to have had the episodes of
   NSVT coinciding with dialysis. Given 150mg amio x1 on [**4-12**] and
   continued on drip at 1 then 0.5 per hour. ectopy has improved. would
   try to avoid amio especially given her tenuous pulmonary status.
   Attempted anticoagulation was not tolerated by patient due to epistaxis
   and IV site bleeding.  Not receiving metoprolol. Currently off
   pressors.
   - cont plan to hold metoprolol for now, but can use as needed to
   control afib
   #. Liver:
   Patient had rising LFT
s with peak in the thousands. Thought to be
   shock liver due to hypotension following HD. Vori was discontinued, and
   liposomal amphoterocin started. After liver enzymes recovered,
   discontinued amphoterocin and restarted voriconazole. Amphotericin was
   again started and vori discontinued due to rising LFTs, however these
   were in the setting of another episode of hypotension. Will cont to
   support pressures as needed to keep SBP above 100. Previous liver
   ultrasound showed normal right lobe of the liver, limited view of the
   left lobe. No portal vein thrombosis. Echogenic kidneys are consistent
   with parenchymal disease. Now off vori though plan is to restart this
   after LFTs improve
   - cont to trend LFTs
   #.  Leukocytosis:
   Peak WBC had been 28. Is 22.3 today and has been fluctuating. Is being
   placed on micafungin and stopped on amphotericin due to decreasing
   platlets. She will need months of treatment for invasive aspergillosis.
   Also restarted Vancomycin for g+ve cocci in sputum.
   - follow-up cultures
   - weekly B-glucan, galactomannan
   #. RUE DVT:
    DVT seen on U/S. Patient at risk for PE; however, was intolerant of
   anticoagulation.
   #. ESRD on HD:
   Patient has been on dialysis since recent colectomy.  Normally gets HD
   MWF.  Nephrology following.  CVVH initiated on [**4-30**] although was not
   continued due to clot formation and inability to take off volume.
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - nephrocaps
   - daily weights
   - unable to tolerate citrate or heparin, problems with CVVH due to clot
   formation.

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, malnutrition, and recurrent respiratory distress secondary to right lower lobe (RLL) lobar collapse. She has been diagnosed with invasive aspergillosis and is currently on micafungin therapy. The patient also has MRSA growing in her sputum and is being treated with vancomycin. She has thrombocytopenia, likely due to amphotericin B, and is off anticoagulation due to intolerance. Her liver enzymes were elevated in the thousands, consistent with shock liver. She is being closely monitored for potential complications such as pulmonary embolism from known right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with presumed aspergillus PNA and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient is sedated and unresponsive, unable to provide history. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, ESRD, hemodynamic lability, thrombocytopenia, hepatitis, and other medical complications. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and sepsis. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, and deep vein thrombosis in the right lower extremity. The patient is currently on dialysis and has intolerance to anticoagulant agents.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure on top of chronic respiratory failure. The patient's mental status is limiting, and there is a suspicion of aspergillus pneumonia. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and supplemental oxygen.
2. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient has ESRD and is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD). However, the patient is unable to tolerate heparin or citrate, which increases the risk of clotting during dialysis.
3. Hemodynamic Lability: The patient experiences hypotension associated with hemodialysis/CVVHD. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and further complications.
