   [**Age over 90 212**] yo M with PMH CRI, CAD, dementia admitted with fever,
   unresponsiveness and recent aspiration pneumonia.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): most likely due to acute
   mucous plugging and thick secretions in the setting of aspiration
   pneumonia.  Currently saturating very well on minimal ventillatory
   support with pressure support of [**6-11**].
   - cont current vent setting of PS 5/5 as tolerated
   - pulmonary toilet
   - follow sputum cultures
   - empiric PNA coverage with vanco and zosyn, will wean abx if  possible
   based on culture data
   - hold tube feeds after MN; consider extubation in a.m.
   - consider arterial line if unable to extubate in a.m.
   - check PM ABG
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): contributing factors on
   admission include acute infection, fever and significant
   hypernatremia.
   - wean sedation on ventilator as tolerated
   -correct hypernatremia slowly as discussed below, free water deficit of
   7.5L
   -treat infection as above
   # Hypotension: normotensive on admission, however became progressively
   hypotensive in the ED in the setting of infection but also of sedatives
   given for intubation.
   - LR boluses for goal CVP > 8 and urine output of 0.5-1cc/kg/hr
   - levophed for goal MAP > 65
   - once CVP > 8, wean levophed as tolerated by BP
   - once CVP > 8, consider adding vasopressin if still has pressor
   requirement.
   - check cortisol stim test, hold additional steroids in the meantime
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE): he has
   significant h/o CAD/prior MI with EF of 20%.  Now with elevated
   troponin and MBI, however normal CK and CKMB.  Concerning for demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension vs. ACS.  At this time more likely
   demand ischemia given normal CK however given significant h/o CAD ACS
   is also possible.  No EKG changes, however baseline LBB.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - serial EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - cont ASA
   - start heparin gtt without bolus for NSTEMI
   - on sepsis protocol, on statin or placebo, if enzymes continuing to
   trend up will consider stopping study and giving ensuring that he is
   getting high dose statin.
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM): FWD of 7.2L on admission, will replete
   half of deficit over the next 24 hours with D5W.
   - check Na Q4H (goal Na by morning is 148; avoid faster correction)
   - start D5W at 200 cc/hr and reassess Q4H
   # Fever: most likely causes include report of suspected aspiration PNA
   vs sinusitis seen on head ct vs. diarrhea.  UA negative.
   - follow blood and sputum cultures
   - follow stool CDiff toxin
   - empiric therapy with vanco, zosyn as above
 ANEMIA, OTHER: likely with baseline anemia of chronic
   disease/hemodilution.  No evidence of acute bleed.
   - trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - guaiac stools
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Coagulopathy: most likely [**3-10**] nutritional deviciency, no h/o recent
   anticoagulation.
   - hold vitamin K tx due to concern for NSTEMI
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE): baseline cr around 1, elevated to 1.8 on admission likely [**3-10**]
   infection and volume depletion.
   -trend Cr
   -continue to hydrate with IVF for CVP>8 and UO >50cc/hr
 .H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC: EF 20%, evidence of
   pulmonary edema on CXR, however CVP of 4 at this time indicating likely
   needs additional volume repletion.
   -continue with LR boluses for CVP >8
   -monitor for evidence of worsening pulmonary edema by O2 sat, or
   increasing ventillator requirements
   -try to avoid over hydration as may be able to extubate tomorrow if
   does well with SBT in the morning
   -holding metoprolol for now
   -not on ACEI as outpatient
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT): underlying dementia,
   NH resident
   - cont memantine and donepezil and celexa
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II: insulin dependent with prior
   admission for HONC.  Hyperglycemic up to 400's on admission, likely [**3-10**]
   to infection, also given steroids in ED.
   - humalog SSI
   -consider insulin gtt if unable to control glucose with SubQ insulin

   significant h/o CAD/prior MI with EF of 20%.  Now with elevated
   troponin and MBI, however normal CK and CKMB.  Concerning for demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension vs. ACS.  At this time more likely
   demand ischemia given normal CK however given significant h/o CAD ACS
   is also possible.  No EKG changes, however baseline LBB.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - serial EKG and cardiac enzymes, if continues to trend down will stop
   heparin gtt after completing a course of 48 hours
   - cont ASA

   - on sepsis protocol, on statin or placebo, if enzymes continuing to
   trend up will consider stopping study and giving ensuring that he is
   getting high dose statin.
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM): FWD of 7.2L on admission, will replete
   half of deficit over the next 24 hours with D5W.  free water deficit of

","Summary:
The patient is a 212-year-old male with a medical history of chronic renal failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, dementia, and heart failure. He was admitted with fever, unresponsiveness, and recent aspiration pneumonia. He is currently intubated for airway protection and hypoxia, and his condition is being supported by mechanical ventilation with pressure support. The patient has altered mental status, most likely due to acute infection, fever, and significant hypernatremia. He also has hypotension, which is being managed with LR boluses for a goal CVP of >8 and urine output of 0.5-1cc/kg/hr. There are concerns for coronary artery disease with elevated troponin levels, but no EKG changes. The patient has hypernatremia with a free water deficit of 5L, which is being corrected slowly. He also has anemia, coagulopathy, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, dementia, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to acute mucous plugging and thick secretions in the setting of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Delirium caused by multiple factors including acute infection, fever, and significant hypernatremia.
3. Hypotension possibly due to infection, sedatives given for intubation, or demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension vs. ACS.
4. Coronary artery disease with elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, coronary artery disease, dementia, diabetes mellitus type II, dysphagia, and hypertension. He was admitted with fever, unresponsiveness, and recent aspiration pneumonia. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 102/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. He has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 75%. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, glucose, and troponin T levels. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, altered mental status, hypotension, coronary artery disease, hypernatremia, fever, anemia, coagulopathy, chronic renal failure, and chronic heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to acute mucous plugging and thick secretions in the setting of aspiration pneumonia. It is important to continue pulmonary toilet, follow sputum cultures, and consider extubation in the morning.
2. Altered Mental Status: Contributing factors include acute infection, fever, and significant hypernatremia. Sedation should"

   Assessment and Plan
   1-       Acute RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE: secondary to pneumonia and
   poor mental status(inability to protect airway)
   Plan: Continue mechanical ventilation as mental status precludes
   extubation.  Will re-evaluate in afternoon/tomorrow.  Currently on
   pressure support and will continue as long as patient tolerates.
   2 - Pneumonia:
      Plan: continue Vanc/Zosyn (WBC decreasing)
   3- Septic shock/hypotension: remains relatively hypotensive (systolic
   80-90s) although off pressors currently
      Plan: Continue IVF as needed based on endpoints of blood pressure,
   lactate, urine output, CVP
will continue physiologic dose
   hydrocortisone for relative insufficiency (baseline 10) and discontinue
   as soon as blood pressure improves
   4 - Coronary Artery Disease (NSTEMI vs. Demand ischemia): Will continue
   heparin for 48 hours.  Decision made to withdraw patient from statin
   vs. placebo sepsis trial as statin is currently indicated for the
   possibility of NSTEMI.  Will receive statin therapy as well as aspirin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient was found unresponsive and febrile, with elevated white blood cell count. They were intubated for airway protection and diagnosed with pneumonia.
- The patient developed hypotension post-intubation and required levophed support.
- The patient received IV fluids overnight due to decreased urine output, low central venous pressure, and low blood pressure.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and poor mental status.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (NSTEMI), hypernatremia, chronic renal failure, heart failure, dementia, diabetes mellitus type II, and dysphagia.
- The patient's current medical plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, treating pneumonia with Vancomycin and Zosyn, managing septic shock with IV fluids and hydrocortisone, monitoring coronary artery disease with heparin, addressing hypernatremia with free water, treating coagulopathy, managing acute renal failure, and managing anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of being on mechanical ventilation indicates a potential complication of acute respiratory failure, which could be due to pneumonia and poor mental status.
2. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, hypotension, and requirement for pressor support suggest a possible sepsis or septic shock.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing treatment with antibiotics indicate a potential complication of pneumonia.
4. Coronary Artery Disease/NSTEMI: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and the presence of cardiac enzymes raise concerns for potential complications related to the heart, such as NSTEMI.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels require careful management to prevent further complications.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and low platelet count indicate a potential coagulopathy, which can lead to bleeding complications.
7. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest a potential complication of acute renal failure.
8. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates a potential complication of anemia.
9. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's history of chronic renal failure may contribute to ongoing renal issues.
10. Dementia/Alzheimer's Disease: The patient's history of dementia increases the risk of complications related to cognitive decline and impaired decision-making abilities.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required to determine the exact medical complications and their severity."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Presumed secondary to aspiration pneumonia. Getting vanc/zosyn.
   Following cultures. Gram stain shows GPRs and GPCs, resp cx shows
   sparse GNRs; difficult to assess what the causative pathogen would be
   and therefore continuing to cover broadly. WBC is declining; afebrile;
   CXR c/w pneumonia. Fluid overload may also be playing a role. Will
   gently diurese today.
   In terms of ventilation, his RSBI is <100 but his mental status is poor
   and it is not clear that he could protect his airway. Will continue to
   keep intubated and reassess as we go, assessing both RSBI and capacity
   to wake up.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   See above. Essentially unresponsive this am. Concerning for hypoxic
   brain injury but may be metabolic stress of infection. Hypernatremia is
   corrected, should not be a factor at this point. Treating infection;
   given dementia, pt is likely to have very little cerebral reserve, may
   improve with treatment.
   HYPOTENSION
   Low this morning. ?Perisepsis vs element of cardiac insufficiency.
   Responsive to fluids. Will check VBG+ABG to measure CO via Fick; will
   put in A-line for ongoing more reliable measurement of BP.
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   Elevated troponin on admission to 1.6. Will follow up cardiac enzymes.
   For now no new evidence of MI. Have stopped heparin gtt, but if cardiac
   enzymes elevate again, will restart.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   If signs of MI would transfuse for Hct <30. If none, transfuse <25. No
   acute drop currently, no significant worry for bleed.
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   Creatinine normalizing. Goal CVP remains >8, goal Uo >40/hr. With this
   Cr should be able to tolerate diuresis if needed.
 .H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   Approach to blood pressure difficult balance given the number of
   various factors that may be influencing it. Goal CVP >8 as above.
   Cautious diuresis as above.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Continuing home meds.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Transitioning to SC regimen from drip today. Will follow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of lethargy, fever, and hypoxia. The patient has been receiving fluids and medications for suspected pneumonia, and there are concerns about potential complications such as respiratory failure, altered mental status, hypotension, coronary artery disease, anemia, renal failure, heart failure, dementia, diabetes mellitus, and dysphagia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's low respiratory system compliance (RSBI) suggests a risk for respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated due to poor mental status and inability to protect the airway.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is unresponsive and has a history of dementia. Metabolic stress of infection and hypoxic brain injury are potential causes for the altered mental status.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis or cardiac insufficiency. Fluid resuscitation has been provided, and further monitoring is planned.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Elevated troponin levels on admission indicate possible myocardial injury. The patient will be monitored for cardiac enzymes, and heparin has been stopped temporarily.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low. If signs of myocardial infarction occur, blood transfusion will be considered for hematocrit levels below 30. If not, transfusion will be considered for levels"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who presented to the ICU with complaints of lethargy, fever, and hypoxia. He has a history of multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease, chronic renal failure, heart failure, dementia, diabetes mellitus, dysphagia, and hypernatremia. The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and altered mental status.

24-hour events include receiving a total of 4 liters of normal saline for low blood pressure, hypernatremia resolved after LR boluses, receiving stress dose steroids, and worsening left-sided pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient was not extubated due to no improvement in mental status with decreased sedation.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient has a history of pneumonia, which likely led to the development of acute respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving IV fluids for low urine output and hypotension, but remains poorly responsive.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 95/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 402 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system is clear, but the patient has decreased breath sounds bilaterally.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.0 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 29.5% to 31.7%, platelet count (Plt) of 227 K/uL, and elevated creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 1.1 to 1.3 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels are elevated at 1.60 ng/mL. Other lab results indicate electrolyte imbalances, including high potassium (K+) and low bicarbonate (HCO3-).

The patient's medical complications include acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, septic shock, coronary artery disease (CAD)/NSTEMI, altered mental status, hypernatremia, anemia, coagulopathy, chronic renal failure, heart failure, dementia, diabetes mellitus, and dysphagia. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is receiving treatment for various conditions, including antibiotics, insulin, heparin, and tube feeds.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of septic shock, development of further electrolyte imbalances, and worsening of chronic renal failure."

   Addendum: After arterial line placed, blood pressure much better 120/70

   venous-arterial PCO2 difference is 9 thus indicating decreased cardiac
   output.  Given this information, current picture is more consistent
   with resuscitated sepsis now with fluid overload (known decreased
   cardiac function).  As blood pressure normal per arterial line, will
   give lasix and try to get fluid off.  Holding off on inotropes at this
   time because of NSTEMI and no signs of hypo-perfusion at this point
   (kidney function normal, lactate normal).  If blood pressure continues
   to remain normal, will wean steroids.

","Summary:
The patient is an unresponsive individual with respiratory failure and septic shock. They have been receiving IV fluids for low urine output and hypotension. Despite being poorly responsive, the patient remains on mechanical ventilation. The vital signs indicate a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 95/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient's weight is 94.1 kg with a height of 70 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 78%. The total fluid intake and output balance shows a positive balance of 6,667 mL. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 402 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 73, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 11 cmH2O, and the arterial blood gas (ABG) results are as follows: pH - 7.23, PaCO2 - 63.8 mmHg, PaO2 - 61.4 mmHg, HCO3- 24 mEq/L, Base excess - 1 mEq/L, and lactate - 2.3 mmol/L. The patient's laboratory values reveal a white blood cell (WBC) count of 18.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.5 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 259 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.3 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 1.60 ng/mL, and blood glucose level of 83 mg/dL. 

Assessment and Plan:
1) Acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia, with superimposed volume overload due to resuscitation from IVFs. Plan: Continue Zosyn/Vanc.
2) Pneumonia: Continue Zosyn/Vanc.
3) Septic shock: Off vasopressors but still relatively hypotensive and required a lot of fluid. Plan: Check venous-arterial pCO2 difference, ECHO, and place arterial line.
4) CAD/?NSTEMI: Will discontinue heparin and continue ASA, statin.
5) Relative adrenal insufficiency: Cortisol 10.5 -> low baseline and still having hypotension. Plan: Continue steroids for now and wean rapidly when pressure improves.
6) Anemia: Will transfuse to keep Hct 28-30%.
7) DM - insulin drip.
Addendum: After arterial line placement, blood pressure improved to 120/70"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Presumed secondary to aspiration pneumonia. Getting vanc/zosyn.
   Following cultures. Gram stain shows GPRs and GPCs, resp cx shows
   sparse GNRs; difficult to assess what the causative pathogen would be
   and therefore continuing to cover broadly. WBC is declining; afebrile;
   CXR c/w pneumonia. Fluid overload may also be playing a role. Will
   gently diurese today.
   In terms of ventilation, his RSBI is <100 but his mental status is poor
   and it is not clear that he could protect his airway. Will continue to
   keep intubated and reassess as we go, assessing both RSBI and capacity
   to wake up.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   See above. Essentially unresponsive this am. Concerning for hypoxic
   brain injury but may be metabolic stress of infection. Hypernatremia is
   corrected, should not be a factor at this point. Treating infection;
   given dementia, pt is likely to have very little cerebral reserve, may
   improve with treatment.
   HYPOTENSION
   Low this morning. ?Perisepsis vs element of cardiac insufficiency.
   Responsive to fluids. Will check VBG+ABG to measure CO via Fick; will
   put in A-line for ongoing more reliable measurement of BP.
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   Elevated troponin on admission to 1.6. Will follow up cardiac enzymes.
   For now no new evidence of MI. Have stopped heparin gtt, but if cardiac
   enzymes elevate again, will restart.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   If signs of MI would transfuse for Hct <30. If none, transfuse <25. No
   acute drop currently, no significant worry for bleed.
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   Creatinine normalizing. Goal CVP remains >8, goal Uo >40/hr. With this
   Cr should be able to tolerate diuresis if needed.
 .H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   Approach to blood pressure difficult balance given the number of
   various factors that may be influencing it. Goal CVP >8 as above.
   Cautious diuresis as above.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Continuing home meds.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Transitioning to SC regimen from drip today. Will follow.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. These include respiratory failure, altered mental status, hypotension, coronary artery disease, anemia, renal failure, heart failure, dementia, diabetes mellitus, and dysphagia. 

Respiratory failure is indicated by the patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 93%) and the presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on the chest X-ray. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

Altered mental status is evident from the patient's unresponsiveness and inability to follow commands. This may be due to hypoxic brain injury or metabolic stress of infection.

Hypotension is suggested by the patient's low blood pressure readings throughout the day. The cause of hypotension is uncertain, but it could be related to sepsis or cardiac insufficiency.

Coronary artery disease is indicated by the elevated troponin levels on admission. However, no new evidence of myocardial infarction has been observed, and heparin infusion has been stopped.

Anemia is present, but no acute drop in hemoglobin levels has been noted. There is no significant worry for bleeding at this time.

Renal failure is indicated by the chronic kidney disease history, with normalizing creatinine levels. The goal CVP remains above 8, and urine output should be maintained above 40/hr.

Heart failure, specifically chronic systolic heart failure"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension and altered mental status. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease, chronic renal failure, heart failure, dementia, diabetes mellitus type II, dysphagia, and hypernatremia. 

The patient's current vital signs show low blood pressure, decreased central venous pressure, and decreased urine output. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 390 mL, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 48. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 180 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 33 mmHg. 

The patient's physical examination reveals anasarca and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with pleural effusions on chest X-ray. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine, lactic acid, troponin T, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The patient also has hypernatremia and hypoalbuminemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension and altered mental status. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments including arterial line placement, diuresis with Lasix, heparin drip due to elevated troponin levels, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 89/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Physical examination reveals anasarca and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and troponin-T levels. Imaging shows evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, and an enlarged heart. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, coronary artery disease, hypernatremia, anemia, coagulopathy, chronic renal failure, heart failure, dementia, diabetes mellitus, and dysphagia. The patient is currently on tube feeds via G-tube and receiving ICU care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition indicates respiratory failure due to bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Elevated troponin levels suggest myocardial injury,"

   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
   The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
   global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15 %). Two large thrombi
   are seen in the left ventricle. One appears to be adherent to the
   inferior wall and apex and measures 2.9cm x 2cm. The other is near the
   anterior apex and measures approximately 1.5cm x 1.7cm. Neither appears
   to be mobile. The age of the thrombi cannot be determined by
   echocardiogram. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated, severely hypokinetic left ventricle with two large
   left ventricular thrombi. Mild mitral regurgitation and pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension.

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever, pneumonia (PNA), and hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU. On admission, the patient had elevated troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac damage. An echocardiogram revealed a severely dilated left ventricle with two large thrombi and mild mitral regurgitation. The patient's respiratory culture showed moderate growth of oropharyngeal flora, while the urine culture showed mixed bacterial flora consistent with skin and/or genital contamination.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is not ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, but it is not delirium.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and ischemic heart disease.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, indicating hypernatremia.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but the specific type is not mentioned.

   Imaging: [**3-5**] ECHO
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
   The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
   global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15 %). Two large thrombi
   are seen in the left ventricle. One appears to be adherent to the
   inferior wall and apex and measures 2.9cm x 2cm. The other is near the
   anterior apex and measures approximately 1.5cm x 1.7cm. Neither appears
   to be mobile. The age of the thrombi cannot be determined by
   echocardiogram. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated, severely hypokinetic left ventricle with two large
   left ventricular thrombi. Mild mitral regurgitation and pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 etiology Is presumably
   aspiration PNA (vanc/zosyn begun [**3-3**])
   - RSBI was 73 this AM, off sedation and more alert. Will plan to
   extubate after d/w and arrival of family
   - Vanc level this AM supratherapeutic, hold dose and change to q48h
   with levels checks prior to dose
   - Continue zosyn
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   - Much improved. Tracks intern and follows simple commands
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE) - Elevated
   troponin on admission to 1.6
   - now s/p >48h of heparin gtt, will d/c
   - continue ASA and statin
   - added low dose standing metoprolol as tolerated
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
   - worsening. Will give D5W for now and increase free water flushes if
   continues to worsen
   - check PM lytes
 BRBPR this AM
   - HCTs stable, d/c heparin gtt as above
   - check PM HCT
 LV THROMUS
 multiple. found on echo [**3-5**]. Will likely be untreatable
   in long term.
   - pt is not a long term anticoagulation candidate, and heparin gtt
   contraindication given BRBPR
   - continue ASA, no coumadin
   -  this diagnosis would make a code situation with chest compressions
   essentially contraindicated. Family aware and has made patient DNR
 RENAL FAILURE
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   - likely ischemic ATN per urine lytes and FeNA
   - trend Cr
   - avoid diuresis in the short term
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, CHRONIC
   - LV function is even worse on recent echo, down to 10-15%
   - continue ASA, add BB as tolerated as above
 PAF
 one episode yesterday, since then has been in sinus rhythm
   - starting standing BB today, daily ASA
   - monitor on tele
 Dirty U/A
   - no culture data available. Pt already on vanc and zosyn.
   - change Foley today, send U/A and culture after catheter is changed
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   - continue alzheimers meds
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   - better glucose control with increase in glargine
   - anticipate worsening of FSGs with D5W to treat hypernatremia,
   continue Insulin SS

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever, pneumonia, and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He has a history of chronic heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, and dementia.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, metoprolol, lansoprazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, insulin, ASA, statin, and Alzheimer's medications.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, troponin levels, and blood glucose levels. The echocardiogram reveals a severely hypokinetic left ventricle with two large left ventricular thrombi, mild mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's respiratory culture shows moderate growth of oropharyngeal flora, while the urine culture shows mixed bacterial flora consistent with skin and/or genital contamination.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam has been initiated.
2. Altered mental status improving with improved oxygenation and sedation reduction.
3. Coronary artery disease with elevated troponin levels on admission. Heparin therapy has been administered, and the patient will be discharged from heparin gtt.
4. Hypernatrem"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure, altered mental status, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypernatremia, anemia, coagulopathy, renal failure, chronic heart failure, dementia, diabetes mellitus type II, dysphagia, and previous ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation support. Complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma due to high pressures in the lungs.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, and they are not fully oriented. Delirium is a potential complication that could worsen the patient's condition and prolong their stay in the ICU.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has elevated troponin levels indicating ongoing mild ischemia despite heparin therapy. This suggests that the patient may still be experiencing cardiac events, which can lead to further complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, indicating hypernatremia. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially neurological complications.
5. Anemia and Coagulopathy: The patient has anemia and coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding and blood clots. Complications may"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, dementia, dysphagia, and is currently experiencing hypernatremia and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been improving, with good respiratory support and reduced secretions. The patient is expected to be extubated after the family arrives, but will require further monitoring and care in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest in the ICU.
3. Stress ulcers - The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis, indicating an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Hypernatremia - The patient's high sodium levels need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as seizures or neurological damage.
5. Worsening renal function - The patient has chronic renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function during the ICU stay.
6. Cardiac events - The patient's history of coronary artery disease and heart failure increases the risk of cardiac events, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
7. Infection - Due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia (AP): The patient's chief complaint is aspiration PNA, which is likely contributing to their respiratory failure.
2. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10-15% on echo. They are currently experiencing acute exacerbation due to fluid overload.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The most likely etiology is aspiration PNA with a contribution from CHF. RSBI was 73 this morning, off sedation, and remains alert.
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Elevated troponin on admission suggests possible acute coronary syndrome. The patient is already on heparin, ASA, metoprolol, and statin therapy.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a history of chronic renal failure but now approaching baseline creatinine. FeNa >5%, indicating ATN from hypotension. Trending Cr [Hospital1], now diuresing aggressively so monitor closely.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
- Heart Rate: 70 bpm
- Blood Pressure: 95/63 mmHg
- Respiratory Rate: 19 breaths per minute
- Oxygen Saturation: 98% on supplemental oxygen

The patient has a history of chronic renal failure with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 10-15%. He also has a history of coronary artery disease, including a previous myocardial infarction, and diabetes mellitus type II.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating possible ongoing myocardial injury. His white blood cell count is elevated, suggestive of an infection or inflammatory process. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. Electrolyte imbalances are present, including hypernatremia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, with a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 41, indicating a decreased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia. However, the patient remains at high risk for further complications due to his underlying medical conditions, including chronic kidney disease, coronary"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several ongoing medical complications. The patient has respiratory failure, most likely caused by aspiration pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF). The plan is to extubate the patient today, but the prognosis is poor, and reintubation may not significantly change the course of the disease.

The patient also has coronary artery disease (CAD), although there have been no obvious episodes of ischemia in the last two days. The elevated troponin level on admission indicates ongoing cardiac issues.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with a high sodium level and chronic renal failure (CRF) due to chronic kidney disease. The patient is currently being treated with diuretics and an ACE inhibitor.

Other medical conditions include anemia, altered mental status, dementia, type II diabetes mellitus, dysphagia, and a history of heart failure. The patient is receiving tube feeds through a G-tube and is on multiple medications for prophylaxis against various conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and their disposition is to remain in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing worsening pulmonary edema, desats to mid-high 80s, tachycardia to 110-120s, and mild distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/58 to 159/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including vancomycin, Zosyn, furosemide, morphine, scopolamine, and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to worsening pulmonary edema and aspiration pneumonia. The use of non-invasive ventilation (CPAP/PSV) and aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device suggests ongoing respiratory support.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10-15%. Diuretics are being used to manage fluid overload.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: Elevated troponin levels on admission indicate possible acute coronary syndrome. The patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and heparin.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level and a history of chronic renal insuff"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing worsening pulmonary edema, desats to mid-high 80s, tachycardia to 110-120s, and mild distress. Medications administered include Lasix, morphine, nitropaste, metoprolol, and scopolamine patch. The patient is unable to provide history due to encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening infection: The patient is afebrile but concerning for worsening infection. Differential diagnoses include aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and line infection. It is recommended to check the differential, repeat urine analysis (UA) and blood cultures.
2. Fluid overload: The patient is still fluid overloaded and requires continued diuresis. The goal is to achieve a net negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters today. Electrolytes should be monitored in the post-midnight period.
3. Acute respiratory failure: The most likely etiology of the respiratory failure is aspiration pneumonia with a contribution from congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient should continue receiving vancomycin and Zosyn antibiotics, as well as scopolamine to reduce oral secretions.
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The elevated troponin on admission suggests ongoing myocardial ischemia. The patient should continue medical management with aspirin (ASA), metop"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He is extubated and requiring frequent suctioning. The patient's allergies include ipratropium, with unknown severity. He is currently receiving various medications including antibiotics, furosemide, morphine sulfate, and metoprolol. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for dyspnea and anemia.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/68 mmHg to 159/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's cardiovascular status shows sinus rhythm with a systolic murmur. Physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, cool skin, and trace edema in both extremities. Neurologic examination shows the patient follows simple commands but tone, movement, and response assessment are not available.

Lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several ongoing problems including coronary artery disease with congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure, hypernatremia, altered mental status, chronic renal failure, anemia of unknown etiology, diabetes mellitus type II, and dysphagia. Prognosis remains poor, and the family has been informed that the patient will not be reintubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and dysphagia, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia or worsening respiratory distress.
2. Cardiac Complications: With a history of coronary artery disease and CHF, the patient is at risk for further cardiac events such as arrhythmias or heart failure exacerbation.
3. Renal Complications: The presence of acute renal failure and chronic renal failure increases the risk of worsening kidney function and potential electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the presence of diabetes and chronic illnesses, making him more susceptible to infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
5. Metabolic Imbalances: The patient's hypernatremia and altered mental status indicate potential metabolic disturbances that need close monitoring and management.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition, manage his comorbidities, and provide appropriate supportive care to minimize the risk of these potential complications."

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of chronic heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, dementia, and dysphagia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia with possible contribution from CHF. The patient's medical conditions include encephalopathy, anemia, altered mental status, and LV thrombi. He is on multiple medications including diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's current condition of respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia puts him at risk for developing VAP. Proper ventilation techniques and adherence to infection control measures are necessary to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of DVT, which can potentially lead to a life-threatening PE if not prevented. The patient is on prophylactic subcutaneous heparin to reduce this risk.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline chronic renal insufficiency may worsen due to factors such as hypotension, use of nephrotoxic medications, or the progression of underlying kidney disease.
4. Wound infections: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of developing wound infections at the site of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He is unresponsive and unable to provide history. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, dysphagia, and anemia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 84/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a face tent and has a diminished radial pulse on the right side. Physical examination findings include dullness at the lung bases, diminished breath sounds, cool skin, and no spontaneous movement. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin levels. The patient's plan is focused on comfort measures, with intermittent suctioning and morphine as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased sputum production, and changes in oxygenation is important.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and decreased venous return due to mechanical ventilation increase the risk of DVT formation. Regular assessment for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions and complications. The chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient's primary goal at this point is comfort, and they are being provided with intermittent suctioning and morphine as needed.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic renal failure (CRF), anemia, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), and dysphagia. They are unable to provide their own history as they are unresponsive.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, blood pressure ranging from 84/44 mmHg to 128/63 mmHg, heart rate of 59 bpm, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a face tent.

The physical examination shows the patient to be overweight/obese, with diminished radial and digital pulses, dullness in the lung bases, diminished breath sounds, cool skin, no spontaneous movement, and no assessed muscle tone.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, high creatinine, elevated troponin levels, high potassium, low sodium, and altered liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is low, and they require a face tent for oxygen delivery. This indicates significant respiratory compromise.

2. Renal failure: The"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient appears alert and interacts non-verbally, following commands. They have allergies to ipratropium and an unknown allergy. The patient is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Infusions and other medications are also being administered.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/70 mmHg to 81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a face tent. The patient is hemodynamically stable, with a sinus rhythm and normal heart sounds. There are crackles in the chest but have improved. The patient has anasarca, a soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and a G-tube in place.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.1 K/uL, elevated troponin levels, and increased creatinine levels. The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10-15%. They are on diuretics, beta-blockers, and an ACE inhibitor. The patient also has acute respiratory failure likely due to aspiration PNA and contribution from CHF. They are receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy and sc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical conditions including chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10-15%, acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and potential contribution from heart failure, coronary artery disease with elevated troponin on admission, acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.1, anemia, altered mental status, dementia, type II diabetes mellitus, and dysphagia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may lead to further deterioration, resulting in fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Pneumonia progression: Aspiration pneumonia can worsen and lead to sepsis, respiratory distress, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure could progress, leading to increased creatinine levels, fluid retention, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Ischemic heart disease: The patient's coronary artery disease may result in myocardial infarction or unstable angina, especially with the elevated troponin levels.
5. Wound infection or bedsores: Immobility and pressure ulcers can increase the risk of wound infections or the development of bedsores.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to eat orally due to dysphagia and the use of"

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a chief complaint of aspiration pneumonia. He appears more comfortable and alert, able to speak, and has been weaned down to a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery. The patient had asymptomatic runs of accelerated idioventricular rhythm, diuresed -400cc at midnight, and his diuresis goal was -1 liter. He is receiving antibiotics, vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and has been on heparin sodium prophylaxis.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/61 to 123/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight is 100.1 kg, with total intake of 2,514 mL, including 1,113 mL by mouth and 890 mL intravenously. His urine output is 2,905 mL, and he has a negative fluid balance of -391 mL.

The patient is awake, making eye contact, and answering yes/no questions appropriately. His cardiovascular examination reveals distant heart sounds with no murmur, and his peripheral pulses are not assessed. Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds with good air movement anteriorly. Abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender bowel sounds. Extremities are cool and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a history of aspiration pneumonia, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. He is currently in the ICU and has shown improvement in his general condition, appearing more comfortable and alert. He has been weaned off supplemental oxygen and is now on nasal cannula. The patient had asymptomatic runs of Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR) but no other significant changes were noted.

Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient initially presented with aspiration pneumonia, which is a common complication in elderly patients with swallowing difficulties.
2. Heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure. His current condition indicates ongoing heart failure symptoms, such as pulmonary edema, shortness of breath, and fluid retention.
3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has elevated troponin levels on admission, indicating possible acute coronary syndrome or ongoing ischemic heart disease.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still compromised due to the underlying pneumonia and acute congestive heart failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient had resolved hypernatremia, which can be associated with dehydration or excessive sodium intake.
7. Altered mental status: The patient initially presented with altered mental status"
