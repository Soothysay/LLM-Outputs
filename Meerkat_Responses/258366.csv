","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine level of 1.4), schizoaffective disorder, chronic hyperkalemia possibly due to beta-blocker use, remote pulmonary embolism on coumadin, clinical diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without pulmonary function tests or imaging evidence of emphysema, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. The patient presented with presyncope and was found to be lethargic on the floor with an arterial blood gas (ABG) showing pH 7.19, PaCO2 90, and PaO2 99.

The patient required non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for a few hours due to hypoventilation but desaturated and was placed back on bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP). The patient's condition improved with increased FiO2, and he was given supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 107/72 to 118/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has edema in both lower extremities and an ulceration on the left shin. His blood glucose level is within normal"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 1.4), schizoaffective disorder, chronic hyperkalemia possibly due to beta-blocker use, remote pulmonary embolism on coumadin, and clinical diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but without pulmonary function tests or imaging evidence of emphysema, and left hemidiaphragm elevation.

The patient presented with presyncope and was found to be lethargic on the floor with an arterial blood gas (ABG) showing pH 7.19, PaCO2 90, and PaO2 99. He was alert and oriented x3 with decreased breath sounds at bases, right-sided rhonchi, 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema with chronic venous stasis changes, no open areas, and no skin or neurologic assessments performed.

Lab results showed a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, leukocyte count of 240 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 99 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL, sodium of 31 mEq/L, potassium of 5.2 mEq/L, chloride of 105 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 43 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.1 mg/dL, phosphate of 4.4 mg/dL, glucose of 81 mg/dL, and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) of 22.2/2.1. Other lab values were within normal range or not significantly abnormal.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure - unclear etiology but now doing well, placed on BiPAP overnight for presumed sleep apnea, continue to avoid sedating agents, and may have component of obesity hypoventilation, history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), so would ask sleep consult to see patient and continue nighttime BiPAP for now.
2. Acute renal failure likely pre-renal in etiology - creatinine improving from 2.9 on admission to 1.9 today, lasix on hold.
3. History of pulmonary embolism (PE) on coumadin - restarted coumadin today given INR 2.1 today.
4. Schizoaffective disorder - continue home regimen.
5.

He presented with presyncope and lethargy, and was found to have an abnormal blood gas (ABG) of 7.19/90/99.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been on BiPAP overnight for presumed sleep apnea. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.2Â°C (99Â°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 112/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. He is currently on various medications including ipratropium, fluticasone, divalproex, risperidone, hydroxychloroquine, and ranitidine.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of -875 mL over the past 24 hours, with total intake being 700 mL and total output being 1,575 mL. He is receiving supplemental oxygen through a"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine level of 1.4), schizoaffective disorder, chronic hyperkalemia thought due to beta blocker use, remote pulmonary embolism on coumadin, and clinical diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without pulmonary function tests or imaging evidence of emphysema, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He was admitted with presyncope and lethargy, and his arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.19, which indicates severe acidosis.

The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation support. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/51 to 141/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. He is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 700 mL and total output of 1575 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 875 mL. His respiratory support includes a ventilator mode of standby, set with a tidal volume of 489 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 16 cmH2O. His ABG values are as follows: pH 7.26, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 73 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 226, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 31 mEq/L.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 5.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 37.7%, platelet (Plt) count of 240 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 2.5 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 99 mg/dL, and various other lab values within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without acute exacerbation. He is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is still pending."

   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Likely has some obstructive lung
   disease despite relatively unremarkable imaging.  Does have chronic
   respiratory acidosis and responds to nebulizers.  Etiology of acute
   worsening unclear.  Unlikely related to pscyhotrophic medications as
   these are hepatically cleared per pharm.  Neg head CT and tox screen.
   - continue fluticasone, albuterol, Ipratropium
   - BiPAP overnight and as needed for acidemia
   - will need formal sleep study and PFTs as outpatient
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1458**] here at

   of his chronic kidney disease is felt to be multifactorial, including
   lithium toxicity, renal hypperfusion from CHF, NSAIDs in setting of RA,
   PVD with RAS, diabetic/ hypertensive nephropathy.  FeNa < 1%.

- The patient is a 63-year-old man with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal insufficiency, schizophrenia, chronic hyperkalemia, remote pulmonary embolism, clinical diagnosis of COPD, and left hemidiaphragm elevation.
- He was admitted for presyncope and later transferred to the MICU for lethargy and an ABG showing respiratory acidosis.
- The patient's current condition is stable, with improved mental status cleared while on BiPAP.
- Imaging reveals mucosal thickening of the left maxillary and ethmoid sinuses with an air-fluid level in the left maxillary sinus, but no acute bleed or masses.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/51 to 141/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
- Fluid balance shows a total intake of 700 mL and total output of 1575 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 875 mL.
- The patient is on non-invasive ventilation with a standby ventilator mode, using a nasal cannula, with a tidal volume of 489 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 16 cmH2O.
- Blood gas analysis shows pH of 7.31, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 90 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 35 mEq/L.
- Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 240 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 10.2 g/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 141 mEq/L, potassium (K+) level of 5.2 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) level of 99 mg/dL, and glucose level of 81 mg/dL.
- Imaging also shows no evidence of acute bleed or masses.
- The patient has several medical conditions including hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, remote history of pulmonary embolism, leg ulceration concerning for peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and pre-syncope/fall with unclear etiology.
- The patient's medications include fluticasone, albuterol, ipratropium, BiPAP overnight, risperidone, oxcarbamazapine, divalproex, ASA 81 mg daily, flomax, home gtt's for glaucoma, hydroxychloroquine, ranitidine, warfarin, and bowel regimen.
- The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently receiving ICU care with nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's elevated PCO2 levels indicate respiratory acidosis, which may worsen if his respiratory function deteriorates further.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest worsening renal function, which could lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and further deterioration of renal function.
3. Leg ulceration with concern for PAD: The presence of a leg ulcer raises concern for compromised blood flow to the extremities, increasing the risk of tissue necrosis and potential limb loss.
4. Pre-syncope/fall with unclear etiology: The patient's history of presyncope and fall without identified cause increases the risk of future sync"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal insufficiency, schizoaffective disorder, chronic hyperkalemia, remote pulmonary embolism on coumadin, clinical diagnosis of COPD but no pulmonary function tests, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He was admitted with presyncope and lethargy, and found to have an ABG of 7.19/90/99. The patient did not tolerate nasal BiPAP but tolerated full face mask BiPAP. ABG improved from 7.23/89/90 to 7.27/78/81 on BiPAP. Switched to nasal CPAP, ABG improved further to 7.29/76/66. Sleep study with auto-set CPAP showed ABG while on CPAP as 7.29/76/66. The patient has a history of episodic hyperkalemia and is on coumadin for a past pulmonary embolism. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure due to likely combination of L hemidiaphragm dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea, and central hypoventilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal insufficiency, schizoaffective disorder, chronic hyperkalemia, remote pulmonary embolism on coumadin, clinical diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He was admitted with presyncope and found to be lethargic with an initial arterial blood gas (ABG) showing severe respiratory acidosis. The patient required various respiratory support measures including BiPAP, CPAP, and nasal cannula oxygen.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure due to likely combination of L hemidiaphragm dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea, and central hypoventilation.
   - Change fluticasone to Advair 250/50 1 puff [**Hospital1 7**] for persistent wheezing.
   - Sleep study last night will need to followup optimal CPAP based on yesterday's study.

2. Acute renal failure likely pre-renal in etiology.
   - Cr improving from 2.9 on admission to 1.9 to 1.5 today.

3. History of PE on coumadin.
   - On coumadin for goal INR [**2-9**].

4. Schizoaffective disorder.
   - Continue home regimen, none of which are renally cleared.

5. Episodic hyperkalemia"

The patient presented with presyncope and was found to be lethargic on the floor with an initial arterial blood gas (ABG) showing pH 7.19, PaCO2 of 90, and PaO2 of 99.

During the hospital stay, the patient underwent several interventions including a trial of BiPAP, which improved ABG results, and a switch to nasal CPAP. An overnight sleep study with auto-set CPAP was also performed. The patient's potassium level was noted to be elevated at 6.0 meq/L, and an EKG did not show any changes related to hyperkalemia. Kayexalate was ordered to help lower the potassium level.

The patient's vital signs were monitored, showing a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/68 mmHg to 166/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm was noted to be in sinus rhythm.

The patient was admitted for presyncope and lethargy and was later transferred to the MICU.

The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to a history of sleep apnea +/- obstructive lung disease. There was some worsening last night with an ABG showing acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis in the setting of somnolence. The plan includes continuing fluticasone, albuterol, and ipratropium, initiating BiPAP overnight and as needed for acidemia, and scheduling a formal sleep study and pulmonary function tests as an outpatient.

The patient also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with an improving creatinine level due to volume resuscitation. The plan is to continue holding lasix until the creatinine improves to baseline. Additionally, the patient has hyperkalemia, for which he received polysterene x1 and will be rechecked in lytes PM. A low potassium diet has also been recommended.

   63 yo man with DM II, CRI (baseline Cr 1.4), schizoaffective disorder,
   chronic hyperkalemia thought due to beta blocker, remote PE on
   coumadin, clinical diagnosis of COPD but no PFTs and imaging without
   evidence of emphysema, and L hemidiaphragm elevation admitted for
   presyncope and transferred to MICU for lethary and ABG 7.19/90/99.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  likely related to a h/o sleep apnea
   +/- obstructive lung disease.  Had some worsening last night with ABG
   showing acute on chronic respiratory acidosis in the setting of
   somnolence.  Status post sleep study.
   - continue fluticasone, albuterol, Ipratropium
   - BiPAP overnight and as needed for acidemia
   - will need formal sleep study and PFTs as outpatient
   - outpatient sleep study
   - consider further evaluation of psychotropic meds and possible
   sedating effect
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1458**] here at
   [**Hospital1 19**].  Baseline 1.5, improving currently w/ volume resuscitation.
   -trend Cr
   -cont to hold lasix until cr improves to baseline
   # H/o PE: Remote history.
   - start heparin for inr 1.5
   - continue warfain
   # LE ulceration: concering for manifestations of PAD.  [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from
   ABIs as outpatient.  Wound care nurse following.
   - appreciate wound care recs
   # Pre-Syncope and Fall:  Unclear etiology.  No focal neurologic
   deficits on exam.  No fractures on pelvic xray.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 1.4), schizoaffective disorder, chronic hyperkalemia thought due to beta blocker use, remote pulmonary embolism on coumadin, clinical diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but no pulmonary function tests (PFTs) or imaging evidence of emphysema, and left hemidiaphragm elevation. He was admitted for presyncope and transferred to the MICU for lethargy and an arterial blood gas (ABG) showing severe respiratory acidosis.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: likely related to a history of sleep apnea +/- obstructive lung disease. There was some worsening last night with an ABG showing acute on chronic respiratory acidosis in the setting of somnolence. The plan is to continue fluticasone, albuterol, and ipratropium, as well as BiPAP overnight and as needed for acidemia. A formal sleep study and PFTs will be needed as an outpatient.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: followed by Dr. [Last Name (Title)] here at [Hospital]. Baseline creatinine 1.5, improving currently with volume resuscitation. It is planned to trend creatinine and hold lasix until"
