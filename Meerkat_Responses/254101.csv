   64 y/o M with hx of CHF, afib, aflutter, s/p PPM for SSS, RCC on chemo
   with Bevacizumab / Temsirolimus who presented with probably VT arrest
   who is transferred to the MICU for fevers and rash and presumed sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: patient transferred with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension,
   likely sepsis from a cellulitis.  Was febrile to 104 most of day
   today.  Has received 1750 cc of fluid total so far with a decrease in
   his HR but BP dropping.
   - IVFs PRN with 250 cc boluses for MAP <60
   - consider CVL if BP does not respond to fluids for pressors
   - trend lactates, CVPs in CVL placed
   - abx with vanco/zosyn/clinda as discussed below
   .
   # Fevers: most obvious cause is the new rash which is likely
   cellulitis.  Strange that it is [**Last Name (LF) 12001**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] could be a systemic
   bacteremia that is manifesting itself at the venopuncture sites.  No
   central lines or ports, but does have a PPM in place, although not
   recently manipulated.  No other skin tears or rashes that could be
   niduses of infection.  UA normal and CXR without infiltrate.  Abdominal
   exam benign but does have hx of chronic diarrhea.
   - vanco/zosyn for now
   - ID consults in AM
   - tylenol PRN
   .
   # Rash: unclear etiology, looks like sepsis but could be secondary to
   microvascular thrombotic events, chemotherapy reactions, latex allergic
   reactions or other unclear reasons.  Has been outlined.
   - abx as above
   - continue to follow clinically
   - consider derm if not improving
   .
   # Vtach: stable VTach overnight for about 10 minutes.
   - EP re-consult today
   - continue amio load
   - telemetrey, replace lytes as needed
   .
   # Syncope: unclear etiology, but ? VT arrest vs. other cardiogenic
   cause.  Did have an echo today and was going to go to an EP study, but
   deferred because of infection.
   - EP recs
   - consider study when stable
   - avoid pressors with B1 agonist if possible
   .
   # CHF: has EF of about 25% based on echo today.  Has new O2 requirement
   after being given IVFs.  Is stable with his breathing, though, no
   admission to the ICU.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - avoid diuresis at this time
   .
   # RCC: is stable per old onc recs; currently under treatment and was
   due for next dosing tomorrow.
   - hold on chemo given infection
   .
   # Afib/flutter: has hx of aflutter and was anticoagulated.  Stable in
   NSR at this time.  Has pacer for sick sinus syndrome.
   - hold anticoagulation at this time given possible need for procedure
   .
   # HTN: hypotensive given sepsis.
   - hold antihypertensive.
   .
   # Hyperthryroidism: cont levothyroxine

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and flutter, who presented with a probable ventricular tachycardia arrest. He was transferred to the MICU for fevers and rash, presumed sepsis, and is currently experiencing hypotension and tachycardia. The patient has received a total of 1750 cc of fluid so far with a decrease in his heart rate but dropping blood pressure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.8째C (101.8째F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 97/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving amiodarone at a rate of 1 mg/min and phenylephrine at 2.5 mcg/kg/min. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 36.6%, platelet count of 108 K/uL, creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, blood glucose of 122 mg/dL, and lactate level of 2.9 mmol/L. Other labs include PT/PTT/INR of 15.1/29.7/1.3, ALT/AST of 15/28, alkalinized phosphatase/TBili of 63/0.8, and calcium/magnesium/phosphate levels within normal range. 

The patient has been diagnosed with cardiac dysrhythmia, fever, sepsis, and rash. The assessment and plan include managing the patient's cardiac dysrhythmia with amiodarone, treating the fever with antipyretics and broad-spectrum antibiotics, addressing the sepsis with IV fluids and vasopressors, and evaluating the rash to determine its etiology. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis leading to organ dysfunction, further episodes of ventricular tachycardia, development of complications related to the chemotherapy treatment, and potential cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or heart failure exacerbation."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), flutter, and sick sinus syndrome (SSS) who presented with a probable ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest. He was transferred to the MICU for fevers and rash, presumed to be sepsis secondary to cellulitis. The patient's initial presentation included fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. He received IV fluids and antibiotics, and an arterial line was placed.

The patient has several medical conditions, including CHF, afib/flutter, SSS, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) undergoing chemotherapy with Bevacizumab/Temsirolimus. He also has a pacemaker (PPM) for SSS. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.8째F, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 97/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. He is receiving amiodarone for VTach, phenylephrine for pressor support, and IV fluids as needed.

Physical examination reveals crackles in the bases of the lungs, right lower extremity edema absent, left lower extremity edema absent, and a rash on the dorsum of the hand with an erythematous patch"

   64 y/o M with hx of CHF, afib, aflutter, s/p PPM for SSS, RCC on chemo
   with Bevacizumab / Temsirolimus who presented with probably VT arrest
   who is transferred to the MICU for fevers and rash and presumed sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: patient transferred with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension,
   likely sepsis from a cellulitis.  Was febrile to 104 most of day
   today.  Has received 1750 cc of fluid total so far with a decrease in
   his HR but BP dropping.
   - IVFs PRN with 250 cc boluses for MAP <60
   - trend lactates, CVPs in CVL placed
   - Continue abx with vanco/zosyn as discussed below
   - F/U cultures
 trend daily BCx
   - ID consult to discuss management
   - Will request read of TTE for ? vegetation; consider TEE
   # Fevers: most obvious cause is the new rash which is likely
   cellulitis.  Has started growing GPCs in [**2-16**] bottles.  Strange that it
   is [**Last Name (LF) 12001**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] could be a systemic bacteremia that is manifesting
   itself at the venopuncture sites.  No central lines or ports, but does
   have a PPM in place, although not recently manipulated.  No other skin
   tears or rashes that could be niduses of infection.  UA normal and CXR
   without infiltrate.  Abdominal exam benign but does have hx of chronic
   diarrhea.
   - vanco/zosyn for now
   - ID consults today
   - tylenol PRN
   .
   # Rash: stable, shrinking; likely is a GPC cellulitis
   # Vtach: stable VTach overnight for about 10 minutes.  Long-term will
   likely need EP study.
   - EP re-consult today
   - continue amio load
   - telemetrey, replace lytes as needed
   - keep chest pads in place in case of recurrence
   .
   # Syncope: unclear etiology, but ? VT arrest vs. other cardiogenic
   cause.  Did have an echo today and was going to go to an EP study, but
   deferred because of infection.
   - reevaluate echo from two days ago for possible beg
   - EP recs
   - consider study when stable
   - avoid pressors with B1 agonist if possible
   .
   # CHF: has EF of about 25% based on echo today.  Has new O2 requirement
   after being given IVFs.  Is stable with his breathing, though, no
   admission to the ICU.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - avoid diuresis at this time
   .
   # RCC: is stable per old onc recs; currently under treatment and due
   for next dosing today.
   - hold on chemo given infection
   - Touch base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of oncology/onc fellow re: next cycle of
   chemo (due today)
   .
   # Afib/flutter: has hx of aflutter and was anticoagulated.  Stable in

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), flutter, and sick sinus syndrome (SSS). He was admitted to the MICU for fevers and rash, presumed to be sepsis from cellulitis. The patient has been experiencing recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrests, hypotension, and hypoxia. He has undergone multiple interventions including fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and cardiac pacing.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Sepsis: The patient was transferred with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, suggesting possible sepsis. The presence of a rash and growing gram-positive cocci (GPC) in cultures indicates a bacterial infection, likely cellulitis.

2. Cellulitis: The patient's rash, which is likely cellulitis, can lead to complications such as skin breakdown, increased risk of infection, and systemic bacteremia.

3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of afib, flutter, and VT arrests. These cardiac arrhythmias can increase the risk of further complications such as stroke, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death.

4. Heart failure: The patient has a history of CHF with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of about 25%. Heart failure can worsen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient experienced multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia and was on pressors, but later had episodes of hypotension requiring bolus administration of fluids. The patient also had a fever, rash, and abnormal laboratory values including elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal coagulation profiles. The patient's vital signs were unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate, and required titration of medications. The patient was given amiodarone for cardiac rhythm control and esmolol for blood pressure management, although the esmolol drip was not initiated. The patient received various antibiotics for sepsis. The patient's respiratory status was supported with supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, but had an oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's fluid balance showed a net positive balance of 2,641 mL. The patient's peripheral pulses were not assessed, and neurologic examination was incomplete. The patient's arterial blood gas revealed respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. The patient's lab results indicated leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures were positive for bacteria.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of ventricular tachycardia (Vtach). The patient experienced another episode of Vtach overnight, lasting 10 minutes. The patient was taken off pressors and became hypertensive, with systolic blood pressures ranging from 190 to 210 mmHg. Lidocaine was administered at a rate of 2 mg/min and then titrated down and eventually stopped over the course of 6 hours. An esmolol drip was ordered but not given, and the patient was bolused with hypotensive medication around 1 am. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfonamides, possible hematuria, Wellbutrin, an unknown seizure, and latex causing a rash. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Piperacillin on 04/13/2106 at 04:25 pm, Vancomycin on 04/13/2106 at 10:00 pm, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 04/14/2106 at 12:10 am.

Infusions include amiodarone at 0.5 mg/min and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other ICU medications include amiodarone, which was started on 04/13/2106 at 12:36 pm. The patient is also receiving a prophylactic dose of heparin sodium since 04/14/2106 at 12:15 am.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Flowsheet data shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring shows central venous pressure (CVP) at 7 mmHg. Fluid balance indicates a total input of 4,936 mL with 1,856 mL given through intravenous fluids. Total output includes 2,295 mL of blood products and 2,065 mL of urine. The respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula with a SpO2 of 93% and an arterial blood gas (ABG) reading of 7.37/40/123/19/-1.

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and other systems. Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 132 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, sodium of 19 mEq/L, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, glucose of 122 mg/dL, and platelet count of 108 K/uL. Other lab values include elevated PT/PTT/INR, slightly elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal blood gases.

   TEE: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
   mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid
   inferior hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
   arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
   aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or vegetations
   are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess is seen. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
   pulmonic valve. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Good quality study. No valvular vegetations or perivavlar
   abcesses seen. No vegetations seen on RA/RV pacer leads. Mild mitral
   regurgitation. Mild focal left ventricular dysfunction with basal to
   mid wall hypokinesis. Compared to the transthoracic echo of [**4-12**]/9, the
   anterior wall motion looks normal and the inferior wall is less
   hypokinetic.
   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o M with hx of CHF, afib, aflutter, s/p PPM for SSS, RCC on chemo
   with Bevacizumab / Temsirolimus who presented with probable VT arrest
   who is transferred to the MICU for fevers and rash and presumed sepsis
   with hospital course complicated by episodes of sustained VT.
   .
   # Sepsis: patient transferred with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension,
   likely sepsis from a cellulitis.  Afebrile now for 36 hours on
   vancomycin/zosyn/nafcillin. Now normotensive and off of pressors.  TEE
   negative for involvement of heart of PPM leads.  If persistently
   febrile consider involvement of spine hardware, PPM, deep tissue
   infection in hand.
   - IVFs PRN with 250 cc boluses for MAP <60
   - trend lactates, CVPs in CVL placed
   - continue vancomycin/nafcillin; consider d/c zosyn
   - F/U results of daily cultures
   # Vtach:  Patient with intermittent episodes of sustained ventricular
   tachycardia, hemodynamically stable
   - monitor on telemetry
   - F/U EP recs
   - continue PO amiodarone 400 [**Hospital1 **] for one week then reduce to
   maintenance
   - continue PO metoprolol and titrate up as blood pressure tolerates
   - keep chest pads in place in case of recurrence
   # Fevers: most obvious cause is the new rash which is likely
   cellulitis. [**4-12**] blood cultures growing MSSA.  Strange that it is
   bilateral, so could be a systemic bacteremia that is manifesting itself
   at the venopuncture sites.  No central lines or ports, but does have a
   PPM in place, although not recently manipulated.  UA normal and CXR
   without infiltrate.  If persistently febrile consider involvement of
   spine hardware, PPM, deep tissue infection in hand.
   - change antibiotics as above
   - F/U ID recs
   - tylenol PRN
   .
   # Syncope: unclear etiology, but ? VT arrest vs. other cardiogenic
   cause.  Did have an echo today and was going to go to an EP study, but
   deferred because of infection.
   - reassuring TEE from [**2106-4-14**].
   - EP recs
   - consider study when stable
   - avoid pressors with B1 agonist if possible
   .
   # Cellulitis: Clinical improvement on the left but still with swelling,
   erythema on the right.  Clinically neurovascularly intact without
   obvious fluid collection, joints non-tender without evidence of septic
   arthritis.
   - U/S to evaluate for fluid collection on Right
   - consult hand surgery
   .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Reduction in platelet count in setting of
   subcutaneous heparin concerning for HIT.
   - hold subQ heparin
   - send HIT antibody
   .
   # CHF: has EF of about 25% based on echo.  No evidence of fluid
   overload or acute CHF.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - avoid diuresis at this time
   .
   # RCC: is stable per old onc recs; currently under treatment and due
   for next dosing today.
   - hold on chemo given infection
   - will hold on chemotherapy until patient stable (based upon outpatient
   oncology recommendations).
   .
   # Afib/flutter: has hx of aflutter and was anticoagulated.  Stable in
   NSR at this time.  Has pacer for sick sinus syndrome.
   - hold anticoagulation at this time given possible need for procedure
   .
   # HTN: hypotensive given sepsis.
   - hold antihypertensive.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of cardiac dysrhythmia. The patient experienced episodes of hypotension in the early morning, but then became hypertensive with systolic blood pressures in the 200s later in the morning. Esmolol drip was started and successfully weaned off after 2 hours. A transesophageal echo (TEE) showed no vegetations on valves or pacer wires. The patient was changed to oral amiodarone after completing a 24-hour esmolol drip. Low-dose beta-blockers were started in the evening, as recommended by the electrophysiology (EP) team. Thrombocytopenia worsened from 100 to 74 to 66, so subcutaneous heparin was stopped. An email from Dr. [Last Name (Title)] in oncology stated that no chemotherapy should be given until the patient is stable as an outpatient.

The patient has allergies to sulfonamides, possible hematuria with Wellbutrin (Oral) (Bupropion Hcl), an unknown allergy causing a seizure, latex resulting in a rash, and an unknown medication causing a rash. The last doses of antibiotics administered were piperacillin on 04/13/2106 at 04:25 PM, vancomycin on 04/13/2106 at 10:00 PM, piperacillin/t"

   TEE: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
   mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid
   inferior hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
   arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
   aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or vegetations
   are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess is seen. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
   pulmonic valve. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Good quality study. No valvular vegetations or perivavlar
   abcesses seen. No vegetations seen on RA/RV pacer leads. Mild mitral
   regurgitation. Mild focal left ventricular dysfunction with basal to
   mid wall hypokinesis.
   Compared to the transthoracic echo of [**4-12**]/9, the anterior wall motion
   looks normal and the inferior wall is less hypokinetic.
   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o M with hx of CHF, afib, aflutter, s/p PPM for SSS, RCC on chemo
   with Bevacizumab / Temsirolimus who presented with probable VT arrest
   who is transferred to the MICU for fevers and rash and presumed sepsis
   with hospital course complicated by episodes of sustained VT.
   .
   # Sepsis: patient transferred with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension,
   likely sepsis from a cellulitis.  Afebrile now for 36 hours on
   vancomycin/zosyn/nafcillin. Now normotensive and off of pressors.  TEE
   negative for involvement of heart of PPM leads.  If persistently
   febrile consider involvement of spine hardware, PPM, deep tissue
   infection in hand.
   - IVFs PRN with 250 cc boluses for MAP <60
   - trend lactates, CVPs in CVL placed
   - continue vancomycin/nafcillin; consider d/c zosyn
   - F/U results of daily cultures
   # Vtach:  Patient with intermittent episodes of sustained ventricular
   tachycardia, hemodynamically stable
   - monitor on telemetry
   - F/U EP recs
   - Start PO amiodarone
   - continue PO metoprolol and titrate up as blood pressure tolerates
   - keep chest pads in place in case of recurrence
   # Fevers: most obvious cause is the new rash which is likely
   cellulitis. [**4-12**] blood cultures growing MSSA.  Strange that it is
   bilateral, so could be a systemic bacteremia that is manifesting itself
   at the venopuncture sites.  No central lines or ports, but does have a
   PPM in place, although not recently manipulated.  UA normal and CXR
   without infiltrate.  If persistently febrile consider involvement of
   spine hardware, PPM, deep tissue infection in hand.
   - change antibiotics as above
   - F/U ID recs
   - tylenol PRN
   .
   # Syncope: unclear etiology, but ? VT arrest vs. other cardiogenic
   cause.  Did have an echo today and was going to go to an EP study, but
   deferred because of infection.
   - reassuring TEE from [**2106-4-14**].
   - EP recs
   - consider study when stable
   - avoid pressors with B1 agonist if possible
   .
   #Rash:  Hand cellulitis improving, monitor clinically
   # CHF: has EF of about 25% based on echo.  No evidence of fluid
   overload or acute CHF.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - avoid diuresis at this time
   .
   # RCC: is stable per old onc recs; currently under treatment and due
   for next dosing today.
   - hold on chemo given infection
   - will hold on chemotherapy until patient stable (based upon outpatient
   oncology recommendations).
   .
   # Afib/flutter: has hx of aflutter and was anticoagulated.  Stable in
   NSR at this time.  Has pacer for sick sinus syndrome.
   - hold anticoagulation at this time given possible need for procedure
   .
   # HTN: hypotensive given sepsis.
   - hold antihypertensive.
   .
   # Hyperthryroidism: cont levothyroxine
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: cont statin and gemfibrizol

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), atrial flutter (aflutter), and sick sinus syndrome (SSS) who presented with a probable ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for fevers and rash, presumed sepsis from cellulitis. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by episodes of sustained VT, fevers, and hypotension.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presented with fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, likely due to sepsis from cellulitis. He is currently afebrile and normotensive, but still on vancomycin, nafcillin, and zosyn.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has intermittent episodes of sustained VT, which is hemodynamically stable. He is being monitored on telemetry and will continue with amiodarone and metoprolol, titrated up as blood pressure tolerates.
3. Fevers: The most obvious cause of the fevers is the new rash, which is likely cellulitis. Blood cultures growing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Other potential causes include bacteremia, involvement of spine hardware, pacemaker lead infection, or deep tissue infection in"
