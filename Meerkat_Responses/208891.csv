   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
   Assesment: This is a 66 year-old male with severe COPD and recent
   admission for COPD exacerbation who is admitted intubated after
   experiencing increased WOB and hyponatremia.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Respiratory failure: Pt presented to the ED with complaints of
   dyspnea, upon assessment required intubation currently on ventilatory
   support. Pt has a history of dyspnea that improves only with an
   increase in his steroid doses. His last spirometry in [**2114-12-26**] showed
   Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 28%; FEV1/FVC 55%.  He did not improve with
   diuresis, nitro page or nitro gtt, so this does not likely represent a
   CHF exacerbation. Also BNP was low at 364. Had recent admission for
   COPD exacerbation and was treated with 10 days of ceftaz and 5 days of
   Bactrim for pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum.  Patient did not appear to have
   much of a cough or sputum production prior to intubation.  However, he
   does have evidence of RLL infiltrate on CT scan.
   - Sputum sample if possible
   - Follow up [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 1415**] sensitivities
   - Will give vanc/zosyn for now given recent pseudomonas and MRSA +
   sputum cultures, will focus coverage within 24 hours if continued
   improvement
   - Stress dose steroids Solumedrol 125mg q8hrs
   - Patient currently weaned successfully on CPAP 5/5. Pt still has
   icnreased WOB and is not ready for extubation as of yet, particularlyt
   given his stage of COPD. Will  trial increase of PEEP to 10 to see if
   this will aid his work of breathing.
   - Will contact outpatient pulmonologist today top notify pt of
   admission
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Given family
s report that pt has had poor PO intake I
   believe he is hypovolemic hyponatremic particularly given his Na
   response to NS bolus.  NS was held this AM as pt had a 6Meq increase,
   however after NS was held pt
s Na continued to decrease. Serum Osm
   noted to be low at 251 but still within 10 of predicted Osm, urine Osm
   is higher than expected. Will continue to assess pt
s response to
   fluids, other factors to consider are SIADH however I would expect the
   urine Osm to be higher and I do not believe pt was euvolemic on
   presewntation.
   - Will try to restart NS at 75 cc/hr and continue q4hr Na checks, aim
   to correct Na 0.5Meq per hour
   - Renal is currently following appreciate recs, will f/u on Renal recs
   .
   # Delirium: Pt
s delirium state appears to be improving he was able to
   communicate a few phrases today. Cause is multifactorial.  Likely
   acutely worsened by his hyponatremia.  However, he had also been taking
   increased narcotic medication, had minimal sleep over multiple days and
   had not been eating or drinking.  Currently intubated and sedated.
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Correct hyponatremia
   - Avoid benzos or narcotics if possible
   - Continue to follow mental status when awake
   .
   # Lower extremity edema: Per the family, this has been an ongoing
   problem, never any definitive etiology.  He has diasolic heart failure,
   but no pnd/orthopnea or other symptoms suggestive of acute CHF.  Also,
   BNP was less than 400.
   - Continue to hold lasix
   - Consider compression hose

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with severe COPD and a recent admission for COPD exacerbation. He is currently intubated and on ventilatory support in the ICU.

The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea and required intubation due to increased work of breathing. He has a history of dyspnea that improves only with an increase in steroid doses. His last spirometry showed Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 of 28% and FEV1/FVC of 55%. He did not improve with diuresis, nitro page, or nitro gtt, suggesting that this is not likely a CHF exacerbation. The patient also had a recent admission for COPD exacerbation and was treated with antibiotics for pseudomonas/MRSA+ sputum. However, he does have evidence of right lower lobe infiltrate on CT scan.

The plan includes obtaining a sputum sample if possible, following up with hospital sensitivities, continuing the current antibiotic regimen, and stress dose steroids. The patient is currently weaned successfully on CPAP 5/5 but still has increased work of breathing and is not ready for extubation yet. An increase in PEEP to 10 is being tried to aid his work of breathing.

The patient also has hyponatremia, which is believed to be hypovolemic hyponatremia due to poor oral"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 5028**] remains intubated but more aware of his surroundings. He has
   transitioned off 3% NS and is currently on CPAP and PSv of [**11-4**] cms
   with continued use of accessory muscles. He has minimal secretions at
   present through ETT and is not on pressors.
   Exam notable for Tm of 99 BPof 152/71  HR of 95 RR of 16 with sats of
   96% on FiO2 of 50% and 5 PEEP . he has diffuse expiratory wheezing with
   distant breath and heart sounds. He has features of anasarca but more
   so in his lower extremities ( till his thighs). Labs notable for WBC of
   5.1 K, HCT of 31.1 , K+ of 4.6, Cr of 0.9 , Na of 126 ( 118) lactate of
   1.5. CTA chest did now show occlusive pulmonary vascular disease but
   did reveal RLL ASD and severe underlying COPD. EKG is without ischemic
   change.
   Agree with plan to continue ventilatory support today with adjustment
   of PSV/ CPAP settings and wean of FiO2. We will maximize
   bronchodilators and continue with IV solumedrol and duonebs through
   ETT. Broad antibiotics will also continue for now for suspected
   nosocomial pathogens. Na has responded to 3% saline and now NS
   infusion. It is likely a consequence of both appropriate (
   hypoperfusion and hypovolemia) and inappropriate ADH release ( lung
   disease). I have had a lengthy discussion with his family at the
   bedside and they wish for continued ventilatory support and wish to
   reverse DNR status. We will move towards attempts at extubation in next
   24 hours if he responds to supportive Rx and normalizes metabolic
   profile. Propafol appears to work well for sedation needs. He will need
   a PICC line or A line today for phlebotomy purposes.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with severe COPD and recent admission for COPD exacerbation. He presented to the ED with complaints of dyspnea and required intubation due to respiratory failure. The patient has been on ventilatory support and is currently on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. His blood gases show a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 28 mEq/L, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 326. The patient's sodium levels are low at 126 mEq/L. He also has evidence of right lower lobe infiltrate on CT scan and a history of poor oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure and required intubation. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not addressed or if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The presence of right lower lobe infiltrate on CT scan and recent pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum cultures suggest the need for appropriate antibiotic coverage.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hyponatremia with a sodium level of 126 mEq/L. This requires careful monitoring and correction to prevent"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old male with severe COPD and recent admission for COPD
   exacerbation who is admitted intubated after experiencing increased WOB
   and hyponatremia.
   #. Respiratory failure: Pt presented to the ED with complaints of
   dyspnea, upon assessment required intubation currently on ventilatory
   support. Pt has a history of dyspnea that improves only with an
   increase in his steroid doses. His last spirometry in [**2114-12-26**] showed
   Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 28%; FEV1/FVC 55%.  He did not improve with
   diuresis, nitro page or nitro gtt, so this does not likely represent a
   CHF exacerbation. Also BNP was low at 364. Had recent admission for
   COPD exacerbation and was treated with 10 days of ceftaz and 5 days of
   Bactrim for pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum.  Patient did not appear to have
   much of a cough or sputum production prior to intubation.  However, he
   does have evidence of RLL infiltrate on CT scan.
   - F/u pending sputum sample (grew out 1+ gram neg rods)
   - Follow up [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 1415**] sensitivities
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for now given recent pseudomonas and MRSA +
   sputum cultures
   - Continue IV Solumedrol
   - Patient currently at CPAP of [**11-9**].  Will attempt a SBT and extubate
   if and ABG looks ok and he does well with the SBT.
   - Ativan prn for anxiety once extubated and BIPAP support prn.
   - Speech and swallow consult given recent intubation.
   # Hyponatremia:  The patient
s Na was 118 on admission and had
   increased to 126
128 yesterday, but is no down to 126 today.  Was
   getting NS at 100 cc/hr yesterday.  On admission his Uosm was 367 and
   Una was 22.  He initally repsonded to IVF indicating that he likely had
   hypovolemic hyponatremia.  He has been volume resusitated, however he
   has not fully correctly.  Likely has a component of SIADH
   - 2 L Fluid restriction if urine lytes are consistent with SIADH
   - Continue to trend Na
   - Appreciate renal consult, will f/u recs.
   # Anemia: The patient
s Hct decreased from 31.1 to 27.7.  No clinical
   evidence of bleeding.  Hct was 32.5 on admission (baseline Hct appears
   to be in the high 20
s to low 30
   - Guaiac all stools.
   - continue to follow daily Hct.
   # Lower extremity edema: Per the family, this has been an ongoing
   problem, never any definitive etiology.  He has diasolic heart failure,
   but no pnd/orthopnea or other symptoms suggestive of acute CHF.  Also,
   BNP was less than 400.
   - Continue to hold lasix
   - compression stockings
   # Code: FULL CODE, pt does have a history of DNR/DNI but has rescinded
   it currently will be FULL CODE pending further family discussion.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Tube feeds started yesterday, being held currently in
   anticipation of possible extubation today.

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with severe COPD and recent admission for COPD exacerbation. He presented to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea and required intubation. The patient is currently on ventilatory support in the ICU.

The patient's code status was changed to full code after discussion with the family. A PICC line was placed, and his hyponatremia slowly improved from 126 to 128 with normal saline (NS). His Prot/Cr was 0.2, indicating a decreased serum protein concentration. He was started on tube feeds, but currently, they are being held in anticipation of possible extubation.

The patient's PEEP was increased to 10 cmH2O, and he is receiving 50% FiO2. His respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode, with a Vt of 611 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR of 13, PIP of 21 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 98%. ABG results show a pH of 7.31 and HCO3- of 29 mEq/L.

On physical examination, the patient appears alert and moves all extremities to commands. He has a reducible umbilical hernia and warm, dry skin with ecchymosis around the lower abdomen. Coarse breath sounds are heard bilaterally.

Laboratory findings include a WBC count of 7."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old male with severe COPD and recent admission for COPD
   exacerbation who is admitted intubated after experiencing increased WOB
   and hyponatremia.
   #. Respiratory failure: Pt presented to the ED with complaints of
   dyspnea, upon assessment required intubation currently on ventilatory
   support. Pt has a history of dyspnea that improves only with an
   increase in his steroid doses. His last spirometry in [**2114-12-26**] showed
   Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 28%; FEV1/FVC 55%.  He did not improve with
   diuresis, nitro page or nitro gtt, so this does not likely represent a
   CHF exacerbation. Also BNP was low at 364. Had recent admission for
   COPD exacerbation and was treated with 10 days of ceftaz and 5 days of
   Bactrim for pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum.  Patient did not appear to have
   much of a cough or sputum production prior to intubation.  However, he
   does have evidence of RLL infiltrate on CT scan.
   - F/u pending sputum sample (grew out 1+ gram neg rods)
   - Follow up [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 1415**] sensitivities
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for now given recent pseudomonas and MRSA +
   sputum cultures
   - Continue IV Solumedrol
   - Patient currently at CPAP of [**11-9**].  Will attempt a SBT and extubate
   if and ABG looks ok and he does well with the SBT.
   - Ativan prn for anxiety once extubated and BIPAP support prn.
   - Speech and swallow consult given recent intubation.
   # Hyponatremia:  The patient
s Na was 118 on admission and had
   increased to 126
128 yesterday, but is no down to 126 today.  Was
   getting NS at 100 cc/hr yesterday.  On admission his Uosm was 367 and
   Una was 22.  He initally repsonded to IVF indicating that he likely had
   hypovolemic hyponatremia.  He has been volume resusitated, however he
   has not fully correctly.  Likely has a component of SIADH
   - 2 L Fluid restriction if urine lytes are consistent with SIADH
   - Continue to trend Na
   - Appreciate renal consult, will f/u recs.
   # Anemia: The patient
s Hct decreased from 31.1 to 27.7.  No clinical
   evidence of bleeding.  Hct was 32.5 on admission (baseline Hct appears
   to be in the high 20
s to low 30
   - Guaiac all stools.
   - continue to follow daily Hct.
   # Lower extremity edema: Per the family, this has been an ongoing
   problem, never any definitive etiology.  He has diasolic heart failure,
   but no pnd/orthopnea or other symptoms suggestive of acute CHF.  Also,
   BNP was less than 400.
   - Continue to hold lasix
   - compression stockings
   # Code: FULL CODE, pt does have a history of DNR/DNI but has rescinded
   it currently will be FULL CODE pending further family discussion.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Tube feeds started yesterday, being held currently in
   anticipation of possible extubation today.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 5028**] is more arousable today and tolerating his SBT well. He
   continues to manifest use of his accessory muscles but his cough is
   strong. His sodium is still low and TBB has been negative without
   diuretics.
   Exam notable for Tm of 99.5 BP of 170/66  HR of 85 RR of 20 with satsof
   95% on 40% FiO2 . his belly is soft but obese. Labs notable for WBC of
   7.2K, HCT of 27.7 , K+ 3.8 , Na of 126 Cr of 0.6 . ABG is shows ph of
   7.37 and PCO2 of 57. CXR with resolving RLL ASD and no effusions
   Agree with plan to extubate. He will need aggressive nebulizer therapy
   and BP control in post extubation setting. Mucinex will be added to
   regimen and BiPAP used on as needed basis. We will recheck urine lytes
   after NS administration. If this is in keeping with SIADH, then fluid
   restriction to be considered too with /without the need for diuretics.
   Zosyn and Vanco to continue despite sputum with 1+ GNR. He will remain
   in ICU.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with severe COPD and a recent admission for COPD exacerbation. He was admitted intubated after experiencing increased work of breathing (WOB) and hyponatremia. The patient's code status was changed to full code.

The patient has a history of dyspnea that improves only with an increase in his steroid doses. His last spirometry showed Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 of 28% and FEV1/FVC of 55%. He did not improve with diuresis, nitro page or nitro gtt, so this does not likely represent a CHF exacerbation. The patient also has evidence of right lower lobe infiltrate on CT scan.

The patient's sodium levels have been fluctuating between 126 and 128, indicating hyponatremia. He initially responded to IV fluids, suggesting hypovolemic hyponatremia. However, he has not fully corrected, and it is likely that he has a component of SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion). The plan is to continue fluid restriction if urine lytes are consistent with SIADH and trend Na levels.

The patient's Hct has decreased from 31.1 to 27.7, indicating anemia. No clinical evidence of bleeding was found, and the Hct was 32.5 on admission."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 66 year-old male with severe COPD and recent
   admission for COPD exacerbation who is admitted intubated after
   experiencing increased WOB and hyponatremia.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Respiratory failure: Pt presented to the ED with complaints of
   dyspnea, upon assessment required intubation currently on ventilatory
   support. Pt has a history of dyspnea that improves only with an
   increase in his steroid doses. His last spirometry in [**2114-12-26**] showed
   Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 28%; FEV1/FVC 55%.  He did not improve with
   diuresis, nitro page or nitro gtt, so this does not likely represent a
   CHF exacerbation. Also BNP was low at 364. Had recent admission for
   COPD exacerbation and was treated with 10 days of ceftaz and 5 days of
   Bactrim for pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum.  Patient did not appear to have
   much of a cough or sputum production prior to intubation.  However, he
   does have evidence of RLL infiltrate on CT scan.
   - Sputum sample if possible
   - Follow up [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 1415**] sensitivities
   - Will give vanc/zosyn for now given recent pseudomonas and MRSA +
   sputum cultures, will focus coverage within 24 hours if continued
   improvement
   - Stress dose steroids Solumedrol 125mg q8hrs
   - Patient currently weaned successfully on CPAP 5/5. Pt still has
   icnreased WOB and is not ready for extubation as of yet, particularlyt
   given his stage of COPD. Will  trial increase of PEEP to 10 to see if
   this will aid his work of breathing.
   - Will contact outpatient pulmonologist today top notify pt of
   admission
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Given family
s report that pt has had poor PO intake I
   believe he is hypovolemic hyponatremic particularly given his Na
   response to NS bolus.  NS was held this AM as pt had a 6Meq increase,
   however after NS was held pt
s Na continued to decrease. Serum Osm
   noted to be low at 251 but still within 10 of predicted Osm, urine Osm
   is higher than expected. Will continue to assess pt
s response to
   fluids, other factors to consider are SIADH however I would expect the
   urine Osm to be higher and I do not believe pt was euvolemic on
   presewntation.
   - Will try to restart NS at 75 cc/hr and continue q4hr Na checks, aim
   to correct Na 0.5Meq per hour
   - Renal is currently following appreciate recs, will f/u on Renal recs
   .
   # Delirium: Pt
s delirium state appears to be improving he was able to
   communicate a few phrases today. Cause is multifactorial.  Likely
   acutely worsened by his hyponatremia.  However, he had also been taking
   increased narcotic medication, had minimal sleep over multiple days and
   had not been eating or drinking.  Currently intubated and sedated.
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Correct hyponatremia
   - Avoid benzos or narcotics if possible
   - Continue to follow mental status when awake
   .
   # Lower extremity edema: Per the family, this has been an ongoing
   problem, never any definitive etiology.  He has diasolic heart failure,
   but no pnd/orthopnea or other symptoms suggestive of acute CHF.  Also,
   BNP was less than 400.
   - Continue to hold lasix
   - Consider compression hose
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now, will attempt extubation tomorrow, if unable, will
   place OG and place Nutrition consult, hyponatremia management as above,
   replete lytes prn
   .
   # Access: PIV for now
   .
   # PPx: lansoprazole, hep SQ

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old male with severe COPD and recent admission for COPD
   exacerbation who is admitted intubated after experiencing increased WOB
   and hyponatremia.
   #. Respiratory failure: Pt presented to the ED with complaints of
   dyspnea, upon assessment required intubation currently on ventilatory
   support. Pt has a history of dyspnea that improves only with an
   increase in his steroid doses. His last spirometry in [**2114-12-26**] showed
   Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 28%; FEV1/FVC 55%.  He did not improve with
   diuresis, nitro page or nitro gtt, so this does not likely represent a
   CHF exacerbation. Also BNP was low at 364. Had recent admission for
   COPD exacerbation and was treated with 10 days of ceftaz and 5 days of
   Bactrim for pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum.  Patient did not appear to have
   much of a cough or sputum production prior to intubation.  However, he
   does have evidence of RLL infiltrate on CT scan.
   - Sputum sample if possible
   - Follow up [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 1415**] sensitivities
   - Will give vanc/zosyn for now given recent pseudomonas and MRSA +
   sputum cultures, will focus coverage within 24 hours if continued
   improvement
   - Stress dose steroids Solumedrol 125mg q8hrs
   - Patient currently weaned successfully on CPAP 5/5. Pt still has
   icnreased WOB and is not ready for extubation as of yet, particularlyt
   given his stage of COPD. Will  trial increase of PEEP to 10 to see if
   this will aid his work of breathing.
   - Will contact outpatient pulmonologist today top notify pt of
   admission
   # Hyponatremia: Given family
s report that pt has had poor PO intake I
   believe he is hypovolemic hyponatremic particularly given his Na
   response to NS bolus.  NS was held this AM as pt had a 6Meq increase,
   however after NS was held pt
s Na continued to decrease. Serum Osm
   noted to be low at 251 but still within 10 of predicted Osm, urine Osm
   is higher than expected. Will continue to assess pt
s response to
   fluids, other factors to consider are SIADH however I would expect the
   urine Osm to be higher and I do not believe pt was euvolemic on
   presewntation.
   - Will try to restart NS at 75 cc/hr and continue q4hr Na checks, aim
   to correct Na 0.5Meq per hour
   - Renal is currently following appreciate recs, will f/u on Renal recs
   # Delirium: Pt
s delirium state appears to be improving he was able to
   communicate a few phrases today. Cause is multifactorial.  Likely
   acutely worsened by his hyponatremia.  However, he had also been taking
   increased narcotic medication, had minimal sleep over multiple days and
   had not been eating or drinking.  Currently intubated and sedated.
   - Wean sedation as possible
   - Correct hyponatremia
   - Avoid benzos or narcotics if possible
   - Continue to follow mental status when awake
   # Lower extremity edema: Per the family, this has been an ongoing
   problem, never any definitive etiology.  He has diasolic heart failure,
   but no pnd/orthopnea or other symptoms suggestive of acute CHF.  Also,
   BNP was less than 400.
   - Continue to hold lasix
   - compression stockings
   # Code: FULL CODE, pt does have a history of DNR/DNI but has rescinded
   it currently will be FULL CODE pending further family discussion.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 year-old male with severe COPD and recent admission for COPD
   exacerbation who is admitted intubated after experiencing increased WOB
   and hyponatremia.
   #. Respiratory failure: Pt presented to the ED with complaints of
   dyspnea, upon assessment required intubation currently on ventilatory
   support. Pt has a history of dyspnea that improves only with an
   increase in his steroid doses. His last spirometry in [**2114-12-26**] showed
   Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 28%; FEV1/FVC 55%.  He did not improve with
   diuresis, nitro page or nitro gtt, so this does not likely represent a
   CHF exacerbation. Also BNP was low at 364. Had recent admission for
   COPD exacerbation and was treated with 10 days of ceftaz and 5 days of
   Bactrim for pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum.  Patient did not appear to have
   much of a cough or sputum production prior to intubation.  However, he
   does have evidence of RLL infiltrate on CT scan.
   - F/u pending sputum sample (grew out 1+ gram neg rods)
   - Follow up [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 1415**] sensitivities
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for now given recent pseudomonas and MRSA +
   sputum cultures
   - Will change his steroids from Solumedrol 125mg q8hrs to prednisone 60
   mg daily.
   - Patient currently at CPAP of [**11-9**].  Will try to wean as tolerated.
   # Hyponatremia:  The patient
s Na was 118 on admission and had
   increased to 126
128 yesterday, but is no down to 126 today.  Was
   getting NS at 100 cc/hr yesterday.  On admission his Uosm was 367 and
   Una was 22.  He initally repsonded to IVF indicating that he likely had
   hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - Will given 1 L NS bolus now and recheck Na to look for improvement.
   If it doesn
t respond, then this is likely SIADH
   - Appreciate renal consult, will f/u recs.
   # Anemia: The patient
s Hct decreased from 31.1 to 27.7.  No clinical
   evidence of bleeding.  Hct was 32.5 on admission (baseline Hct appears
   to be in the high 20
s to low 30
   - Guaiac all stools.
   - continue to follow daily Hct.
   # Lower extremity edema: Per the family, this has been an ongoing
   problem, never any definitive etiology.  He has diasolic heart failure,
   but no pnd/orthopnea or other symptoms suggestive of acute CHF.  Also,
   BNP was less than 400.
   - Continue to hold lasix
   - compression stockings
   # Code: FULL CODE, pt does have a history of DNR/DNI but has rescinded
   it currently will be FULL CODE pending further family discussion.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Tube feeds started yesterday, being held currently in
   anticipation of possible extubation today.

He presented to the ED with complaints of dyspnea and required intubation due to increased work of breathing (WOB) and hyponatremia. He has a history of dyspnea that improves only with an increase in his steroid doses. His last spirometry showed Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 of 28% and FEV1/FVC ratio of 55%. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hyponatremia, anemia, and lower extremity edema. He is intubated and on ventilatory support, and his PEEP has been increased to 10 cmH2O. He has a rash with ecchymosis around the lower abdomen. His labs show hyponatremia, elevated WBC count, and decreased hemoglobin levels. 

The assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. He has a history of COPD exacerbation and was treated with antibiotics for pseudomonas/MRSA+ sputum. He also has evidence of right lower lobe infiltrate on the CT scan. Follow-up sputum sample and sensitivities are pending, and he will continue on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

   morning.  Pt presented to the ED with complaints of dyspnea, upon
   assessment required intubation. Pt has a history of dyspnea that
   improves only with an increase in his steroid doses. His last
   spirometry in [**2114-12-26**] showed Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 28%; FEV1/FVC
   55%.  He did not improve with diuresis, nitro page or nitro gtt, so
   this does not likely represent a CHF exacerbation. Also BNP was low at
   364. Had recent admission for COPD exacerbation and was treated with 10
   days of ceftaz and 5 days of Bactrim for pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum.
   Patient did not appear to have much of a cough or sputum production
   prior to intubation.  However, he does have evidence of RLL infiltrate
   on CT scan.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with severe COPD and a recent admission for COPD exacerbation. He was admitted intubated after experiencing increased work of breathing and hyponatremia. The patient has been successfully extubated, but continues to require respiratory support with BIPAP prn. He is hypertensive and has a history of dyspnea that improves with increased steroid doses. His last spirometry showed Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 of 28% and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 55%. He also has evidence of right lower lobe infiltrate on CT scan and has grown out 1+ gram negative rods in sputum culture, sparse growth of aspergillus, and recent pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum cultures. His sodium levels have resolved with fluid restriction, and he is being treated for hypertension, hyponatremia, anemia, and lower extremity edema. The patient's condition remains stable, and he is being closely monitored in the ICU. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe COPD and was previously intubated due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if his lung function deteriorates further.
2. Infection: The patient has evidence of right lower lobe infiltrate on CT scan and positive sputum cultures for gram-negative rods and aspergillus."

   55%.  He did not improve with diuresis, nitro page or nitro gtt, so
   this does not likely represent a CHF exacerbation. Also BNP was low at
   364. Had recent admission for COPD exacerbation and was treated with 10
   days of ceftaz and 5 days of Bactrim for pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum.
   Patient did not appear to have much of a cough or sputum production
   prior to intubation.  However, he does have evidence of RLL infiltrate

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old male with severe COPD and recent admission for COPD exacerbation. He was admitted intubated after experiencing increased work of breathing (WOB) and hyponatremia.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, resolving; electrolyte and fluid disorder; hypertension; hyponatremia; anemia; and lower extremity edema. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was previously in respiratory failure and required intubation. Although he has been successfully extubated, there is a risk of recurrence if his COPD worsens or if he develops any new respiratory issues.

2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient initially presented with hyponatremia, which has since resolved. However, there is still a risk of electrolyte imbalances, particularly given his ongoing fluid management.

3. Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive overnight and is being started on amlodipine. Proper management of hypertension is essential to prevent complications such as stroke or cardiac events.

4. Hyponatremia: Although the patient's sodium levels have normalized, close monitoring is necessary to prevent the recurrence of hyponatremia, which can lead to neurological complications.

5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but it is important to continue monitoring his hemoglobin levels and addressing the underlying"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 5028**] has done well off the ventilator with increasing secretion
   output but elevated SBP too. His Na has corrected well thus far with
   fluid restriction. Sputum cultures showing aspergillus and GNR.
   Exam notable for Tm 96.3 BP 180/70 HR of 93  RR  of 12 with sat 96% on
   3lpm . He has diffuse expiratory wheezing but no rales. There is no
   edema either. He remains mildly anxious. Labs notable for WBC 12.5 K,
   HCT of 29.5, K+ of 3.8, Cr of 0.6. CXR with interval improvement in RLL
   ASD.
   Agree with plan to transition to PO steroids and continue IV
   antibiotics. We will hold off on starting Rx for aspergillus in airway
   at this time as suspicion for fungal PNA ( as opposed to GNR PNA) is
   lower. If he deos not improve with ongoing treatment, then PO
   voriconazole/ posiconazole would help. He will need help with nebs, IS
   and mucinex once he leaves the ICU. Low dose Lasix to be restarted
   today in addition to lopressor for BP and HR control. Xanax may be used
   carefully for anxiety. He is happy that short term intubation was done
   and he wishes this in the future too if there is a respiratory setback
   but not on a prolonged basis.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is stable to leave ICU

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with severe COPD and recent admission for COPD exacerbation. He was admitted intubated after experiencing increased work of breathing and hyponatremia. The patient successfully extubated yesterday morning. His sodium level has resolved and he is now hypertensive. He has evidence of right lower lobe infiltrate on CT scan and sputum culture grew out 1+ gram negative rods. He will need follow-up sensitivities and coverage with voriconazole if necessary. He is also being treated for MRSA and pseudomonas in his sputum. His anemia is stable, but he has ongoing lower extremity edema without any definitive etiology. He has a history of dyspnea that improves with increased steroid doses. His last spirometry showed Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 of 28% and FEV1/FVC ratio of 55%. He is currently on BIPAP support prn. The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder is resolving. He has been prescribed medications such as Ativan, verapamil, prednisone, and Lasix. The patient's code status is full code and he will be transferred to the floor once stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of severe COPD and recent admission for COPD exacerbation. There is evidence of right lower lobe infiltrate on CT scan, which could indicate"

 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
   66 year-old male with severe COPD and recent admission for COPD
   exacerbation who is admitted intubated after experiencing increased WOB
   and hyponatremia.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Resolved, extubated several days ago.  Pt
   presented to the ED with complaints of dyspnea, upon assessment
   required intubation. Pt has a history of dyspnea that improves only
   with an increase in his steroid doses. His last spirometry in [**2114-12-26**]
   showed Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 28%; FEV1/FVC 55%.  He did not
   improve with diuresis, nitro page or nitro gtt, so this does not likely
   represent a CHF exacerbation. Also BNP was low at 364. Had recent
   admission for COPD exacerbation and was treated with 10 days of ceftaz
   and 5 days of Bactrim for pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum.  Patient did not
   appear to have much of a cough or sputum production prior to
   intubation.  However, he does have evidence of RLL infiltrate on CT
   scan.
   - F/u pending sputum sample with pseudomonas, no sensitivies though
   prior had been pansens
   -
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for now given recent pseudomonas and MRSA +
   sputum cultures pending sensitivies
 if pan sesn, can give levoflox or
   moxiflox
   - continued prednisone taper
   - continue Ativan prn for anxiety prn BIPAP support prn
   - standing mucolytic
   - Speech and swallow consult given recent intubation though taking po
   per nursing without difficulty
   - will need f/u CT in 6 weeks to ensure PNA resolution
   - out patient pulmonologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 391**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 612**]) aware
    # Hypertension:  Still hypertensive to 160
s.  Had restarted
   amlodipine yesterday and BB.
   - increase home verapamil to 360mg qd
   - will d/c low dose beta blocker as [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to give 2 nodal blockers
   - increase amlodipine to 10mg qd
   # Hyponatremia:  132 this morning after restarting low dose po lasix.
   - Continue to trend Na
   - continue fluid restriction to 2L
   - will d/c lasix as appears to be treating [**Location (un) **] but not respiratory
   symptoms
   # Leukocytosis:  Likely [**3-4**] steroids, no clinical signs of new
   infection
   - trend daily
   # Anemia: Stable this morning at 28.  On admission, patient
s Hct
   decreased from 31.1 to 27.7.  No clinical evidence of bleeding.  Hct

   - Guaiac all stools.
   - continue to follow daily Hct.
   # Lower extremity edema: Per the family, this has been an ongoing
   problem, never any definitive etiology.  He has diastolic heart
   failure, but no pnd/orthopnea or other symptoms suggestive of acute
   CHF.  Also, BNP was less than 400.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with severe COPD and recent admission for COPD exacerbation. The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea and required intubation. The patient's last spirometry showed Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 of 28% and FEV1/FVC ratio of 55%. The patient did not improve with diuretics, nitroprusside, or nitroglycerin, so it is unlikely that this represents a CHF exacerbation. The patient also had a recent admission for COPD exacerbation and was treated with 10 days of ceftazidime and 5 days of Bactrim for pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum. The patient did not appear to have much of a cough or sputum production prior to intubation, but he does have evidence of right lower lobe infiltrate on CT scan.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
- Respiratory failure: Resolved, extubated several days ago.
- Electrolyte & fluid disorder, other: The patient has hyponatremia with a sodium level of 132 mg/dL. Fluid restriction to 2L and discontinuation of low-dose lasix are recommended. Trending Na and continuing fluid restriction are also advised.
- Leukocytosis: Likely due to steroids, no clinical signs of new infection. Trend daily"

   364. Had recent admission for COPD exacerbation and was treated with 10
   days of ceftaz and 5 days of Bactrim for pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum.
   Patient did not appear to have much of a cough or sputum production
   prior to intubation.  However, he does have evidence of RLL infiltrate
   on CT scan.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with severe COPD and a recent admission for a COPD exacerbation. He was admitted intubated after experiencing increased work of breathing (WOB) and hyponatremia.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe COPD, which puts him at risk for respiratory failure. He was previously intubated due to increased WOB, indicating a potential respiratory failure event.

2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has hyponatremia, which has resolved but requires close monitoring. Additionally, there is a mention of a fluid disorder, possibly involving SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion).

3. Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive overnight and has not been on his home medication for it. This indicates a need for blood pressure management.

4. Anemia: The patient's Hct decreased from 31.1 to 27.7 on admission, indicating possible anemia. It is important to monitor and investigate the cause of this change.

5. Lower Extremity Edema: The patient has a history of lower extremity edema with no definitive etiology. It could be related to diastolic heart failure or other underlying conditions.

6. Infection: The patient had a recent admission for a COPD exacerbation and was treated with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with severe COPD and recent admission for COPD exacerbation. He is admitted intubated after experiencing increased work of breathing (WOB) and hyponatremia. The patient has a history of hypertension, angioedema, and allergies to Lisinopril and Mavik. He has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium, colace, prevacid, fe supp, wellbutrin, flovent, folate, insulin, verapamil, amlodipine, lasix, prednisone, atrovent, and lopressor.

24-hour events include hypertension yesterday with a blood pressure of 200s, for which the patient resumed his home medications. The patient has allergies to tetanus diphtheria, lisinopril, and trandolapril, and the last dose of antibiotics was piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) at 01:23 AM and vancomycin at 08:46 AM.

Infusions include heparin sodium (prophylaxis) started at 12:02 AM. Other ICU medications are also being administered. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for increased WOB and hyponatremia.

Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygen delivery device. The patient's blood gases indicate an ABG of ///34. Physical examination findings include extremities with +3+ edema, and the peripheral vascular examination was not assessed. Neurologic examination was also not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelets (Plt). Kidney function tests reveal increased creatinine (Cr) levels. Glucose levels have been fluctuating, and other lab results including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, differential leukocyte count, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range. Imaging and microbiology results indicate the presence of Pseudomonas and MRSA colonization.

Assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to severe COPD, possibly exacerbated by pneumonia or aspiration. Antibiotics vancomycin and Zosyn have been initiated, pending culture sensitivity profile. Prednisone taper has been prescribed, and a follow-up CT scan in 6 weeks is recommended to ensure pneumonia resolution. Contact with an outpatient pulmonologist has been made.

Other medical issues include hypertension, which requires optimization of verapamil and amlodipine, and hypokalemia, which has resolved. Anemia is stable, and the patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), further electrolyte imbalances, and possible progression of kidney dysfunction."
