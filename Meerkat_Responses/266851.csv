   Patient is critically ill in light of acute alcohol withdrawal and
   abnormal vital signs
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with complaints of neck pain following a fall two days ago. He had a loss of consciousness (LOC) during the fall and was found to have an odontoid and C4 fracture on a CT scan. The patient was transferred to another hospital for spine evaluation, but due to his increasing agitation and restlessness, which were likely caused by alcohol withdrawal, he was given Valium. The patient also has a history of EtOH and tobacco abuse, as well as neck arthritis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient's agitation and restlessness are signs of alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to severe complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, and even death if not properly managed.
2. Infection: Due to the patient's immobility and potential for prolonged bed rest, he is at an increased risk of developing infections, particularly in the urinary tract.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the use of IV lines increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to serious complications like pulmonary embolism if they dislodge.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged pressure on bony prominences can cause tissue damage and lead to pressure ulcers, which can become infected and complicated.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's neck fracture and collar restricts neck movement, potentially affecting"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with complaints of neck pain after falling twice in the past two days. A CT scan revealed fractures in the odontoid and C4 vertebrae. He was transferred to another hospital for spine evaluation and later returned to the ICU due to increasing agitation and restlessness, which was attributed to alcohol withdrawal. The patient has a history of alcohol and tobacco abuse and also has neck arthritis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient's increasing agitation and restlessness suggest alcohol withdrawal. If left untreated, it can progress to more severe symptoms such as seizures, delirium tremens, and potentially life-threatening complications.

2. C-spine Fracture: The patient has sustained fractures in the odontoid and C4 vertebrae. This places him at risk for further spinal cord injury or compression if not properly managed. Surgical intervention may be necessary, but the patient's critical condition needs to be stabilized first.

3. Hypertension and Tachycardia: The patient's vital signs indicate hypertension and tachycardia. These symptoms, combined with his agitation and disorientation, could indicate a physiological response to alcohol withdrawal or potential complications related to the neck fractures. Monitoring and management of blood pressure and heart rate are crucial to prevent cardiovascular complications.

4. Respiratory Issues: Although the patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, his history of cough and"

   OSH CT head (final): No acute intracranial pathological process.
   OSH CT c-spine (final):
   1. Transverse, type 2 odontoid fracture, with posterior displacement of
   the C1/odontoid complex and the body of C2 at approximately 7 mm. While
   the fracture line appears somewhat corticated, making this of uncertain
   chronicity in the lack of prior comparisons, prevertebral soft tissue
   swelling suggests an element of acute injury.
   2. Obliquely oriented fracture through the body of C4, with extension
   into the left lamina. There is also fracture of anterior bridging
   osteophytic complex at C3-C4 level. There is exaggerated lordotic
   curvature and distraction of fracture line, and some retropulsion of
   the superior fracture fragment into the canal. There is again
   prevertebral soft tissue swelling at this level.
   3. Diffuse degenerative change, with profuse anterior bridging
   osteophytes and disc osteophyte complexes causing mild-to-moderate
   canal stenosis. This does predispose patient to cord injury, and MRI of
   the cervical spine is recommended to exclude ligamentous involvement
   and cord contusion.
   Addendum: Upon re-examination of the axial sections, the epidural
   hemorrhage may be longitudinally more extensive than localized at C3/4,
   and likely involves more cephalad segments. However, it is still likely
   a relatively thin rind in shape. MR scanning would be helpful in more
   detailed imaging of the cord and dural margins.
   CT T-Spine: 1. No fracture or malalignment. 2. Moderate-to-severe
   degenerative change, characterized by loss of disc height, disc
   calcification, and perfuse bridging marginal osteophyte formation.
   There is no significant canal stenosis. 3. Right lung base atelectasis
   with proximal mucus plugging. Given clinical scenario, aspiration
   should be considered.
   CT L-Spine: 1. No evidence for fracture or malalignment of lumbar
   spine. 2. Degenerative change with diffuse anterior bridging
   osteophytes spanning from L1 through L4. There are multiple
   discontinuities and disc osteophyte complexes, but these appear well
   corticated, and are likely chronic. 3. Diverticulosis without
   diverticulitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo man with known h/o EtOH abuse p/w to OSH for neck pain s/p falls
   and transferred here for management of cervical spine fractures, now in
   EtOH withdrawal and intubated overnight for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: No known underlying pulmonary disease although
   COPD possible in setting of long smoking history; reportedly with
   wheezing on exam in ED. Initial desat episodes likely with component
   from OSA with acute respiratory decompension likely due to aspiration
   of secretions in setting of EtOH intoxication with declining ability to
   protect airway exacerbated by benzos for EtOH withdrawal. S/p emergent
   Intubation. CXR appears to have worsened bibasilar infiltrates. A-a
   gradient likely reflective of secretions/mucous plugging.
   - Maintain sedation with versed/fentanyl for now
   - Wean vent as tolerated post-op
   - Abx coverage for aspiration PNA if pt spikes fever
   - NPO with aspiration precautions
   - Albuterol and ipratropium MDI prn
   - Outpt PFTs and sleep apnea evaluation
   # C-spine fractures: CT c-spine from OSH with acute C4 and ?acute on
   chronic odontoid fracture in setting of recent falls. No T/L-spine
   fracture on CT imaging here. Neuro exam nonfocal; currently unable to
   assess s/p paralytic but plan for OR this AM. Pt with moderate
   functional capacity and at low cardiac risk for intermediate risk
   procedure.
   - OR today: NPO, type and crossed x 2 units pRBC, holding heparin
   - [**Location (un) 1083**] J-collar in place
   - Bedrest with log roll precautions; HOB no higher than 45 degrees
   - F/u Ortho-spine recs
   # EtOH withdrawal: Pt with h/o EtOH abuse. Required escalating doses of
   valium overnight eventually limited by respiratory status. Now
   intubated and sedated on versed gtt.
   - MVI, thiamine, folate
   - Monitor electrolytes; replete K, Mg, Phos, Ca prn
   - Keep NPO with aspiration precautions
   - Social Work consult ordered

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the hospital with neck pain after falling. He was transferred to the ICU for management of cervical spine fractures and is currently intubated overnight for respiratory failure. The patient is also experiencing ethanol withdrawal and has shown episodes of desaturation likely due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and aspiration of secretions. He has a history of smoking and may have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient has multiple comorbidities including a transaminitis, which is likely hepatic inflammation in the setting of alcohol abuse. He also has degenerative changes in the cervical spine with fractures at C3-C4 and an odontoid fracture. There are no fractures in the thoracic or lumbar spine. The patient is at risk for cord injury due to the degenerative changes and an epidural hematoma.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors including OSA, acute respiratory decompensation from aspiration of secretions in the setting of ethanol intoxication, and benzos for ethanol withdrawal. The patient's condition has worsened, with worsening bibasilar infiltrates on chest X-ray and an increased A-a gradient likely reflective of secretions/mucus plugging.

The plan for the patient includes maintaining sedation with versed/fentanyl, weaning off the ventilator as tolerated post-operation, providing antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia if the patient spikes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of EtOH abuse who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. He has been intubated and is currently sedated with versed and fentanyl. The patient also has a cervical spine fracture and is at risk for further complications. He has been placed on bedrest with log roll precautions and is awaiting surgery when medically cleared. The patient's falls have been investigated, and there is a possibility of a seizure disorder, although it is more likely that he was intoxicated at the time of the falls. The patient's cardiac enzymes are unremarkable for acute coronary syndrome, but he does have a history of tobacco use and may have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been prescribed albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed, and efforts are being made to wean him off supplemental oxygen. The patient's neck pain is managed with fentanyl and he is scheduled to meet with his primary care physician (PCP) for further pain control."

   OSH CT head (final): No acute intracranial pathological process.
   OSH CT c-spine (final):
   1. Transverse, type 2 odontoid fracture, with posterior displacement of
   the C1/odontoid complex and the body of C2 at approximately 7 mm. While
   the fracture line appears somewhat corticated, making this of uncertain
   chronicity in the lack of prior comparisons, prevertebral soft tissue
   swelling suggests an element of acute injury.
   2. Obliquely oriented fracture through the body of C4, with extension
   into the left lamina. There is also fracture of anterior bridging
   osteophytic complex at C3-C4 level. There is exaggerated lordotic
   curvature and distraction of fracture line, and some retropulsion of
   the superior fracture fragment into the canal. There is again
   prevertebral soft tissue swelling at this level.
   3. Diffuse degenerative change, with profuse anterior bridging
   osteophytes and disc osteophyte complexes causing mild-to-moderate
   canal stenosis. This does predispose patient to cord injury, and MRI of
   the cervical spine is recommended to exclude ligamentous involvement
   and cord contusion.
   Addendum: Upon re-examination of the axial sections, the epidural
   hemorrhage may be longitudinally more extensive than localized at C3/4,
   and likely involves more cephalad segments. However, it is still likely
   a relatively thin rind in shape. MR scanning would be helpful in more
   detailed imaging of the cord and dural margins.
   CT T-Spine: 1. No fracture or malalignment. 2. Moderate-to-severe
   degenerative change, characterized by loss of disc height, disc
   calcification, and perfuse bridging marginal osteophyte formation.
   There is no significant canal stenosis. 3. Right lung base atelectasis
   with proximal mucus plugging. Given clinical scenario, aspiration
   should be considered.
   CT L-Spine: 1. No evidence for fracture or malalignment of lumbar
   spine. 2. Degenerative change with diffuse anterior bridging
   osteophytes spanning from L1 through L4. There are multiple
   discontinuities and disc osteophyte complexes, but these appear well
   corticated, and are likely chronic. 3. Diverticulosis without
   diverticulitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo man with known h/o EtOH abuse p/w to OSH for neck pain s/p falls
   and transferred here for management of cervical spine fractures, now in
   EtOH withdrawal and intubated overnight for respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely in setting aspiration and declining to
   protect airway exacerbated by benzos for EtOH withdrawal. Intubated
   emergently. CXR appears to have worsened bibasilar infiltrates. A-a
   gradient likely reflective of secretions/mucous plugging.
   - Maintain sedation with versed/fentanyl for now
   - Abx coverage for aspiration pna if pt spikes fever
   - Aspiration precautions
   # C-spine fractures: CT c-spine from OSH with acute appearing C4
   fracture with type 2 transverse odontoid fracture of uncertain
   chronicity in setting of recent falls. Pt denies weakness or sensory
   loss; neuro exam nonfocal.
   - Appreciate Ortho-spine input
   - CT T/L spine
   - [**Location (un) 1083**] J-collar in place
   - Bedrest with log roll precautions
   - Plan for OR today
   - Keep NPO; coags checked, active T&S
   # S/p multiple falls: 2 falls in past 2 days with reported LOC after.
   No h/o seizure disorder although possible in the setting of EtOH
   withdrawal. More likely intoxicated at the time of fall however as
   known to be drinking Thursday night. No h/o other drug use. No h/o CVA.
   OSH CT head with no evidence of intracranial process. No h/o CAD or
   arrhythmia. First set of cardiac enzymes unremarkable for ACS. EKG
   notable only for PVCs and LAFB.
   - Monitor neuro exam
   - CIWA scale as above
   - F/u serum and urine tox
   - F/u CT head final read
   - Monitor on tele, EKG in AM
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Replete lytes prn
   # EtOH withdrawal: Pt with h/o EtOH abuse. Required escalating doses of
   valium overnight eventually limited by respiratory status. Now
   intubated and on versed gtt
   - Complete banana bag, then daily MVI, thiamine, folate
   - Monitor electrolytes; replete K, Mg, Phos, Ca prn
   - Keep NPO
   - Social Work consult
   # H/o tobacco use: Wheezes on exam at admission, now resolved. [**Month (only) 51**] have
   COPD given extensive h/o smoking.
   - Declined nicotine patch
   - Albuterol and ipratropium nebs prn
   - Wean off O2 as tolerated
   .
   # Neck arthritis:
   - On fentanyl gtt
   - Obtain records from PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: pain control
   # Transminitis: Downtrending. Likely hepatic inflammation in setting of
   EtOH abuse.

   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8573**])
   Code status: Full code (discussed with HCP)
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the hospital for neck pain after falling and was subsequently transferred to the ICU for management of cervical spine fractures. He is now intubated overnight for respiratory failure and has shown signs of ethanol withdrawal.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the note include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, leading to intubation. The presence of bibasilar infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggests aspiration pneumonia, which could be exacerbated by benzodiazepines given for ethanol withdrawal.

2. Cervical spine fractures: The patient has acute appearing C4 fracture with a type 2 transverse odontoid fracture. There is also a concern for chronicity due to recent falls. Neurological exam is nonfocal, but further evaluation is needed to assess the extent of the injury and potential neurological involvement.

3. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is showing signs of withdrawal, requiring escalating doses of Valium overnight. Now intubated, he is on Versed gtt for sedation.

4. Falls: The patient has had multiple falls in the past two days with reported loss of consciousness afterward. Although there is no history of seizure disorder, it is possible in the setting of ethanol withdrawal. Monitoring the neuro exam is crucial in this case.
