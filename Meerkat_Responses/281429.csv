","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multi-lumen insertion and invasive ventilation initiated. The patient has allergies to penicillins and an unknown allergy. Infusions of fentanyl were given on [**2187-5-16**] 02:44 AM. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 146/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows normal readings, with fluid balance indicating a total input of 64 mL and total output of 923 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -859 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube and a ventilator set at a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Laboratory results show normal levels for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and troponin-T. However, there are elevated levels of potassium, sodium, magnesium, and phosphate. The patient's medical and family history are unchanged from admission, and review of systems remains the same except for the noted events.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with bipolar disorder and a history of suicide attempt presenting unresponsive with bradycardia in the setting of a drug overdose involving benzodiazepines and opiates. 

The patient's medical history includes prior suicide attempt, bipolar disorder, and allergies to penicillins. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and bradycardia, requiring intubation for airway protection. The patient was extubated on rounds and is currently alert and oriented, with stable oxygenation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.3 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 32.6%, platelet count (Plt) of 162 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.7 mg/dL, and troponin T level below 0.01 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Imaging shows right middle lobe infiltration and low lung volumes. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/110 to 115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86%.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/110 to 115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 86%. She is on invasive ventilation but was extubated this morning.

The patient's physical examination shows well-nourished appearance without acute distress. Her pupils are dilated and minimally reactive. The cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds, and the respiratory system examination shows clear breath sounds with symmetric chest expansion. The abdominal examination is unremarkable, and the neurological examination does not assess movement, tone, or myoclonic jerks.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, platelet count of 162 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, troponin-T of less than 0.01 ng/mL, glucose of 100 mg/dL, and sodium, potassium, and chloride levels within normal range. Imaging reveals right middle lobe infiltration and low lung volumes.

The assessment and plan include drug overdose, bradycardia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with unclear past medical history who presented to the ER unresponsive and was intubated for airway protection. She has a positive tox screen for benzodiazepine and opiate, which she takes at home. She also experienced bradycardia on the way to the ER, possibly due to atenolol ingestion or opiate overdose. The patient has been on invasive ventilation, but it was successfully extubated. She requires supplemental oxygen and has crackles on exam, suggesting possible aspiration or mild pulmonary edema due to hypertension. A head CT showed no acute intracranial process, but there was age-appropriate volume loss. The patient's mental status has not cleared, and a repeat head CT is recommended. She is also experiencing hypertension and may need inpatient psychiatric admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation for airway protection and is persistently requiring oxygen, indicating ongoing respiratory support needs.
2. Bradycardia: The patient experienced episodes of bradycardia, which could be related to medication ingestion or sinus dysfunction.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has crackles on exam and may have aspirated during charcoal administration, leading to aspiration pneumonia.
4. Withdrawal Symptoms: The patient may be experiencing withdrawal symptoms from narcotics or benzodiazepines.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with unclear past medical history presenting to the ER with unresponsiveness, suspected drug overdose. Toxicology screen positive for benzodiazepine and opioid, which the patient takes at home and may have mistakenly ingested. The patient also experienced bradycardia en route to the ER, and upon presentation to the ICU, had two episodes of sinus pause on telemetry. She is intubated in the ER for airway protection and may have aspirated during charcoal administration. The patient is currently awake and able to answer questions, but requires supplemental oxygen. She has crackles on exam and a mildly worsened chest X-ray, suggesting possible aspiration or mild pulmonary edema due to hypertension. Antibiotics will be withheld for now, and if she develops fever or signs/symptoms of aspiration pneumonia, coverage will be initiated. The patient will likely need inpatient psychiatric admission, and a 1:1 sitter has been assigned. Further history will be obtained once she is more stable. A repeat head CT shows no acute intracranial process but does reveal age-inappropriate volume loss. The patient's blood pressure needs to be managed carefully due to hypertension, and nodal agents should be avoided. Captopril has been started, and norvasc will be added for BP control as needed. Withdrawal symptoms should be monitored for, particularly narcotics or benzodiazepines."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of depression and a prior suicide attempt. She presents unresponsive with bradycardia in the setting of a drug overdose involving benzodiazepines and opioids. 

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and various interventions have been implemented. She has been placed on invasive ventilation, but it was later stopped. The patient's vitals have shown fluctuations, with blood pressure readings ranging from 165/99 mmHg to 186/109 mmHg. Her heart rate has been stable within the range of 73-81 bpm. Oxygen saturation levels have been maintained above 95%. 

The patient's neurological status is currently described as attentive, oriented to time, place, and person, and able to follow simple commands. She does not appear sedated or paralyzed. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. Liver enzymes are within normal limits, as well as electrolyte levels. However, the creatinine level is slightly elevated at 0.7 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels are below the detection limit, indicating no cardiac injury. 

Imaging studies reveal age-appropriate parenchymal loss on a head CT scan, with no acute process identified. A chest X-ray shows a resolving infiltrate at the right mid zone, along with increased interstitial markings. 

Assessment and plan include the following:"

   .
   # Drug overdose - unclear what medication patient took, tox screen
   positive for benzo and opiate which patient does take at home and may
   have mistaken.  Unclear what medication caused bradycardia which was
   observed enroute to the ER but as per toxicology may have been [**2-3**] to
   opiates as per toxicology.
   - Appreciate toxicology recs.
   - Short sinus pauses overnight of 2 seconds.  Now with low normal sinus
   rhythm.
   - LFT's stable, no gap, no other signs of toxicity
   - Called out to floor on telemetry yesterday but hypertensive
   overnight.
   .
   # Bradycardia
 Unclear how bradycardic patient was enroute to ER.  On
   presentation to the ICU, she had two episodes of pause on tele lasting
   2.5 sec and 5.9 sec.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been from atenolol ingestion or possibly
   opiates.  She may have sinus dysfunction at baseline and may be having
   pauses with increased vagal tone during sleep.
   - Cardiac Enzymes negative.
   - Tolerating labetalol gtt overnight for hypertensive urgency.  Would
   transition to PO labetalol today for BP control.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - intubated in the ER for airway protection,
   unclear if she aspirated during charcoal administration.  Currenly able
   to answer questions and is awake.
   - Has tolerated extubation, but is persistently requiring oxygen -
   attempt to wean today
   - CXR mildly worse, and patient with crackles on exam - likely [**2-3**]
   aspiration, or mild increase pulm edema due to hypertension.
   - Will withhold antibiotics for now and monitor clinically if spikes a
   temp or has other signs or symptoms of aspiration would cover for
   aspiration PNA.  Still no fever/leukocytosis to suggest pneumonia.
   .
   #Psych: Will likely need inpatient psych admission.  1:1 sitter for
   now.  Further history to be obtained now that she is more stable.
   - Repeat head CT w/ age inappropriate volume loss but no acute process
   - recommend further evaluation as outpatient.
   - TSH folate normal, RPR negative.
   - Contact PCP today for further history and medication
   - Appreciate Psych rec's and help with med list.
   .
   #Hypertension: Previously only on atenolol for BP control so need for
   multiple agents suggests component of withdrawal.  Would restart home
   MS contin dose given lower back pain.
   - Monitor closely for withdrawal - narcotic or benzo.
   - Started on labetalol gtt overnight - transition to oral regimen
   today.
   - HR stable in low 60's,
   - Started captopril 50 TID and amlodipine 10mg
   - Add norvasc for BP control PRN.
   .
   #Pain: lower back, chronic and [**2-3**] bed, no flank discoloration c/w RP
   bleed and Hct stable - await AM labs.
   - Restarted low dose oxycontin PRN.
   .
   #Electrolytes: Started on standing phos repletion yesterday PM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with unclear medical history who presented to the emergency room with unresponsiveness, possibly due to a drug overdose. The toxicology screen was positive for benzodiazepines and opioids, which the patient takes at home and may have mistaken for another medication. The patient experienced bradycardia during transport to the ER, but it is unclear what caused it. Upon arrival in the ICU, she had episodes of sinus pauses lasting 2.5 seconds and 5.9 seconds. The patient is tolerating labetalol gtt for hypertensive urgency and will transition to oral labetalol today for blood pressure control. She is intubated for airway protection and is awake, answering questions. The patient requires oxygen but is being weaned off the ventilator. Her chest X-ray is mildly worse, with crackles on examination, suggesting possible aspiration or mild pulmonary edema due to hypertension. Antibiotics will be withheld for now, but coverage for aspiration pneumonia may be necessary if fever or leukocytosis develops. The patient may need inpatient psychiatric admission and further history is needed. A repeat head CT showed age-inappropriate volume loss but no acute process. Further evaluation is recommended as an outpatient. The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, folate level, and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test are normal. The patient's pain management plan includes restarting home medication for lower back"

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression and Plan:  54 yof with unclear PMH presented to ER with
   unresponsiveness in setting of unclear drug overdose.
   .
   # Drug overdose - unclear what medication patient took, tox screen
   positive for benzo and opiate which patient does take at home and may
   have mistaken.  Unclear what medication caused bradycardia which was
   observed enroute to the ER but as per toxicology may have been [**2-3**] to
   opiates as per toxicology.
   - Appreciate toxicology recs.
   - Short sinus pauses overnight of 2 seconds.  Now with low normal sinus
   rhythm.
   - LFT's stable, no gap, no other signs of toxicity
   - Called out to floor on telemetry yesterday but hypertensive
   overnight.
   .
   # Bradycardia
 Unclear how bradycardic patient was enroute to ER.  On
   presentation to the ICU, she had two episodes of pause on tele lasting
   2.5 sec and 5.9 sec.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been from atenolol ingestion or possibly
   opiates.  She may have sinus dysfunction at baseline and may be having
   pauses with increased vagal tone during sleep.
   - Cardiac Enzymes negative.
   - Tolerating labetalol gtt overnight for hypertensive urgency.  Would
   transition to PO labetalol today for BP control.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - intubated in the ER for airway protection,
   unclear if she aspirated during charcoal administration.  Currenly able
   to answer questions and is awake.
   - Has tolerated extubation, but is persistently requiring oxygen -
   attempt to wean today
   - CXR mildly worse, and patient with crackles on exam - likely [**2-3**]
   aspiration, or mild increase pulm edema due to hypertension.
   - Will withhold antibiotics for now and monitor clinically if spikes a
   temp or has other signs or symptoms of aspiration would cover for
   aspiration PNA.  Still no fever/leukocytosis to suggest pneumonia.
   .
   #Psych: Will likely need inpatient psych admission.  1:1 sitter for
   now.  Further history to be obtained now that she is more stable.
   - Repeat head CT w/ age inappropriate volume loss but no acute process
   - recommend further evaluation as outpatient.
   - TSH folate normal, RPR negative.
   - Contact PCP today for further history and medication
   - Appreciate Psych rec's and help with med list.
   .
   #Hypertension: Previously only on atenolol for BP control so need for
   multiple agents suggests component of withdrawal.  Would restart home
   MS contin dose given lower back pain.
   - Monitor closely for withdrawal - narcotic or benzo.
   - Started on labetalol gtt overnight - transition to oral regimen
   today.
   - HR stable in low 60's,
   - Started captopril 50 TID and amlodipine 10mg
   - Add norvasc for BP control PRN.
   .
   #Pain: lower back, chronic and [**2-3**] bed, no flank discoloration c/w RP
   bleed and Hct stable - await AM labs.
   - Restarted low dose oxycontin PRN.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with unclear past medical history who presented to the ER with unresponsiveness, suspected drug overdose. The toxicology screen was positive for benzodiazepines and opiates, which the patient takes at home and may have mistakenly ingested. The patient experienced bradycardia en route to the ER, but it was unclear what medication caused it. In the ICU, the patient had episodes of sinus pauses lasting 2.5 seconds and 5.9 seconds. The cardiac enzymes were negative, indicating no myocardial infarction. The patient was intubated in the ER for airway protection, and there is uncertainty about possible aspiration during charcoal administration. The patient tolerated extubation but required supplemental oxygen. A chest X-ray showed mild worsening, and crackles were heard on examination, suggesting possible aspiration or increased pulmonary edema due to hypertension. Antibiotics were withheld, and the patient will be monitored for signs of aspiration pneumonia. The patient may need an inpatient psychiatric admission, and further history is needed to be obtained. The patient's hypertension is being managed with labetalol, captopril, amlodipine, and nifedipine. The patient has chronic lower back pain and was restarted on a low dose of oxycontin PRN. The patient is receiving prophylactic sc heparin and PPI (home medication). The patient's electroly"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of depression and a prior suicide attempt, presenting unresponsive with bradycardia in the setting of a drug overdose involving benzodiazepines and opiates. She remains in the ICU with difficult-to-control hypertension, despite being on atenolol. The patient has experienced nausea and emesis. She is currently receiving labetalol via gtt, hydralazine, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other medications as per review. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.7 C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/72 to 208/166 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is hemodynamically stable with a fluid balance of +425 mL. Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and troponin-T levels. However, her potassium level is slightly low at 3.6 mEq/L, and her sodium level is within normal range at 137 mEq/L. Imaging and microbiology tests have not revealed any significant findings. The patient's assessment includes hypertension, drug overdose, possible withdrawal symptoms, nausea, and potential aspiration during charcoal administration. The plan involves restarting low-dose opiates, discussing the resumption of citalopram, transitioning to oral labetalol, continuing captopril and nortriptyline until blood pressure is better controlled, and monitoring for bradycardia. The patient's disposition will be transferred to the floor once her blood pressure is stable off the drip.

Potential medical complications:
1. Rebound hypertension: The patient's difficult-to-control hypertension may worsen upon discontinuation of the current antihypertensive medications.
2. Withdrawal symptoms: The patient may experience withdrawal symptoms due to the cessation of benzodiazepines and opiates, which can lead to agitation, seizures, or other complications.
3. Aspiration: The patient's potential aspiration during charcoal administration should be closely monitored, as it can increase the risk of pneumonia.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's low potassium level needs to be corrected to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The presence of yeast in the sputum culture indicates a possible respiratory infection, which should be treated promptly to prevent worsening of the condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression and Plan:  54 yof with unclear PMH presented to ER with
   unresponsiveness in setting of unclear drug overdose.
   .
   #Hypertension: Previously only on atenolol for BP control so need for
   multiple agents suggests component of withdrawal although patient w/o
   tachycardia (on beta-blocker), diaphoresis, nausea/vomiting, tremor,
   anxiety to suggest benzo/opiate withdrawall.  Have restarted home MS
   contin dose given lower back pain at 1/2 dose.  Pain well controlled.
   Restart low dose benzo's today as trial for BP control
 hold AM
   labetalol.  If BP responds to benzodiazepines would consider further
   replacement .
   - Monitor closely for withdrawal - narcotic or benzo.
   - Tolerating PO labetalol well at this time
   - HR stable in low 60's,
   - captopril 100 TID and amlodipine 5mg
   - d/c hydral yesterday as well controlled on above. Change to long
   acting ACE when stable.
   .
   # Drug overdose - unclear what medication patient took, tox screen
   positive for benzo and opiate which patient does take at home and may
   have mistaken.  Unclear what medication caused bradycardia which was
   observed enroute to the ER but as per toxicology may have been [**2-3**] to
   opiates as per toxicology.  Does take atenolol as outpatient so likely
   component.
   - Appreciate toxicology recs.
   - Short sinus pauses earlier.
   - Now with low normal sinus rhythm.
   - LFT's stable, no gap, no other signs of toxicity
   .
   # Bradycardia
 Unclear how bradycardic patient was enroute to ER.  On
   presentation to the ICU, she had two episodes of pause on tele lasting
   2.5 sec and 5.9 sec.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been from atenolol ingestion or possibly
   opiates.  She may have sinus dysfunction at baseline and may be having
   pauses with increased vagal tone during sleep.
   - Cardiac Enzymes negative.
   - Tolerating labetalol gtt overnight for hypertensive urgency.  Now off
   gtt and on PO labetalol w/o further sinus pauses last 12-24 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory - intubated in the ER for airway protection, likely
   aspirated during charcoal administration.
   - Has tolerated extubation, and is now on room air.
   - CXR mildly worse, and patient with crackles on exam initially that
   have resolved - likely [**2-3**] aspiration, or mild increase pulm edema due
   to hypertension.
   - Will withhold antibiotics for now and monitor clinically if spikes a
   temp or has other signs or symptoms of aspiration would cover for
   aspiration PNA.  Still no fever/leukocytosis to suggest pneumonia.
   .
   #Psych: Will likely need inpatient psych admission.  1:1 sitter for
   now.  Further history to be obtained now that she is more stable.
   - Repeat head CT w/ age inappropriate volume loss but no acute process
   - recommend further evaluation as outpatient.
   - TSH folate normal, RPR negative.
   - Appreciate Psych rec's and help with med list.
   - Holding outpatient psych meds for now.
   - MRI brain today for ? atrophy given persistent cognitive impairment
   clarify with family regarding baseline mental status.
   .
   #Pain: lower back, chronic and [**2-3**] bed, no flank discoloration c/w RP
   bleed and Hct stable - await AM labs.
   - Restarted low dose MS-contin yesterday.
   .
   #Electrolytes: Follow with daily labs.
   .
   # FEN - regular heart healthy diet today.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old female with unclear medical history who presented to the emergency room with unresponsiveness. The patient was intubated for airway protection and diagnosed with a drug overdose. Toxicology screens were positive for benzodiazepines and opioids, which the patient takes at home and may have mistaken for other medications.

The patient has been restarted on her home medications, including a lower dose of narcotics due to lower back pain, and will be closely monitored for signs of withdrawal. The plan is to hold AM labetalol and restart low-dose benzodiazepines for blood pressure control.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate in the low 60s, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's neurological examination is also within normal limits.

The patient has a history of hypertension, for which she was previously on atenolol. However, the need for multiple antihypertensive agents suggests a component of withdrawal, although the patient does not exhibit signs of beta-blocker or opioid withdrawal.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are stable, and cardiac enzymes are negative. The patient's renal function is also within normal limits.

There are no new imaging or microbiology results mentioned in the progress note.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Withdrawal symptoms: The patient may experience withdrawal"

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression and Plan:  54 yof with unclear PMH presented to ER with
   unresponsiveness in setting of unclear drug overdose.
   .
   #Hypertension: Previously only on atenolol for BP control so need for
   multiple agents suggests component of withdrawal.  Restart home MS
   contin dose given lower back pain at 1/2 dose.  Pain well controlled.
   Restart low dose benzo's today.
   - Monitor closely for withdrawal - narcotic or benzo.
   - Tolerating PO labetalol well at this time
   - HR stable in low 60's,
   - Started captopril 50 TID and amlodipine 10mg
   - Add norvasc for BP control PRN.
   .
   # Drug overdose - unclear what medication patient took, tox screen
   positive for benzo and opiate which patient does take at home and may
   have mistaken.  Unclear what medication caused bradycardia which was
   observed enroute to the ER but as per toxicology may have been [**2-3**] to
   opiates as per toxicology.  Does take atenolol as outpatient so likely
   component.
   - Appreciate toxicology recs.
   - Short sinus pauses earlier.
   - Now with low normal sinus rhythm.
   - LFT's stable, no gap, no other signs of toxicity
   - Called out to floor on telemetry yesterday but hypertensive
   overnight.
   .
   # Bradycardia
 Unclear how bradycardic patient was enroute to ER.  On
   presentation to the ICU, she had two episodes of pause on tele lasting
   2.5 sec and 5.9 sec.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been from atenolol ingestion or possibly
   opiates.  She may have sinus dysfunction at baseline and may be having
   pauses with increased vagal tone during sleep.
   - Cardiac Enzymes negative.
   - Tolerating labetalol gtt overnight for hypertensive urgency.  Now off
   gtt and on PO labetalol
   .
   # Respiratory - intubated in the ER for airway protection, likely
   aspirated during charcoal administration.
   - Has tolerated extubation, and is now on room air.
   - CXR mildly worse, and patient with crackles on exam initially that
   have resolved - likely [**2-3**] aspiration, or mild increase pulm edema due
   to hypertension.
   - Will withhold antibiotics for now and monitor clinically if spikes a
   temp or has other signs or symptoms of aspiration would cover for
   aspiration PNA.  Still no fever/leukocytosis to suggest pneumonia.
   .
   #Psych: Will likely need inpatient psych admission.  1:1 sitter for
   now.  Further history to be obtained now that she is more stable.
   - Repeat head CT w/ age inappropriate volume loss but no acute process
   - recommend further evaluation as outpatient.
   - TSH folate normal, RPR negative.
   - Appreciate Psych rec's and help with med list.
   - Holding outpatient psych meds for now.
   .
   #Pain: lower back, chronic and [**2-3**] bed, no flank discoloration c/w RP
   bleed and Hct stable - await AM labs.
   - Restarted low dose oxycontin PRN.
   .
   #Electrolytes: Started on standing phos repletion yesterday PM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with unclear past medical history who presented to the ER with unresponsiveness, possibly due to a drug overdose. The patient was intubated for airway protection and is now on room air. She has been started on various medications, including labetalol, captopril, amlodipine, and norvasc for blood pressure control. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the low 60's. She has tolerated PO labetalol well and has shown improvement. However, there are concerns about potential medical complications, such as bradycardia, respiratory issues, and psychiatric problems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient experienced episodes of bradycardia during transport to the ER and had short sinus pauses earlier. This could be attributed to medication ingestion, specifically atenolol or opiates. There is a possibility of underlying sinus dysfunction that may be exacerbated by increased vagal tone during sleep.
2. Respiratory issues: The patient was intubated in the ER for airway protection and may have aspirated during charcoal administration. She tolerated extubation and is now on room air. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia, but currently, there are no signs or symptoms of infection.
3. Psychiatric problems: The patient may require inpatient psychiatric admission. Further evaluation is needed to obtain a complete history, and it"

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of depression and a prior suicide attempt 25 years ago. She presents unresponsive with bradycardia in the setting of a drug overdose (benzos and opiate + tox). She is currently in the ICU with difficult-to-control hypertension, nausea/vomiting, and possible withdrawal symptoms. 

The primary issues include hypertension, which is being managed with multiple agents despite the patient taking atenolol. The patient also has nausea/vomiting, which could be due to withdrawal or rebound hypertension. It is planned to continue oral blood pressure management with short-acting medications and low-dose MS Contin for chronic pain. Low-dose Valium will be restarted, and the patient will be reassessed for anti-hypertensive requirements in the setting of possible withdrawal. Discussion with psych regarding resuming citalopram (Celexa) will be made, as the patient takes it daily at home and may experience withdrawal symptoms.

The patient also has delirium, which was initially attributed to overdose but is improving. She is alert and oriented but still has deficits. A CT head showed age-inappropriate changes, and an MRI would be considered (not urgent). A neuro-psych evaluation will be considered once medical issues are optimized.

The patient's drug overdose and possible suicide attempt will be managed by psychiatric follow-up, and she will continue to have 1:1 sitter care. Transition to an inpatient psychiatric stay"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, and a prior suicide attempt, presenting unresponsive with bradycardia in the setting of a drug overdose (benzos and opiate + tox). She remains in the ICU with difficult-to-control hypertension. The primary issues include hypertension, nausea/vomiting possibly due to withdrawal symptoms, delirium/dementia, drug overdose, bradycardia, and possible aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is difficult to control, requiring multiple agents. There is a concern for rebound hypertension after holding beta-blockers. The plan is to continue oral BP reg with short-acting meds and lower dose MS Contin for chronic pain. Restarting low-dose Valium and reassessing anti-hypertensive requirements in the setting of possible withdrawal are also planned. Discussion with psych regarding resuming Celexa is recommended.

2. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient's nausea/vomiting is possibly due to withdrawal symptoms. Continuing low-dose opiates (MS Contin) is planned.

3. Delirium/Dementia: Initially attributed to OD, the patient's delirium/dementia continues to improve. She is alert and oriented, but unclear baseline function. A CT head showed age-inappropriate changes, and an MRI (not urgent) is considered. A neuro-psych eval is recommended once medical issues are optimized.
