","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected pulmonary embolism. He has a history of heart failure and atrial fibrillation. On admission, he presented with shortness of breath, chest pain, and hemodynamic instability. He was started on heparin therapy and given vitamin K due to a significantly elevated INR. An IVC filter was placed, and he was monitored overnight in the SICU due to ongoing hemoptysis. He continues to produce approximately one-quarter size hemoptysis hourly. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5Â°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 116/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. He is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and no signs of jugular venous distention or lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and significantly prolonged PT/PTT/INR. The patient's CK/CKMB/Troponin-T levels are within normal range, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and"

 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   69 y/o F with hx of metastatic NSCLC, known RLE DVT, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia, dCHF and pulm HTN who was admitted [**2161-3-1**]  with 2 days
   of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a RLE cellulitis.
   Now with bilateral PEs.
   .
   # PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  Recurrent thromboembolism on coumadin.  Most
   likely source of PE is known LLE DVT.  Now s/p placement of IVC
   filter.  Currently with supratherapeutic INR with heparin drip started
   overnight. She is hemodynamically stable and sating at baseline in high
   90s on 3L.
   - hold coumadin tonight with goal to be therapeutic 2.5-3
   - start IV heparin for now; consider transition to lovenox soon
   - continue nebulizers PNR
   - morphine PRN for pain control
   .
   # PNA: has PNA seen on the CT scan, does have a cough on exam today and
   has some sputum production.  Recently hospitalized, so should have HAP
   coverage, will add azithro for atypical coverage as well.
   - continue vanco, cefepime, azithro
   - legionella antigen
   - send sputum sample
   .
   # NSCLC: is metastatic, was due to start chemotherapy this Thursday but
   likely will have to defer now.  Has not had chemo or radiation in the
   past, just local resection.
   - s/p resection, but now with recurrence
   - no chemo currently
   - consider heme onc consult in the AM
   - hold dexamethasone taper for now as is for pre-chemo nausea tx
   .
   # Diastolic CHF: appears euvolemic on exam; has mild peripheral edema,
   L > R, but likely from the DVT rather than fluid overload.  Is
   normotensive.
   - euvolemic on exam
   - hold lasix tonight, start as needed tomorrow
   .
   # SOB: likely from the factors above, will continue treatment for PE
   with double anticoagulation, abx for pneumonia and will consult heme
   onc for lung cancer management
   .
   # HTN: stable, normotensive
   - hold HTN meds tonight in light of new diagnosis
   - meds being held are nifedipine, metoprolol, lisionpril, lasix
   (restart PRN for hypertension)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), known right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dilated cardiomyopathy. She was admitted with pleuritic chest pain and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and she has been started on a heparin drip. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed. The patient is currently stable, with a high oxygen saturation level in the high 90s on 3 liters of oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent thromboembolism: Given the patient's history of DVT and the presence of bilateral PE, there is a risk of recurrent thromboembolic events.
2. Pulmonary infarction: The presence of patchy opacity in the left upper lobe and left lung base on the CT scan may indicate developing pulmonary infarcts due to the embolic events.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has symptoms of cough and sputum production, which may indicate pneumonia. The recent hospitalization also increases the risk of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP).
4. Cancer progression: The patient has metastatic NSCLC, and the current presentation may be related to cancer progression or metastasis.
5. Diastolic congestive heart failure (CH"

   filter.  Currently with supratherapeutic INR with heparin drip
   re-started overnight. She is hemodynamically stable and sating at
   baseline in high 90s on 3L.
   - discontinue coumadin as this likely represents a failure of coumadin
   - hold IV heparin for now as supratherapeutic
 will restart heparin at
   low dose when ptt < 75; consider transition to lovenox soon (likely
   100mg SC BID)
 may need to follow factor X levels initially over
   concern for sensitivity to anticoagulants
   - continue nebulizers PNR

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), known right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted with two days of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and right lower extremity cellulitis. She now presents with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). 

Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has developed recurrent thromboembolism on coumadin. The most likely source of PE is her known left lower extremity DVT. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed. She is currently hemodynamically stable and saturating at baseline in the high 90s on 3 liters of oxygen.
- Discontinue coumadin as it likely represents a failure of coumadin.
- Hold IV heparin for now as it is supratherapeutic.
- Restart heparin at low dose when prothrombin time (PTT) < 75. Consider transition to low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) soon.
- May need to follow factor X levels initially due to concern for sensitivity to anticoagulants.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has pneumonia seen on the CT scan, along with cough on examination today and some sputum production. She was"

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), known right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted with two days of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and right lower extremity cellulitis. Now, she has bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs). The patient is currently receiving IV heparin and an IVC filter has been placed. She is hemodynamically stable, maintaining baseline oxygen saturation in the high 90s on 2 liters of oxygen. The INR was supratherapeutic yesterday and is now slightly sub-therapeutic. The patient's white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count are within normal ranges. She has an elevated troponin T level of 124, indicating possible cardiac involvement. The patient has a non-pulsatile, firm subcutaneous mass of 2-3 cm diameter located to the right of the umbilicus, which has been present for one month. She is experiencing dark urine with possible clots, likely due to supratherapeutic INR and PTT. The patient's pain is controlled with morphine PRN. She is currently not febrile and does not have any signs of infection. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and her lung cancer treatment may be delayed due to her current condition."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), known right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted with pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and right lower extremity cellulitis. Now she presents with bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and supratherapeutic INR due to heparin therapy. The patient is hemodynamically stable and is receiving high-flow oxygen via nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent thromboembolism: The patient has a known history of DVT and is currently experiencing bilateral PEs, indicating a failure of coumadin therapy. There is a risk of further thromboembolic events if anticoagulation therapy is not appropriately managed.

2. Infection: The patient has pneumonia seen on the CT scan, cough, and sputum production. She has recently been hospitalized, so she should have hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) coverage. The current antibiotic regimen includes azithromycin, but it may need to be adjusted based on the sensitivity results of the sputum culture.

3. NSCLC: The patient has metastatic NSCLC and was due to start chemotherapy this week. However, due to her current clinical condition,"
