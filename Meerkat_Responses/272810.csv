   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT / PLAN:
   71yo male with history of metastatic pancreatic cancer was admitted
   with dyspnea, new ascites, and profound hyponatremia.
   # Hyponatremia: Likely etiology of altered mental status with
   improvement in Na with initial aggressive repletion. Overall fluid
   overloaded on exam although may have some intravascular depletion given
   concentrated urine. [**Month (only) 51**] have SIADH [**12-29**] intravascular volume depletion
   or secondary to a pulmonary process.
   - Have corrected Na by 10mEq over 24 hours. Will now continue 3% saline
   but decrease repletion to 0.5 mEq/hour
   - F/u urine osms
   # Bandemia: Likely given infiltrate on CXR and productive cough, and
   absence of other localizing sx or findings, pneumonia most likely.
   Small pleural effusions seen on CT chest may be parapneumonic.
   - Cont vanc/zosyn for presumed HAP
   - Send sputum cx; f/u pending blood and urine cx
   - F/u final CXR read
   # Dyspnea:  Likely multifactorial etiology; differential diagnosis
   includes pneumonia, aspiration, hypoventilation related to increased
   ascites, and effusion (?d/t PNA, malignancy)
   - Treat HAP as above
   - Consider IR-guided paracentesis and/or thoracentesis if dyspnea
   persists
   # Guaiac positive stools: Patient was found to have guiac positive
   stools, likely related to his history of GI cancer and it is unclear if
   he has any GI tract involvement of his cancer. In light of guiac
   positive stools, will hold off on any anticoagulation at this time.
   # Splenic Vein Thrombosis
   Patient has newly diagnosed splenic vein thrombosis. Unclear if this
   represents a spontaneous thrombosis or is related to tumor invasion.
   Patient is certainly a poor candidate for anticoagulation given his
   poor PO intake, multiple comorbidities, and reported allergy to
   coumadin.
   - continue to monitor
   # Fluid overload: [**Month (only) 51**] be [**12-29**] increased metastatic disease, low albumin.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have some diastolic dysfunction not assessed on prior echo. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also have third-spacing [**12-29**] hyponatremia. Nephrotic syndrome unlikely
   given U/A. ? of new ascites which is likely related to his increased
   metastatic disease.
   - Could consider IR guided paracentesis pending improvement in sodium
   - Nutrition consult for low albumin
   # Metastatic pancreatic Cancer: Evidence of progression of CT
   abdomen/pelvis. He has been offered palliative chemotherapy and
   radiation treatment, which he has refused. He has also had palliative
   care evaluation which has not been pursued.
   -Will notify primary oncologist of admission.
   -Palliative care consulted ; pt
s family would like full code for now
   per recent discussions per report with pt
   -Consider CT scan to evaluate progression of disease

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT / PLAN:
   71yo male with history of metastatic pancreatic cancer was admitted
   with dyspnea, new ascites, and profound hyponatremia to 103.
   .
   1. Dyspnea
   Etiology of his dyspnea is likely multifactorial. Differential
   diagnosis includes pneumonia, aspiration, hypoventilation related to
   increased ascites, and effusion. Regarding pneumonia, CXR infiltrate
   and leukocytosis are suggestive. Regarding hypoventilation, patient may
   have increased sensation of dyspnea related to his ascites. Regarding
   effusion, patient has evidence of effusion on CXR. Etiology of his
   effusion could be secondary to pneumonia or malignancy.
   - treat for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn
   - consider IR-guided paracentesis for evaluation of paracentesis
   - consider IR guided thoracentesis for evaluation of his pleural
   effusion if his symptoms do not improve with antibiotics
   .
   2. Hyponatremia
   Patient has profound hyponatremia. Patient appears total body
   overloaded on exam, although he is likely intravascularly depleted.
   This appears likely given his concentrated urine, although it is
   somewhat surprising that his creatinine is normal. His hyponatremia is
   likely related to an increased ADH related to intravascular volume
   depletion. An additional possibility includes SIADH secondary to a
   pulmonary process. Given his altered mental status and sodium values,
   he likely has symptomatic hyponatremia. Will likely need aggressive
   repletion of sodium with increase in sodium concentration of
   1-2mEq/hour for the first 3-4 hours and then can slow down to
   .5-1mEq/hour after that.
   - start hypertonic saline at 150mL/hour x 3 hours and check sodium and
   make appropriate adjustments after that
   - add on urine and serum osm
   .
   3. Leukocytosis
   Etiology of his leukocytosis is unclear. Differential diagnosis
   includes most likely infection, with pneumonia being his most likely
   source.
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - send urine cultures
   - follow-up final read of CXR
   - send sputum gram stain and culture
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for treatment of presumed hospital
   acquired pneumonia
   .
   4. Guaiac positive stools
   Patient was found to have guiac positive stools, likely related to his
   history of GI cancer and it is unclear if he has any GI tract
   involvement of his cancer. In light of guiac positive stools, will hold
   off on any anticoagulation at this time.
   .
   5. Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
   Patient has known metastatic pancreatic cancer. He has been offered
   palliative chemotherapy and radiation treatment, which he has refused.
   He has also had palliative care evaluation which has not been pursued.
   Patient's CT scan demonstrates progression of his disease with new
   ascites, likely related to his increased burden of hepatic  mets.
   - will let patient's primary oncologist know that patient is
   hospitalized
   - palliative care consult
   6. Ascites
   Patient has developed new ascites which is likely related  to his
   increased metastatic disease. IR guided paracentesis may improve his
   subjective symptoms of dyspnea, although this will likely recur quickly
   given his metastatic disease.
   - consider IR guided paracentesis pending improvement in sodium
   7. Splenic Vein Thrombosis
   Patient has newly diagnosed splenic vein thrombosis. Unclear if this
   represents a spontaneous thrombosis or is related to tumor invasion.
   Patient is certainly a poor candidate for anticoagulation given his
   poor PO intake, multiple comorbidities, and reported allergy to
   coumadin.
   - appreciate GI input
   - continue to monitor

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, new ascites, and profound hyponatremia. The patient is somnolent and difficult to arouse, but in no apparent distress. Physical examination reveals clear lungs with rales at the right base and diminished breath sounds at the left base. There is also evidence of edema in the lower extremities and upper back. Neurological examination is incomplete due to the patient's obtundation.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including pneumonia, hypoventilation related to increased ascites, pleural effusion, profound hyponatremia, leukocytosis, and guaiac positive stools. The patient's dyspnea may be caused by pneumonia, hypoventilation due to ascites, or pleural effusion. The hyponatremia is likely related to increased ADH or SIADH. The leukocytosis may be due to infection, possibly from pneumonia. The guaiac positive stools suggest gastrointestinal bleeding, which is a concern given the patient's history of GI cancer.

The patient has known metastatic pancreatic cancer and has refused palliative chemotherapy and radiation treatment. He has also not pursued palliative care evaluation. The patient's CT scan shows progression of his disease with new ascites. The patient has an allergy to Coumadin and is not a"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo male with metastatic pancreatic cancer and no plans for further
   Rx for cancer primarily now with recent Rx with Levoflox for community
   acquired pneumonia.  He now is seen with evidence of worsening findings
   of infection with significant elevation in WBC count, bandemia and
   concern for recurrent infection but with significant and severe
   hyponatremia.
   1) HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)
This is in the setting of
   relative hypervolemia with weight up but Na+ decreased.  He has had
   relatively rapid response to 3% saline initially.
   -Currently urine OSMs unknown
   -No need for volume based upon exam
   -Will continue with 3% saline until we know urine OSMS and can assure
   continued improvement.
   2)Pneumonia
suggested by infiltrate, cough, sputum production and
   concern for infection.
   -Vancomycin/Zosyn to continue for likely hospital acquired PNA
   -Concern for pleural space infection is present but in fact
effusion
   appears to be a mild component of the findings based upon CT scan
   images.  At this time with effusion small volume and appearing
   loculated would have to be Ipguided thoracentesis
   -Will send sputum GX C+S
   3)Pancreatic Cancer-
   -Will continue to follow with oncology recs for supportive treatment
   available
   -CT scan with progression of disease
   -OB positive stool seen in the setting of known GI malignancy but with

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with metastatic pancreatic cancer and no plans for further treatment for the cancer. He was recently treated with Levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia. The patient is now presenting with worsening findings of infection, significant elevation in white blood cell count, and severe hyponatremia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 96/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the left lung, mild epigastric tenderness, and soft distended abdomen. Lab results show hyponatremia, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging reveals splenic vein occlusion, patent portal vein, metastatic lesions in the left adrenal gland, left pleural effusion, and consolidations in the lungs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY): The patient has severe hyponatremia, which can lead to neurological symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and even coma if not corrected properly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has signs of infection, including an elevated white blood cell count, cough, sputum production, and infiltrates on chest imaging. If left untreated,"

","The patient's condition is complicated by several factors. They have a diagnosis of hyponatremia, which is a low sodium level in the blood. This can cause various symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and muscle weakness. The patient's sodium level was initially 113, but improved to 112 and then 114. They were placed on hypertonic saline at 60ml/hr for 500ml overnight and given NS 500ml as well. 

Additionally, the patient has a history of cancer, specifically malignant neoplasms of the liver and pancreas. These cancers can contribute to the patient's overall decline in health.

The patient also has impaired skin integrity and impaired physical mobility, which may be related to their underlying medical conditions or the effects of treatment.

   Assessment and Plan
   71yo male with history of metastatic pancreatic cancer was admitted
   with dyspnea, new ascites, and profound hyponatremia.
   # Hyponatremia: Likely etiology of altered mental status with
   improvement in Na with initial aggressive repletion. Overall fluid
   overloaded on exam although may have some intravascular depletion given
   concentrated urine. [**Month (only) 51**] have SIADH [**12-29**] intravascular volume depletion
   or secondary to a pulmonary process.
   - Have corrected Na by 10mEq over 24 hours. Will now continue 3% saline
   but decrease repletion to 0.5 mEq/hour
   - F/u urine osms
   # Bandemia: Likely given infiltrate on CXR and productive cough, and
   absence of other localizing sx or findings, pneumonia most likely.
   Small pleural effusions seen on CT chest may be parapneumonic.
   - Cont vanc/zosyn for presumed HAP
   - Send sputum cx; f/u pending blood and urine cx
   - F/u final CXR read
   # Dyspnea:  Likely multifactorial etiology; differential diagnosis
   includes pneumonia, aspiration, hypoventilation related to increased
   ascites, and effusion (?d/t PNA, malignancy)
   - Treat HAP as above
   - Consider IR-guided paracentesis and/or thoracentesis if dyspnea
   persists
   # Guaiac positive stools: Patient was found to have guiac positive
   stools, likely related to his history of GI cancer and it is unclear if
   he has any GI tract involvement of his cancer. In light of guiac
   positive stools, will hold off on any anticoagulation at this time.
   # Splenic Vein Thrombosis
   Patient has newly diagnosed splenic vein thrombosis. Unclear if this
   represents a spontaneous thrombosis or is related to tumor invasion.
   Patient is certainly a poor candidate for anticoagulation given his
   poor PO intake, multiple comorbidities, and reported allergy to
   coumadin.
   - continue to monitor
   # Fluid overload: [**Month (only) 51**] be [**12-29**] increased metastatic disease, low albumin.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have some diastolic dysfunction not assessed on prior echo. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also have third-spacing [**12-29**] hyponatremia. Nephrotic syndrome unlikely
   given U/A. ? of new ascites which is likely related to his increased
   metastatic disease.
   - Could consider IR guided paracentesis pending improvement in sodium
   - Nutrition consult for low albumin
   # Metastatic pancreatic Cancer: Evidence of progression of CT
   abdomen/pelvis. He has been offered palliative chemotherapy and
   radiation treatment, which he has refused. He has also had palliative
   care evaluation which has not been pursued.
   -Will notify primary oncologist of admission.
   -Palliative care consulted ; pt
s family would like full code for now
   per recent discussions per report with pt
   -Consider CT scan to evaluate progression of disease

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer, admitted with dyspnea, new ascites, and profound hyponatremia.
- The patient's sodium levels have improved with aggressive repletion using hypertonic saline.
- The patient's blood pressure is low, and they received a 500cc normal saline bolus overnight.
- The patient's cortisol levels are normal.
- The patient's cough is improving, but they remain very lethargic with slightly improved mental status.
- The patient has allergies to Coumadin (warfarin sodium) and experiences nausea/vomiting.
- The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia.
- The patient has guaiac positive stools, likely related to their history of GI cancer.
- The patient has newly diagnosed splenic vein thrombosis, which may be related to tumor invasion or spontaneous thrombosis.
- The patient is experiencing fluid overload, possibly due to increased metastatic disease, low albumin, diastolic dysfunction, and third-spacing of hyponatremia.
- The patient's metastatic pancreatic cancer is progressing, with evidence on CT abdomen/pelvis.
- The patient has refused palliative chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient's profound hyponatremia can lead to altered mental status and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed carefully.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate intravascular depletion and could result in organ hypoperfusion if not addressed promptly.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and findings on chest X-ray suggest pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of sepsis.
4. GI Bleeding: The presence of guaiac positive stools indicates potential gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be related to the patient's history of GI cancer.
5. Splenic Vein Thrombosis: The newly diagnosed splenic vein thrombosis could lead to further complications, such as splenic infarction or abscess formation.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload increases the risk of heart failure, pulmonary edema, and kidney dysfunction.
7. Metastatic Progression: The patient's progressing metastatic pancreatic cancer can lead to further deterioration of organ function and overall prognosis."

   with hypotension, dry MM, tachycardia and with fluid bolus given and
   patient with good response in regards to Na+ and mental status.
   1)hyponatremia-Improvement in Na+ quite reasonable and will maintain

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted with altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleeding, and significant hyponatremia. The patient had evidence of functional hypovolemia with hypotension, dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, and responded well to fluid bolus administration. Sodium levels have improved from 103 to 114 in the past 24 hours and increased to 121 this morning. Cortisol levels are low at 25. Urine Osmolality is 356 this morning. The patient has allergies to Coumadin (Warfarin Sodium) and experiences nausea/vomiting. Antibiotics were administered including Piperacillin, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is currently receiving multiple medications in the ICU. There are no changes to the patient's medical, social, or family history. The patient's review of systems is unchanged except for fatigue. Vital signs show a temperature of 36.1 C (97%), heart rate of 87 bpm (78-110), blood pressure ranging from 97/57 mmHg to 80/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute (14-25), and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen. Physical examination reveals a thin appearance, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, cardiovascular abnormalities including distant S2 and diminished breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, extremities with 3+ edema, and unassessed skin. Neurological examination shows the patient oriented to place and year, with movement and tone not assessed. Lab results indicate low hemoglobin, elevated WBC count, decreased platelet count, low potassium, low sodium, low glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition is complicated by metastatic pancreatic cancer, impaired physical mobility, impaired skin integrity, and hepatic cancer. The plan includes maintaining sodium levels between 8-10 mEq/d, administering 3% normal saline bolus, providing ongoing support for severe and persistent hyponatremia, consulting nutrition and oncology, evaluating speech and swallow prior to oral intake, and making the oncology team aware of the ongoing management."

   Assessment and Plan
   71yo male with history of metastatic pancreatic cancer was admitted
   with dyspnea, new ascites, and profound hyponatremia.
   # Hyponatremia: Likely etiology of altered mental status with
   improvement in Na with initial aggressive repletion. Overall fluid
   overloaded but likely intravascular depletioned.
   - Given high urine [**Last Name (LF) 3736**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] continue repletion with 3% saline at
   50cc/h to maintain slow rate of repletion with goal of 10mEq/day
   - Serial Na and urine [**First Name3 (LF) 3736**] check as Na may rapidly rise if volume
   repleted
   - Renal consulted; will f/u recs
   # Hypotension: Likely [**12-29**] hypovolemia. Asx but baseline BP on review of
   prior records appears to be >100.
   - 500cc NS fluid boluses prn
   # Dyspnea: Pneumonia on CXR, treated as  HAP (enlarged despite recent
   levofloxacin course, legionella Ag neg) with improvement in oxygenation
   (now on RA) and leukocytosis. Also with small bilateral effusions, ddx
   parapneumonic v. malignancy. [**Month (only) 51**] also have hypoventilation related to
   increased ascites.
   - Vanco and Zosyn for 8-day course
   - Could consider IR-guided paracentesis and/or thoracentesis if dyspnea
   persists but appears to be improving
   # Bandemia: Likely [**12-29**] pneumonia. No other localizing sx.
   - Cont vanc/zosyn for presumed HAP. Sputum sample inadequate.
   - F/u pending blood, urine, resp cx
   - Awaiting stool for C. diff
   # Guaiac positive stools: Patient was found to have guiac positive
   stools, likely related to his history of GI cancer and it is unclear if
   he has any GI tract involvement of his cancer. In light of guiac
   positive stools, will hold off on any anticoagulation at this time.
   - Hct stable for now; consider outpatient evaluation pending discussion
   on goals of care
   # Splenic Vein Thrombosis
   Patient has newly diagnosed splenic vein thrombosis. Unclear if this
   represents a spontaneous thrombosis or is related to tumor invasion.
   Patient is certainly a poor candidate for anticoagulation given his
   poor PO intake, multiple comorbidities, and reported allergy to
   coumadin.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Fluid overload: [**Month (only) 51**] be [**12-29**] increased metastatic disease, low albumin.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have some diastolic dysfunction not assessed on prior echo. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also have third-spacing [**12-29**] hyponatremia. Nephrotic syndrome unlikely
   given U/A. ? of new ascites which is likely related to his increased
   metastatic disease.
   - Nutrition consult for low albumin; f/u recs
   # Metastatic pancreatic Cancer: Evidence of progression of CT
   abdomen/pelvis. He has been offered palliative chemotherapy and
   radiation treatment, which he has refused. He has also had palliative
   care evaluation which has not been pursued.
   -Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 353**] aware of admission
   -Appreciate palliative care recs; will arrange for family meeting with
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 353**], Palliative Care, interpreter
   -OB positive stool seen in the setting of known GI malignancy but with
   relatively stable Hct

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer. He was admitted with dyspnea, new ascites, and profound hyponatremia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications that require attention.

1. Hyponatremia: The patient has profound hyponatremia, which is likely causing his altered mental status. Sodium levels have improved with aggressive repletion using 3% saline. The plan is to continue slow repletion with a goal of 10mEq/day and monitor sodium and urine osmolality levels.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to hypovolemia. He will receive 500cc NS fluid boluses as needed. Baseline BP on review appears to be above 100.

3. Dyspnea: The patient has pneumonia on chest X-ray and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). His oxygenation has improved, and he is now on room air. Leukocytosis is present. Small bilateral effusions were seen, and a differential diagnosis of parapneumonic effusion versus malignancy is being considered. Thoracentesis or paracentesis may be considered if dyspnea persists.

4. Bandemia: The patient has leukocytosis, likely secondary to pneumonia. He is already on vancomycin and Zosyn for presumed HAP. Blood, urine, and respiratory cultures are"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo male with metastatic pancreatic CA and SIADH now admitted with
   significant hyponatremia in the setting of excess free water intake.
   1) HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)-
   -Free water restrict as possible
goal 1 liter
   -Follow Na+ daily
   2)Hypotension
Had a component of hypovolemia perhaps but has not had
   durable response to IVF bolus and his urine Na+ is >21.  The issue is
   he has hypotension, tachycardia, poor urine output and small AG
   acidosis.
   -Vanco/Zosyn to continue for possible sepsis
   -Will repeat Lactate
   -For today will consider patient likely euvolemic but do have concerns
   above
   -Fluid bolus for symptomatic hypotension
   3)Pancreatic Cancer-
   -Thrombosis not to be treated given risk of GI bleeding
   -Will need to consider goals of care in light of current progression of
   decline

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer. He was admitted with dyspnea, new ascites, and profound hyponatremia. The patient's current condition includes lethargy but slightly more alert, dry mucous membranes, supple neck, no jugular venous distention or lung crackles, mild pitting edema in the lower extremities, and no skin lesions. His vital signs show a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure in the 80s/50s mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and receiving several medications including piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and warfarin.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, platelet count within normal range, normal creatinine levels, low glucose levels, and elevated liver enzymes. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient likely has mild SIADH with hyponatremia exacerbated by excessive oral fluid intake at home. Sodium levels are stable between 126-128. The patient will be restricted to 1 liter of fluid intake per day and may consider lasix.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer. He was admitted with dyspnea, new ascites, and profound hyponatremia. The patient's current condition shows improvement in alertness but still appears lethargic. Physical examination reveals mild crackles at the bases of the lungs, brawny edema to the lateral abdomen, and 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels. Laboratory results indicate hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated liver enzymes, and decreased potassium and magnesium levels. The patient is currently receiving aggressive fluid restriction, antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which can be due to hypovolemia or new baseline chronic disease. Further evaluation is required, and the patient's renal function should be closely monitored.
2. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea may be caused by an infiltrate on the chest X-ray, being treated as hospital-acquired pneumonia. There is also a possibility of small bilateral effusions, potentially related to malignancy or parapneumonic effusion. Further investigation and treatment are needed.
3. Bandemia: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection, likely related to recent pneumonia. Blood cultures and"

   # Hyponatremia: Likely etiology of altered mental status. Has improved
   with hypertonic saline and restriction of free water intake. Underlying
   mild SIADH and hyponatremia was likely exacerbated by excessive free
   water intake at home given recent admission for
dehydration.

   guiac positive stools, will hold off on any anticoagulation at this
   time.
   -hematocrit stable, will continue to follow
   # Splenic Vein Thrombosis
   Patient has newly diagnosed splenic vein thrombosis. Unclear if this
   represents a spontaneous thrombosis or is related to tumor invasion.

   addressed home hospice, which patient would like to try. However, on
   speaking with family this morning, it is not clear if they understand
   what is meant by hospice (family is requesting TPN, even though patient
   is not complaining of hunger and this does not appear to be an
   intervention that would make him more comfortable); we will ask
   palliative care to speak with patient specifically regarding hospice
   before these arrangements are made.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer. He was admitted with dyspnea, new ascites, and profound hyponatremia. The likely etiology of his altered mental status is hyponatremia, which has improved with hypertonic saline and restriction of free water intake. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/44 mmHg to 97/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. He is experiencing atrial fibrillation. His physical examination reveals slight disorientation, distended but non-tender abdomen, and 2+ pitting edema to mid shins.

Laboratory results show hyponatremia (50 mg/dL), leukocytosis (22.3), elevated lactate (4.0 mmol/L), elevated LDH (765 IU/L), low albumin (2.1 g/dL), and low magnesium (1.9 mg/dL). Imaging studies show evidence of disease progression, including metastasis to the liver, left adrenal gland, and possibly the lungs.

Plan:
- Continue hypertonic saline and fluid restriction to manage hyponatremia.
- Avoid adding IV fluids due to concern of worsening hyponatremia.
- Consider lasix for fluid overload, considering renal recommendations.
- Continue c"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer. He was admitted with dyspnea, new ascites, and profound hyponatremia. His altered mental status has improved with hypertonic saline and restriction of free water intake. He has mild SIADH and hyponatremia, which was likely exacerbated by excessive free water intake at home. The patient also has hypotension, dyspnea, bandemia, guaiac positive stools, splenic vein thrombosis, and fluid overload. His condition is complicated by metastatic pancreatic cancer, which has progressed on CT abdomen/pelvis. He declined palliative chemo and/or radiation therapy. The patient's goals of care meeting addressed home hospice, which he would like to try.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia could further deteriorate due to fluid restriction or other underlying factors.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's dyspnea and infiltrate on CXR suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
4. Ascites: The patient's new ascites could lead to respiratory distress and increased risk of infection.
5. Splenic vein thrombosis: This condition may cause abdominal pain and potential complications if not"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo male with metastatic pancreatic cancer now admitted with
   significant altered mental status and hyponatremia.
   1)HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)--Combination of SIADH and
   excess free water intake leading to severe hyponatremia.  Appreciate
   renal input and support.
   -Continue with free water restriction
   -Will need continued free water restriction
   2)pancreatic cancer-Extensive spread and including GI tract and with
   some evidence of GI bleeding in addition to continued extension into
   lung, abdomen.
   -NO further corrective intervention specific to be offered

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with metastatic pancreatic cancer, currently admitted with significant altered mental status and hyponatremia. The patient's medical history includes allergies to Coumadin, nausea/vomiting, and previous antibiotic use. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 90/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has received a total of 1,292 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 712 mL of urine. The patient is not receiving respiratory support.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be thin, with distant heart sounds and diminished breath sounds. The patient's abdomen is soft, extremities are edematous, and skin assessment was not performed. Neurologic examination shows the patient responding to verbal stimuli but with movement, tone, and skin assessments not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate hyponatremia with a sodium level of 50 mg/dL, as well as elevated potassium levels at 16 mEq/L and low magnesium levels at 0.8 mg/dL. Other lab values show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. The patient's creatinine and glucose levels are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hyponatremia"
