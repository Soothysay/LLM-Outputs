   Assessment and Plan
   67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal tx on HD,
   recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF, hx PE, who presented to
   the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD, patient developed
   pulm edema leading to respiratory failure, pt intubated.
   # Type I/Type VI respiratory failure: Patient presented with
   hypotension and septic physiology. Given IVF to maintain pressures.
   Patient responded, however, became fluid overload. Unable to diurese.
   Gave morphine and SL nitro in attempt to vasodilate. Patient increased
   work of breathing with respiratory rate to 55. Respiratory failure
   likely caused by pulm edema and sepsis.
   - Intubated [**6-27**]
   - Renal [**Name (NI) 420**], will discuss HD to take fluid off
   - Fentanyl Versed sedation
   # Troponin-t: patient describes intermittent chest pain, labs show
   increased in troponin t, cardiology consulted
   - ASA
   - Metoprolol
   - Heparin
   - Atorvastatin
   # Sepsis:  Meets SIRS criteria with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea and
   line infection vs pneumonia vs c. diff as suspected source.  Was
   initially hypotensive but BP/MAPs stable now.  Initial report of
   purulent material oozing from entry site of left subclavian HD line but
   none seen on exam and only mild erythema.  Does have history of line
   sepsis however.   Pneumonia seems possible given ?hypoxia and cough
   though not clearly supported by CXR.  C. diff also possible given
   frequent BMs though no history of recent antibiotics.  Would also
   consider infected thrombus (has thrombosed fistula, SVC syndrome and
   prior PE), influenza, viral syndrome, UTI.  Was initially also c/o back
   pain prompting concern for osteo but currently denies.  Left femoral
   CVL in place.
   - Pull line if possible
   - IVF for UOP under 30, tachycardic
   - vanc, zosyn, flagyl Day 2
   - daily CXR
   - follow-up blood/sputum culture data (draw one set off HD line)
   - stool studies
   - will culture urine if possible (makes small amount of urine at
   baseline)
   - flu negative
   # ESRD, s/p failed kidney transplant:  Receives HD on MWF.  Renal aware
   of admission.
   - HD qMWF
   - continue nephrocaps, cinacalcet
   - continue low dose prednisone
   - epo with HD
   # DM: stable.
   - NPH and HISS
   # dCHF. No evidence of decompensation currently.
   - holding ACEI, BB in setting of sepsis

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of ESRD, failed renal transplant, CAD, dCHF, and PE. She presented to the ED with fevers and rigors and was admitted to the MICU for hypotension and concern for sepsis. The patient developed pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure and was intubated. She also has increased troponin-t levels, indicating possible cardiac involvement. The patient meets SIRS criteria with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and line infection vs pneumonia vs C. difficile as suspected sources. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Type I/Type VI respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by pulmonary edema and sepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria and has a suspected line infection, pneumonia, or C. difficile as potential sources.
3. Cardiac involvement: The patient has increased troponin-t levels, indicating possible cardiac involvement.
4. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and receives hemodialysis on MWF.
5. Failed renal transplant: The patient had a failed kidney transplant in the past.
6. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease.
7. dCHF: The patient has a history of decompensated congestive heart failure.
8. PE: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a failed renal transplant and is currently on hemodialysis (HD). She presented to the emergency department with fevers and rigors and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and concern for sepsis in the setting of HD. The patient developed pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure, and she was intubated.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD), dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF), history of pulmonary embolism (PE), and superior vena cava (SVC) thrombus. She also has diabetes mellitus (DM), which is currently stable, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Upon admission, the patient was found to have a new regional wall motion abnormality in the mid to distal left anterior descending (LAD) distribution, with decreased ejection fraction (EF), elevated troponin-T levels, and an increased CK-MB index. Cardiology was consulted, and the patient was started on aspirin (ASA), metoprolol, heparin, and atorvastatin. However, due to an intra-arterial (IR) procedure, the patient was taken off heparin.

The patient meets the criteria for sepsis with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and line infection versus pneumonia versus Clostrid"

   recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF, hx PE, who presented to
   the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD, patient developed
   pulm edema leading to respiratory failure, pt intubated.
   # Type I/Type VI respiratory failure: Patient presented with
   hypotension and septic physiology. Currently maintaining PA02 in mid
   70s.
   Consider d/c sedation, eval if breath spontaneously on just pressure
   support. Bolus versed as needed.
   ABG: Q6H.
   CXR: unchanged: stable retrocardiac opacity, interstitial markings.
   Volume Overload:
   48 hour line holiday eith nexy hemodialysis on Thursday. Needs IR
   guided temporary line placement.
   Labile BPs: HTN occurred with procedure (tube placement, moving).
   Currently on levophed. Hold for MAP < 58, systolic < 110. BP will
   likely increase given no dialysis till Thursday and d/c levophed.
   Demand ischemia: Elevated troponins, stable CK-MB, pattern consistent
   with demand ischemia. Continue daily EKGs, tele, ASA, metoprolol,
   atorvastatin.
   ERSD: s/p failed kidney transplant, usually gets HD: MWF will get [**Last Name (un) **]
   this week.
   Continue low dose steroids, epo with HD.
   Taking meds by NGT therefore changed nephrocaps to MTV/ folate.
   Consider lytes today, no HD.
   Hx: PE/SVC: warfarin held for IR procedure. Continue follow INR.
   DM: stable: continue GFS, NPH/HISS.

- Presented to the ED with fevers and rigors and was transferred to the MICU for hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD.
- Patient developed pulm edema leading to respiratory failure, intubated.
- 24-hour events include removal of dialysis catheter, sent tip for culture, developed fever despite therapeutic vancomycin level, pan cultured with mini BAL deferred, troponins trending upward, NG tube placement, agitation with rise of BP to 180s, HR stable in 80s normalized with versed, became hypotensive overnight with MAPs to low 60s, recovered on own, metoprolol held.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Type I/Type VI respiratory failure: The patient's presentation with hypotension and septic physiology, along with maintaining a PA02 in mid 70s, suggests the possibility of respiratory failure.
2. Volume Overload: The patient is at risk for volume overload due to the recent line sepsis and lack of dialysis until Thursday.

   the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD, patient developed
   pulm edema leading to respiratory failure, pt intubated.
   # Type I/Type VI respiratory failure: Patient presented with
   hypotension and septic physiology. Given IVF to maintain pressures.
   Patient responded, however, became fluid overload. Unable to diurese.
   Gave morphine and SL nitro in attempt to vasodilate. Patient increased
   work of breathing with respiratory rate to 55. Respiratory failure
   likely caused by pulm edema and sepsis.
   - Intubated [**6-27**]
   - Renal [**Name (NI) 420**], wishes to pull line today and HD at another time
   - Fentanyl Versed sedation
   - ABG q8h, change vent settings as needed
   - CXR
   # Demand ischemia: patient describes intermittent chest pain, labs show
   increased in troponin-t, cardiology consulted-they  rec ASA,
   metoprolol, heparin, atorvastatin. Pt initially remained on those meds
   through the night.
   - ASA
   - Metoprolol
   - d/c heparin due to IR procedure
   - Atorvastatin
   # Sepsis:  Meets SIRS criteria with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea and
   line infection vs pneumonia vs c. diff as suspected source.  Was
   initially hypotensive but BP/MAPs stable now.  Initial report of
   purulent material oozing from entry site of left subclavian HD line but
   none seen on exam and only mild erythema.  Does have history of line
   sepsis however.   Pneumonia seems possible given ?hypoxia and cough
   though not clearly supported by CXR.  C. diff also possible given
   frequent BMs though no history of recent antibiotics.  Would also
   consider infected thrombus (has thrombosed fistula, SVC syndrome and
   prior PE), influenza, viral syndrome, UTI.  Was initially also c/o back
   pain prompting concern for osteo but currently denies.  Left femoral
   CVL in place. Pt culture S. aureus from line.
   - Renal consulted
 pull line in IR
   - Temp line for HD in future
   - Levophed for hypotension
   - vanc, zosyn, Day 2
   - stool negative, d/c flagyl and azithromycin
   - CXR
   - follow up cultures
   # ESRD, s/p failed kidney transplant:  Receives HD on MWF.  Renal
   consulted.
   - IR will pull line, FFP to correct INR
   - No HD today per renal
   - Will need temp line placed for HD MWF
   - continue nephrocaps, cinacalcet
   - continue low dose prednisone
   - epo with HD
   # DM: stable.
   - NPH and HISS
   # dCHF. No evidence of decompensation currently.
   - holding ACEI, BB in setting of sepsis
   - will restart when pressures stable
   # PE, SVC thrombus:  She was found to have a PE and SVC in [**1-30**] and
   started on warfarin (held for IR procedure).
   - Heparin (currently held for IR procedure)
   - SCD

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of ESRD, who has undergone failed cadaveric renal transplantation and is currently on hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. She presented to the emergency department with fevers and rigors, leading to concerns of sepsis, especially in the setting of HD. The patient developed pulmonary edema, which resulted in respiratory failure, and she was subsequently intubated.

During her stay in the MICU, the patient's condition has been complicated by several issues. Firstly, there is evidence of demand ischemia, as indicated by increased troponin-T levels and chest pain described by the patient. Cardiology was consulted, and the patient was started on aspirin (ASA), metoprolol, heparin, and atorvastatin. However, the patient's initial response to these medications is not mentioned.

Secondly, the patient meets the criteria for sepsis, characterized by fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and a possible line infection. The initial report of purulent material oozing from the entry site of the left subclavian HD line raised concerns for line sepsis. However, no purulent material was observed during the physical examination, and only mild erythema was present. Other potential sources of infection, such as pneumonia, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), or urinary tract infection (UTI), were also considered."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who underwent a failed renal transplant. She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and concern for sepsis during hemodialysis (HD). The patient developed pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure and was intubated. She also presented with fevers and rigors, indicating a possible infection. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD), dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF), previous pulmonary embolism (PE), and line sepsis. She has chronic renal failure and is on maintenance hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia (VTach) - The patient experienced sustained monomorphic VTach, which may be due to cardiac ischemia, infection, or fluid overload. Cardiology fellow consulted, rhythm decreased with increased sedation, and a lidocaine drip was started.
2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) - The patient's presentation with unstable angina and coronary ischemia suggests ACS. She is currently on heparin, Plavix, and aspirin.
3. Sepsis - The patient likely had sepsis due to line sepsis, growing MSSA, and now on Nafcillin. WBC count is trending up.
4. Respiratory failure - The patient developed pulmonary edema and subsequently respiratory failure. She is on assisted control ventilation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a failed cadaveric renal transplant and is currently on hemodialysis (HD). She presented to the emergency department with fevers and rigors and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and concern for sepsis during HD. The patient developed pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure and was intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia, sustained: The patient experienced a sustained ventricular tachycardia, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), unstable angina, coronary ischemia: The patient's symptoms and EKG changes suggest ACS or unstable angina, indicating possible coronary artery disease and reduced blood flow to the heart.
3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient likely has sepsis due to line sepsis, as indicated by the growth of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and an elevated white blood cell count.
4. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by MSSA, which may be contributing to her septic state.
5. Chronic renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure (CRF), as evidenced by her ESRD and failed renal transplant.
6. Superior vena cava syndrome (SVC):"

   #Cardiac ischemia- patient perfusing well, has very irregular and
   multiple heart rhythms. Lidocaine was started yesterday for VTach and
   d/c yesterday. A heparin drip was also started, then held for
   increasing INR and need for a line placement. Cardiology was consulted.
   Original plan was to take to cath lab for T-wave changes, however,
   increased INR so they cancelled. CE continue to be elevated.
   - D/C heparin drip
   - Restart beta blocker when pressures can tolerate
   - Cont ASA
   - CVVH to take off fluid
   - Appreciate cards recs

   worsening clinical picture/infection
   - CT torso with contrast
   - consider adding Flagyl source detected. On meropenem currently.
   #Coagulation: The patient had an increase in INR throughout the day
   yesterday. DIC negative. Heme-onc consulted and likely [**12-26**] VitK
   deficiency. Gave IV vitK. Pt also received FFP and CVVH which appear to
   have brought INR into normal range 1.2 this am.
   - Continue to monitor - [**Hospital1 **] coags
   # Respiratory failure: fluid overload vs septic physiology. On
   CMV/Assist. Likely a few days from extubation.
   - Continue to monitor ABG q6h, adjust vent settings as needed
   - Continue with intubation, consider PS
   - Continue to dialyze fluid off

   #Sepsis: Likely MSSA line sepsis. Coverage expanded yesterday.
   Nafcillin d/ced. WBC 9.6.
   - Cont vanc and meropenem, treat for 72 days, if cultures negative and
   CT negative consider d/c and restart nafcillin
   - Daily blood cultures
   - Off pressors
   - Follow Ucx, blood cx
   - Appreciate ID recs
   # Hypotension: Off pressors, currently normotensive.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-failed cadaveric renal transplant, recent admission for line sepsis, coronary artery disease (CAD), dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF), and previous pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient presented to the emergency department with fevers and rigors and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of hemodialysis (HD). 

The patient developed pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient also had cardiac ischemia with very irregular and multiple heart rhythms, for which lidocaine was started for ventricular tachycardia (VTach) and later discontinued. Heparin was started but held due to increasing international normalized ratio (INR) and need for a line placement. Cardiology was consulted, and the plan was to take the patient to the cath lab for T-wave changes, but this was canceled due to increased INR. 

The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes (CE) and continues to have T-wave changes on the electrocardiogram (EKG). The patient's INR increased throughout the day yesterday, and DIC was negative. Hematology-oncology was consulted and likely attributed the increased INR to vitamin K deficiency. Intravenous vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FF"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal tx on HD,
   recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF, hx PE, who presented to
   the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD, patient developed
   pulm edema leading to respiratory failure, pt intubated.
   #Cardiac ischemia- patient perfusing well, has very irregular and
   multiple heart rhythms. Lidocaine was started yesterday for VTach and
   d/c yesterday. A heparin drip was also started, then held for
   increasing INR and need for a line placement. Cardiology was consulted.
   Original plan was to take to cath lab for T-wave changes, however,
   increased INR so they cancelled. CE continue to be elevated.
   - Restarted Heparin drip, continue
   - Restart beta blocker when pressures can tolerate
   - Cont ASA
   - CVVH to take off fluid
   - Appreciate cards recs
   - CE, EKG
   #Coagulation: The patient had an increase in INR throughout the day
   yesterday. DIC negative. Heme-onc consulted and likely [**12-26**] VitK
   deficiency. Gave IV vitK. Pt also received FFP and CVVH which appear to
   have brought INR into normal range 1.2 this am.
   - Restart heparin drip to PTT goal of 60
   - Continue to monitor - [**Hospital1 **] coags
   # Respiratory failure: fluid overload vs septic physiology. On
   CMV/Assist
   - Continue to monitor ABG q6h, adjust vent settings as needed
   - Continue with intubation, consider SBT if tolerates wean of sedation
   - Continue to dialyze fluid off
   -maintain sedation with fentanyl/versed
   #Renal Failure: ESRD s/p renal txp.  Temp HD cath placed
   - CVVH last night
   - HD today
   - Renal recs
   - Cont low dose steroids and EPO
   #Sepsis: Likely MSSA line sepsis. Coverage expanded yesterday.
   Nafcillin d/ced. WBC 9.6.
   - Cont vanc and meropenem, get ID recs for course duration
   - Daily blood cultures
   - Off pressors
   - Follow Ucx, blood cx
   - Follow ID recs
   # Hypotension: Off pressors, currently normotensive.
   #DM: controlled
   - continue NPH/HISS.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has undergone failed cadaveric renal transplant. She presented to the emergency department with fevers and rigors and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and concern for sepsis in the setting of hemodialysis (HD). The patient developed pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure, and she was intubated.

The patient has several medical complications, including cardiac ischemia, coagulation issues with an increased INR, respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, sepsis, bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), vascular device infection (not central or arterial line), superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), diarrhea, fever, hypotension, dyspnea, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

The patient's current plan includes restarting heparin drip, continuing beta-blocker therapy when pressures can tolerate, continuing aspirin therapy, performing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) to remove fluid, appreciating cardiology recommendations, monitoring coagulation parameters, adjusting ventilation settings as needed, weaning sedation if the patient tolerates, maintaining sedation with fentanyl and midazolam, continuing hemodialysis, and following renal recommendations.

She has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and a history of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient presented to the emergency department with fevers and rigors and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and concern for sepsis during HD.

24-hour events include a CT scan showing gallbladder distension and edema likely secondary to fluids given. A head CT revealed multifocal old infarcts with encephalomalacia. Renal will change dialysate and dialysis regimen due to clots in the filter. Cardiology anticipates transient worsening ischemia, likely [**12-26**] demand ischemia due to strain vs ischemia vs metabolic causes. The patient has been afebrile, dipped BP earlier in the day, and was restarted on neo (presumably medication) with MAPS in the 70s. Trying to wean neo so can restart HD tomorrow as not taking off enough with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Currently on CVVH. Discuss with renal desire to restart HD tomorrow and take off more fluid if can wean off levophed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a failed renal transplant. She presented to the emergency department with fevers and rigors and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and concern for sepsis during hemodialysis (HD). The patient developed pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure, and she was intubated.

The patient has multiple medical complications including ventricular tachycardia, hypoglycemia, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), chronic renal failure, superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), vascular device infection, respiratory failure, diarrhea, hypotension, and dyspnea.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient had sustained ventricular tachycardia, but it is no longer having runs of Vtach. Lidocaine was discontinued, and heparin was restarted.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient had an episode of hypoglycemia, which may be due to an acute increase in the creatine kinase (CK) level. Statin was discontinued, and CK is trending down.
3. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient presented with unstable angina and coronary ischemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a failed renal transplant. She presented to the emergency department with fevers and rigors, leading to her transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and concern for sepsis. She developed pulmonary edema and respiratory failure, resulting in endotracheal intubation. The patient has several comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and a history of pulmonary embolism (PE).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced sustained ventricular tachycardia, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient had low blood sugar levels, requiring close monitoring and management.
3. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient may be at risk for ACS, given her history of CAD and ongoing chest pain symptoms.
4. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to line sepsis, and appropriate antibiotics have been initiated.
5. Bacteremia: The patient may have bacteremia, as indicated by an elevated white blood cell count.
6. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and temporary hemodialysis is being performed.

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent failed cadaveric renal transplant and is currently on hemodialysis (HD). She has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and previous pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient presented to the emergency department with fevers and rigors and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and concern for sepsis during HD. She developed pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure and required intubation.

The patient's recent admission was for line sepsis. She has several ongoing medical issues, including cholecystitis, sepsis, renal failure, superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels.

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, meropenem, vancomycin, lansoprazole, and various other ICU medications. She is also receiving heparin gtt PTT around 40-60 for SVC obstruction and intermittent use of phenylephrine for hypotension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/48 to 180/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is sedated and minimally responsive. Her physical examination reveals a III/VI systolic murmur, warm extremities, and crackles on anterior lung exam.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.1, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.7 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 2.6, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 114 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 141 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 3.9 mEq/L, and calcium (Ca++) of 10.3 mg/dL. Her liver function tests are within normal limits, but her lactate levels are elevated at 1.0 mmol/L.

The patient has been diagnosed with several potential medical complications, including respiratory failure, cholecystitis, sepsis, renal failure, SVC syndrome, vascular device infection, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and hypotension. Additionally, she has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic renal failure (CRF), and previous episodes of hypoglycemia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of ESRD, failed cadaveric renal transplant, and multiple comorbidities including CAD, dCHF, and PE.
- She presented to the ED with fevers and rigors, hypotension, and concern for sepsis during hemodialysis. She developed pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure, and she was intubated.
- The patient has several ongoing medical issues including cholecystitis, sepsis (likely MSSA line sepsis), hypotension, cardiac ischemia/Vtach, elevated CK, coagulation abnormalities, chronic renal failure, and superior vena cava syndrome.
- The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, lansoprazole, meropenem, vancomycin, ASA, beta blockers, and statins.
- She is receiving hemodialysis and has a temporary HD line in.
- The patient's recent lab results show leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and electrolyte imbalances.
- The patient's vital signs include tachycardia, hypertension, normal oxygen saturation, and decreased urine output.
- She has been on mechanical ventilation with pressures support and is being weaned off sedation.
- The patient's overall condition requires close monitoring and management of various organ dysfunctions.

   HD admitted with line sepsis, hypotension. Line sepsis since treated,
   developed demand ischemia with EKG changes, and abdominal pain, with
   gall bladder distension noted on CT. So the question remains what the
   source of her infection is. She has not grown organisms  from her bile
   .
   She was being treated with heparin for her SVC, with PTT in the 150s
   developed spontaneous bleeding everywhere
   24 Hour Events:
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2175-7-4**] 12:24 AM
   Given her normo-hypertensive BPs it was felt that she could tolerate HD
   and she had 3L taken off yesterday, maintaining MAPS in the 80s to 90s.
   Weaned off neo gtt with bp 100-250 systolic, got lopressor pm dose and
   5mg IV with effect.
   She had a trial of CPAP, was put on AC for comfort during HD, was
   agitated afterwards, receiving boluses sedation, kept on AC. Sedatives
   were changed from versed/fentanly boluses to propofol drip with plan to
   attempt wean after HD today. Continues to have copious oral
   secretions,
   Her A line was repositioned with normalizatio of her A-line tracings.
   Her biliary drain initially drained bilious then bloody fluid without
   change in her abdominal exam. She was also noted to have dark red
   blood, coffee grounds and sm clots via ogt, in setting coagulopathy
   with PTT of 150s on heparin which she was getting for SVC syndrome.
   Heparin drip was held, with reversal of her PTT to 26.7 today. Given
   coffee grounds, tube feeds held and NPH while NPO. She is on a PPI.
   She was typed, crossed, and 2 units PRBC reserved, although no

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has been admitted to the ICU. She initially presented with line sepsis and hypotension, which has since been treated. However, she developed demand ischemia with EKG changes and abdominal pain, along with gallbladder distension noted on CT. The source of infection remains unclear as she has not grown any organisms from her bile.

The patient has also been experiencing spontaneous bleeding due to elevated PTT levels while receiving heparin for superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. She was on prophylactic heparin but developed a significant bleed, so the heparin was held and her PTT normalized.

The patient's vital signs have been fluctuating, with high blood pressures and low heart rates. She is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. Her oxygen saturation remains stable at 97%. The patient is sedated and minimally responsive.

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelets, troponin-T, and lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient continues to have intermittent fevers despite antibiotic coverage, indicating a possible ongoing infection.
2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient's EKG changes and chest pain suggest the possibility of ACS.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted to the ICU for line sepsis and hypotension. She had a previous failed renal transplant. The patient developed demand ischemia with EKG changes and abdominal pain, along with gallbladder distension noted on CT. The source of her infection is still unknown as she has not grown any organisms from her bile cultures.

The patient was being treated with heparin for superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, but she developed spontaneous bleeding throughout her body due to a high PTT level. She underwent hemodialysis (HD) and had 3 liters taken off, maintaining mean arterial pressures (MAPs) in the 80s to 90s. She was weaned off neoplastic and continued on metoprolol.

The patient had a trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and was put on assist control (AC) ventilation for comfort during HD. She became agitated afterwards and received boluses of sedation, transitioning to a propofol drip. She continues to have copious oral secretions.

Her arterial line was repositioned with normalization of her arterial line tracings. Initially, her biliary drain drained bilious fluid, then bloody fluid without any change in her abdominal exam. She also had dark red blood, coffee grounds, and some clots via oral gastric tube (OGT"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has been admitted to the ICU for line sepsis and hypotension. The patient has a history of failed cadaveric renal transplant and is currently on hemodialysis (HD).

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Cholecystitis: The patient has been diagnosed with cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. This condition may be causing the abdominal pain and distension noted on the CT scan.

2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has shown EKG changes indicating possible ACS or unstable angina. This requires further evaluation and treatment.

3. Sepsis and Bacteremia: The patient initially presented with line sepsis and subsequent bacteremia. Despite receiving meropenem for bacterial sepsis, the source of infection remains unclear. The blood cultures are pending, and there is suspicion of MSSA infection.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure requiring dialysis. The HD was well-tolerated, and the patient's systolic blood pressure stabilized in the 80-90 range.

5. Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC): The patient has SVC syndrome, likely due to compression of the superior vena cava by a vascular device or graft. Heparin treatment has been initiated to manage this condition.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 67-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has been admitted to the ICU. She initially presented with line sepsis and hypotension, which has since been treated. However, she developed demand ischemia with EKG changes and abdominal pain, along with gallbladder distension noted on CT. The source of her infection is still unclear as no organisms have grown from her bile.

She was being treated with heparin for superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, but she developed spontaneous bleeding due to a high PTT level. Her blood cultures are pending from femoral and arterial lines. Sputum culture shows oral growth, while fecal culture is negative.

The patient has multiple medical complications including cholecystitis, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), chronic renal failure, SVC syndrome, vascular device infection, respiratory failure, diarrhea, hypotension, and dyspnea.

Fever persists despite coverage with meropenem for bile salt-escalating bacterial load (BSEBLs) and gram-positive organisms. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she will receive a dose of vancomycin with hemodialysis (HD) today. Gallbladder culture is pending, and if negative, she may be taken off vancomycin and meropenem, switching to nafcillin.

The patient also has an acute gastrointestinal bleed likely secondary to elevated PTT in the setting of heparin treatment for SVC syndrome. She is currently off heparin with a PTT of 26 (from 150), and she continues to drain bloody fluid from her per tube. Consider restarting heparin versus lovenox for SVC treatment.

The patient's plan includes redialyzing today, post-dialysis plan for extubation, checking ABG with vent changes, weaning sedation, and trying pressure support. If the patient fails spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), she will remain on propofol for 24 hours and wake up to medical rescue for vascular event.

The patient's labile blood pressures are causing issues with weaning off sedation and transitioning to boluses from a drip. Her EKG changes are also concerning, and she will undergo further evaluation."

   HD admitted with line sepsis, hypotension. Line sepsis since treated,
   developed demand ischemia with EKG changes, and abdominal pain, with
   gall bladder distension noted on CT. So the question remains what the
   source of her infection is. She has not grown organisms  from her bile

   24 Hour Events:
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2175-7-4**] 12:24 AM
   Given her normo-hypertensive BPs it was felt that she could tolerate HD
   and she had 3L taken off yesterday, maintaining MAPS in the 80s to 90s.
   Weaned off neo gtt with bp 100-250 systolic, got lopressor pm dose and
   5mg IV with effect.
   She had a trial of CPAP, was put on AC for comfort during HD, was
   agitated afterwards, receiving boluses sedation, kept on AC. Sedatives
   were changed from versed/fentanly boluses to propofol drip with plan to
   attempt wean after HD today. Continues to have copious oral
   secretions,
   Her A line was repositioned with normalizatio of her A-line tracings.
   Her biliary drain initially drained bilious then bloody fluid without
   change in her abdominal exam. She was also noted to have dark red
   blood, coffee grounds and sm clots via ogt, in setting coagulopathy
   with PTT of 150s on heparin which she was getting for SVC syndrome.
   Heparin drip was held, with reversal of her PTT to 26.7 today. Given
   coffee grounds, tube feeds held and NPH while NPO. She is on a PPI.
   She was typed, crossed, and 2 units PRBC reserved, although no
   transfusion was needed.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 67-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has undergone a failed cadaveric renal transplant.
- She was admitted to the ICU with line sepsis and hypotension. The line sepsis was treated, but she developed demand ischemia with EKG changes and abdominal pain.
- A CT scan showed gallbladder distension, suggesting possible cholecystitis.
- She has not grown any organisms from her bile cultures, making cholecystitis an unlikely cause of infection.
- The patient was being treated with heparin for superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, but developed spontaneous bleeding due to a prolonged PTT in the 150s.
- She received a dose of vancomycin post HD and had blood cultures taken from her femoral line and arterial line.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.0 F, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/55 mmHg to 92/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and troponin-T levels.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic renal failure, acute coronary syndrome, sepsis without organ dysfunction, bacteremia caused by methicillin"

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): possibly [**12-26**] sepsis vs ICP vs
   agitation.  LP performed yesterday.
   - F/U LP results
   - F/U CT head and MRI head
   - attempt to lighten sedation with anxiolytics on board see if patient
   less agitated.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): patient continues
   switching between AC and PSV.  As sedation is weaned, she becomes
   tachypneic and agitated, leading to more sedation, respiratory
   depression and worsened respiratory status.
   -c/s neuromuscular service regarding respiratory failure, possibly due
   to weaknes
   -check lipase for propofol sedation
   -CVVH or HD to get fluid off for respiratory status
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE): ESRD s/p failed renal txp, on HD.
   - HD today per renal
   - f/u renal recs
   -if unable to HD today due to BP, switch to CVVH
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)- pt intermittantly requires pressors, and
   then reflexively becomes tachycardic. Currently off neo.
   -change HD to CVVH if BP fall, but plan to take off fluid today.
   -make effort not to restart Neo unless CVVH attempted or compelled by
   urgency
 BACTEREMIA MSSA: Abx d/c'd yesterday, and nafcillin started back
   yesterday.
   -continue nafcillin
   -f/u bcxs, CSF cxs
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS.  Perc drained by surgery.  Surgery ready to
   sign off.
   - continue to monitor output.
 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
   -holding TF for possible extubation
 DM: NPH increased o/n
   -check FSBG q6 with NPH + ISS
 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS, UNSTABLE ANGINA, CORONARY ISCHEMIA).
   earlier in admission had ventricular arrhythmias on pressors, now
   resolved after 1d heparin drip and lidocaine drip.
   - Cont. to monitor for dysrrhythmias

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The chief complaint is not specified in the note. The patient underwent several tests and procedures, including an EKG, lumbar puncture, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The CT head showed a right parietal lesion, and an MRI scan was performed to assess the lesion. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, and there are no signs of jugular venous distention. The patient is sedated and intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute. Oxygen is being delivered through an endotracheal tube, and the FiO2 is set at 30%. The physical examination reveals coarse bilateral breath sounds, and a Percussion drain of the gallbladder was performed due to non-bloody, non-purulent fluid.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and creatinine (Cr) levels. The troponin T level is elevated, indicating possible cardiac involvement. Other lab values, such as glucose, electrolytes, liver function tests, and kidney function tests, are within normal limits or show slight abnormalities.

The assessment and plan section indicates that the patient has altered mental status, possibly due to sepsis, increased intr"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): possibly [**12-26**] sepsis vs ICP vs
   agitation.  LP performed yesterday.
   - F/U LP results
   - F/U CT head and MRI head
   - attempt to lighten sedation with anxiolytics on board see if patient
   less agitated.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): patient continues
   switching between AC and PSV.  As sedation is weaned, she becomes
   tachypneic and agitated, leading to more sedation, respiratory
   depression and worsened respiratory status.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has undergone a failed cadaveric renal transplant. She presents with line sepsis and is intubated for respiratory failure, along with continuing hypotension. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to experience respiratory failure, and there is a mention of switching between assisted control (AC) and pressure support ventilation (PSV). The need for neuromuscular service consultation is mentioned due to the possibility of neuro or muscular cause of weakness.

2. Hypotension: The patient requires pressors intermittently and then becomes tachycardic. This suggests ongoing hypotension that needs to be addressed. The mention of septic picture due to lability and leukocytosis indicates a possible infection causing the hypotension.

3. Bacteremia MSSA: The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Antibiotics were discontinued yesterday, and nafcillin was started back yesterday. A 21-day course of antibiotics is planned.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to sepsis, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), or agitation. A lumbar puncture (LP) has been performed, and further"

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has undergone a failed renal transplant. She presents with line sepsis, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to switch between assisted (AC) and spontaneous (PSV) ventilation modes. She becomes tachypneic and agitated when sedation is weaned, leading to more sedation, respiratory depression, and worsened respiratory status. Consultation with a neuromuscular service is recommended regarding respiratory failure and the possibility of a neuro or muscular cause of weakness.

2. Hypotension: The patient requires intermittent pressors and then becomes tachycardic. She required pressors last night for low mean arterial pressure (MAP) after continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH). There is a septic picture due to lability and leukocytosis.

3. Bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): Antibiotics were discontinued yesterday, and nafcillin was started back yesterday. Nafcillin should be continued for a total of 21 days.

4. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to sepsis, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), or agitation. A"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a failed renal transplant and is currently on hemodialysis. She presented to the emergency department with fevers, rigors, and hypotension, leading to her transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for concern of sepsis in the setting of hemodialysis. The patient has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and a history of pulmonary embolism (PE).

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fevers, rigors, and hypotension suggests sepsis. Cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient has altered mental status, acute respiratory failure, acute coronary syndrome, renal failure, chronic kidney disease, and hyperglycemia.
3. Abdominal Abscesses: A CT scan revealed abscesses in the liver, kidney, and spleen. The patient is being treated empirically with micafungin, and mycolytic cultures have been sent.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's AST/ALT levels have significantly increased from 99/42 to 7697/[**2098**] in 24 hours, indicating possible liver injury. This could be due to infection, ischemic injury, or drug-induced toxicity"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a failed renal transplant. She presented to the emergency department with fevers, rigors, and hypotension, leading to her admission to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for concern of sepsis during hemodialysis. The patient has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary embolism (PE), and a history of line sepsis. Her current conditions include severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, altered mental status, hyperglycemia, acute coronary syndrome, bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), chronic renal failure, and superior vena cava syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated candidiasis: The patient has abdominal abscesses, which could potentially spread to other organs, including the liver and spleen. She is already on micafungin, and mycolytic cultures have been sent.
2. Cardiogenic shock vs septic shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension, fevers, and a rising white blood cell count, making it difficult to differentiate between cardiogenic and septic shock. She is being treated with vanc/cefepime/micafungin until cultures come back negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent failed cadaveric renal transplant and is currently on hemodialysis (HD). She also has a history of line sepsis, coronary artery disease (CAD), dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF), and previous pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient presented to the emergency department with fevers and rigors and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and concern for sepsis during HD.

The patient's 24-hour events include a trans thoracic echo, blood cultures, stopping the dialysis catheter, arterial line stoppage, and cultures of sputum, stool, and blood. The patient developed fever, and abdominal CT revealed abscesses in the liver, kidney, and spleen. She was started on micafungin, mycologic cultures, and CMV antigen was sent out. The patient also experienced transaminitis with high levels, indicating liver involvement.

In the afternoon, the patient became febrile, hypotensive, and showed increasing lactate, prompting panculture and fluid resuscitation. She was given neomycin and immediately rebounded, becoming hypertensive with labile blood pressure readings. The patient required neo and levo to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) in the high 50s. Due to fevers, the HD line"
