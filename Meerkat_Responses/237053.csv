","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis who presented with massive hematemesis. He was intubated for airway protection and underwent endoscopic treatment to control the bleeding gastric varix. The patient has been admitted to the ICU where he is receiving supportive care including IV fluids, blood transfusions, octreotide, pantoprazole, and antibiotics. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 142/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy, with an INR of 1.8. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: There is a risk of rebleeding from the gastric varix, especially if the source of bleeding was not completely controlled during the endoscopy.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of cryptogenic cirrhosis increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status and confusion.
3. Infection: The patient is at increased risk for infections due to his intubation and the use of indwelling lines, making ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) potential complications.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient has received"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with cryptogenic cirrhosis who was admitted with hematemesis. The patient had a gastric varix that rebleeding caused this presentation. He required massive transfusion, intubation, and an endoscopic glue injection to control the bleeding varix.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), a heart rate of 99 bpm, a blood pressure of 142/82 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he has a regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, a 3/6 systolic murmur that increases with expiration, a distended but soft abdomen with a positive fluid wave, and no edema. The patient's neurologic examination is also noted as intubated and sedated.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.3 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 13.9 g/dL, a platelet count of 80 K/uL, and an INR of 1.6. Other lab values such as blood glucose, liver function tests, electrolytes, and kidney function are within normal limits.

The patient's chest X-ray shows clear lung fields, an elevated right hemidiaphrag"

","Summary:
The patient presented with massive hematemesis and was intubated. They were started on fentanyl and Versed drips, and received 6 units of packed red blood cells. A central line was placed in the left internal jugular vein using ultrasound guidance. Endoscopy was performed at 05:19 AM, revealing large varices that were glued with ethiodol. The patient is on octreotide, fentanyl, and midazolam infusions in the ICU. Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the recent event. Vital signs show a stable temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 33.9 mmHg. Fluid balance indicates an input of 208 mL and output of 615 mL, with a positive balance of 4,397 mL. Respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and 100% oxygen delivery. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings are not assessed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and liver enzymes. Other labs are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Bleeding: The patient initially presented with massive hematemesis, indicating significant bleeding. Although the bleeding has been controlled with endoscopic therapy, there is still a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with massive hematemesis and was intubated. Fentanyl and Versed drip were started, and the patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells. A central line was placed in the left internal jugular vein, and endoscopy was performed at 5:19 AM, revealing large varices that were treated with ethiodol. The patient's allergies are unknown, and the last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin at 11:15 PM on 10/10/2149.

The patient is currently on multiple infusions including octreotide, fentanyl, and midazolam (Versed). Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events. The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/82 to 172/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's height is 67 inches, and central venous pressure (CVP) is 33.9 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 208 mL and a total output of 615 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 208 mL. Respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 30 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be somnolent but arousable, with large but reactive pupils, clear sclerae, moist mucous membranes, and no rash or edema. Neurological examination shows the patient to be alert but not oriented, with intact bilateral hand grip and no hyperreflexia, clonus, or asterixis.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 7.3 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 32.6 g/dL, decreased platelet count of 80 K/uL, elevated blood glucose level of 170 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL. Other laboratory values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is receiving ICU care with ongoing monitoring, nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, who presented to the ICU with massive hematemesis. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and is currently on octreotide, fentanyl, and midazolam infusions. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 142/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 100%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals somnolence, large but reactive pupils, clear mental status, normal heart sounds, distended but soft abdomen with a positive fluid wave, hypoactive bowel sounds, and no edema. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, elevated liver enzymes, and low albumin. 

The patient has been diagnosed with rebleeding gastric varices and is being treated with pantoprazole, octreotide, and planned endoscopic intervention. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatic hydrothorax, hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatomegaly."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Had TIPS revision by IR.  Portal gradient was initially 15 mmHg (nl
   [**5-31**]), with mild stenosis of the distal TIPS.  Angioplasty was
   attempted but failed.  A new stent was placed.  This stent passes into
   IVC, such that a clot would make revision difficult.  Following
   procedure gradient was 6 mmHg and flow was improved.  Patient needs US
   to evaluate tomorrow (Monday would be ok).

He had a prior TIPS procedure but presented with massive hematemesis, requiring intubation for airway protection and endoscopic control of bleeding gastric varix. A TIPS revision was performed today, with initial portal gradient of 15 mmHg, which reduced to 6 mmHg after stent placement. The patient is currently on octreotide, pantoprazole, and has an elevated INR of 1.5 due to coagulopathy. He is also receiving IV fluids and has been started on lactulose for encephalopathy. The patient has a history of gastric varix and is at risk for rebleeding. He needs a repeat ultrasound to reassess TIPS function, and consideration should be given to lactulose PO/NG.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with cryptogenic/nonsurgical alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis who underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) revision. He presented with hematemesis and is currently intubated for airway protection. The patient has a history of known gastric fundal varix and increased pressure gradient due to a poorly functioning TIPS. He is now scheduled for TIPS revision.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient likely has hepatic encephalopathy, which can worsen in the setting of an acute bleed. Treatment includes lactulose enemas three times a day.
2. Gastric Fundal Varix Bleeding: The patient has a known gastric fundal varix, which is a risk factor for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The bleeding may be related to increased pressure gradient due to poorly functioning TIPS. Further evaluation and management are needed to control the bleeding.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR (>1.5), indicating a coagulation disorder. Vitamin K has been administered, but the INR remains elevated at 1.7. Monitoring and appropriate intervention, such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP), may be necessary depending on the clinical scenario.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, resulting in a total fluid intake"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of cryptogenic/NASH cirrhosis who underwent a TIPS procedure with revision. He was admitted with hematemesis, likely due to a known gastric fundal varix and increased pressure gradient caused by a poorly functioning TIPS. The patient has shown improvement in mental status with lactulose enemas and has been extubated without difficulty. He is now converted to all oral medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has likely experienced hepatic encephalopathy, which is worsened in the setting of an acute bleed. Treatment includes administering lactulose and adding rifaximin back to the regimen.
2. Hematemesis: The patient's hematemesis is likely due to a known gastric fundal varix and increased pressure gradient caused by a poorly functioning TIPS. The recent TIPS revision shows a good gradient across TIPS and the patient has been stable for 48 hours.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR (>1.5) and received vitamin K on [**10-11**]. The INR remains at 1.7 today. Monitoring is recommended, with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) administration if rebleeding occurs.
4. Fluid overload: The patient has a negative fluid balance over the past 24 hours, indicating potential fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is essential.
