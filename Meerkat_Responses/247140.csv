   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 50 yo male with inferolateral STEMI involving RCA and LAD s/p
   PCI with BMS placement.
   # Myocardial Infarction: Remains stable following the PCI. His
   hemodynamics suggest RV as well as LV dysfunction (elevated end RV
   pressure and elevated PCWP), but he is not in overt CHF. BP tolerated
   BB overnight.  CK was notably elevated to 5, 000 range with Trop 19.
   Both of these are trending down this am.
   - Start ACE today
   - Continue ASA, Beta blocker, clopidogrel, statin, nicotine patch
   - TTE in the morning to eval for wall abdormalities
   - Fasting lipid profile
   # Leucocytosis: stable. Likely reflects inflammation associated with
   his MI and intervention. Will monitor

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of inferolateral ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving the right coronary artery (RCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD), who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/92 to 134/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the general appearance, heart, lungs, neck, abdomen, or extremities. However, there is evidence of dried blood from a recent tooth extraction site and xanthalomas on the superior eyelids bilaterally. The patient's pulses are strong and equal bilaterally in all extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), troponin-T, and cardiac enzymes (CK and CKMB). These elevated levels are consistent with the recent myocardial infarction and intervention. The electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include the following:

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of inferolateral STEMI involving the right coronary artery (RCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD), who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate ranging from 74 to 111 bpm, blood pressure between 98/92 mmHg and 116/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. 

The patient experienced episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and one episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) overnight, but the EKG during these episodes remained unchanged. 

The patient reported post-prandial chest discomfort, which improved with Maalox. 

The patient has a small ooze from a catheter site and a small hematoma, both of which are stable. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (17.3 K/uL), hemoglobin level (39.9%), platelet count (395 K/uL), creatinine level (0.9 mg/dL), and troponin-T level (19.91). The CK level is notably elevated to the 5,000 range, which is trending down this morning.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with an inferolateral ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving the right coronary artery (RCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement in the RCA. The patient's 24-hour events include episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and one episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), both with unchanged EKG findings. The patient experienced postprandial chest discomfort that improved with Maalox and has been anxious.

   Imaging: TTE:  The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.There is mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with severe inferior hypokinsis and mild mid
   inferolateral hypokinsis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
   imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function. Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal with focal basal free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   consistent with coronary artery disease. Mild basal right ventricular
   freewall hypokinesis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 50 yo male with inferolateral STEMI involving RCA and LAD s/p
   PCI with BMS placement.
   # Myocardial Infarction: Now s/p infero-posterior MI. Remains stable
   following the PCI. His hemodynamics suggest RV as well as LV
   dysfunction (elevated end RV pressure and elevated PCWP), but he is not
   in overt CHF. BP tolerated BB overnight.  CK was notably elevated to 5,
   000 range with Trop 19. Both of these are trending down this am.
   - Start ACE today->captopril so can titrate throughout day today.
   Likely d/c on lisinopril.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of inferolateral STEMI involving RCA and LAD, who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement. The patient's current condition remains stable following the PCI, but there are indications of right ventricular (RV) as well as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. The patient's hemodynamics show elevated end RV pressure and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), but he is not in overt congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's blood pressure is well-tolerated on beta-blockers (BB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, but it is slightly low in the morning. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is elevated, likely reflecting inflammation associated with the myocardial infarction (MI) and intervention. The patient's normocytic anemia is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ongoing LV and RV dysfunction: The patient's echocardiogram shows mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease, as well as mild basal right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. Close monitoring of cardiac function is essential to identify any worsening of these dysfunctions.

2. Hypotension: Although the patient's blood pressure is well-tolerated on BB and ACE inhibitors, it is slightly low in the morning. Adjustments in medication dosage may be necessary to maintain adequate"

   Imaging: TTE:  The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.There is mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with severe inferior hypokinsis and mild mid
   inferolateral hypokinsis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
   imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function. Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal with focal basal free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   consistent with coronary artery disease. Mild basal right ventricular
   freewall hypokinesis.
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 50 yo male with inferolateral STEMI involving RCA and LAD s/p
   PCI with BMS placement.
   # Myocardial Infarction: Now s/p infero-posterior MI. Remains stable
   following the PCI. His hemodynamics suggest RV as well as LV
   dysfunction (elevated end RV pressure and elevated PCWP), but he is not
   in overt CHF. BP tolerated BB/ACE overnight, but this morning is a bit
   low.  CK continues to improve.
   - Continue ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin 80mg, captopril and nicotine
   patch. Transition to lisinopril on d/c
   - If BP persistently low in am, then would decrease BB to 12.5 TID.
   (increased amount to 25 and freq to TID yesterday)
   # Leucocytosis: stable. Likely reflects inflammation associated with
   his MI and intervention. Trending down.
   # Normocytic anemia: Stable.
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: PIVs
   # PROPHYLAXIS: SC heparin, bowel regimen
   # CODE: Presumed full
   # DISPO: Transfer to floor

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of inferolateral ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving the right coronary artery (RCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD), who has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement.
- The patient remains stable following the PCI, but shows signs of right ventricular (RV) as well as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, indicated by elevated end-diastolic pressure in the RV and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).
- The patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled overnight but is a bit low in the morning. CK levels are improving.
- The patient has leucocytosis, likely reflecting inflammation associated with the MI and intervention. Trending down.
- The patient also has normocytic anemia, which is stable.
- The plan includes continuing aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin 80mg, captopril, and nicotine patch. Transition to lisinopril upon discharge.
- If the patient's blood pressure persists in being low in the morning, the dose of beta-blocker will be decreased to 12.5mg three times a day.
- The patient will be kept NPO overnight.
- Prophylaxis for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) will be continued.
- The patient's code status remains as full"
