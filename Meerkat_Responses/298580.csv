","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old female who presented to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient is nonverbal, occasionally grunting/groaning, and does not recognize family or caregivers. She responds to painful stimuli. The patient was hypotensive and received intravenous fluids and vasopressor support. She has been treated with various antibiotics for suspected infections. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/67 mmHg to 88/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. She is receiving respiratory support and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, low creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal no significant abnormalities. The patient has been diagnosed with hyperglycemia, hypothermia, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and fever of unknown origin. She is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

   aphasia and left sided hemiplegia admitted from nursing home for
   fevers, tachycardia and tachypnea.
   .
   # Fevers: Unable to obtain history from patient to narrow source. Ua
   negative. CXR no overt infiltrate, other than left basilar atelactasis.
   Blood cultures sent. Patient with recent C. Diff infection, abdominal
   exam soft but moderately distended. Moderate distension similiar to
   prior admission when CT scan was done. Unable to assess menigitic
   symptoms -mental status unresponsive at baseline (confirmed with
   nursing home), unable to assess nucchal rigidity on exam. Nasal swab
   for influenza was an inadequate swab.
   - Due to health care exposure broaden antibiotics to Vancomycin and
   Cipro. Anaerobic coverage with metronidazole due to aspriation risk and
   foul smelling breath on admission. Also c/w ampicillin and cefepime at
   meningitic doses
   - Follow-up blood culture and urine culture
   - Repeat CXR this afternoon following fluid resuscitation
   - Send sputum culture via nasotracheal suction
   - Order stool culture if has bowel movements
   - Repeat nasal swab for influenza
   - KUB to eval for megacolon in setting of recent c. diff infection and
   moderate distension on exam
   - Consider LP
   .
   # Hypotension: Evidence of shock with elevated lactate and creatinine.
   Lactate improved with 3 L NS. Differential most likely septic shock in
   setting of fevers vs. hypovolemic shock.
   - Infectious work-up as above
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Add pressors if MAP < 60
   - Awaiting TTE findings, trend troponins to eval cardiogenic shock
   - Trend lactate
   - Further resuscitation with RBC vs LR
   .
   # Acute kidney injury: Creatine returned to baseline, after aggressive
   fluid resusciation
   - Follow urine output
   .
   # Tachypnea: Appears to be chronic problem, felt to be central process.
   Unlikely PE as patient on lovenox doses at nursing home for DVT ppx.
   CXR no overt infiltrate, effusions. No suggestion of heart failure on
   exam. While examining patient with notable upper airway sounds
   suggestive of sleep apnea. Based on VBG appears to be respiratory
   acidosis with compensation.
   - ABG to assess acid-base status
   - KUB to assess for abdominal etiology (obstruction, megacolon)
   - Consider CPAP treatment at night, however patient appears to be
   intermittently sleeping throughout the day.
   .
   # Anemia: 29 from 37.5 most likely dilutional. Guaiac negative on
   rectal exam. However, clotted blood around PEG tube. Unlikely
   significant GI bleed resulting in tachypnea.
   - Active type and screen
   - Repeat HCT to monitor stability
   .
   # DM type II: Order sliding scale.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Metoprolol
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, right cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual aphasia and left-sided hemiplegia. She was admitted from a nursing home due to fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The patient is currently in the ICU.

24-hour events include the start of a multi-lumen line, EKG, and arterial line. The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing hypotension despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. She continues to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, ampicillin, and cefepime.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/67 mmHg to 88/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 223 K/uL, elevated glucose level of 117 mg/dL, elevated lactate level of 1.8 mmol/L, and decreased hemoglobin concentration of 29.1%. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Imaging studies include a pending chest X-ray (CXR),"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient's medical history includes enucleation of the left eye, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and a recent history of Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/67 mmHg to 88/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving multiple intravenous medications including antibiotics, vasopressors, and other ICU medications. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Imaging reveals a possible right middle lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's electrolytes and fluids are also being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and right middle lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray raise concerns for pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and further evaluation with sputum cultures are necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient's initial hypotension and elevated lactate levels suggest septic shock, which has since resolved. Continued monitoring of vital signs and lactate levels is essential to detect any signs of recurrent sepsis.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's"

   # Fevers: Afebrile overnight. Ua negative. CXR no overt infiltrate,
   other than left basilar atelactasis. Blood and CSF cultures sent, as
   well as CSF HSV PCR. Had recent C. Diff infection. Nasal swab for
   influenza neg. KUB showed constipation. [**Month (only) 11**] also represent serotonin
   syndrome.
   - Pull back meningitic dosing of antibiotics, as CSF studies not
   classic for bacterial infection
   - Due to health care exposure, continue with broad spectrum coverage
   (Cefepime, Vanc, Ampicillin, Flagyl, Cipro
 amp/cefepime doses). Added
   on Acyclovir yesterday given CSF findings.
   - Consider ID consult for guidance on antimicrobial choices
   - Consider toxicology recommendation for potential medication toxicity
   - Follow-up blood/urine/CSF cultures
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved
   - Infectious work-up as above
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Trend lactate

   # Acute kidney injury: Creatine returned to baseline, after aggressive
   fluid resusciation
   - Follow urine output, BUN/creatinine
   .
   # Tachypnea: Appears to be chronic problem, felt to be central process.
   Based on VBG appears to be respiratory acidosis with compensation.
   - Consider CPAP treatment at night, however patient appears to be
   intermittently sleeping throughout the day.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, right cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual aphasia, and left-sided hemiplegia. The patient was admitted from a nursing home due to fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Fevers: The patient's fever has resolved overnight, and there are no signs of infection on the chest X-ray. However, the patient has a history of recent C. Diff infection, and a nasal swab for influenza was negative. Blood and CSF cultures have been sent, along with a CSF HSV PCR. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics due to healthcare exposure. 

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but they required aggressive fluid resuscitation and trend lactate levels. 

3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level returned to baseline after aggressive fluid resuscitation. 

4. Tachypnea: The patient's tachypnea appears to be a chronic problem, possibly related to a central process. There is respiratory acidosis with compensation based on the vital signs. 

5. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level of 24.9%, which is likely dilutional.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and altered mental status. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. On admission, the patient's vital signs were unstable, with high blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and fever. The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and blood glucose levels. The patient's renal function was also impaired, as indicated by the elevated serum creatinine level. The patient's electrolyte levels were abnormal, with low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including anemia, acute renal failure, altered mental status, hyperglycemia, hypothermia, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and fever of unknown origin. The patient is receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care. The patient's code status is full code, indicating that all measures should be taken to save the patient's life.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and altered mental status may indicate an underlying infection. The patient is already receiving antibiotics, which suggests that there may be a suspicion of bacterial infection. However, further investigations are needed to identify the specific pathogen causing the infection.

2. Acute Kidney Injury ("

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y/o F PMH DM, HTN, right CVA with residual aphasia and left sided
   hemiplegia admitted from nursing home for fevers, tachycardia and
   tachypnea.
   .
   # Fevers: Unable to obtain history from patient to narrow source. Ua
   negative. CXR no overt infiltrate, other than left basilar atelactasis.
   Blood cultures sent. Patient with recent C. Diff infection, abdominal
   exam soft but moderately distended. Moderate distension similiar to
   prior admission when CT scan was done. Unable to assess menigitic
   symptoms -mental status unresponsive at baseline (confirmed with
   nursing home), unable to assess nucchal rigidity on exam. Nasal swab
   for influenza neg. Sputum unable to be induced sufficiently. Cdiff
   pending. CSF cultures pending. KUB showed constipation
   - Due to health care exposure, continue with broad spectrum coverage
   (Cefeime, Vanc, Ampicillin, Flagyl, Cipro
 amp/cefepime at meningitic
   doses). Added on Acyclovir yesterday given CSF findings.
   - Follow-up blood culture and urine culture (NGTD); also follow-up CSF
   cultures
   .
   # Hypotension: Evidence of shock with elevated lactate and creatinine.
   Lactate improved with 3 L NS. Differential most likely septic shock in
   setting of fevers vs. hypovolemic shock. Now resolved
   - Infectious work-up as above
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Add pressors if MAP < 60
   - Trend lactate
   - Further resuscitation with RBC vs LR
   .
   # Acute kidney injury: Creatine returned to baseline, after aggressive
   fluid resusciation
   - Follow urine output
   .
   # Tachypnea: Appears to be chronic problem, felt to be central process.
   Unlikely PE as patient on lovenox doses at nursing home for DVT ppx.
   CXR no overt infiltrate, effusions. No suggestion of heart failure on
   exam. While examining patient with notable upper airway sounds
   suggestive of sleep apnea. Based on VBG appears to be respiratory
   acidosis with compensation.
   - ABG to assess acid-base status; improved with 2L NC
   - Consider CPAP treatment at night, however patient appears to be
   intermittently sleeping throughout the day.
   .
   # Anemia: 24.9 from 37.5 most likely dilutional. Guaiac negative on
   rectal exam. However, clotted blood around PEG tube. Unlikely
   significant GI bleed resulting in tachypnea.
   - Active type and screen
   - Repeat HCT to monitor stability
   .
   # DM type II: Order sliding scale.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold outpatient Lisinopril, Metoprolol
   .
   # CVA: LFTs stable
   - Restart statin, ASA
   .
   # Dementia: Continue amantadine.
   .
   # Med Rec: Hold reglan for now.
   .
   # FEN: aggressive IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO
   - Nutrition recs for tube feeds
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin TID, bowel reg
   # Access: femoral line, arterial line
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with HCP)
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and right cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual aphasia and left-sided hemiplegia. She was admitted from a nursing home for fevers, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, hyperglycemia, hypothermia, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and fever of unknown origin.

Upon admission, the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected septic shock. She was also given acyclovir based on CSF findings. The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and CSF cultures are pending.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated creatinine levels. Her arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with compensation.

The patient's physical examination revealed no overt infiltrate on chest X-ray, but there was left basilar atelectasis. The abdominal exam showed moderate distension, which is similar to her previous admission when a CT scan was done. The patient's neurological examination could not be assessed due to her unresponsive mental status.

The patient's care plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, follow-up blood culture and urine culture, and follow-up CSF cultures. She is also being aggressively fluid-resuscitated, with plans to add pressors if mean arterial pressure"
