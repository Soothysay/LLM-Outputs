","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of cardiogenic shock. They have a history of allergies to sulfa, penicillins, latex, red dye, Darvon, Percodan, aspirin, and aspartame. The patient is currently on multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, dobutamine, norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and furosemide. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 77/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and a respiratory system compliance of 34.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, troponin, C-reactive protein, and glucose. The patient's platelet count is within normal range, while kidney function appears to be impaired with an elevated blood urea nitrogen level. Electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with low potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals peripheral vascular issues, altered mental status, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's medical history includes respiratory failure, cardi"

   Echo: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in
   the left ventricle. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There
   is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs
   of tamponade.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-4-25**], the RV
   systolic function is slightly worse and the pericardial effusion is
   slightly larger (still small, without evidence of tamponade).

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old woman with history of ALL s/p transplant and multiple
   rounds of chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusions, s/p asystolic
   cardiac arrest, now back to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with acute shortness of breath.
   #) Acute respiratory distress: Given the patient
s description of
   anxiety, elevated cardiac enzymes and [**Last Name (un) 6322**] cardiac function it is
   likely that she has had an ischemic event.  Other posibilities include
   flash pulmonary edema or pulmonary embolism.
   - Diuresis, treatment of cardiogenic shock (see below)
   #) Cardiogenic shock. Physical exam findings, mixed venous O2 sats, and
   pulmonary edema are suggestive of cardiogenic shock. Echo shows
   worsening mitral regurgitation. EF on echocardiogram today is 20%.  The
   patient
s cardiac output lived around 3.5 overnight per Vigileo
   monitoring.  Lactates and Venous O2 sats improving.
   - Continue dobutamine to promote forward flow
   - Trend mixed venous O2 sats Q6H
   - Follow lactates to assess perfusion Q6H
   #) VRE bacteremia/Omaya infection s/p removal/CNS infection. Continue
   linezolid. No role for repeating lumbar puncture for now.
   #) Transaminitis. Was resolving s/p arrest, now elevated (likely in
   setting of hypotension and ? PEA arrest peri-intubation). Will continue
   to trend.
   #) Leukemia. No peripheral blasts. Oncology to consider IT chemotherapy
   if she continues to recover.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of ALL post-transplant and multiple rounds of chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusions, who presented with acute shortness of breath and is currently in the ICU.

Summary of Information:
- The patient has a history of ALL and has undergone a transplant and multiple chemotherapy treatments.
- She experienced an asystolic cardiac arrest and was resuscitated.
- She is now back in the ICU with acute respiratory distress.
- Her cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury.
- She is experiencing cardiogenic shock, with physical exam findings suggestive of this condition.
- Her ejection fraction (EF) on the echocardiogram is 20%, indicating reduced heart function.
- She has worsening mitral regurgitation and her cardiac output is around 3.5 per Vigileo monitoring.
- She has VRE bacteremia/Omaya infection and CNS infection.
- She also has transaminitis, likely due to hypotension and peri-intubation.
- She has leukemia, with no peripheral blasts, and her oncology team is considering IT chemotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's condition suggests cardiogenic shock, which can lead to organ failure and decreased perfusion to vital organs.
2. Ischemic Event: The elevated cardiac enzymes and description of anxiety may indicate an ischemic event, such as a heart attack.

   60 year old woman with history of ALL s/p transplant and multiple
   rounds of chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusions, s/p asystolic
   cardiac arrest, now back to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with acute shortness of breath.
   #) Acute respiratory distress: Given the patient
s description of
   anxiety, elevated cardiac enzymes and [**Last Name (un) 6322**] cardiac function it is
   likely that she has had an ischemic event at some point prior to her
   transfer to the ICU.  This transient ischemia likely led to poor
   forward flow and flash pulmonary edema.  She appears to be recovering
   at this point.
   - Attempt PSV with lighter sedation
   - Diurese 1-2L
   #) Cardiogenic shock. Physical exam findings, mixed venous O2 sats, and
   pulmonary edema are suggestive of cardiogenic shock. Echo shows
   worsening mitral regurgitation. EF on echocardiogram today is 20%.  The
   patient
s cardiac output lived around 3.5 overnight per Vigileo
   monitoring.  Lactates and Venous O2 sats improving.
   - Continue dobutamine to promote forward flow, wean throughout the day
   based on patients clinical status
   - Trend mixed venous O2 sats Q6H
   - Follow lactates to assess perfusion Q6H
   #) VRE bacteremia/Omaya infection s/p removal/CNS infection. Continue
   linezolid. No role for repeating lumbar puncture for now.
   #) Transaminitis. Was resolving s/p arrest, now elevated (likely in
   setting of hypotension and ? PEA arrest peri-intubation). Will continue
   to trend, resolving once again
   #) Leukemia. No peripheral blasts. Oncology to consider IT chemotherapy
   if she continues to recover.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of ALL, post-transplant, multiple rounds of chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusions. She experienced an asystolic cardiac arrest and was transferred to the ICU with acute shortness of breath. The patient's cardiac function is poor, and she is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock. Her mixed venous O2 sats are improving, and her cardiac output is around 3.5 as per Vigileo monitoring. She has worsening mitral regurgitation, an ejection fraction of 20%, and pulmonary edema. She has been receiving dobutamine to promote forward flow and is being weaned throughout the day based on her clinical status. 

The patient also has VRE bacteremia/Omaya infection, which is being treated with linezolid. She has transaminitis, which is resolving after her arrest and peri-intubation. She has leukemia, with no peripheral blasts, and oncology is considering IT chemotherapy if she continues to recover. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 77/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for anxiety. Her physical examination reveals diminished radial and digital pulses, wheezes in the respiratory system, poor air movement, and diminished bowel"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of ALL who has undergone a transplant, multiple rounds of chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusions. She experienced an asystolic cardiac arrest and was transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath. The patient's medical conditions include acute respiratory distress, cardiogenic shock, VRE bacteremia/Omaya infection, transaminitis, and leukemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's physical exam findings, mixed venous O2 sats, and pulmonary edema suggest cardiogenic shock. The echo shows worsening mitral regurgitation and an EF of 20%. The patient is currently recovering but still requires dobutamine to promote forward flow. Close monitoring of mixed venous O2 sats and lactates is necessary.
2. VRE bacteremia/Omaya infection: The patient has VRE bacteremia/Omaya infection, which is a serious infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Linezolid has been started to treat the infection. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed tomorrow to determine if treatment for VRE endocarditis is necessary.
3. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminase levels are elevated, likely due to hypotension and possible peri-intubation factors. The trend in transaminase levels will be monitored, and it is expected to resolve again.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of ALL and multiple rounds of chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusions. She presented with acute shortness of breath and was transferred to the ICU. The patient has several medical complications, including acute respiratory distress, cardiogenic shock, VRE bacteremia/Omaya infection, transaminitis, and leukemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress: The patient's description of anxiety and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest an ischemic event, which can lead to poor forward flow and flash pulmonary edema.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: Physical exam findings, mixed venous O2 sats, and pulmonary edema indicate cardiogenic shock. The echocardiogram shows worsening mitral regurgitation and an EF of 20%. The patient's cardiac output is low, and there is a need to continue dobutamine to promote forward flow.
3. VRE Bacteremia/Omaya Infection: The patient had a central line infection with VRE bacteremia. Linezolid is being continued, and further investigation is needed.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes were elevated, likely due to hypotension and peri-intubation. Trending and resolution are expected once again.
5. Leukemia: The patient has a history of leukemia, and oncology should consider IT chemotherapy if she continues to recover.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who experienced an asystolic cardiac arrest and was transferred to the ICU. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress. The patient's medical history includes multiple rounds of chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusions. Her current conditions include hypotension, cardiogenic shock, acute respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, fever of unknown origin, and altered nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates a potential risk for inadequate perfusion to vital organs, which can lead to organ dysfunction.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, as indicated by an ejection fraction of 20% on echocardiogram. This can result in poor forward flow and inadequate tissue perfusion.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. This increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia/Omaya infection. If not properly managed, this can progress to sepsis and septic shock.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may be due to various factors such as sepsis, hypoxia, or medication effects. This puts her at"

   60 year old woman with history of ALL s/p transplant and multiple
   rounds of chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusions, s/p asystolic
   cardiac arrest, intubated for acute shortness of breath associated with
   elevated cardiac enzymes, unclear if etiology was cardiac vs another
   source which then produced demand ischemia.
   #) Acute respiratory distress: Given the patient
s description of
   anxiety, elevated cardiac enzymes and poor cardiac function it is
   likely that she has had an ischemic event at some point prior to her
   transfer to the ICU.  This transient ischemia likely led to poor
   forward flow and flash pulmonary edema.  That said, we source of acute
   resp decompensation poorly understood.
   - SBT and extubation today (post TEE)
   - endotracheal sputum which was discarded will be processed per lab.
   # HYPONATREMIA: Certainly has enough CNS processes to produce SIDH,
   althought this seems to have been precipitated by hypotensive episode
   which brought her to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]. Possibly CNS process that led to both
   (now failing to move left arm
nnew focal deficit).
   - consult renal and start hypotonic saline
   - meds reviewed with pharmacy and preparations have been concentrated
   and switched to NS from D5 where possible
   - hold free water wherever possible
   - holding additonal diuresis as producing good urine with improvement
   in Cardiac output (on dobutamine).
   #) Cardiogenic shock. Physical exam findings, mixed venous O2 sats, and
   pulmonary edema are suggestive of cardiogenic shock. Echo shows
   worsening mitral regurgitation. EF on echocardiogram is 20%.   Lactates
   and Venous O2 sats improving initially improving on dobutamine and
   levo, but have been unable to follow [**1-1**] central line not drawing
   back..  She appears to be recovering at this point with increased UOP
   implying improved forward flow, but still on dobutamine, neo which
   could not beweaned yesterday
   - Although would like to wean pressors, priority today is the weaning
   of vent; will come off pressors as tolerated s/p extubation.
   #) VRE bacteremia/Omaya infection s/p removal/CNS infection. Continue
   linezolid. No role for repeating lumbar puncture for now.
   --TEE today to determine whether pt require treatment course for VRE
   endocarditis which is longer than course for CNS VRE
   -- Pt will eventually require a line holiday although currently
   requiring too many IV meds to pursue
   #) Transaminitis. Was resolving s/p arrest, now elevated (likely in
   setting of hypotension and ? PEA arrest peri-intubation). Will continue
   to trend, resolving once again
   #) Leukemia. No peripheral blasts. Oncology to consider IT chemotherapy
   if she continues to recover.

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a transplant and multiple rounds of chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusions. She experienced an asystolic cardiac arrest and was intubated due to acute shortness of breath associated with elevated cardiac enzymes. The etiology of her cardiac event is unclear, but it could have been caused by an ischemic event or another source that resulted in demand ischemia.

The patient has several medical complications, including acute respiratory distress, hyponatremia (low sodium), cardiogenic shock, cardiac dysrhythmia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, alteration in nutrition, impaired airway protection, altered mental status, fever of unknown origin, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's current medications include dobutamine, norepinephrine, midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), famotidine (Pepcid), and linezolid. She also received atovaquone, micafungin, and acyclovir in the past.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), elevated troponin T, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and altered liver function tests.

   Assessment and Plan
   60F w ALL (s/p txp, s/p chemotherapy, s/p donor lymphocyte infusion),
   currently w prolonged hospitalization since [**2176-2-27**] c/b VRE
   bacteremia w CNS involvement, as well as asystolic cardiac arrest w
   subsequent intubation for acute respiratory distress.
   # Acute respiratory distress: Unclear etiology, but likely from flash
   pulmonary edema [**1-1**] cardiogenic shock from ischemic event given
   elevated cardiac enzymes and poor cardiac function.
   - SBT and extubation today
   - diuresis w lasix beforehand
   # Cardiogenic shock: Physical exam findings, mixed venous O2 sats, and
   pulmonary edema are suggestive of cardiogenic shock. Echo shows
   worsening mitral regurgitation. EF on echocardiogram is 20%.   Lactates
   and Venous O2 sats improving initially improving on dobutamine and
   levo, but have been unable to follow [**1-1**] central line not drawing
   back..  She appears to be recovering at this point with increased UOP
   implying improved forward flow, but still on dobutamine.
   - although would like to wean pressors, priority today is the weaning
   of vent; will come off pressors as tolerated s/p extubation.
   # VRE bacteremia/Omaya infection s/p removal/CNS infection: TEE
   negative for vegetations.
   - continue linezolid (day 1: [**2176-4-15**])
   - no role for repeating lumbar puncture for now.
   - plan for CT head
   # Hyponatremia: Likely [**1-1**] SIADH from CNS vs pulmonary processes. Na
   nadir at 115, now improving.
   - on hypertonic (3%) saline to correct Na @ 0.5 mEq/hr
 check Na q4h,
   goal 124-126 per renal
   - meds reviewed with pharmacy and preparations have been concentrated
   and switched to NS from D5 where possible
   - hold free water wherever possible
   - holding additonal diuresis as producing good urine with improvement
   in cardiac output (on dobutamine).
   # Transaminitis: Likely [**1-1**] poor forward flow, resolving w improved
   blood pressures.
   # ALL: No peripheral blasts. Oncology to consider IT chemotherapy if
   she continues to recover.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has been hospitalized since February 27th. She was admitted for VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement and experienced an asystolic cardiac arrest, leading to intubation for acute respiratory distress. 

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory distress of unclear etiology, likely flash pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock due to an ischemic event. The echocardiogram shows worsening mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 20%. Lactates and mixed venous O2 sats initially improved on dobutamine and levo, but have been unable to follow. The patient is still on dobutamine and has increased urine output, indicating improved forward flow.

The patient also has hyponatremia, likely secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) from CNS or pulmonary processes. Her sodium level has improved from a nadir of 115 to the current level. She is receiving hypertonic saline to correct sodium at a rate of 0.5 mEq/hr.

Other findings include transaminitis, likely due to poor forward flow, but resolving with improved blood pressures. The patient's ALL is currently in remission, with no peripheral blasts. Oncology may consider intrathecal chemotherapy if she continues to recover.

The patient's ICU care includes tube feeds, glycemic control, and various lines and proph"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a transplant, multiple rounds of chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusions.
- She experienced an asystolic cardiac arrest and was intubated for acute shortness of breath associated with elevated cardiac enzymes.
- The patient has multiple medical complications, including hyponatremia likely due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), cardiogenic shock with a decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 20% and worsening mitral regurgitation, bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infection, transaminitis, and leukemia.
- The patient is currently on dobutamine and neomycin, unable to be weaned off the pressors, and remains intubated.
- Further diagnostic tests, such as an MRI and TEE, have been ordered to evaluate for potential causes of SIADH and VRE endocarditis.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her various medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's physical exam findings, mixed venous O2 sats, and pulmonary edema suggest cardiogenic shock. The EF of 20% on echocardiogram indicates significantly reduced heart function. Dobutamine and neomycin have been initiated, but the patient has been unable to wean"

   60 year old woman with history of ALL s/p transplant and multiple
   rounds of chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusions, s/p asystolic
   cardiac arrest, intubated for acute shortness of breath associated with
   elevated cardiac enzymes, unclear if etiology was cardiac vs another
   source which then produced demand ischemia.
   #) Acute respiratory distress: Given the patient
s description of
   anxiety, elevated cardiac enzymes and poor cardiac function it is
   likely that she has had an ischemic event at some point prior to her
   transfer to the ICU.  This transient ischemia likely led to poor
   forward flow and flash pulmonary edema.  That said, we source of acute
   resp decompensation poorly understood.
   - SBT and extubation today (post TEE)
   - endotracheal sputum which was discarded will be processed per lab.
   # HYPONATREMIA: Certainly has enough CNS processes to produce SIDH,
   althought this seems to have been precipitated by hypotensive episode
   which brought her to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]. Possibly CNS process that led to both
   (now failing to move left arm
nnew focal deficit).
   - consult renal and start hypotonic saline
   - meds reviewed with pharmacy and preparations have been concentrated
   and switched to NS from D5 where possible
   - hold free water wherever possible
   - holding additonal diuresis as producing good urine with improvement
   in Cardiac output (on dobutamine).
   #) Cardiogenic shock. Physical exam findings, mixed venous O2 sats, and
   pulmonary edema are suggestive of cardiogenic shock. Echo shows
   worsening mitral regurgitation. EF on echocardiogram is 20%.   Lactates
   and Venous O2 sats improving initially improving on dobutamine and
   levo, but have been unable to follow [**1-1**] central line not drawing
   back..  She appears to be recovering at this point with increased UOP
   implying improved forward flow, but still on dobutamine, neo which
   could not beweaned yesterday
   - Although would like to wean pressors, priority today is the weaning
   of vent; will come off pressors as tolerated s/p extubation.
   #) VRE bacteremia/Omaya infection s/p removal/CNS infection. Continue
   linezolid. No role for repeating lumbar puncture for now.
   --TEE today to determine whether pt require treatment course for VRE
   endocarditis which is longer than course for CNS VRE
   -- Pt will eventually require a line holiday although currently
   requiring too many IV meds to pursue
   #) Transaminitis. Was resolving s/p arrest, now elevated (likely in

2. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which may be caused by SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion). This could be due to CNS processes or a hypotensive episode that led to the development of SIADH.

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has been hospitalized since February 27th due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia with central nervous system involvement, as well as asystolic cardiac arrest and respiratory distress. The patient underwent intubation for acute respiratory distress of unclear etiology, possibly flash pulmonary edema or demand ischemia, sedation, or chemotherapy side effect.

The patient is currently on linezolid for VRE bacteremia and Omaya infection, with previous removal and CNS infection. A CT head has been ordered to evaluate subdural hematoma (SDH) and intracranial processes. The patient is being followed up with ID recommendations.

The patient also has hyponatremia, likely secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) from CNS or pulmonary processes. Sodium levels have improved from a nadir of 115 to the 120s with hypertonic NaCl infusion. The patient is being monitored with Na q8h, continuing fluid restriction, and giving IV meds with NS. Renal recommendations are being followed up.

The patient's ALL is being monitored without peripheral blasts. No chemotherapy is currently being given. The patient is transfused with 2pRBCs due to a low hematocrit (Hct) level of 21%, and lasix is being given in between. A consultation has been made with B"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has been hospitalized since February 27th due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia with central nervous system involvement, as well as cardiac arrest. The patient was intubated for acute respiratory distress and has been on prolonged mechanical ventilation. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory distress of unclear etiology, likely flash pulmonary edema leading to cardiogenic shock. The patient's echocardiogram shows worsening mitral regurgitation with an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient is being treated with dobutamine and levo, and there have been initial improvements in lactates and mixed venous O2 sats. However, the patient's central line is not drawing back, indicating potential complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VRE Bacteremia/Omaya Infection: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with central nervous system involvement. Although a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was negative for vegetations, the patient still requires treatment with linezolid. There is a plan for a CT head to further evaluate the infection.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock with physical exam findings, mixed venous O2 sats, and pulmonary edema suggesting poor cardiac function. The patient's echocardiogram shows worsening mitral regurgitation"

   Assessment and Plan
   60F w ALL (s/p txp, s/p chemotherapy, s/p donor lymphocyte infusion),
   currently w prolonged hospitalization since [**2176-2-27**] c/b VRE
   bacteremia w CNS involvement, as well as asystolic cardiac arrest w
   subsequent intubation for acute respiratory distress, now extubated.
   # Acute respiratory distress: Unclear etiology, but likely from flash
   pulmonary edema [**1-1**] cardiogenic shock from ischemic event given
   elevated cardiac enzymes and poor cardiac function. S/p intubation. Now
   improved, on O2 by NC.
   # Cardiogenic shock: Physical exam findings, mixed venous O2 sats, and
   pulmonary edema are suggestive of cardiogenic shock. Echo shows
   worsening mitral regurgitation. EF on echocardiogram is 20%.   Lactates
   and Venous O2 sats improving initially improving on dobutamine and
   levo, but have been unable to follow [**1-1**] central line not drawing
   back..  She appears to be recovering at this point with increased UOP
   implying improved forward flow, but still on dobutamine.
   - although would like to wean pressors, priority today is the weaning
   of vent; will come off pressors as tolerated s/p extubation.
   # VRE bacteremia/Omaya infection s/p removal/CNS infection: TEE
   negative for vegetations.
   - continue linezolid (day 1: [**2176-4-15**])
   - no role for repeating lumbar puncture for now.
   - CT head today to eval SDH, intracranial processes
   # Hyponatremia: Likely [**1-1**] SIADH from CNS vs pulmonary processes. Na
   nadir at 115, now improved to 125 w hypertonic Na infusion.
   - stopped hypertonic Na infusion in PM
   - meds reviewed with pharmacy and preparations have been concentrated
   and switched to NS from D5 where possible
   - hold free water wherever possible
   - holding additonal diuresis as producing good urine with improvement
   in cardiac output (on dobutamine).
   - continue to monitor Na level
   # Transaminitis: Likely ischemic damage [**1-1**] poor forward flow in the
   setting of cardiogenic shock, resolving w improved blood pressures.
   # ALL: No peripheral blasts.
   - transfuse 2pRBCs given Hct 21
   - d/w BMT
   - consider IT chemotherapy if she continues to recover.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who has been hospitalized for an extended period of time due to VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, as well as a subsequent cardiac arrest. She was intubated for acute respiratory distress but has now been extubated. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Acute respiratory distress: The etiology is unclear, but it is likely due to flash pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock from an ischemic event. The patient has improved and is now on oxygen via nasal cannula.

2. Cardiogenic shock: Physical exam findings, mixed venous O2 saturation levels, and pulmonary edema suggest cardiogenic shock. An echocardiogram shows worsening mitral regurgitation, and the patient's ejection fraction is 20%. Initially, the patient responded well to dobutamine and levo, but there have been difficulties in weaning off central line pressors. The patient appears to be recovering with increased urine output, indicating improved forward flow, but is still on dobutamine.

3. VRE bacteremia/Omaya infection s/p removal/CNS infection: A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was negative for vegetations. The plan is to continue with linezolid and not repeat the lumbar puncture at this time. A CT head has been ordered to evaluate subdural hematoma"
