","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, COPD, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with complaints of shortness of breath, cough with sputum production, and hyperglycemia. The patient has a history of brittle type 1 diabetes and labile blood sugars. Blood sugar levels have been running high this week, likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) and fevers. The patient presented with a blood sugar level of 278 and a gap of 12. He received intravenous (IV) solumedrol, and blood sugar rose to 550 with a gap of 15. Urine was positive for ketones and glucose. Serum acetone is pending. The patient is at high risk for developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and blood sugar not controlled throughout the day.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are significantly elevated, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. He is at high risk for developing DKA. The plan includes IV fluids with normal saline (NS) and 20meq KCl at 200cc/hr to address the free water deficit, followed by switching to D5 1/2 NS with KCl when blood sugar approaches 200. Insulin will be administered per ICU protocol with q1hr blood sugar checks. NPH will be given"

   sugars. BS have been running high this week, likely [**2-4**] URI & fevers.
   Pt presented with BS of 278 & gap of 12. Pt received IV solumedrol & BS
   rose to 550 with Gap of 15.  Urine was positive for ketones & glucose.
   Serum acetone pending.  Pt is high risk for developping DKA and BS not
   controlled all day in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] treat aggressively to prevent widening
   gap acidosis.
   - patinet taking adequate PO, encouage fluid intake
   - electroyltes, including K+ and anion-gap gap, have been normal and
   stable
   - patient has been off insulin gtt for over 12 hrs, FS<300 since then.
   Patient has been seeny by [**Last Name (un) 276**], and SS may need further adjustment as
   patient remains on  steroid taper.  Appreciate there recs
   - diabetic diet as tolerated
   .
   #Cough/SOB: Pt with h/o alpha 1 antitrypsin defic & assoc COPD who p/w
   SOB, cough with sputum production but no infiltrate on CXR.  Denies
   muscle aches, low suspician for flu.  Diff dx includes viral URI,
   bronchitis, atypical PNA. TB unlikely given acute onset of symptoms,
   neg CXR & absence of hemoptysis and other diagnosis more likely. Pt
   received Solumedrol, Levofloxacin & Duonebs in ED. Pt comfortable,
   sating well on RA, [**Month (only) 38**] BS likely due to emphysema/COPD, scattered
   wheezes anteriorly but moving air well. Sputum culture showing strep
   pneumonia, will send blood Cx if spikes.
   - Prednisone 60mg in am, plan for quick taper
   - Albuterol q4hrs & q6hr Ipratroprium nebs
   - continue Advair [**Hospital1 **] & Flonase
   - Guaifenesin/Codeine prn
   - continue Levofloxacin 750mg daily [**3-8**], assume that strep pneumonia
   not resistant, so will f/u cx sensitivities.

   # Hepatitis C: Pt with active Hep C, last VL 29 400 in [**11-10**] followed
   by GI at [**Hospital1 183**], ongoing discussion regarding initiation of interferon
   therapy, currently untreated. Pt c/o RUQ tenderness on exam, negative
   murphys sign.  Mild transaminitis likely due to underlying liver
   disease, no e/o cholestasis.
   - trend LFTs daily & consider RUQ U/S if alk phos/T bili become
   elevated
   .
   # Thrush: Pt with chronic thrush followed by ENT, has white plaques
   scattered over oropharynx on exam and precervical LN.  Given h/o IVDU
   and recurrent thrush, would offer HIV screening to patient

   Assessment and Plan
   40 y/o M with alpha 1 antitrypsin dz, COPD, hepatitis C, cirrhosis and
   DM I admitted with c/o SOB, cough with sputum production &
   hyperglycemia.
   .
   #Hyperglycemia: Pt with history of brittle type I & labile blood
   sugars. BS have been running high this week, likely [**2-4**] URI & fevers.
   Pt presented with BS of 278 & gap of 12. Pt received IV solumedrol & BS
   rose to 550 with Gap of 15.  Urine was positive for ketones & glucose.
   Serum acetone pending.  Pt is high risk for developping DKA and BS not
   controlled all day in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] treat aggressively to prevent widening
   gap acidosis.
   - patinet taking adequate PO, encouage fluid intake
   - electroyltes, including K+ and anion-gap gap, have been normal and
   stable
   - patient has been off insulin gtt for over 12 hrs, FS<300 since then.
   After excessive carb intake overnight w/ hypoglycemia, patient will
   high BS this am.  Will cover this hyperglycemia w/ additional humalog,
   but do not feel that it is necessary to adjust SS at this time.
   Patient has been seeny by [**Last Name (un) 276**], and SS may need further adjustment as
   patient remains on  steroid taper.  Appreciate there recs
   - diabetic diet as tolerated
   .
   #Cough/SOB: Pt with h/o alpha 1 antitrypsin defic & assoc COPD who p/w
   SOB, cough with sputum production but no infiltrate on CXR.  Denies
   muscle aches, low suspician for flu.  Diff dx includes viral URI,
   bronchitis, atypical PNA. TB unlikely given acute onset of symptoms,
   neg CXR & absence of hemoptysis and other diagnosis more likely. Pt
   received Solumedrol, Levofloxacin & Duonebs in ED. Pt comfortable,
   sating well on RA, [**Month (only) 38**] BS likely due to emphysema/COPD, scattered
   wheezes anteriorly but moving air well. Sputum culture showing strep
   pneumonia, will send blood Cx if spikes.
   - Prednisone 20mg in am, plan for quick taper
   - Albuterol q4hrs & q6hr Ipratroprium nebs
   - continue Advair [**Hospital1 **] & Flonase
   - Guaifenesin/Codeine prn
   - continue Levofloxacin 750mg daily [**3-8**], assume that strep pneumonia
   not resistant, so will f/u cx sensitivities.
       - patient also now reports hx of +PPD.  CXR negative for evidence
   of tuberculosis infection.  Patient should have visit of INH treated
   adjust as outpatient by his pulmonologist.
   .
   # Hepatitis C: Pt with active Hep C, last VL 29 400 in [**11-10**] followed
   by GI at [**Hospital1 183**], ongoing discussion regarding initiation of interferon
   therapy, currently untreated. Pt c/o RUQ tenderness on exam, negative
   murphys sign.  Mild transaminitis likely due to underlying liver
   disease, no e/o cholestasis, LFTs stable [**Last Name (un) 1330**].
   - trend LFTs daily & consider RUQ U/S if alk phos/T bili become
   elevated
   .
   # Thrush: Pt with chronic thrush followed by ENT, has white plaques
   scattered over oropharynx on exam and precervical LN.  Given h/o IVDU
   and recurrent thrush, would offer HIV screening to patient.
   - continue nystatin swish and swallow
   - clotrimazole troches QID
   - not currently worsened on steroid course.
   .
   # Depression/Panic disorder: Pt denying any current SI/HI, also denies
   substance abuse since [**7-10**].
   - continue amitriptyline, citalopram, and risperidone
   .
   # Chronic pain: managed by pain clinic
   - continued on home regimen of amitriptyline, citalopram, gabapentin,
   oxycodone, and methadone.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continued home Synthroid 100mcg daily
   .
   # GERD: stable, continue home regimen PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # FEN: Diabetic diet, encourage PO intake, IVF not necessary as AG has
   glosed

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, COPD, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and type I diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with complaints of shortness of breath, cough with sputum production, and hyperglycemia. The patient has a history of brittle type I diabetes and labile blood sugars. His blood glucose levels have been running high this week, likely due to a urinary tract infection (URI) and fevers. Upon presentation, his blood sugar was 278 with a gap of 12. He received IV solumedrol, and his blood sugar rose to 550 with a gap of 15. Urine was positive for ketones and glucose. The patient is at high risk for developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and his blood sugar has not been controlled throughout the day. 

The patient's respiratory symptoms include cough and shortness of breath but no infiltrate on chest X-ray. He has a history of alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency and associated COPD. The sputum culture showed Streptococcus pneumoniae, so he will continue Levofloxacin. He also has a positive PPD test, and his CXR is negative for evidence of tuberculosis infection. 

The patient has active hepatitis C with a last viral load of 294,000 in November. He is being discussed for initiation of interferon therapy but is currently untreated."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, diabetes mellitus type 1, and hepatic cirrhosis. He presented with COPD flare/bronchitis and hyperglycemia in the setting of infection and steroids. The patient had mild diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) upon admission, which improved with intravenous fluids and insulin therapy. His blood sugar control is being managed with a sliding scale and continued home insulin (Lantus). The patient is on a regular diet and will be monitored in the ICU for the next few checks before being stable for transfer to the floor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Uncontrolled blood sugar levels: The patient's blood sugar levels were elevated after breakfast and snack overnight. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of the sliding scale insulin may be necessary to maintain glycemic control.
2. Infection: The patient has an active infection of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is causing bronchitis. Completing the course of levofloxacin is important to prevent further complications.
3. Chronic liver disease: The patient has hepatic cirrhosis, which can lead to complications such as portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and hepatic encephalopathy. Regular monitoring of liver function tests and clinical symptoms is essential.
4. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: This genetic disorder can cause lung and liver damage. Regular monitoring of lung"

Regarding his cough and shortness of breath, the patient has a history of alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency and associated COPD. He presented with symptoms but no infiltrate on chest X-ray. Sputum culture revealed Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is sensitive to levofloxacin. The patient received IV solumedrol and nebs in the ED, leading to symptom improvement. He is currently on a rapid prednisone taper, using RA (respiratory assist), no wheezes, ambulating well, and experiencing minimal dyspnea on exertion. He will continue taking albuterol q4hrs, ipratropium nebs, Advair, Flonase, and levofloxacin.

The patient also has hepatitis C with an active viral load of 29,400 in [**11-10**] followed by GI at"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, diabetes mellitus type 1, and hepatic cirrhosis. He presents with a COPD flare/bronchitis and hyperglycemia in the setting of infection and steroid use.

The patient initially had mild diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with a blood sugar level of 364 mg/dL and a gap of 15, which quickly closed after receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) and insulin. However, blood sugar control remains difficult due to ongoing steroid use. The patient's sugars are escalating after eating, so rechecking and restarting the insulin drip if unable to control the blood sugar levels have been recommended.

Treatment for COPD/bronchitis includes tapering prednisone, continuing Advair, Flonase, and nebulizers. Although no focal infiltrate is present, a course of levofloxacin for bronchitis will be completed. Mild leukocytosis, which may be due to steroids or infection, has normalized.

The patient also experiences mild right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain on examination, which appears chronic. He has a history of hep C and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, with initial stable liver function tests (LFTs) and no evidence of congestive picture to suggest the need for an RUQ ultrasound at this time.

The patient is currently in the ICU due to ongoing problems with hyperglycemia.

24-hour events:
- The patient continues to have difficulty controlling blood sugar levels.
- Vital signs remain relatively stable, with a slight decrease in blood pressure.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,440 mL and an output of 5,350 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 910 mL.
- Respiratory support is not required, but oxygen saturation is at 93%.
- Physical examination reveals mild right upper quadrant tenderness, mild distension, but soft abdomen with no rebound tenderness. There is also evidence of thrush.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and elevated blood glucose levels.
- Imaging and microbiology results are unremarkable.

Assessment and plan:
- The patient has hyperglycemia, which may be due to infection and steroid use. Insulin therapy is being continued to maintain glycemic control.
- Treatment for COPD flare/bronchitis includes tapering prednisone, continuing Advair, Flonase, and nebulizers. Levoflo"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with complaints of shortness of breath, cough with sputum production, and hyperglycemia. The patient has been experiencing erratic and difficult-to-control blood sugar levels despite receiving insulin. He has also shown signs of infection, including a positive urine culture for ketones and glucose, as well as elevated serum acetone levels. The patient has been treated with Solumedrol, insulin gtt, and is currently on sliding scale coverage, Lantus, and a diabetic diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels have been persistently elevated, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. This can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).
2. Infection: The patient's positive urine culture for ketones and glucose suggests a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). Additionally, the presence of white plaques in the oropharynx may indicate oral thrush, especially considering the patient's history of intravenous drug use.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient's history of alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency and COPD increases the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, diabetes mellitus type 1, and hepatic cirrhosis. He is currently experiencing a resolving COPD flare/bronchitis and hyperglycemia in the setting of infection and steroids. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 121/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient is alert and oriented, with normal neurologic examination findings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient has ongoing labile blood sugar levels, which need to be closely monitored and managed with further adjustments to insulin dosing. Stopping prednisone today should help improve glycemic control.

2. Bronchitis: The patient has been diagnosed with bronchitis, and treatment includes stopping prednisone, continuing Advair, Flonase, and MDI's. Although there is no focal infiltrate, completing a course of Levoflox for bronchitis is recommended.

3. RUQ pain: The patient has mild right upper quadrant pain on examination, which appears chronic. Given the patient's history of hep C and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, there is no indication for an RUQ ultrasound at this time. LFT's remain"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo M with alpha-1 anti trypsin def,  dm1,  hep c cirrhosis,
   presents with copd flare/bronchitis and hyperglycemia in setting of
   infection and steroids.
   #hyperglcyemia--continued to have labile BS in setting of steroids.
   Adjuted lantus and ssi.  Stopping prednisone today which should help.
   Monitor for need to lessen scale in setting of discontinuing
       steroids.
   -Continue treatment of copd/bronchitis-- taper prednisone to off today,
   continuing advair, flonase, and mdi's.  Although no focal infiltrate
   given length of symptoms/cough and sputum (+ strep pneumo) would
   complete course of levoflox for bronchitis (day [**5-8**]).  Mild
   leukocytosis on admit (steroids verses infection) remains normal
   --Has mild RUQ pain on exam which appears chronic with hx of hep c and
   alpha 1-- initial stable lft
s and no evidence of congestive picture to
   suggest indication fro RUQ ultrasound.  LFT's essentially stable. Pt
   follows with GI at [**Hospital1 183**].
   --Continuing treatment of thrush with nystatin, may be further
   exacerbated by steroids, with outpt ent f/u.
   Continue psych and pain medications.   Home synthroid.
   Has been walking/oob.
   Evaluate as outpt issue of + ppd and ? treayment of latent tb

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 40-year-old male with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, diabetes mellitus type 1, and hepatic cirrhosis. He presented with a COPD flare/bronchitis and hyperglycemia in the setting of infection and steroids. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 121/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mention of mild right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain on exam.

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 364 mg/dL to 176 mg/dL. White blood cell count is within normal limits, with some variation across different time points. Hematocrit levels are also within normal limits, ranging from 38.2% to 39.6%. Platelet count is slightly low at 181-263 K/uL. Liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated ALT and AST levels, but remain stable throughout the hospital stay. Other lab results, including creatinine, electrolytes, and kidney function tests, are within normal limits.

Imaging and microbiology results are negative. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, and warm skin. Neurological examination shows that the patient"
