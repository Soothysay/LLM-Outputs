   sister does report medication non-compliance for 24 hours prior to
   presentation.  Patient continues to have altered mental status without
   improvement in the setting of Rifaximin and Lactulose.  Ammonia
   continues to trend down as does lactate. Patient still without a bowel
   movement despite Lactulose q 2 hours and episodes of emesis are

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis. He has been hospitalized multiple times, most recently for a right axillary hematoma and right groin bleed, which were treated with blood product resuscitation and DDAVP and aminocaproic acid. The patient presented with altered mental status one day after discharge, and his symptoms have progressed to confusion, not eating, not using the bathroom, and being awake but nonverbal. The patient's sister reports normal mental status prior to admission. 

24-hour events include bladder pressure of 24, not taking any medications for about 24 hours prior to admission, starting ceftriaxone as prophylaxis per hepatology, lactulose every 2 hours titrated to bowel movement, and episodes of emesis after receiving lactulose through NGT.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 140/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and bladder pressure is 24 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,676 mL and total output of 1,035 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,641 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of ETOH cirrhosis, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times recently for right axillary hematoma and right groin bleed. He presented to the hospital with altered mental status one day after discharge, and his symptoms progressed to the point where he was unable to communicate verbally. The patient has a history of not taking his medications for about 24 hours prior to admission. He is currently receiving ceftriaxone as prophylaxis per hepatology, lactulose to titrate bowel movement, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has elevated bladder pressure. His lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and signs of metabolic acidosis. Imaging studies reveal findings consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, and there is also evidence of ascites and gallbladder sludge. Microscopic examination of peritoneal fluid shows no organisms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver cirrhosis. It is characterized by confusion, disorientation, and other neurological symptoms.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. AKI can occur due to various factors, including decreased blood flow to the kidneys (pre-renal et"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times, most recently for altered mental status. The patient's symptoms have progressed from confusion to not being verbal. He also has a history of right axillary hematoma, right groin bleed, and bladder pressure at 24 mmHg.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 140/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has been receiving ceftriaxone as prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. Liver function tests are within normal limits, but there is an elevated level of ammonia. Other lab results include an elevated lactate level and low levels of magnesium and phosphate.

Imaging studies reveal an expanded medulla and ponto-medullary junctions on axial images of the head, which may be artifactual or real. An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant shows ascites and gallbladder sludge.

The patient's assessment and plan include altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment involves continuing lactulose and rifaximin via nasogastric tube. The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, recent prolonged hospitalization for a right axillary hematoma and right groin bleed, presenting with altered mental status. He has been experiencing confusion, not eating, and not using the bathroom. His symptoms have progressed to the point where he is awake but non-verbal. The patient's sister reports that he had a normal mental status the evening before but noticed his condition worsening the next morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status, along with scleral icterus and distended abdomen, is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. This condition occurs due to liver dysfunction and impaired detoxification of ammonia.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine level at admission and signs of intravascular depletion with lactate suggest acute kidney injury. Fluid challenges have been initiated to maintain urine output and improve renal function.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient is still experiencing metabolic acidosis, as indicated by peripheral VBG and lactate levels. Close monitoring is necessary to ensure the acidosis does not worsen.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, with low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient had guaiac"

   # Altered Mental Status: clinical picture is most likely consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy.  There is no clear precipitant; however,
   sister does report medication non-compliance for 24 hours prior to
   presentation.  Patient continues to have altered mental status without
   improvement in the setting of Rifaximin and Lactulose.  Ammonia
   continues to trend down as does lactate. Patient still without a bowel
   movement despite Lactulose q 2 hours and episodes of emesis are
   suggestive of some gastric residual.
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin via NGT
   - consider additional abdominal imaging as some concern whether patient
   is obstructed
   - consider remeasuring bladder pressure as increased intrabdominal
   pressures may be preventing bowel transi
   - consider IR guided therapeutic paracentesis in intra-abdominal
   pressures continue to remain elevated
   - will repeat head CT when stable for concern of central CNS process

   # ARF: Cr 1.9 at admission and patient appears to be intravascularly
   depleted with lactate of 4.3.  Cr and lactate began to clear with fluid
   challenges suggesting pre-renal etiology and patient has maintained
   good urine output throughout admission thus far.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented to the hospital with altered mental status. The patient had a previous hospitalization for a right axillary hematoma and another readmission for a right groin bleed, which was managed with DDAVP and aminocaproic acid. His symptoms include confusion, not eating, not using the bathroom, and eventually becoming awake but non-verbal. The patient has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy and is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin. Other medical conditions include acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, pancytopenia, gastrointestinal bleeding, end-stage liver disease, and fluid-electrolyte imbalance. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can worsen, leading to further alterations in mental status and potential coma.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidney function may deteriorate further, resulting in an increase in creatinine levels and potential fluid overload.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels are low, and there is a risk of developing severe acidosis, which can affect various organ systems.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's blood cell counts may continue to decrease, leading to an increased risk of infections, bleeding, and"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 63M EtOH cirrhosis, recent hospitalization
   for thoracic art embolization c/b sheath bleed, massive resuscitation.
   Yesterday found encephalopathic / nonverbal by sister. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **] notable
   for neg para for SBP, stable RUQ usg, ARF (0.8 to 1.9). NGT placed on
   arrival, ongoing IVF with increased UOP. Remains agitated, now
   stooling, on CTX for ascites. IAP elevated at 28.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.8 BP 140/70 HR 89 RR 22 with sat 100 on RA.
   Frail man, NAD, non-verbal. PERRL, icteric. O/P dry. Coarse BS B. RRR
   s1s2 2/6Sm. Distended / tympanitic, +BS. 3+ edema. Does not follow
   commands, moves x4. Labs notable for WBC 7K, HCT 25, K+ 3.0, Cr 1.1,
   NH3 94, lac 2.7, tox pending. CXR with low volumes.
   Agree with plan to manage altered mental status with lactulose and
   rifaximin for recurrent hepatic encephalopathy. ARF responing to IVF;
   will trend IAP, but will hold off on tap as this mostly appears to be
   gas. AG acidosis transitioned to NAG acidosis with IVF. He remains
   guiac positive - maintain BBS and check [**Hospital1 **]. For ESLD - will continue
   to hold diuretics, continue CTX, liver following. PNBTS, PIV, full, d/w
   sister. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis and recent hospitalizations for right axillary hematoma and right groin bleed. He presented with altered mental status one day after discharge. The patient had been on lactulose and rifaximin but showed no improvement. His symptoms progressed, and he became awake but non-verbal. The sister reported that the patient had normal mental status the evening before but appeared confused the next morning. The patient was not eating and had not used the bathroom. His sister brought him to the hospital.

24-hour events:
- The patient will need 5 days of ceftriaxone for gastrointestinal bleeding on admission.
- He is persistently encephalopathic and on lactulose every 2 hours.
- Hepatology recommendations include a large-volume paracentesis with 6-8 g/liter of albumin support to prevent obstructive uropathy.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data as of [2149-9-26] 06:08 AM:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis. He has been hospitalized multiple times, including for a right axillary hematoma and right groin bleed. The patient presented to the emergency department with altered mental status one day after discharge. His sister reported that he was normal the evening before but appeared confused and was not eating or using the bathroom. By the evening, he was awake but non-verbal.

The patient's medical history includes gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), large volume therapeutic paracentesis with albumin support, and a planned liver transplant in a few weeks. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 144/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is on respiratory support with an SpO2 of 99%.

Physical examination reveals scleral icterus, distended abdomen that is softer than yesterday, and no palpable masses. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and evidence of renal dysfunction with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has been treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and his mental status is improving."

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis. He was recently hospitalized for a hematoma and a groin bleed that required massive blood product resuscitation. Upon discharge, he presented with altered mental status, which has progressed to confusion, not eating, and not using the bathroom. The patient's sister reports that he appeared normal the evening before these symptoms started. Upon admission, he was awake but non-verbal. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 144/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His physical examination reveals scleral icterus, distended abdomen, and no palpable masses. Lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and abnormal coagulation profile. The patient's WBC count has been fluctuating within normal range, hemoglobin is stable, and platelet count is slightly low. Renal function is impaired with an elevated creatinine level. The patient has received lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, IV fluids for volume resuscitation, and ceftriaxone for gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis. The patient is scheduled for a liver transplant in a few weeks. Potential complications that can arise include hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, gastrointestinal bleeding, and"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, presenting with altered mental status. He has had multiple hospitalizations, including one for a right axillary hematoma and another for a right groin bleed, which was managed with DDAVP and aminocaproic acid. His sister reports that he appeared to be normal upon discharge but presented with confusion the next day, not eating, and not using the bathroom. His symptoms progressed, and by the evening, he was awake but not verbal. His sister brought him to the emergency department.

The patient's 24-hour events include the administration of ceftriaxone for gastrointestinal bleeding, therapeutic paracentesis with albumin support, and being called out to the floor. His allergies are codeine, causing a rash. He has received infusions and other ICU medications. There are no changes to his medical and family history. Review of systems remains unchanged except as noted below.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature range of 36.7-37 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 61-103 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 91-153 mmHg, respiratory rate between 16-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,624 mL, with 260 mL by mouth, 1,214 mL intravenous fluids, and a total output of 1,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:  63 yom with pmh significant for alcoholic
   cirrhosis, complicated by ascites, coagulopathy, hepatic
   encephalopathy, presenting with altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: clinical picture is most likely consistent
   with hepatic encephalopathy.  There is no clear precipitant; however,
   sister does report medication non-compliance for 24 hours prior to
   presentation.  Patient continues to have altered mental status without
   improvement in the setting of Rifaximin and Lactulose.  Ammonia
   continues to trend down as does lactate. Patient still without a bowel
   movement despite Lactulose q 2 hours and episodes of emesis are
   suggestive of some gastric residual.
   - continue lactulose and rifaximin via NGT
   - will repeat head CT when stable for concern of central CNS process
   .
   # ARF: Cr 1.9 at admission and patient appears to be intravascularly
   depleted with lactate of 4.3.  Cr and lactate began to clear with fluid
   challenges suggesting pre-renal etiology and patient has maintained
   good urine output throughout admission thus far.
   - continue fluid boluses to maintain UOP > 30 cc/hr
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Still acidodic, but gap closed.  Lactate
   continues to trend down with fluid resucitation
   - continue to monitor with peripheral VBG and lactate
   .
   # Pancytopenia.  patient remains at his baseline.
   .
   # Guaiac positive stools. these were present during last admission and
   attributed to hemorrhoids.  At admission, ED reported BRBPR.  Hct has
   remained stable and NGT to suction revealed no gross blood.
   - will continue to monitor with serial hematocrits
   .
   # ESLD: LFTs at approximate baseline. Patient scheduled for transplant
   w/u at [**Hospital1 **] in few wks.
   - hold spironolactone and furosemide
   - ? dc ceftriaxone since no history of SBP

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 63M EtOH cirrhosis, recent hospitalization
   for thoracic art embolization c/b sheath bleed, massive resuscitation.
   Yesterday found encephalopathic / nonverbal by sister. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **] notable
   for neg para for SBP, stable RUQ usg, ARF (0.8 to 1.9). NGT placed on
   arrival, ongoing IVF with increased UOP. Remains agitated, now
   stooling, on CTX for ascites. IAP elevated at 28.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.8 BP 140/70 HR 89 RR 22 with sat 100 on RA.
   Frail man, NAD, non-verbal. PERRL, icteric. O/P dry. Coarse BS B. RRR
   s1s2 2/6Sm. Distended / tympanitic, +BS. 3+ edema. Does not follow
   commands, moves x4. Labs notable for WBC 7K, HCT 25, K+ 3.0, Cr 1.1,
   NH3 94, lac 2.7, tox pending. CXR with low volumes.
   Agree with plan to manage altered mental status with lactulose and
   rifaximin for recurrent hepatic encephalopathy. ARF responing to IVF;
   will trend IAP, but will hold off on tap as this mostly appears to be
   gas. AG acidosis transitioned to NAG acidosis with IVF. He remains
   guiac positive - maintain BBS and check [**Hospital1 **]. For ESLD - will continue
   to hold diuretics, continue CTX, liver following. PNBTS, PIV, full, d/w
   sister. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, recent hospitalizations for hematoma and groin bleed, presenting with altered mental status. He was initially diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and received ceftriaxone. The patient has been treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy. His renal function is improving with fluid resuscitation, but he remains acidotic. The patient has pancytopenia, positive guaiac stools, and is scheduled for a liver transplant evaluation. He is receiving IV fluids, has replete electrolytes, and is on a high-calorie diet. Prophylaxis measures include boots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis. It is important to continue treating him with lactulose and rifaximin to manage this condition.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient initially presented with an elevated creatinine level of 1.9 and signs of intravascular depletion with lactate of 4.3. AKI may progress if not adequately managed with fluid resuscitation and careful monitoring.
3. Metabolic acidosis"
