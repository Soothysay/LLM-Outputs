   A/P: This is a 62 y/o with multiple prior episodes of altered MS [**3-13**]
   hypoglycemia, CAD, ESRD s/p transplant who presents with unexplained
   acutue Change in Mental status.
   .
   # altered mental status: Ddx includes infection, but no WBC, not septic
   appearing. NO obvious source CXR clear, neg UA. CSF low WBC. Although
   is hypothermic. However pt on imunosupressions, s/p splenectomy so may
   not mount fever.  CVA: ? withdrawing from pain onr R > L, overall exam
   non-focal. ? seizure activity in ED, dilatnin loaded in OSH.
   toxic-medabolic Cr 2.0, LFTs only mildly elevated. BG, no hypoglycemia
   noted.  Ingestion. Klonipin bottle near chair. Elevated Tylenol with
   unclear [**Name2 (NI) 2912**] period. ? Press syndrome, HTN on admission, h/o old
   lacunar infart.
   - mri/mra head/neck to evaluate for acute stroke
   - f/U LP cult, add on hsv pcr given calcification in CT tempoaral lobes
   - flumazenil 0.2 mg IV X  1 without significant change in MS
   - + opiates, no documentation of opiate in OSH or hear.
   - Graduallly clearing MS, Tylenol level, klonipin bottle, positive
   opiates, resolving conduction delays on EKG all pointing toward
   [**Name2 (NI) 2912**]. When extubated should have sitter, psych to eval for SI.
   -EEG in am
   -f/u cultures.
   - Sent cdiff given recent diarrhea.
   -appreciate transplant recs. Concern for lack of clear abd exam getting
   CT abd with PO contrast to screen for abd pathology. MR is top priority
   -NAC for possible tylenol OD. Qualifies of IV regimen based on tylenol
   > 10 with no clear ingestion time. Tylenol level 76 at 2:30 am. Need to
   clearify on normogram if still within hepatotoxic range.
   - review CT head with rads
   -f/u neuro recs
   .
   #Intubated: for airwary protection. RSBI 56. Ween to PS as possible
   after studies complete today
   .
   #DM: history of 4 hypoglycemic episodes leading to ""coma"" according to
   family. BG ok on all hosptial records. Possible having prolonged MS
   change in setting of hypoglycemia. However BG not low on presentation.
   -trend BG, 444 this am
   -conservative SS

- The patient is a 62-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-transplant, coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous CABG surgery, and hypertension.
- The patient presented with an acute change in mental status, which was initially suspected to be due to infection but no fever or elevated white blood cell count was found.
- The patient has a history of hypoglycemic episodes leading to altered mental status, but blood glucose levels were normal at the time of presentation.
- The patient was intubated for airway protection due to a respiratory status indicating impending respiratory failure.
- Imaging studies including an MRI and CT scan of the head were ordered to evaluate for acute stroke or other neurological issues.
- The patient has a history of medication overdose, specifically Klonopin and Tylenol (acetaminophen), and flumazenil was given without significant change in mental status.
- The patient's conduction delays on the EKG have resolved, suggesting possible medication ingestion.
- The patient has a fungal infection in the groin area and an inguinal hernia.
- The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation for airway protection, indicating potential respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and support are necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type II, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-transplant, coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and hypoglycemia episodes. The patient presented with acute change in mental status, for which various differentials were considered. These include infection, toxic-metabolic causes, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), seizure activity, and drug overdose. However, subsequent evaluation did not reveal any clear cause for the altered mental status. The patient has shown gradual improvement in mental status over time. Further investigations are planned, including repeat MRI/MRA of the head and neck, follow-up lumbar puncture cultures, herpes simplex virus (HSV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and additional laboratory tests. The patient's condition is being managed in the intensive care unit (ICU), and appropriate care measures such as nutrition support, glycemic control, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are being implemented. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently on a DNR (do not resuscitate) order confirmed with the wife and healthcare provider."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with multiple prior episodes of altered mental status, hypoglycemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-transplant. He presents with acute change in mental status. The differential diagnosis includes infection, but there are no white blood cells (WBC) on admission, no obvious source of infection on chest X-ray, and negative urine analysis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows low WBC count. The patient is hypothermic but has been on immunosuppression and had a splenectomy, which may prevent him from mounting a fever. Preliminary MRI/MRA results show no obvious cerebrovascular accident (CVA), but there is stenosis of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral arteries. There is also a question of seizure activity in the emergency department. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there is a history of four hypoglycemic episodes leading to ""coma"" according to the family. Possible causes for the altered mental status include ingestion of Klonopin or Tylenol with unclear timing, pressor syndrome, hypertension on admission, and a history of old lacunar infarct. The plan includes further imaging of the head and neck to evaluate for acute stroke, follow-up lumbar puncture cultures, and HSV PCR given calcification in the CT temporal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-transplant, and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with an acute change in mental status and is currently intubated in the ICU.

The patient has a history of hypoglycemic episodes leading to altered mental status, but his blood glucose levels were normal on presentation. Other possible causes for altered mental status include infection, toxic-metabolic causes, and possible pressor syndrome. MRI/MRA of the head and neck showed right internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral artery stenosis but no evidence of acute stroke.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes and creatinine levels. He has an elevated tylenol level, which could be consistent with an overdose. The patient's EKG shows resolving conduction delays and ST elevation in the anterior view right (AVR), suggesting a possible proximal left coronary artery lesion.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure of 169/58 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 56, indicating the need for intubation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of multiple episodes of altered mental status, hypoglycemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-transplant. He presents with acute onset of altered mental status. The patient's condition is complex, involving multiple potential causes including infection, medication overdose, seizures, and cardiovascular issues. He has been intubated for airway protection and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to immunosuppression following the transplant, making him more susceptible to infections. Despite no obvious source of infection, the patient may still be at risk.
2. Medication Overdose: The presence of a Klonopin bottle near the patient's chair and elevated Tylenol levels indicate a possible overdose. Flumazenil was administered without significant change in mental status, suggesting possible opiate intoxication.
3. Seizure Activity: The patient had seizure activity in the emergency department, and there are concerns about ongoing seizure activity.
4. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient has a history of CAD, including previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Pressor syndrome and hypertension on admission may indicate cardiovascular complications.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of four episodes of hypoglycemia leading to ""coma,"" although blood glucose levels were normal on hospital records"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old individual with multiple prior episodes of altered mental status, hypoglycemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) following a transplant. The patient presents with unexplained acute change in mental status. The differential diagnosis includes infection, but no white blood cell count (WBC) is present, and there are no signs of sepsis. The patient has undergone a splenectomy and is on immunosuppressive medications, which may prevent the development of fever.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's altered mental status could be due to various factors such as infection, toxic-medabolic, or metabolic causes. An MRI/MRA of the head/neck is recommended to evaluate for acute stroke. The patient's low WBC count in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indicates a possible central nervous system infection. However, the patient is not displaying signs of sepsis. It is important to follow up on the lumbar puncture (LP) culture and add herpes simplex virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) given the calcification in the CT temporal lobes.

The patient's condition is improving, and there is a possibility of opioid overdose. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, was administered but did not result in significant changes in mental status. The patient should be closely monitored for potential self-injury (SI) when extubated. An EEG"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status and fever. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure (ESRD), and unknown primary cancer. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 186/60 mmHg to 193/80 mmHg, heart rate between 76-93 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode. 

The patient underwent an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed multiple hypoechoic liver lesions concerning for a malignant process. An EEG showed an abnormal routine EEG due to a slow and disorganized background indicative of mild encephalopathy. There were no focal, lateralized, or epileptiform features noted.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, increased creatinine level, elevated troponin T, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. The use of vancomycin and cefepime indicates an attempt to treat a suspected bacterial infection.

2. Malignancy: The presence of multiple hypoechoic liver lesions on the ultrasound raises concern"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including a history of altered mental status, hypoglycemia, coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease post-transplant, and a past surgical history of CABG and splenectomy. The patient was admitted to the ICU for acute change in mental status and is currently intubated due to airway protection. He has been on mechanical ventilation for over 48 hours. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, abnormal coagulation profile, and elevated troponin T levels. Imaging studies reveal multiple hypoattenuating liver masses, a pancreatic mass with extension into the stomach wall, and calcifications in the temporal lobes. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he continues to have fevers and requires further evaluation for possible infections. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Cultures have been drawn, and additional tests are pending.
2. Liver masses: The patient has multiple hypoattenuating liver lesions, which could be indicative of liver metastases or primary liver cancer. Further evaluation with biopsy is needed to determine the nature of these lesions.
3. Pancreatic mass with gastric involvement: The patient has a pancreatic mass extending into the stomach wall. This raises concerns for a malignant process involving both organs. A biopsy will be necessary for confirmation.
4. Tylenol overdose: There is suspicion of a possible acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose based on the presence of a Klonopin bottle near the patient's chair and elevated Tylenol levels. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been initiated for potential overdose.
5. Fungal infection: The patient has a fungal rash in the left groin, and Nystatin cream has been prescribed for local application.
6. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and antihypertensive medications are being adjusted to maintain blood pressure control.
7. End-stage renal disease: The patient has chronic kidney disease and is on immunosuppressive therapy post-transplant. Renal function needs close monitoring.
8. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of CAD and recent evidence of possible myocardial ischemia on EKG.
9. Inguinal hernia: The patient has a pre-existing inguinal hernia, which will require further evaluation and potential repair.
10. Mental status changes: The patient's acute change in mental status requires ongoing assessment and evaluation for possible underlying causes such as infection, metabolic disturbances, or medication effects.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

- The patient presented with unexplained acute change in mental status.
- The patient has been intubated for airway protection due to an inability to protect his own airway.
- He is currently on mechanical ventilation support.
- The patient has been diagnosed with fever, possibly due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and is being treated with antibiotics.
- An ultrasound of the abdomen showed multiple hypoechoic liver lesions, concerning for a malignant process, as well as a pancreatic mass extending into the stomach wall.
- The patient's electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a slow and disorganized background indicative of mild encephalopathy.
- The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 2.0.
- The patient has a history of hypoglycemic episodes and was found with a Klonopin bottle near his chair, which may have contributed to his altered mental status.
- The patient's condition is complicated by multiple comorbidities including CAD, ESRD post-transplant, DM, and hypertension.

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-transplant, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and liver lesions. The patient presented with acute change in mental status and was intubated for airway protection. He was extubated successfully the previous day. The patient has a history of hypoglycemic episodes, and his blood glucose levels have been stable on the current dosing regimen. He is currently on immunosuppressive medications due to his renal transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's acute change in mental status requires further evaluation to determine the cause. Possible causes include infection, toxic-metabolic, or metabolic encephalopathy. Imaging studies such as MRI/MRA of the head/neck should be performed to rule out acute stroke, and a follow-up lumbar puncture (LP) with cultures and herpes simplex virus (HSV) PCR should be done given the calcification in the temporal lobes on CT.

2. Fever: The patient has a new onset fever, and a possible retrocardiac opacity was noted on chest X-ray. This may suggest a hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Appropriate cultures have been drawn, and the patient is being covered with antibiotics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of multiple prior episodes of altered mental status, coronary artery disease (CAD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-transplant, and diabetes mellitus (DM). He presents with unexplained acute change in mental status. The patient is currently intubated in the ICU for airway protection due to a high respiratory rate and low oxygen saturation. He is alert but slow to respond and does not remember the events leading to hospitalization. The patient denies suicidal ideation or pain medication use except for possible Tylenol. He has a large midline abdominal scar and well-healed CABG (coronary artery bypass graft) surgical site. The patient has a fungal rash in the left groin, a tight but distensible right inguinal hernia, and a large scar over the left hip. He has a history of hypoglycemia, previous splenectomy, and is on immunosuppressive therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, blood pressure ranging from 162/64 mmHg to 128/38 mmHg, heart rate between 72-80 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has been receiving various medications, including heparin sodium, pantoprazole, coreg, protonix, bactrim, colace, nystatin, clonidine, prednisone, tacrolimus, imuran, lasix, senna, and chlorhexidine.

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and risk factors such as altered mental status and immunosuppression, there is a risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent and treat this condition, including regular chest physiotherapy, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, and appropriate antibiotic coverage.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as early mobilization, compression stockings, and low molecular weight heparin should be implemented.

3. Fungal infection: The presence of a fungal rash in the left groin indicates a possible fungal infection. Treatment with antifungal medications like nystatin is already initiated, and local care of the affected area should be provided.

4. Inguinal hernia: The patient has a tight but distensible right inguinal hernia. This condition requires ongoing monitoring for signs of incarceration or strangulation. Surgical repair may be necessary in the future.

5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of hypoglycemic episodes leading to altered mental status. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to prevent further hypoglycemic events.

6. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient's renal function is compromised"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, chronic kidney disease (CKD) status post renal transplant, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and a history of severe hypoglycemic episodes. The patient presented with acute mental status changes and was found to have an elevated Tylenol level, which could be related to an overdose. The patient also has a large hypoattenuating liver mass, two smaller lesions, and a soft tissue mass continuous with the pancreatic tail and gastric wall, concerning for pancreatic mass extension into the stomach wall. The patient has been intubated due to airway protection and is currently on CPAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's intubation and being on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is already being covered for VAP with vancomycin and cefepime.
2. Hepatic Complications: The presence of a large hypoattenuating liver mass and smaller lesions raises concerns about potential liver dysfunction or malignancy.
3. Pancreatic Complications: The soft tissue mass continuous with the pancreatic tail and gastric wall suggests the possibility of pancreatic cancer with local invasion into the stomach wall.
4. Renal Complications: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is currently"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-transplant, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and hypertension. The patient presented with acute change in mental status, which could be due to various causes such as infection, toxic/metabolic disturbances, or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient has been experiencing episodes of altered mental status in the past, particularly during hypoglycemic episodes. However, his blood glucose levels were stable at the time of presentation.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, as he was intubated for airway protection but was successfully extubated yesterday. He is now on non-invasive ventilation support.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case. Firstly, there is a concern for a possible central nervous system (CNS) infection, given the presence of fever and altered mental status. The patient's immunocompromised state due to ESRD and immunosuppressive medications increases the risk of infections, including CNS infections like meningitis or encephalitis.

Secondly, the patient's history of multiple hypoglycemic episodes raises concern for possible hypoglycemia-induced encephalopathy. However, his current blood glucose levels are within normal limits.

Thirdly, the patient's cardiac history, including CAD and"
