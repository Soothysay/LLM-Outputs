   Assessment and Plan
   48M with recently diagnosed Large B-Cell Lymphoma currently undergoing
   chemotherapy ([**Hospital1 988**], Day #2) presenting from the BMT service with acute
   respiratory distress.
 HYPOXEMIA
   Patient cambe down to 5L NC overnight, with very little intevervention.
   ABG had shown a large A-a gradient of 300, saturation has been 100% on
   10L NRB. Initial concern was for tamponade/pericardial effusion however
   prelim Echo reports no fluid collection. CXR shows elevated rt
   hemidiaphragm which on prior reports looks unchanged and reported as
   atelectasis. Given the high A-a gradient suspect either V/Q mismatch or
   shunt physiology. Primary concern is possible disease progression, the
   rate in the decline of his health status suggests a rapid course. CXR
   does show changes within the parenchyma. Pt currently on Chemorx which
   was started yesterday. Other ddx include possible P. Embolism.
   Infection currently unlikely given his clinical status, although he is
   febrile it is likely due to his oncological diagnosis given the length
   of his fevers.
   - check finalized Echo report
   - continue on NRB and wean for a goal O2 of >90%
   - sputum cx if present
   .
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   Pt presented with 2 week history of fevers that were attributed to his
   presumed B-cell Lymphoma. Pt still intermittently febrile with a temp
   of 103 prior to his transfer to the unit.  CXR not significant for an
   infectious process.
   - fever control with tylenol prn
   - as above
   .
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   Pt initially presented with B type symptoms and massive
   lymphadenopathy. This combination of signs/symptoms is concerning for
   lymphoma more likely Non-Hogkin type. Patient found to have agressive
   large B cell lymphoma Stage IV as there is supra and infra
   diaphragmatic involment and extra nodal disease.
   - will continue on EPOC
   - IVF hydration and alkalinization of urine
   - pt has PICC line in place
   - will f/u TID tumor lysis [**Hospital1 **]
   - f/u BM and biopsy final results
   .
 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC
   Metabolic Alkalosis likely [**2-21**] sodium bicarb given with chemo agents.
   Will continue to follow. Unfortunately his bicarb was not checked on AM
   [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] add-on and follow-up.
   - f/u bicarb
   .
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
   Pt endorsed abdominal cramping as part of his presentation initially.
   Likely related to his lymphoma given the evidence of mesentaric
   lymphadenopathy. Per pt's wife though his abd appears more distended
   and firm. KUB ordered and shows stool within the colon.
   - will change bowel prep to standing
   - consider adding Lactulose if no BMs by the AM
   ##. Elevated Lactate: Pt still noted to have a high lactate level of
   2.9 which could be related to his chemo therapy. Other considerations
   include decrease oxygenation of peripheral cells from hypoxia, however
   given his oxygen sat and breathing effort this is unlikely.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with recently diagnosed large B-cell lymphoma currently undergoing chemotherapy. He presented to the ICU with acute respiratory distress. The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, lymphoma, and metabolic alkalosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels may indicate impaired gas exchange and oxygen delivery to tissues. Complications such as respiratory failure or further deterioration in lung function could occur if not managed appropriately.
2. Fever of unknown origin: Although the patient's fevers are likely due to his oncological diagnosis, it is important to rule out any potential infections. Infection-related complications like sepsis or septic shock can develop if an underlying infection is not identified and treated promptly.
3. Lymphoma: The patient's aggressive large B-cell lymphoma can lead to various complications. These may include disease progression, organ dysfunction, and treatment-related toxicities. Close monitoring of tumor response and management of chemotherapy-related side effects is necessary.
4. Metabolic alkalosis: This condition may be related to the administration of sodium bicarb during chemotherapy. Monitoring the patient's electrolyte levels and acid-base balance is crucial to prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or seizures.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory status, infection risk, lymphoma progression, and electrolyte balance. It is important"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with recently diagnosed large B-cell lymphoma currently undergoing chemotherapy. The patient presented from the BMT service with acute respiratory distress.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, and lymphoma. The assessment and plan include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation has been 100% on 10L NRB, indicating severe hypoxemia. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a large A-a gradient of 300, suggesting either V/Q mismatch or shunt physiology. Possible causes include disease progression, pulmonary embolism, or atelectasis. The patient is currently on Chemorx, which was started yesterday.

2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had a two-week history of fevers attributed to his presumed B-cell lymphoma. Although the patient still intermittently has fevers, the chest X-ray does not show any significant infectious process. Fever control with Tylenol as needed and continuation of Chemorx are recommended.

3. Lymphoma: The patient initially presented with B-type symptoms and massive lymphadenopathy, indicating a concern for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Further evaluation and follow-up are planned.

4. Metabolic Alkalosis: This condition is likely due to sodium bicarb given with chemotherapy agents. Bicarb levels should be followed up.

   Assessment and Plan
   48M with recently diagnosed Large B-Cell Lymphoma currently undergoing
   chemotherapy ([**Hospital1 988**], Day #2) presenting from the BMT service with acute
   respiratory distress.
 HYPOXEMIA
   ABG had shown a large A-a gradient of 300, saturation has been 100% on
   10L NRB. Initial concern was for tamponade/pericardial effusion however
   prelim Echo reports no fluid collection. CXR shows elevated rt
   hemidiaphragm which is new since admission. Pt also has intractable
   hiccups suggesting diaphragm involvement. Concern is for phrenic nerve
   irritation by tumor/LAD causing diaphragmatic paralysis. PE was
   considered but less likely to have improved spontaneously and LENIs
   neg, no e/o right heart strain on TTE. Possibly etiologies include
   tumor emboli or bronchospasm, now resolved. Resp status stable on NC.
   - on NC,  wean for a goal O2 of >90%
   - monitor CXR for diaphragm changes with tx of lymphoma
   .
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   Pt presented with 2 week history of fevers that were attributed to his
   presumed B-cell Lymphoma. Pt still intermittently febrile with a temp
   of 103 prior to his transfer to the unit.  CXR not significant for an
   infectious process.
   - fever control with tylenol prn
   - as above
   .
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   Pt initially presented with B type symptoms and massive
   lymphadenopathy. This combination of signs/symptoms is concerning for
   lymphoma more likely Non-Hogkin type. Patient found to have agressive
   large B cell lymphoma Stage IV as there is supra and infra
   diaphragmatic involment and extra nodal disease.
   - will continue on EPOC
   - IVF hydration and alkalinization of urine
   - pt has PICC line in place
   - will f/u TID tumor lysis labs
   .
 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC
   Metabolic Alkalosis likely [**2-21**] sodium bicarb given with chemo agents.
   Will continue to follow.
   .
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
   Pt endorsed abdominal cramping as part of his presentation initially.
   Likely related to his lymphoma given the evidence of mesentaric
   lymphadenopathy. Per pt's wife though his abd appears more distended
   and firm. KUB ordered and shows stool within the colon.
   - will change bowel prep to standing
   - consider adding Lactulose

   neg, no e/o right heart strain on TTE.
   - on NC,  wean for a goal O2 of >90%
   - monitor CXR for diaphragm changes with tx of lymphoma
   .
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   Pt presented with 2 week history of fevers that were attributed to his
   presumed B-cell Lymphoma. Pt still intermittently febrile with a temp
   of 103 prior to his transfer to the unit.  CXR not significant for an
   infectious process.
   - fever control with tylenol prn
   - as above
   .
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   Pt initially presented with B type symptoms and massive
   lymphadenopathy. This combination of signs/symptoms is concerning for
   lymphoma more likely Non-Hogkin type. Patient found to have agressive
   large B cell lymphoma Stage IV as there is supra and infra
   diaphragmatic involment and extra nodal disease.
   - will continue on EPOC
   - IVF hydration and alkalinization of urine
   - pt has PICC line in place
   - will f/u TID tumor lysis labs
   .
 ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC
   Metabolic Alkalosis likely [**2-21**] sodium bicarb given with chemo agents.
   Will continue to follow.
   .
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
   Pt endorsed abdominal cramping as part of his presentation initially.
   Likely related to his lymphoma given the evidence of mesentaric
   lymphadenopathy. Per pt's wife though his abd appears more distended
   and firm. KUB ordered and shows stool within the colon.
   - will change bowel prep to standing
   - consider adding Lactulose

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of Large B-Cell Lymphoma currently undergoing chemotherapy. The patient presented from the BMT service with acute respiratory distress and is experiencing hypoxemia. The initial concern was for tamponade/pericardial effusion, but a preliminary echo report showed no fluid collection. The patient also has intractable hiccups suggesting diaphragm involvement, and there is concern for phrenic nerve irritation by the tumor/LAD causing diaphragmatic paralysis. 

The patient presented with a two-week history of fevers that were initially attributed to his presumed B-cell Lymphoma. The fever is still intermittent, and a CXR does not show any significant infectious process. 

The patient was initially presented with B-type symptoms and massive lymphadenopathy, which is concerning for Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The patient has been diagnosed with aggressive large B-cell lymphoma stage IV, with involvement of both supra and infra diaphragmatic regions and extra nodal disease. 

The patient is experiencing metabolic alkalosis likely due to sodium bicarb given with chemotherapy agents. 

Abdominal pain is also mentioned as part of the patient's presentation, likely related to his lymphoma, with evidence of mesenteric lymphadenopathy. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving regular nutrition and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is confirmed"
