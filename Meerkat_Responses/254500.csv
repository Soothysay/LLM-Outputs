   Assessment and Plan
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   77yo gentleman with CAD, HTN, and DM presenting with RUQ pain and
   obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis.
   # RUQ pain / Elevated LFTs:
   Clinical presentation concerning for cholangitis, although he may also
   have pancreatitis (suggested by labs but not by physical exam).  His
   imaging is suggestive of coincident cholecystitis, but he has no
   indication at present for urgent cholecystectomy.  Although biliary
   sludge or gallstones may explain all of the above findings, would also
   consider that he is an elderly gentleman with a smoking history.  It is
   unclear if his age-appropriate cancer screening is up to date.
   - continue unasyn (3g Q6H; Day 1 = [**6-30**]) but would add vancomycin to
   cover enterococcus if he clinically worsens
   - IV fluids for hydration, but will be a little less aggressive with
   boluses given mild crackles on exam (note that pt is on lasix at home,
   although the indication is unclear)
   - morphine IV for pain
   - plan for ERCP in AM
   - monitor clinical exam, VS
   - appreciate surgical input re: possibility of cholecystectomy
 NOTE
   pt wants to move to West Haven [**Hospital **] Hospital for this procedure due to
   proximity to home.
   - follow LFTs, fever curve, mental status
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u final reads of CT
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt noted to be in Afib with RVR on [**2143-7-2**]
   around 1pm, asymptomatic (no chest pain or palpitations).  Pt treated
   with lopressor 5mg x 3, diltiazem 10 mg x2, loaded with PO metoprolol.
   Initial CK and troponin c normal. 12-lead EKG with Afib.
   - review previous echo
   - continue monitoring rate
   - continue metoprolol (previously on medicaton as outpatient)
   # Low grade fevers:
   Likely due to above, but will send UA/UCx and f/u BCx in this
   diabetic.  Also note that he has a cough on exam, although he states
   this is a chronic cough for him, likely from bronchitis due to his long
   smoking history.
   .
   # HTN:
   Pt hypertensive to SBP in 230s in the ED.  Given concern for developing
   cholangitis, will hold back on giving him all of his home meds, but
   will start short-acting ACE I to prevent severe HTN.
   - captopril 12.5mg TID; titrate up as needed for goal BPs < 170/110
   - will hold patient's metoprolol for now so as not to mask tachycardic
   response
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be due to sundowning in this elderly gentleman who has been to
   multiple hospitals and received IV narcotics.  Would also be concerned
   about CO2 retention given smoking history.  Although altered mental
   status can be a marker of worsening cholangitis, he has not shown
   evidence of septic physiology, so this is less likely the culprit.
   Finally, given elevated pressures in ED, ICH is in differential.
   - CT Head to rule out bleed
   - cautious use of narcotic medications
   - check ABG
   - monitor
   .
   # DM:
   Apparently, only on oral meds at home.  Elevated glucose in ED likely
   due to infection, stress reaction.
   -          SSI for now, consider long acting insulin when transfer to
   floor
   -          Consider restarting home meds
   .
   # Mild gap acidosis:
   - lactate was normal in the ED, AG now 14
   - will monitor
   .
   # Nausea:
   Resolved, was likely related to possible cholangitis/pancreatitis.
   However, given that he is a diabetic with a history of coronary
   disease, this can be a sign of cardiac ischemia.  EKG is reassuring.
   - monitor
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   - continue ASA
   - holding beta blocker as above
   - continue ACE inhibitor
   - continue statin
   .
   # PVD:
   - holding cilostazol as non-formulary med
   .
   # Question of thyroid nodule:  Per review of OSH records.
   - will check TFTs
   - follow up as outpatient
   .
   # Tobacco abuse:
   - counsel regarding tobacco cessation
   - offer nicotine patch
   - continue advair for ?? COPD; will not order equivalent of formoterol
   or mom[**Name (NI) **] as he has beta agonist and steroid in advair
   .
   # Likely dyslipidemia:
   Not on problem list from OSH records, but on statin and gemfibrozil.
   -restarted simvastatin, holding gemfibrozil until LFTs improve
   .
   # Likely BPH:  hold terazosin for now in case his BP begins to drop
   from cholangitis, but will monitor
   .
   # Anemia:  current hct 33, baseline hct not known
   - check iron studies, retics, peripheral smear
   - active type and screen given h/o GI bleed
   - stool is guaiac negative
   - monitor
   .

","The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM) presenting with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and obstructive liver function tests (LFTs) concerning for cholangitis. He also has a history of tobacco abuse and is a smoker. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) which revealed a stone in the common bile duct, and sphincterotomy and stent placement were performed. Bile with pus was drained, and the patient will need a repeat ERCP in 6 weeks with stone removal and stent removal. The patient is currently nil per os (NPO) for gallstone pancreatitis and is receiving intravenous fluids (IVF).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 71 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 141/43mmHg to 125/27mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and sitting comfortably in a chair without acute distress.

   Assessment and Plan
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   77yo gentleman with CAD, HTN, and DM presenting with RUQ pain and
   obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis.
   .
   # RUQ pain / Elevated LFTs:
   Clinical presentation concerning for cholangitis, although he may also
   have pancreatitis (suggested by labs but not by physical exam).  His
   imaging is suggestive of coincident cholecystitis, but he has no
   indication at present for urgent cholecystectomy.  Although biliary
   sludge or gallstones may explain all of the above findings, would also
   consider that he is an elderly gentleman with a smoking history.  It is
   unclear if his age-appropriate cancer screening is up to date.
   - continue unasyn (3g Q6H; Day 1 = [**6-30**]) but would add vancomycin to
   cover enterococcus if he clinically worsens
   - IV fluids for hydration, but will be a little less aggressive with
   boluses given mild crackles on exam (note that pt is on lasix at home,
   although the indication is unclear)
   - morphine IV for pain
   - plan for ERCP in AM
   - monitor clinical exam, VS
   - appreciate surgical input re: possibility of cholecystectomy
   - follow LFTs, fever curve, mental status
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u final reads of CT and ultrasound
   .
   # Low grade fevers:
   Likely due to above, but will send UA/UCx and f/u BCx in this
   diabetic.  Also note that he has a cough on exam, although he states
   this is a chronic cough for him, likely from bronchitis due to his long
   smoking history.
   .
   # HTN:
   Pt hypertensive to SBP in 230s in the ED.  Given concern for developing
   cholangitis, will hold back on giving him all of his home meds, but
   will start short-acting ACE I to prevent severe HTN.
   - captopril 12.5mg TID; titrate up as needed for goal BPs < 170/110
   - will hold patient's metoprolol for now so as not to mask tachycardic
   response
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be due to sundowning in this elderly gentleman who has been to
   multiple hospitals and received IV narcotics.  Would also be concerned
   about CO2 retention given smoking history.  Although altered mental
   status can be a marker of worsening cholangitis, he has not shown
   evidence of septic physiology, so this is less likely the culprit.
   Finally, given elevated pressures in ED, ICH is in differential.
   - CT Head to rule out bleed
   - cautious use of narcotic medications
   - check ABG
   - monitor
   .
   # DM:
   Apparently, only on oral meds at home.  Elevated glucose in ED likely
   due to infection, stress reaction.
   - SSI for now, but may need long acting insulin if sugars are poorly
   controlled
   .
   # Mild gap acidosis:
   - lactate was normal in the ED
   - recheck ABG with lactate
   .
   # Nausea:
   Likely related to possible cholangitis/pancreatitis.  However, given
   that he is a diabetic with a history of coronary disease, this can be a
   sign of cardiac ischemia.  EKG is reassuring.
   - check cardiac biomarkers in AM
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   - continue ASA
   - holding beta blocker as above
   - continue ACE inhibitor
   - restarted statin
   .
   # PVD:
   - holding cilostazol as non-formulary med
   .
   # Question of thyroid nodule:  Per review of OSH records.
   - will check TFTs
   .
   # Tobacco abuse:
   - counsel regarding tobacco cessation
   - offer nicotine patch
   - continue advair for ?? COPD; will not order equivalent of formoterol
   or mom[**Name (NI) **] as he has beta agonist and steroid in advair
   .
   # Likely dyslipidemia:
   Not on problem list from OSH records, but on statin and gemfibrozil.
   -restarted simvastatin, holding gemfibrozil until LFTs improve
   .
   # Likely BPH:  hold terazosin for now in case his BP begins to drop
   from cholangitis, but will monitor
   .
   # Anemia:  current hct 33, baseline hct not known

   - will hold patient's metoprolol for now so as not to mask tachycardic
   response
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be due to sundowning in this elderly gentleman who has been to
   multiple hospitals and received IV narcotics.  Would also be concerned
   about CO2 retention given smoking history.  Although altered mental
   status can be a marker of worsening cholangitis, he has not shown
   evidence of septic physiology, so this is less likely the culprit.
   Finally, given elevated pressures in ED, ICH is in differential.
   - CT Head to rule out bleed
   - cautious use of narcotic medications
   - check ABG
   - monitor
   .
   # DM:
   Apparently, only on oral meds at home.  Elevated glucose in ED likely
   due to infection, stress reaction.
   -          SSI for now, consider long acting insulin when transfer to
   floor
   -          Consider restarting home meds

   # Mild gap acidosis:
   - lactate was normal in the ED, AG now 14
   - will monitor
   .
   # Nausea:
   Resolved, was likely related to possible cholangitis/pancreatitis.
   However, given that he is a diabetic with a history of coronary
   disease, this can be a sign of cardiac ischemia.  EKG is reassuring.
   - monitor

   # CAD s/p CABG:
   - continue ASA
   - holding beta blocker as above
   - continue ACE inhibitor
   - continue statin

   - holding cilostazol as non-formulary med
   .
   # Question of thyroid nodule:  Per review of OSH records.
   - will check TFTs
   - follow up as outpatient
   .
   # Tobacco abuse:
   - counsel regarding tobacco cessation
   - offer nicotine patch
   - continue advair for ?? COPD; will not order equivalent of formoterol
   or mom[**Name (NI) **] as he has beta agonist and steroid in advair
   .
   # Likely dyslipidemia:
   Not on problem list from OSH records, but on statin and gemfibrozil.
   -restarted simvastatin, holding gemfibrozil until LFTs improve

   # Likely BPH:  hold terazosin for now in case his BP begins to drop
   from cholangitis, but will monitor
   .
   # Anemia:  current hct 33, baseline hct not known
   - check iron studies, retics, peripheral smear

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and tobacco abuse. He presented with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and obstructive liver function tests (LFTs) concerning for cholangitis. Imaging suggests coincident cholecystitis, but there is no indication for urgent cholecystectomy at present. The patient also has a history of tobacco use, which may have caused chronic bronchitis. He is currently in the ICU due to gallstone pancreatitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy, stent placement, and drainage of bile with pus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholangitis: The patient's clinical presentation is concerning for cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts. If left untreated, it can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis, which can worsen and cause complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's recent hospitalization and use of invasive procedures increase his risk for pneumonia. His cough and potential CO2 retention due to smoking history should be closely monitored.
4. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient has a history of CAD and was on beta-blockers, but they are"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. Based on the provided progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute pulmonary edema: The patient experienced respiratory distress due to acute pulmonary edema, which responded clinically to net diuresis.

2. Cholecystitis and cholangitis: The patient has been diagnosed with cholecystitis and cholangitis, as indicated by the presence of RUQ pain, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests.

3. Sepsis: There are concerns about sepsis due to the patient's fevers, chills, and elevated WBC count. This may be related to the cholecystitis and cholangitis.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated lipase levels suggest the possibility of pancreatitis (chemical). Monitoring is recommended, and the patient is currently NPO until further evaluation is complete.

5. Hypokalemia: The patient has had episodes of hypokalemia, which has been addressed by repletion to K >4.0.

6. Altered mental status: The patient previously experienced altered mental status, which resolved and was likely related to medications (narcotics).

7. Electrolyte imbalances: There may be other electrolyte imbalances, as indicated by the mention of monitoring and repletion of certain electrolytes.

8. Potential need for surgery: The patient wishes to have surgery for the cholecystitis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 86-year-old male admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation (AFib), cholecystitis, and sepsis. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure of 148/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including metoprolol, diltiazem, and antibiotics. Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,370 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), C-reactive protein (CRP), and troponin-T, as well as elevated liver enzymes and lactate levels. The patient's blood cultures were collected on 07/02/2143 at 05:09 PM. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ongoing AFib increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events such as stroke or systemic embolism.
2. Cholecystitis: The patient's cholecystitis can lead to complications such as gallbladder perforation or abscess formation if not managed appropriately.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, elevated CRP, and positive blood cultures suggest ongoing infection, which could progress to severe sepsis or septic shock if not promptly treated.

   Assessment and Plan
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   77yo gentleman with CAD, HTN, and DM presenting with RUQ pain and
   obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis.
   # RUQ pain / Elevated LFTs:
   Clinical presentation concerning for cholangitis, although he may also
   have pancreatitis (suggested by labs but not by physical exam).  His
   imaging is suggestive of coincident cholecystitis, but he has no
   indication at present for urgent cholecystectomy.  Although biliary
   sludge or gallstones may explain all of the above findings, would also
   consider that he is an elderly gentleman with a smoking history.  It is
   unclear if his age-appropriate cancer screening is up to date.
   - continue unasyn (3g Q6H; Day 1 = [**6-30**]) but would add vancomycin to
   cover enterococcus if he clinically worsens
   - IV fluids for hydration, but will be a little less aggressive with
   boluses given mild crackles on exam (note that pt is on lasix at home,
   although the indication is unclear)
   - morphine IV for pain
   - plan for ERCP in AM
   - monitor clinical exam, VS
   - appreciate surgical input re: possibility of cholecystectomy
 NOTE
   pt wants to move to West Haven [**Hospital **] Hospital for this procedure due to
   proximity to home.
   - follow LFTs, fever curve, mental status
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u final reads of CT
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt noted to be in Afib with RVR on [**2143-7-2**]
   around 1pm, asymptomatic (no chest pain or palpitations).  Pt treated
   with lopressor 5mg x 3, diltiazem 10 mg x2, loaded with PO metoprolol.
   Initial CK and troponin c normal. 12-lead EKG with Afib.
   - review previous echo
   - continue monitoring rate
   - continue metoprolol (previously on medicaton as outpatient)
   - check second set of CE
s at 9pm
   # Low grade fevers:
   Likely due to above, but will send UA/UCx and f/u BCx in this
   diabetic.  Also note that he has a cough on exam, although he states
   this is a chronic cough for him, likely from bronchitis due to his long
   smoking history.
   .
   # HTN:
   Pt hypertensive to SBP in 230s in the ED.  Given concern for developing
   cholangitis, will hold back on giving him all of his home meds, but
   will start short-acting ACE I to prevent severe HTN.
   - captopril 12.5mg TID; titrate up as needed for goal BPs < 170/110
   - was holding metoprolol to avoid masking tachycardia, however, due to
   Afib metoprolol started.
   .
   # Altered mental status:
   Pt. no longer altered.  [**Month (only) 51**] be due to sundowning in this elderly
   gentleman who has been to multiple hospitals and received IV
   narcotics.  Would also be concerned about CO2 retention given smoking
   history.  Although altered mental status can be a marker of worsening
   cholangitis, he has not shown evidence of septic physiology, so this is
   less likely the culprit.  Finally, given elevated pressures in ED, ICH
   is in differential.
   - cautious use of narcotic medications
   - monitor
   .
   # DM:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and smoking. He presented to the hospital with RUQ pain and obstructive liver function tests (LFTs) concerning for cholangitis. The patient also has evidence of gallstones and coincident cholecystitis on imaging. His initial troponin T levels were normal, but there was a mild elevation on the second day.

The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and has been treated with diltiazem and metoprolol. His blood pressure has been high, ranging in the 230s, so an ACE inhibitor has been started to prevent severe HTN.

The patient's mental status was initially altered, but has since resolved. It was initially suspected to be due to sundowning or CO2 retention, but further evaluation did not reveal any signs of worsening cholangitis or intracranial hemorrhage.

The patient's glucose levels were elevated in the emergency department, likely due to infection and stress reaction. He is currently on oral diabetic medications, but may require insulin during his hospital stay.

There is a mild gap acidosis with an anion gap of 14. This will be monitored closely. The patient's nausea has resolved, but he has a history of coronary artery disease and could be at risk for cardiac ischemia."

   Assessment and Plan
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   77yo gentleman with CAD, HTN, and DM presenting with RUQ pain and
   obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis.
   # RUQ pain / Elevated LFTs:
   Clinical presentation concerning for cholangitis vs pancreatitis
   (suggested by labs but not by physical exam).  Imaging was consistent
   with coincident cholecystitis, but he had no indication at present for
   urgent cholecystectomy.  s/p ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent
   placement (see ERCP report for further results).  He is clinically
   improved and is experiencing no further abdominal discomfort.
   - continue unasyn (3g Q6H; Day 1 = [**6-30**]) but would add vancomycin to
   cover enterococcus if he clinically worsens
   - appreciate surgical input re: possibility of cholecystectomy who
   agree with plan to transfer patient as per request to West Haven VA
   - follow LFTs, fever curve, mental status
   - f/u final reads of CT
   -pt will need repeat ERCP in 6 weeks to pull billiary stent
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt noted to be in Afib with RVR on [**2143-7-2**]
   around 1pm, asymptomatic (no chest pain or palpitations).  Pt treated
   with lopressor 5mg x 3, diltiazem 10 mg x2, loaded with PO metoprolol.
   CK normal with troponin leak. 12-lead EKG with Afib.  Patient developed
   hypotension with increase dose metoprolol to 75mg PO TID
   - etiology: unclear whether new onset vs. paroxysmal Afib (enlarged
   LAE); will check VA records
   - continue monitoring rate
   - start digoxin for better rate control, monitor and replete K as
   needed
   -contraindication to anticoagulation as patient has had hx of recent GI
   bleed [**2-11**] to gastric ulcer
   # Low grade fevers:
   Likely due to above, but will send UA/UCx and f/u BCx in this
   diabetic.  Also note that he has a cough on exam, although he states
   this is a chronic cough for him, likely from bronchitis due to his long
   smoking history.
   .
   #  labile BP: HTN with transint episode of hypotension responsive to
   fluid bolus
   -initially received captopril [**2-11**] HTN in ER
   - hx. of HTN on home metoprolol- increased dose to 50mg TID for blood
   pressure and rate control

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM) presenting with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and obstructive liver function tests (LFTs) concerning for cholangitis. He underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and stent placement, which resulted in clinical improvement. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), for which he is being treated with beta-blockers and diltiazem. He has a history of recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, so anticoagulation is contraindicated. The patient has labile blood pressure, poorly controlled DM, and a history of CABG surgery. He is also a smoker with chronic cough and has a thyroid nodule that needs further evaluation. The patient has been counseled regarding tobacco cessation and offered nicotine patches. He is being advanced to a normal diet and his glycemic control is being managed with glargine and sliding scale insulin (SSI). He is on prophylactic heparin for DVT, omeprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and is being monitored for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   Cholecycstitis, cholangitits.
   SEPSIS -- fevers, chills, elevated WBC --> concern for cholangitis,
   cholescystitis.  Empirical Unasyn.  Clinically improved.
   A-FIB -- [**Last Name **] problem.  Dilated [**Name2 (NI) **] by echo, mild AS.  Control rate with
   lopressor.  [**Month (only) 51**] require Digoxin if b-blocker not effective.  Consider
   Cardiiology consultation.  Consider anticoagulation.
   CAD
 likely accounts for troponin leak (likely demand ischemia from
   flash pulmonary eema), although cannot exclude primary ischemia.  Will
   require cardiac clearance prior to surgery.
   RESP DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema.  Clinically
   resolved.  Continue usual meds including lasix.
   RUQ PAIN -- attributed to cholecystitits, choledocholithiasis --> may
   have passed stone based on clinical symptoms and LFTs.  General Surgery
   evaluated and following.   ERCP team to evaluate.  Pt. indicates he
   wishes to have surgery in VAH.
   FLUIDS --  replete.  Monitor I/O.  Desire net negative fluid balance.
   ELEVATED LFTs -- replete to K >4.0.
   ELEVATED LIPASE -- evidence for pancreatits (chemical).  Improved.
   Advance diet as approved per Surgery.
   NIDDM
 maintain control, maintain <150.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- resolved.  Likely related to medications

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient developed atrial fibrillation last night and required a beta-blocker for rate control, but did not respond to diltiazem. The patient also experienced transient hypotension this morning, which resolved with an IV fluid bolus. The patient has been on multiple medications including metoprolol, diltiazem, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/51 to 170/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, and their WBC count is within normal limits. The patient has elevated levels of AST, ALT, bilirubin, amylase, lipase, lactic acid, and troponin T. The patient's electrolytes are imbalanced, with low potassium and calcium levels. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, atrial fibrillation, cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, acute pulmonary edema, pancreatitis, and an altered mental status. The patient's medical history includes cholecystitis, cholangitis, NIDDM, thyroid nodule, and altered mental status. The patient's pain in the right upper quadrant is attributed to cholecystitis and choledocholith"

   Assessment and Plan
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   77yo gentleman with CAD, HTN, and DM presenting with RUQ pain and
   obstructive LFTs concerning for cholangitis.
   # RUQ pain / Elevated LFTs:
   Clinical presentation concerning for cholangitis vs pancreatitis
   (suggested by labs but not by physical exam).  Imaging was consistent
   with coincident cholecystitis, but he had no indication at present for
   urgent cholecystectomy.  s/p ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent
   placement (see ERCP report for further results).  He is clinically
   improved and is experiencing no further abdominal discomfort.
   - continue unasyn (3g Q6H; Day 1 = [**6-30**]) but would add vancomycin to
   cover enterococcus if he clinically worsens
   - appreciate surgical input re: possibility of cholecystectomy who
   agree with plan to transfer patient as per request to West Haven VA
   - follow LFTs, fever curve, mental status
   - f/u final reads of CT
   -pt will need repeat ERCP in 6 weeks to pull billiary stent
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt noted to be in Afib with RVR on [**2143-7-2**]
   around 1pm, asymptomatic (no chest pain or palpitations).  Pt treated
   with lopressor 5mg x 3, diltiazem 10 mg x2, loaded with PO metoprolol.
   CK normal with troponin leak. 12-lead EKG with Afib.  Patient developed
   hypotension with increase dose metoprolol to 75mg PO TID
   - etiology: unclear whether new onset vs. paroxysmal Afib (enlarged
   LAE); will check VA records
   - continue monitoring rate
   - start digoxin for better rate control, monitor and replete K as
   needed
   -contraindication to anticoagulation as patient has had hx of recent GI
   bleed [**2-11**] to gastric ulcer
   # Low grade fevers:
   Likely due to above, but will send UA/UCx and f/u BCx in this
   diabetic.  Also note that he has a cough on exam, although he states
   this is a chronic cough for him, likely from bronchitis due to his long
   smoking history.
   .
   #  labile BP: HTN with transint episode of hypotension responsive to
   fluid bolus
   -initially received captopril [**2-11**] HTN in ER
   - hx. of HTN on home metoprolol- increased dose to 50mg TID for blood
   pressure and rate control
   ..
   # DM: poor control on SSI
   - patient
s outpatient medication held on hospitalization
   - added glargine 5 Units daily, adjust as needed to maintain euglycemia
   # CAD s/p CABG:
   - continue ASA, statin
   - ACE inhibitor on hold for now
   .
   # PVD: holding cilostazol as non-formulary med
   .
   # Question of thyroid nodule:  Per review of OSH records.
   - will check TFTs
   - follow up as outpatient
   .
   # Tobacco abuse:
   - counsel regarding tobacco cessation
   - offer nicotine patch
   - continue advair for ?? COPD; will not order equivalent of formoterol
   or mom[**Name (NI) **] as he has beta agonist and steroid in advair
   .
   # Likely dyslipidemia:
   Not on problem list from OSH records, but on statin and gemfibrozil.
   -restarted simvastatin, holding gemfibrozil until LFTs improve
   .
   # Likely BPH:  hold terazosin for now in case his BP begins to drop
   from cholangitis, but will monitor
   .
   # Anemia:  current hct 33, baseline hct not known
   - check iron studies, retics, peripheral smear
   - active type and screen given h/o GI bleed
   - stool is guaiac negative
   - monitor
   .
   # h/o Prostate CA:  resolved, per pt

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and obstructive liver function tests (LFTs) concerning for cholangitis. He underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and stent placement, which resulted in clinical improvement and no further abdominal discomfort. He is currently being treated with antibiotics for cholangitis and will have a follow-up ERCP in 6 weeks to remove the biliary stent.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was treated with metoprolol, diltiazem, and digoxin for rate control. His cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, but he has a history of recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, which is a contraindication for anticoagulation.

He has low-grade fevers likely due to cholangitis, but further investigations are needed. His blood pressure has been labile, with transient episodes of hypertension and hypotension responsive to fluid boluses. His diabetes is poorly controlled, and he requires adjustment of his insulin dosage.

The patient has a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and is currently on aspirin and a statin"

   Assessment and Plan
   Cholecycstitis, cholangitits.  A-fib.
   SEPSIS -- Cholangitis, cholescystitis.  Empirical Unasyn.  Clinically
   improved.
   A-FIB -- [**Last Name **] problem.  Dilated [**Name2 (NI) **] by echo, mild AS.  Control rate with
   lopressor.  Consider anticoagulation.
   CAD
 likely accounts for troponin leak (likely demand ischemia from
   flash pulmonary eema), although cannot exclude primary ischemia.  Will
   require cardiac clearance prior to surgery.
   DELERIUM -- ICU psychosis vs. EtOH.  Good response to haldol and
   ativan.  Monitor.
   RESP DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema.  Clinically
   resolved.  Continue usual meds including lasix.
   RUQ PAIN -- attributed to cholecystitits, choledocholithiasis --> may
   have passed stone based on clinical symptoms and LFTs.  General Surgery
   evaluated and following.    Pt. indicates he wishes to have surgery in
   VAH.
   FLUIDS --  replete.  Monitor I/O.  Desire net negative fluid balance.
   ELEVATED LFTs -- replete to K >4.0.
   ELEVATED LIPASE -- evidence for pancreatits (chemical).  Improved.
   Advance diet as approved per Surgery.
   NIDDM
 maintain control, maintain <150.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- resolved.  Likely related to medications
   (narcotics)
   THYROID NODULE
 needs outpatient follow up.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K >4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.
