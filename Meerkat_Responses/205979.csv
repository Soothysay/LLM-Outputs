","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), recent vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She presents with fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels. Her WBC count is 4.0 with an 8% bandemia. She has had multiple infections recently due to immunosuppression. The differential includes line infection, pneumonia, CMV viremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff).

Plan:
- Continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with meropenem and daptomycin.
- Start PO vancomycin due to bandemia.
- Consider adding ciprofloxacin or gentamicin for double gram-negative coverage pending hemodynamic stability.
- IV fluid for goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65.
- Follow up CMV viral load.
- Obtain blood cultures, send urine, line, and stool cultures.
- Consider removing the line pending culture data.
- Consider infectious disease (ID) consult in the morning based on preliminary antibiotic choices.
- Continue midodrine per patient's home regimen for known hypotension.

Pancytopenia:
- Trend CBC.
- Neutropenic precautions.
- Hold line"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a complex medical history including ESRD on HD, recent VRE bacteremia, CMV viremia, and SLE. She presents with fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels, indicating sepsis without organ dysfunction. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing recurrent infections due to immunosuppression. There is a concern for line infection, pneumonia, CMV viremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient is showing signs of pancytopenia, which includes low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and low platelet count. The cause could be medication-related, such as linezolid and valcyte, or secondary to infection. Neutropenic precautions have been implemented.

3. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia with a baseline hemoglobin level of 27-30. There is no active source of bleeding, but the anemia may be due to renal failure, possible lupus involvement, or other factors. Erythropoietin (EPO) will be continued during hemodialysis.

4. Hypergly"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), recent VRE bacteremia, CMV viremia, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She presents with fever and hypotension, indicating sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient also has chronic anemia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the upper extremity, renal failure, and SLE.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels suggests sepsis. The differential diagnosis includes line infection, pneumonia, CMV viremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, including meropenem for gram-negative coverage, daptomycin for gram-positive coverage, and vancomycin due to bandemia. Additionally, consideration is being given to adding ciprofloxacin or gentamicin for double gram-negative coverage pending hemodynamic stability.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which is a decrease in all blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). The possible causes include medications such as linezolid and valcyte, as well as secondary infection. Neutropenic precautions have been implemented"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a complex medical history including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), recent bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, and chronic immunosuppression. The patient was initially admitted for possible VRE sepsis and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR).

24-hour events:
- The patient developed AFib with a rapid rate overnight, which was controlled with digoxin.
- Vancomycin and meropenem were stopped due to lack of clear indication.
- Metoprolol was changed to digoxin per recommendation of renal support to better maintain blood pressure.
- The patient's allergies include Bactrim DS, Cellcept, and Zosyn.
- The last doses of antibiotics were given at 06:29 AM on 01/12/2150 for vancomycin and 12:28 PM on 01/12/2150 for meropenem.

Infusions and medications:
- The patient is receiving other ICU medications, which are not specified in the note.
- Other medications include digoxin PO x1, daptomycin, midodrine, prednisone, and dapsone prophylaxis.

   fibrillation, chronically anticoagulated with coumadin. INR has been
   therapeutic since [**1-5**], previously subtherapeutic.  Given excellent
   mentation, currently improving hemodynamic parameters including
   decreasing heart rate, no indication for urgent cardioversion now and
   has not been anticoagulated for long enough anyway.  Has received a
   total 10 mg IV metoprolol and 20 mg IV diltiazem, 2.5L IVF as well as
   10 mg midodrine.  Previously on no rate control agents. Differential
   for cause of episode of RVR includes stress of recent infection, volume
   depletion.  Patient flipped back into NSR in the 70s on arrival to the
   ICU.

   Plans;
   1.       Afib- management discussed with renal team again. BP remains
   the major factor barring our ability to achieve appropriate rate
   control, due to concerns that beta-blockers will leave no BP room for
   effective diuresis. Pt received digoxin load earlier today, remains
   mildly tachycardic with HR
s hovering 100-120
s. [**Month (only) 11**] need to
   re-consider beta blocker at lower dose, vs. amiodarone
   2.       Fvers: afebrile, on daptomycin. Gancyclovir stopped upon
   hospital admission due to concerns abt this inducing pancytopenia. Will
   talk to ID team regarding whether alternate prophylaxis warranted
   3.       SLE: on prednisone chronically

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a failed kidney transplant on hemodialysis (HD). She was admitted to the ICU for rapid atrial fibrillation (AF) with hypotension. The patient initially converted to sinus rhythm but reverted back to AF after HD. She has been febrile during this hospitalization and had a previous hospitalization for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia.

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient remains in AF despite receiving digoxin. There are concerns about using beta-blockers due to the potential for hypotension, which would prevent effective diuresis. A lower dose of beta-blocker or amiodarone may be reconsidered.
2. Fever: The patient is currently afebrile but has had recurrent fevers during this hospitalization. She is on daptomycin, and gancyclovir was stopped due to concerns about inducing pancytopenia. Further discussion with the ID team is needed regarding prophylaxis.
3. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE): The patient continues on prednisone chronically.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient is on HD, and the renal team is following up.
