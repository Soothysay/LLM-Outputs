   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   34W fervers, HA, ST starting late [**Month (only) **]. Presented to ER early [**Month (only) **]
   and discharged. Symptoms worsened and testing for flu which was
   positive. Again presented to ER [**9-13**] and admitted to ICU for resp
   distress. Tested again pos for flu and mycoplamsa IgM. CT-A showed
   bilateral basal consolidation, small effusions and splenomegaly.
   Treated with vanco and zosyn then vanco and levoflox.
   She developed a transaminitis and had a MRCP. This showed
   hepatosplenomegaly and evidence of postal hypertension. Hepatitis was
   thought to be due to mycoplamsa. Also pancytopenia presumably due to
   sepsis.
   Currently, complains of dry throat, worsening abdominal pain and
   distension, worsening dyspnea.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old female presenting with respiratory distress. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times, initially for flu symptoms that were positive on testing. The patient also tested positive for Mycoplasma IgM. A CT-A showed bilateral basal consolidation, small effusions, and splenomegaly. She was treated with vancomycin and zosyn, then switched to vancomycin and levofloxacin.

The patient developed transaminitis and underwent an MRCP, which revealed hepatosplenomegaly and evidence of portal hypertension. Hepatitis was thought to be due to Mycoplasma. The patient also experienced pancytopenia presumably due to sepsis.

Currently, the patient complains of a dry throat, worsening abdominal pain and distension, and worsening dyspnea. She has allergies to sulfa, unknown, and Compazine. The last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 09/18/2194 at 10:27 PM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 126/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 43 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on nasal cannula oxygen and has an ABG result of 7.44/29/64/18/-2.

Physical examination findings include a distended and tender abdomen, jaundice, and skin not assessed. Neurologic examination was also not assessed.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, platelet count of 197 K/uL, sodium of 131 mEq/L, potassium of 4.9 mEq/L, glucose of 38 mg/dL, and liver enzymes (ALT/AST) elevated. Other lab results indicate prolonged prothrombin time (PTT) and elevated lactate levels.

Radiology findings include a chest X-ray showing low lung volumes and a chest CT showing patchy ground-glass opacities (GOOs), bilateral consolidation, and small effusions.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory distress related to infiltrates (likely combination of flu and superinfection), small effusions, abdominal distension, liver dysfunction, and Crohn's disease with immunosuppression. The plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, considering bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), completing Tamiflu, following liver function tests, renal function, and glucose levels. Lactulose will be started, and the patient's abdomen will be imaged to decide on therapeutic paracentesis. Imuran and pentasa will be held.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's worsening dyspnea and respiratory distress may indicate the possibility of worsening respiratory failure or development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Abdominal Complications: The patient's abdominal distension and tenderness could suggest the development of abdominal compartment syndrome or worsening of her underlying Crohn's disease.
3. Hepatic Complications: The elevated liver enzymes and jaundice may indicate ongoing liver dysfunction, potentially leading to hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure.
4. Infectious Complications: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient may develop antibiotic resistance or a new infection due to immunosuppression from Crohn"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 34-year-old female who presented to the emergency room with respiratory distress, fever, and headache. She was previously diagnosed with Crohn's disease and is on immunosuppressive therapy including imuran and pentasa. Upon admission, she tested positive for influenza and mycoplasma IgM antibodies, indicating a possible mycoplasma pneumonia infection. CT scan revealed bilateral basal consolidation, small effusions, and splenomegaly. 

The patient was initially treated with vancomycin and zosyn, then switched to vancomycin and levofloxacin. However, she developed transaminitis and elevated bilirubin levels, leading to the suspicion of hepatitis caused by mycoplasma. MRCP showed hepatosplenomegaly and evidence of portal hypertension. 

Her condition worsened, and she developed pancytopenia, likely due to sepsis in the setting of immunosuppression from imuran. She complains of a dry throat, worsening abdominal pain and distension, and worsening dyspnea. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/73 to 115/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 43 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease on immunosuppression, presenting with respiratory distress and signs of sepsis. She has bilateral dense infiltrates on CT chest and rising liver enzymes with jaundice. The patient also has ascites, bowel wall edema, and a small pericardial effusion. She is currently on noninvasive ventilation, and her vital signs show tachycardia and tachypnea. The patient's mental status is intact, but she exhibits asterixis. Laboratory results indicate acute liver failure with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral medications. She is being monitored closely with frequent lab tests and imaging studies. The patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and bilateral dense infiltrates on CT chest suggest a possible pneumonia. This needs to be treated promptly to prevent further deterioration.
2. Acute Liver Failure: The rising liver enzymes and jaundice indicate acute liver failure. The cause could be due to various factors such as shock liver, viral hepatitis, acetaminophen toxicity, autoimmune hepatitis, or mycoplasma infection. Close monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation profile is necessary.
3. Sepsis: The patient meets criteria for sepsis with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old female with Crohn's disease, currently hospitalized for respiratory distress. She has a history of flu and mycoplasma infection. Her vital signs include tachycardia, tachypnea, and slightly elevated blood pressure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness, no rebound or guarding, presence of ascites, slight jaundice, and asterixis with arms outstretched. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, high LDH levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient meets SIRS criteria and is likely experiencing sepsis with multiple potential sources including chest and abdominal infections. There are concerns about acute liver failure, anemia, and the need for a transjugular biopsy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen if she develops further lung infections or if her current infection does not respond to treatment.
2. Sepsis: The patient's SIRS criteria suggest ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis if not promptly treated and managed.
3. Acute Liver Failure: The rising liver enzymes and bilirubin levels indicate possible liver dysfunction, which could progress to acute liver failure if not addressed.
4. Bleeding: The patient's coagulation profile shows prolonged PT/INR and PTT, indicating a"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is suffering from fulminant liver failure. The patient has been taking 8 tablets of Tylenol per day for 8 days before presenting to the hospital. The note mentions that the patient has developed bilateral consolidation at the bases of the lungs, as well as evidence of colitis on CT and gallbladder edema. 

The patient is currently receiving NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation) and is tolerating it well. The patient's allergies include sulfa (sulfonamides) and Compazine (prochlorperazine edisylate), causing itching. 

The last doses of antibiotics given were Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 9/18/2194 at 10:27 PM, Metronidazole on 9/19/2194 at 2:54 AM, Acyclovir on 9/19/2194 at 4:05 AM, and Vancomycin on 9/19/2194 at 9:25 AM. 

The patient is receiving various medications including Lorazepam (Ativan), Dextrose 50%, colace, lactulose, vancomycin, and azithromycin. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate (HR) of 124 bpm with a range of 112"

 HEPATIC FAILURE, FULMINANT: with asterixis, hypoglycemia,LFTs rising,
   but lactate trending down.
   Etiology unclear, HSV vs hepatosplenic lymphoma, CT with no evidence of
   [**Male First Name (un) 2717**] chiari, possibly some superimposed tyelnol toxicity but now too far
   out to treat with NAC, other viral serologies pending, autoimmune
   hepatitis serologies. ID consult pending. On Acylcovir. Close
   monitoring of mental status, hypoglycemia, LFTs, bili and coags q6,
   monitor urine output, and lactate, and VBG. Consulting heme for ?
   hepatosplenic lymphoma.
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER:
   plan for elective intubation, prior to IR procedure. Continue broad
   spectrum antibiotics with vanco/zosyn/flagyl. Holding all
   immunesuppressants.
 Fever: pancultured on broadspectrum antiobitics
 Pancytopenia: continue to trend, ? related to viral process, vs
   lymphoma, vs immuran effect vs other.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Her resp status remained severe overnight though she was adequately
   oxygenating and ventilating with the help of BiPAP. The decision was
   made to perform a liver biopsy therefore she was intubated for the
   procedure. She is undergoing the biopsy currently. Her liver function
   has worsened.
   Exam: T103, HR 119, 90/50, 99% AC 12/550/0.8/5
   Intubated, sedated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU includes:

1. Fulminant liver failure: The patient has been taking 8 tabs of Tylenol per day for 8 days before presentation. This excessive intake may have contributed to the liver failure, but other causes such as viral hepatitis or hepatosplenic lymphoma are also being considered.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral consolidation at the bases of the lungs, indicating pneumonia. Antibiotics have been started, but the patient's respiratory status remained severe overnight, necessitating intubation for a liver biopsy procedure.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient is experiencing low levels of all blood cell types (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets). The cause is uncertain, with possibilities including viral infection, lymphoma, or side effects of immunosuppressant drugs.

4. Hepatosplenic lymphoma: This is a potential underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, and further investigation is needed.

5. Other complications: The patient also has gallbladder edema, colitis, and evidence of ascites (abdominal distension). These conditions require close monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to severe liver dysfunction, the patient may develop altered mental status and confusion.

2. Hepatorenal syndrome:"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - ID consulted and added on VZV, adenovirus PCR, urine legionella,
   rimantidine 100mg QD, stool enterovirus these were ordered. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   is working on getting mycoplasma PCR. Also advised that Husband, Mother
   and baby should get prophylaxis. If CXR blossoms should consider
   disseminated PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Hepatology saw pt. and pt. went for transjugular Liver Bx which was
   nonspecific on initial touch prep, did not show lymphoma. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] was
   very concerned for hepatosplenic lymphoma which would be the only
   indication that would not require transplant. Plan is to check final
   liver Bx and if negative get BM biopsy, heme has already been consulted
   and thinks lymphoma unlikely.
   - Trended Q6 LFTs and Coags, coags worsened but bili/AST trended down.
   - Became progressively hypoglycemic to 44 and started D5NS at 100cc/hr
   - Had CVL placed with Liver Bx.
   - UOP remained about 30cc/hr
   - PM lytes showed acute renal failure, stable bicarb
   - Peripheral flow cytometry was sent
   - CT head negative
   - Ophtho consulted and did bedside exam w/ no [**Location (un) 8953**]-Fleischer rings,
   but mild blurring of optic disc w/ hemorrage on disc so got neuro
   consult for management of increased ICP. They recommended MRV to check
   for venous sinus thrombosis.
   - Lactate remained stable
   - Transplant surgery recommended transfer to their service, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**]
   mostly in agreement will need to be discussed in am.
   - Verbally confirmed w/ PCP influenza [**Name Initial (PRE) **] + on [**9-9**].
   - Hct dropped from 25->21 but hepatology recommended against giving her
   products to avoid alloimmunization.
   - PTT trended up to >150
   - FYI'd Nsurg that we may need a bolt for ICP monitoring\
   - After long discussion with transplant surgery, neurology and liver
   fellow decided not to place bolt for intracranial monitoring.

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, currently on immunosuppressive medications. She presented with flu-like symptoms, respiratory distress, and acute liver failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is experiencing multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Liver Failure: The patient is showing signs of asterixis on examination, indicating hepatic encephalopathy. Her liver function tests (LFTs) and bilirubin levels are stable, but she has developed hypoglycemia, requiring dextrose infusion.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is tachypneic and has been intubated electively for a liver biopsy. She has a confirmed flu infection and possible mycoplasma pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, with suspected sources including the chest and abdomen. She has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and she has been advised against receiving blood products to avoid alloimmunization. Active bleeding is being monitored, and stool samples are being checked for occult blood.
5. Crohn's Disease: Immunosuppressants should be held due to the current medical condition.
6. Hepatosplenic Lymphoma: This is a concern given the patient's liver abnormalities and immunosuppressed state. A bone marrow biopsy may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old female with Crohn's disease on immunosuppressive therapy who presented with flu-like symptoms and respiratory distress. She was found to have acute liver failure, respiratory distress, elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), and sepsis. The patient underwent a transjugular liver biopsy which showed nonspecific findings. She is currently intubated and being treated for possible mycoplasma infection, influenza, and other respiratory pathogens. The patient's condition is unstable, and there are concerns about hepatosplenic lymphoma, alloimmunization from blood products, and the need for transfer to the transplant surgery service.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute liver failure: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and bilirubin levels are elevated, indicating liver dysfunction. This can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and increased risk of infections.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing, which may progress to respiratory failure if not adequately managed. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required.
3. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient has papilledema on eye examination, suggesting increased ICP. This can lead to neurological complications such as cerebral edema and herniation if not treated promptly.
4. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria and is suspected to have a bacterial infection. If not effectively"
