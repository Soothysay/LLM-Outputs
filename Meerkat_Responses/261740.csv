   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure. Patient with evidence of a LLL PNA on CXR with
   history of COPD and wheezing on exam to suggest COPD flare. Could have
   had some pulmonary edema in setting of hypertension in ED. WBC slightly
   up today but in setting of steroids.
   -Will treat with vancomycin and levofloxacin to cover MRSA and CAP. If
   worsened respiratory status consider adding flagyl for anaerobic
   coverage in c/o aspiration. Check differential on CBC.
   -Follow up cultures and reculture if febrile
   -Decrease PSV to [**6-17**] wean vent as tolerated
   -Continue ipratropium/albuterol nebulizer treatments
   -Continue IV solumedrol for now in the setting of a COPD flare; convert
   to po steroids when able.
   #. COPD. Patient likely with COPD flare in the setting of a pneumonia.
   -Will give ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers q6h
   -Treat pna and continue steroids as above.
   #. CHF. Patient with evidence of regional hypokinesis c/w CAD at prior
   echo, with EF 40%. Patient does not appear to be volume overloaded on
   exam and CVPs low, suspect that she is intravascularly dry.  Hold off
   on further diuresis. Will bolus with LR and give additional 1L LR
   following urine output.
   #. CAD. Patient w/hx CAD. EKG shows no evidence of acute ST-T changes.
   Troponin slightly elevated at admission but trending down. Continue
   ASA.
   #. Hypertension. Patient with hypertensive urgency with evidence of
   elevated cardiac enzymes and worsening of renal failure.
   -D/c nitro gtt, start labetolol gtt until stable then transition to po
   labetalol
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure FeUrea ~20% consistent with pre-renal
   state suspect volume depleted rather than simply poor perfusion due to
   HF. Has had recent antibiotics but urine eos negative. Follow urine
   output with hydration and recheck PM electrolytes.
   #. Thrombocytopenia. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to medication eg recent Bactrim,
   now on hold. Follow for now.
   #. Diabetes mellitus. Patient with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia.
   -Reduce dose of glargine
   -Start D5W drip at 50 cc/hr until fingersticks normalize.
   .
   #. UTI. Patient with recent UTI, receiving meropenem at [**Name (NI) 455**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
 unclear duration of therapy or whether abx completed. Need to contact
   [**Name (NI) 455**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for records, follow up urine cx here
   .
   #. Depression/hx hallucinations.
   -Continue risperdal
   -Restraints in place
   -Will monitor for signs of agitation after extubation

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, DM, CHF, and CAD. He was admitted with increased shortness of breath and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, pneumonia, acute on chronic renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, UTI, diabetes mellitus, and depression with hallucinations. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, sedatives, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is evidence of a lower left lobe pneumonia. This can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function if not appropriately managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed lower left lobe pneumonia, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent the spread to other areas of the lungs.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient shows signs of pre-renal azotemia, likely due to volume depletion rather than poor cardiac perfusion. Close monitoring of urine output and recheck of PM electrolytes is necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be secondary to medication usage. Further evaluation is required to determine the cause and appropriate management.
5. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, which needs to be addressed to prevent further end-organ damage.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure. Patient with evidence of a LLL PNA on CXR with
   history of COPD and wheezing on exam to suggest COPD flare. Could have
   had some pulmonary edema in setting of hypertension in ED.
   -Will treat with vancomycin and levofloxacin to cover MRSA and CAP.
   Gram stains negative
 consider D/C vancomycin. If worsened respiratory
   status consider adding flagyl for anaerobic coverage in c/o aspiration.
   -Follow up cultures and reculture if febrile
   -Continue ipratropium/albuterol nebulizer treatments
   #. COPD. Patient likely with COPD flare in the setting of a pneumonia.
   -Will give ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers q6h
   -Change to PO steroids
   #. CHF. Patient with evidence of regional hypokinesis c/w CAD at prior
   echo, with EF 40%. Patient does not appear to be volume overloaded on
   exam and CVPs low, suspect that she is intravascularly dry. Urine
   output yesterday borderline.
   -Continue IVFs today follow urine output
   #. CAD. Patient w/hx CAD. EKG shows no evidence of acute ST-T changes.
   Troponin slightly elevated at admission but trending down. Continue
   ASA.
   #. Hypertension. Patient with hypertensive urgency with evidence of
   elevated cardiac enzymes and worsening of renal failure.
   -D/c nitro gtt, start labetolol gtt until stable then transition back
   to home antihypertensive agents
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure FeUrea ~20% consistent with pre-renal
   state suspect volume depleted rather than simply poor perfusion due to
   HF. Has had recent antibiotics but urine eos negative. Follow urine
   output with hydration and recheck PM electrolytes.
   #. Thrombocytopenia. [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to medication eg recent Bactrim,
   now on hold. Follow for now.
   #. Diabetes mellitus. Patient with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia at
   her nursing facility.
   -Titrate up glargine today
   -Start D5W drip at 50 cc/hr until fingersticks normalize.
   .
   #. UTI. Patient with recent UTI, receiving meropenem at [**Name (NI) 455**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
 unclear duration of therapy or whether abx completed.
Follow up
   urine culture, will likely need to broaden abx if had ESBL organism
   .
   #. Depression/hx hallucinations.
   -Continue risperdal
   -Restraints in place
   -Will monitor for signs of agitation after extubation

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient was successfully extubated and is currently on CPAP mode for respiratory support. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure (CHF), hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic renal failure, thrombocytopenia, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypertension, and latex allergy. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/53 mmHg to 155/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the mid inspiratory phase and diminished breath sounds. Laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and stable creatinine levels. The patient's overall assessment includes respiratory failure, bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, chronic heart failure, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, coronary artery disease, chronic renal failure, acute thrombocytopenia, type II diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, benign hypertension, and potential complications such as ARDS.
