","The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of uterine fibroids and hyperlipidemia who was admitted for a hysterectomy complicated by bowel perforation. She has since undergone bowel resection. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, except for persistent sinus tachycardia all night. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 114 bpm with a range of 103-124 bpm, blood pressure of 132/89 mmHg with a range of 129-138/85-91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute with a range of 16-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on medium concentration mask.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is somnolent but arousable, with no abnormalities in her head, eyes, ears, nose, or throat. Her lungs are clear bilaterally with no signs of infection. Her cardiovascular assessment shows tachycardia but no murmurs, regurgitation, or gallop. Her abdomen is soft and tender, with decreased bowel sounds, and she has surgical scars and lap wounds bilaterally. Her extremities are warm, well perfused, and without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

The patient's lab results show normal levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Her glucose level is slightly elevated at 129 mg/dL. The patient is currently receiving various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and dilaudid PCA for pain control.

The patient's assessment and plan include management of bowel perforation, pain, uterine fibroids, tachycardia, and hyperlipidemia. The patient will be closely monitored for any complications related to her conditions, including post-operative ileus, pain, and tachycardia. She will continue to receive appropriate antibiotics, pain management, and supportive care."

   On this day I examined the patient and reviewed the history and
   relevant lab and imaging data.  I was present for the key portions of
   the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10627**]
s note and agree with
   her findings and plan of care.   The patient seems to be doing better
   following bowel resection for peritonitis and bowel perf following
   hysterectomy.  WBC is lower, she
s hemodynamically stable, and pain
   seems under reasonable control.  She
s received lots of fluids and has
   L>R effusions, but is in no resp distress.  We
ll transfuse 1 unit prbc
   for what we think is largely dilutional anemia. If stable Hct after
   that she can likely go to floor.  As per OB/GYN, we
ll commence TPN via
   PICC.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of uterine fibroids and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted for a hysterectomy that was complicated by bowel perforation, and subsequently underwent bowel resection. The patient is currently in the ICU, where she is being treated for several medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bowel perforation: The patient had a bowel perforation following hysterectomy, which required surgical intervention and bowel resection. She is at high risk for post-operative ileus and other complications associated with bowel surgery.
2. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing tachycardia, likely secondary to abdominal discomfort, anemia, and intravascular volume depletion. Monitoring and aggressive hydration have been initiated to address this issue.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is resolving with intravenous fluid hydration. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels will be necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) level is low, indicating anemia. She will receive a blood transfusion to address this condition.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, for which she was taking simvastatin. It is recommended to resume simvastatin when she is tolerating oral medications again.
6. Potential infections: Given the recent surgery and hospitalization, the patient is at risk for developing infections"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 yo female with h/o uterine fibroids, hyperlipidemia, who
   was admitted for hyesterectomy complicated by bowel perforation, now
   s/p bowel resection.
   .
   1.  Bowel perforation.  Patient with bowel perforation following
   hysterectomy with evidence of stool in abdomen during surgery, now s/p
   resection of bowel.  Patient is currently hemodynamically stable with
   the exception of tachycardia.  She received levo/flagyl pre-operatively
   and will broaden to vanco/zosyn.  Anticipate long post-operative course
   and at high risk for post-op ileus.
   - Vanco/Zosyn
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u urine output with goal of 30-50 cc/hour
   - IVFs to keep MAPs > 60
   - NPO with NGT to suction
   - Surgery & Ob/Gyn following
   - pain management with dilaudid IV prn and standing toradol and will
   institute bowel reg when able to take POs
   .
   2.  Pain.  Patient's pain is likely secondary abdominal discomfort from
   sugery and bowel perforation.  CTA did not show PE earlier today.
   - dilaudid pca and standing toradol for pain control
   .
   3.  Uterine fibroids.  Patient is s/p hysterectomy complicated by bowel
   perforation.
   - Ob/gyn following
   - post-operative pain management with dialudid IV prn
   .
   4.  Tachycardia.  Patient noted to be newly tachycardic following
   surgery.  Likely secondary to to abdominal discomfort from sugery and
   bowel perforation.  CTA did not show PE earlier today.  Patient is
   afebrile.  EBL of only 50 cc.
   - monitor on telementry
   - dilaudid PCA and toradol for pain management
   - patient aggressively hydrated with IVF with some improvement in
   tachycardia and urine output
   - serial Hcts
patient with HCT=20.8 today, will type and screen and
   transfuse 1unti PRBC
   .
   5.  Hyperlipidemia.
   - resume simvastatin when tolerating POs

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname] is a 46-year-old female admitted for a hysterectomy complicated by bowel perforation. She underwent bowel resection and is currently hemodynamically stable with the exception of tachycardia. The patient has a history of uterine fibroids and hyperlipidemia. She received pre-operative antibiotics and will continue broad-spectrum antibiotics post-operatively. The patient is at high risk for post-operative ileus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bowel perforation: The patient had a bowel perforation following hysterectomy, which has already been addressed by bowel resection. However, she remains at risk for further complications related to the perforation.
2. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing tachycardia, likely secondary to abdominal discomfort from surgery and bowel perforation. Monitoring and aggressive hydration have been initiated to improve tachycardia and urine output.
3. Pain: The patient's pain is likely due to abdominal discomfort from surgery and bowel perforation. Pain management strategies have been implemented.
4. Uterine fibroids: The patient underwent hysterectomy due to uterine fibroids. There may be complications related to the removal of the fibroids.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, which may need to be managed post-operatively.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may"

","Summary:
The patient is a female with an unknown age, admitted to the ICU for an unspecified reason. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, pain management, and fluid management. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight drop in blood pressure at times. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count and decreased hemoglobin levels, indicating a possible infection or bleeding. The patient's chest pain and abdominal pain have been managed with medication. There are concerns about ineffective coping, peritonitis, and pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and the presence of antibiotics suggest a possible infection. If left untreated, it could lead to sepsis or septic shock.
2. Bleeding: The decreased hemoglobin levels and the administration of blood products indicate a possibility of bleeding. If the bleeding continues, it may result in anemia or hypovolemic shock.
3. Peritonitis: The mention of peritonitis suggests an infection within the peritoneal cavity. If not properly managed, it could progress to severe complications such as abscess formation or sepsis.
4. Pain management: The patient's acute and chronic pain require effective pain management. If not controlled, it may lead to patient discomfort, increased risk of complications, or even delirium.
5. Fluid overload: The administration of fluids and the presence of increased fluid on the chest X-ray indicate a potential"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 yo female with h/o uterine fibroids, hyperlipidemia, who
   was admitted for hyesterectomy complicated by bowel perforation, now
   s/p bowel resection.
   .
   1.  Bowel perforation.
   POD#3 s/p resection and repair of bowel.  Hemodynamically stable but
   has persistent tachycardia.  On vanco/zosyn.  Has Post-op ileus by
   abdominal Xray but hyperactive bowel sounds.  Urine output good and
   blood pressures stable overnight.
   - Vanco/Zosyn-leukocytosis improving
   - f/u blood cultures
NGTD
   - NPO with NGT to suction-will start  TPN, will not advance diet until
   patient is passing gas and having BM
   - Surgery & Ob/Gyn following, surgery changing bandages for post-op
   wound care
   - pain management with dilaudid PCA and standing toradol
   - needs bowel reg when able to take POs
   .
   2. Anemia:
   Post-operative.  Stable in last 12 hours, but was concern for possible
   intraabdominal bleed overnight.  If there were a bleed, it would not
   likely be a retroperitoneal bleed.  Consider CT abd/pelvis if Hct drops
   further
   - cont to monitor Hct
   .
   3.  Tachycardia.  Patient noted to be newly tachycardic following
   surgery.  Likely secondary to abdominal discomfort, anemia, and
   intravascular volume depletion.  CTA negative for PE.  Patient remains
   afebrile, appears adequately hydrated. States that pain controlled by
   PCA pump and toradol.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - monitor renal function w standing toradol
 do not use for more than
   3 days
check w pharmacy
   - serial Hcts stable for last 12 hours
   .
   4.  Uterine fibroids.  Patient is s/p hysterectomy complicated by bowel
   perforation.
   - Ob/gyn following
   - post-operative pain management with dialudid PCA and toradol x 3 days
   .
   5.  Hyperlipidemia.
   - resume simvastatin when tolerating POs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 46-year-old female who was admitted for a hysterectomy complicated by bowel perforation. She underwent bowel resection and repair.
- The patient is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) antibiotics. Her white blood cell count (WBC) is improving.
- She has a post-operative ileus as shown by an abdominal X-ray but has hyperactive bowel sounds. Her urine output is good, and blood pressures are stable overnight.
- The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) was initially low but has been stable in the last 12 hours. There were concerns about possible intra-abdominal bleeding, but it was unlikely to be retroperitoneal bleeding. Further monitoring of Hct is recommended.
- The patient is experiencing tachycardia, which is likely secondary to abdominal discomfort, anemia, and intravascular volume depletion. A chest X-ray (CTA) did not show any pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient appears adequately hydrated and states that her pain is controlled by the PCA pump and toradol.
- Serial Hcts are stable for the last 12 hours.
- The patient underwent a hysterectomy for uterine fibroids and experienced bowel perforation.
- She will continue to receive pain management with dilaudid PCA and standing toradol for three days"
