","Summary:
The patient presented with dyspnea and underwent pericardiocentesis, resulting in the removal of bloody fluid from the pericardial space. The procedure successfully decreased the right atrial pressure. A pigtail catheter was left in place, draining an additional 150 cc of bloody fluid this morning. The patient's pulses remained unchanged, and they required oxygen supplementation via a shovel mask due to mild desaturation in the 80s, responding well to it.

The patient has a history of allergies to sulfonamides, with unknown reactions in the past. No other significant medical or family history was reported. Review of systems showed no changes except for soreness near the drain site.

Vital signs showed a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 79 bpm with normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on supplemental oxygen. Hemodynamic monitoring revealed a decreased right atrial pressure.

Fluid balance showed an input of 540 mL and output of 1040 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 500 mL. The patient received respiratory support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device and had an ABG analysis, although the results were not provided in the note.

Physical examination findings included well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and overweight/obese status. Eyes and conjunctiva were assessed as PERRL, and"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 57yo F with h/o obesity and squamous metaplasia of
   bladder neck in [**2154**] admitted with pleural and pericardial effusions
   now s/p pericardiocentesis transferred to CCU for further monitoring.
   .
   # Pericardial Effusion: Differential of etiology of effusions broad but
   most likely infectious vs malignancy vs rheumatologic. Given up to date
   cancer screenings, preceding viral syndrome and low grade fevers favor
   infectious etiology. Also rheumatologic is on the differential given
   her myalgias and fevers. Now s/p pericardiocentesis with pigtail
   catheter in place. Currently no evidence of tamponade clinically.
   - Monitor tube drainage and pulsus overnight -> unchanged at 8 mmHg
   - Post cath check at 10pm -> wnl
   - Follow up cytologies, gram stain, cultures of fluid
   - Follow up studies ordered by cardiology team including TSH, [**Doctor First Name **]
   - will continue on ibuprofen PRN to treat pericarditis symptoms she was
   complaining of previously as will decrease the inflammatory response
   and may help keep pericardial effusion from recurring.
   .
   # Pleural Effusions: Likely same etiology as the pericardial effusion.
   Currently clinically stable satting well on N/C with shovel mask with
   no need for emergent thoracentesis.
   - cont to monitor
   - Wean O2 as able
   - Follow up studies of pericardial effusion as above
   .
   #. Transaminitis: Likely [**3-3**] same syndrome that has resulted in the
   effusions. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to a viral gastroenteritis, however, may
   also have been the cause initially of her vomiting/nausea.
   - Will check hepatitis serologies and follow LFTs -> trending down
   - Consider RUQ ultrasound if the transaminitis persists, or if patient
   worsens clinically
   .
   # PUMP:  Per recent TTE patient has normal systolic and diastolic
   function.
   - Will repeat TTE post-procedure to ensure no recurrence of pericardial
   effusion -> done, wnl
   - Monitor on telemetry, no events
   - will repeat TTE this morning to reassess pericardium
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Currently sinus.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No known coronary disease although likely at risk given
   habitus and family history of early MI.
   - Will monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Pre-diabetes: Patient with no diagnosis of diabetes but does have
   h/o slightly elevated HgBA1c.
   - Will check FSBS while in hospital and cover with ISS as needed
   .
   #  Fybromyalgia: will continue home pain regimen and

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of obesity and squamous metaplasia of the bladder neck. She was admitted with pleural and pericardial effusions and underwent pericardiocentesis. The patient is now in the CCU for further monitoring.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Pericardial Effusion: The etiology of the effusions is still under investigation, with infectious, malignancy, or rheumatologic causes being considered. The patient has shown improvement after pericardiocentesis, with no evidence of tamponade clinically. Monitoring of tube drainage and pulsus paradoxus will continue overnight, and follow-up cytologies, gram stain, and cultures of the fluid will be done. Additional studies ordered by the cardiology team will also be followed up.

2. Pleural Effusions: These are likely due to the same etiology as the pericardial effusion. The patient is currently clinically stable and does not require emergent thoracentesis. Continuous monitoring and weaning of O2 as able will be done. Follow-up studies of the pericardial effusion will also be conducted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of obesity and squamous metaplasia of the bladder neck. She was admitted with pleural and pericardial effusions and underwent pericardiocentesis. The patient is currently in the ICU for further monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial Effusion: The patient had pericardial effusion, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, malignancy, or rheumatologic conditions. Monitoring tube drainage and pulsus overnight is necessary to assess any changes.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient also has pleural effusions, likely due to the same underlying cause as the pericardial effusion. Close monitoring is required, and weaning off oxygen as able is recommended.
3. Transaminitis: The patient is experiencing transaminitis, which may be related to viral gastroenteritis or other causes. Hepatitis serologies and liver function tests (LFTs) should be checked, and a RUQ ultrasound may be considered if the transaminitis persists.
4. Cardiac Function: The patient's cardiac function appears to be normal based on recent TTE results. Repeating TTE post-procedure and monitoring on telemetry are advised.
5. Rhythm: The patient's current rhythm is sinus, and close monitoring on telemetry is necessary to detect any changes.
6. Coronary Disease: Although there is no known"

The echocardiogram (TTE) showed a small pericardial effusion, and the chest X-ray revealed small bilateral pleural effusions. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes, while other parameters are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial Effusion: The patient initially presented with pericardial effusion, which has been managed with pericardiocentesis and a pigtail catheter. Continuous monitoring of tube drainage and repeat TTE are planned to evaluate the remaining effusate volume. If the effusion does not decrease, further intervention may be required.

2. Pleural Effusions: The patient also has small bilateral pleural effusions, likely caused by the same underlying condition as the pericardial effusion. Clinically, the patient is stable without emergent thoracentesis. Close monitoring and weaning off oxygen as tolerated are recommended.

3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), suggesting transaminitis. It may be related to a viral syndrome or other underlying conditions. Hepatitis serologies"

   Assessment and Plan
   57yo F with h/o obesity and squamous metaplasia of bladder neck in [**2154**]
   admitted with pleural and pericardial effusions now s/p
   pericardiocentesis transferred to CCU for further monitoring.
   .
   # Pericardial Effusion: Differential of etiology of effusions broad but
   most likely infectious vs malignancy vs rheumatologic. Given up to date
   cancer screenings, preceding viral syndrome and low grade fevers favor
   infectious etiology. Also rheumatologic is on the differential given
   her myalgias and fevers, however, unlikely given negative [**Doctor First Name **] and
   normal TSH. Now s/p pericardiocentesis with pigtail catheter in place.
   Currently no evidence of tamponade clinically.
   - Continue to monitor tube drainage, 50 mL since 4pm [**2160-10-4**].
   - Repeat TTE this morning to evaluate remaining pericardial effusate
   volume. If not greater than TTE yesterday, consider to d/c pericardial
   drain.
   - Continue to monitor pulsus. Overnight was 4-6 mmHg.
   - Follow up cytologies, gram stain, cultures of fluid. Pericardial
   fluid was positive for gram + cocci in clusters, likely contaminant.
   Patient is not clinically septic, no antibiotic therapy warranted at
   this time.
   - will continue on ibuprofen PRN to treat pericarditis symptoms she was
   complaining of previously as will decrease the inflammatory response
   and may help keep pericardial effusion from recurring.
   .
   # Pleural Effusions: Likely same etiology as the pericardial effusion.
   CXR on [**2160-10-4**] showed small b/l pleural effusions. Currently clinically
   stable satting well on N/C with shovel mask with no need for emergent
   thoracentesis. Patient diuresing well on own.
   - cont to monitor
   - Wean O2 as able, currently requiring 5L by NC or shovel mask.
   - Nasal saline spray for irritation from nasal cannula
   - Encourage incentive spirometry to prevent atelectasis
   - Follow up studies of pericardial effusion as above
   .
   #. Transaminitis: Likely [**3-3**] same syndrome that has resulted in the
   effusions. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to a viral gastroenteritis, however, may
   also have been the cause initially of her vomiting/nausea.
   - Will check hepatitis serologies and follow LFTs -> trending down
   - Consider RUQ ultrasound if the transaminitis persists, or if patient
   worsens clinically
   .
   # PUMP:  Per recent TTE patient has normal systolic and diastolic
   function. Had short duration of a-fib overnight.
   - Monitor on telemetry, continue to monitor for a-fib
   - will repeat TTE this morning to reassess pericardium

   57yo F with h/o obesity and squamous metaplasia of bladder neck in [**2154**]
   admitted with pleural and pericardial effusions now s/p
   pericardiocentesis transferred to CCU for further monitoring.
   .
   # Pericardial Effusion: Differential of etiology of effusions broad but
   most likely infectious vs malignancy vs rheumatologic. Given up to date
   cancer screenings, preceding viral syndrome and low grade fevers favor
   infectious etiology. Also rheumatologic is on the differential given
   her myalgias and fevers, however, unlikely given negative [**Doctor First Name **] and
   normal TSH. Now s/p pericardiocentesis with pigtail catheter in place.
   Currently no evidence of tamponade clinically.
   - Continue to monitor tube drainage, 50 mL since 4pm [**2160-10-4**].
   - Repeat TTE this morning to evaluate remaining pericardial effusate
   volume. If not greater than TTE yesterday, consider to d/c pericardial
   drain.
   - Continue to monitor pulsus. Overnight was 4-6 mmHg.
   - Follow up cytologies, gram stain, cultures of fluid. Pericardial
   fluid was positive for gram + cocci in clusters, likely contaminant.
   Patient is not clinically septic, no antibiotic therapy warranted at
   this time.
   - will continue on ibuprofen PRN to treat pericarditis symptoms she was
   complaining of previously as will decrease the inflammatory response
   and may help keep pericardial effusion from recurring.
   .
   # Pleural Effusions: Likely same etiology as the pericardial effusion.
   CXR on [**2160-10-4**] showed small b/l pleural effusions. Currently clinically
   stable satting well on N/C with shovel mask with no need for emergent
   thoracentesis. Patient diuresing well on own.
   - cont to monitor
   - Wean O2 as able, currently requiring 5L by NC or shovel mask.
   - Nasal saline spray for irritation from nasal cannula
   - Encourage incentive spirometry to prevent atelectasis
   - Follow up studies of pericardial effusion as above
   .
   #. Transaminitis: Likely [**3-3**] same syndrome that has resulted in the
   effusions. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to a viral gastroenteritis, however, may
   also have been the cause initially of her vomiting/nausea.
   - Will check hepatitis serologies and follow LFTs -> trending down
   - Consider RUQ ultrasound if the transaminitis persists, or if patient
   worsens clinically
   .
   # PUMP:  Per recent TTE patient has normal systolic and diastolic
   function. Had short duration of a-fib overnight.
   - Monitor on telemetry, continue to monitor for a-fib
   - will repeat TTE this morning to reassess pericardium
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of obesity and squamous metaplasia of the bladder neck. She was admitted with pleural and pericardial effusions and underwent pericardiocentesis, resulting in the removal of 50 mL of serosanguinous fluid. The pericardial fluid was positive for Gram-positive cocci in clusters, likely a contaminant. The patient is not clinically septic and does not require antibiotic therapy at this time. She is currently on ibuprofen as needed for pericarditis symptoms. The patient also has small bilateral pleural effusions, which are likely due to the same etiology as the pericardial effusion. She is stable on nasal cannula with oxygen and is diuresing well on her own. The plan is to continue monitoring the tube drainage, perform a repeat TTE to evaluate remaining pericardial effusate volume, and consider discontinuing the pericardial drain if there is no evidence of tamponade clinically. Follow-up cytologies, gram stain, and cultures of the fluid will also be done. The patient's other medical conditions include transaminitis, PUMP (normal systolic and diastolic function), rhythm (currently sinus), coronaries (no known coronary disease), pre-diabetes, and fibromyalgia. She is being monitored on telemetry and will have repeat TTE in the morning. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Reaccumulation of pericardial effusion: The patient's pericardial effusion may reaccumulate, leading to potential tamponade and compromised cardiac function.
2. Infection: Although the pericardial fluid grew Gram-positive cocci in clusters, which is likely a contaminant, there is still a possibility of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and considering appropriate antibiotic therapy if necessary.
3. Pleural effusion progression: The patient's small bilateral pleural effusions may progress, potentially leading to respiratory compromise.
4. Transaminitis progression: The patient's transaminitis (elevated liver enzymes) should be closely monitored, as it may indicate ongoing liver injury or dysfunction.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient had a short duration of atrial fibrillation overnight, and her cardiac rhythm should continue to be monitored for any new or recurrent arrhythmias."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 57yo F with h/o obesity and squamous metaplasia of
   bladder neck in [**2154**] admitted with pleural and pericardial effusions
   now s/o pericardiocentesis transferred to CCU for further monitoring.
   .
   # Pericardial Effusion: Differential of etiology of effusions broad but
   most likely infectious vs malignancy vs rheumatologic. Given upto date
   cancer screenings, preceding viral syndrome and low grade fevers favor
   infectious etiology. Also rheumatologic is on the differential given
   her myalgias and fevers. Now s/p pericardiocentesis with pigtail
   catheter in place. Currently no evidence of tamponade clinically.
   - Monitor tube drainage and pulsus overnight
   - Post cath check at 10pm
   - Follow up cytologies, gram stain, cultures of fluid
   - Follow up studies ordered by cardiology team including TSH, [**Doctor First Name **]
   - will continue on ibuprofen to treat pericarditis symptoms she was
   complaining of previously as will decrease the inflammatory response
   and may help keep pericardial effusion from recurring.
   .
   # Pleural Effusions: Likely same etiology as the pericardial effusion.
   Currently clinically stable satting well on NRB with no need for
   emergent thoracentesis.
   - Monitor overnight
   - Wean O2 as able
   - Will benefit from sitting up once cath site stable enought to allow
   her to sit up.
   - Follow up studies of pericardial effusion as above
   .
   #. Transaminitis: Likely [**3-3**] same syndrome that has resulted in the
   effusions. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to a viral gastroenteritis, however, may
   also have been the cause initially of her vomiting/nausea.
   - Will check hepatitis serologies and follow LFTs
   - Consider RUQ ultrasound if the transaminitis persists.
   .
   # PUMP:  Per recent TTE patient has normal systolic and diastolic
   function.
   - Will repeat TTE post-procedure to ensure no recurrence of pericardial
   effusion.
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Currently sinus.
   - Monitor on telemetry overnight
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No known coronary disease although likely at risk given
   habitus and family history of early MI.
   - Will monitor on telemetry overnight.
   .
   #  Pre-diabetes: Patient with no diagnosis of diabetes but does have
   h/o slightly elevated HgBA1c.
   - Will check FSBS while in hospital and cover with ISS as needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of obesity and squamous metaplasia of the bladder neck, admitted to the ICU with pleural and pericardial effusions. She underwent pericardiocentesis and is currently in the CCU for further monitoring. The differential diagnosis for the effusions includes infectious, malignancy, and rheumatologic causes. There are no signs of tamponade clinically at present. The plan includes monitoring tube drainage and pulsus overnight, follow-up cytologies, gram stain, and cultures of the fluid. The patient will continue on ibuprofen to treat pericarditis symptoms and potentially decrease the inflammatory response. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Reaccumulation of pericardial effusion: Despite the pericardiocentesis, there is a possibility that the effusion may reaccumulate, leading to potential cardiac tamponade.
2. Infection: The effusion could be due to an infectious etiology, and there is a risk of developing further infections, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections.
3. Pleural effusion complications: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which could lead to respiratory distress or other complications if not managed appropriately.
4. Cardiovascular complications: Given the patient's history of obesity and family history of early myocardial infarction, there is a potential risk for cardiovascular events like heart attack or arrhythmias.
5. Hepatitis: The elevated"
