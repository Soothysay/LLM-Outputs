   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o F with PMHx significant for dCHF, HTN, HL, DM, who was admitted
   OSH with respiratory failure, now s/p intubation. Recent hospital
   course complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural
   effusions, and development of sinus pauses on telemetry, s/p placement
   of a temporary pacer wire.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and is
   breathing comfortably on the ventilator. She does not exhibit any signs
   of respiratory distress. The etiology of her respiratory failure is
   likely multifactorial, related to infection and heart failure. Of note,
   her sputum cx at the OSH grew GPC in pairs and GN coccobacilli that
   were concerning for h.flu. Blood cx were also positive for h.flu. For
   this, she has been on vanc/zosyn. In addition to these infectious
   processes, there is also likely a component of heart failure associated
   with the patient's respiratory distress. CXR on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] was
   consistent with fluid overload. As mentioned in her transfer notes, the
   patient does not seem to be compliant with her home medications.
   Additionally, she was noted to have an elevated troponin at the OSH.
   This could represent demand ischemia in the setting of a CHF
   exacerbation vs. active ischemia contributing to the patient's CHF
   exacerbation. Finally, the patient has had episodes of both a.fib with
   RVR and sinus pauses on telemetry. This sinus dysfunction could also be
   contributing to the patient's heart failure.
   - continue diuresis with IV lasix boluses; giving 40 mg IV x 1 now and
   will assess pt's response
   - echo in AM to further evaluate cardiac function
   - continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   .
   # Rhythm: As above, the patient has been noted to have episodes of both
   a.fib with RVR as well as sinus pauses on telemetry. This is concerning
   for sick sinus syndrome.
   - EP consult in AM
   - continue telemetry
   - recheck ECG in AM
   - IV metoprolol for RVR, holding nodal agents otherwise
   - temporary pacer in place for sinus pauses
   - pt not anticoagulated; will likely need to be started on
   anticoagulation in the setting of PAF
   .
   # Troponinemia: As above, elevated troponin secondary to demand
   ischemia in the setting of CHF exacerbation vs. secondary to ischemic
   event contributing to CHF exacerbation. Decreased troponin clearance
   likely [**12-30**] ARF.
   - continue to trend CE's in the morning
   - ECG in AM
   - repeat echo in AM, as above
   - starting ASA
   .
   # ID: Pt with H.flu in blood and GPC's & GN coccobacilli in sputum at
   OSH. Was on vanc/zosyn there.
   - repeat blood cx here
   - f/u micro data from OSH
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - consider getting ID input
   .
   # ARF: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 54**] [**Last Name (un) 303**] labs, baseline Cr ranges between 0.8 and 1.0.
   Currently, Cr is 1.3. Likely poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   .
   # Diabetes: Unclear of pt's home regimen.
   - ISS for now
   - fingersticks QID
   .
   # Nutrition: Pt is hypoalbuminemic on admission (2.3). NG tube in
   place. Was getting TF's at OSH. Poor nutritional status likely
   contributing to patient's peripheral edema.
   - nutrition consult for TF recommendations
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt normotensive at this time.
   - will clarify home med regimen
   - can restart antihypertensives as BP allows
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - need to clarify home regimen
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history significant for congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure and subsequently intubated. The patient's recent hospital course has been complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, and the development of sinus pauses on telemetry, for which a temporary pacer wire was placed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and breathing comfortably on the ventilator. She does not exhibit any signs of respiratory distress. Her sputum culture at the outside hospital grew Gram-positive cocci in pairs and Gram-negative coccobacilli, which were concerning for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Blood cultures were also positive for HAP, so she has been on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. In addition to these infectious processes, there is also likely a component of heart failure associated with the patient's respiratory distress. A chest X-ray on arrival to the hospital showed fluid overload. The patient does not seem to be compliant with her home medications, and she had an elevated troponin at the outside hospital, which could represent demand ischemia in the setting of CHF exacerbation or active ischemia contributing to the patient's CHF exacerbation.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o F with PMHx significant for dCHF, HTN, HL, DM, who was admitted
   OSH with respiratory failure, now s/p intubation. Recent hospital
   course complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural
   effusions, and development of sinus pauses on telemetry, s/p placement
   of a temporary pacer wire.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial, related to infection and
   heart failure. Sputum cx at the OSH grew GPC in pairs and GN
   coccobacilli that were concerning for h.flu. Blood cx were also
   positive for h.flu. On vanc/zosyn. Also likely a component of heart
   failure associated with the patient's respiratory distress. Patient
   does not seem to be compliant with her home medications. Additionally,
   she was noted to have an elevated troponin at the OSH. This could
   represent demand ischemia in the setting of a CHF exacerbation vs.
   active ischemia contributing to the patient's CHF exacerbation.
   Finally, the patient has had episodes of both a.fib with RVR and sinus
   pauses on telemetry. This sinus dysfunction could also be contributing
   to the patient's heart failure.
   - continue diuresis with IV lasix boluses; giving 40 mg IV x 1
   - f/u echo
   - continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - reassess respiratory status this afternoon after diuresis and
   consider extubation
   .
   # Rhythm: As above, the patient has been noted to have episodes of both
   a.fib with RVR as well as sinus pauses on telemetry. This is concerning
   for sick sinus syndrome.
   - consider EP consult for PM placement after infection is better
   controlled
   - continue telemetry
   - IV metoprolol for RVR, holding nodal agents otherwise
   - temporary pacer in place
   - pt not anticoagulated; will likely need to be started on
   anticoagulation in the setting of PAF; starting heparin gtt, can start
   Coumadin after decision re: pacemaker
   .
   # Troponinemia: As above, elevated troponin secondary to demand
   ischemia in the setting of CHF exacerbation vs. secondary to ischemic
   event contributing to CHF exacerbation. Decreased troponin clearance
   likely [**12-30**] ARF.
   - continue to trend CE's
   - f/u echo
   - continue ASA
   .
   # ID: Pt with H.flu in blood and GPC's & GN coccobacilli in sputum at
   OSH. Was on vanc/zosyn there.
   - repeat blood cx here
   - f/u micro data from OSH
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - consider getting ID input
   .
   # ARF: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 54**] [**Last Name (un) 303**] labs, baseline Cr ranges between 0.8 and 1.0.
   Currently, Cr is 1.3. Likely poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   .
   # Diabetes: Unclear of pt's home regimen.
   - ISS for now
   - fingersticks QID
   .
   # Nutrition: Pt is hypoalbuminemic on admission (2.3). NG tube in
   place. Was getting TF's at OSH. Poor nutritional status likely
   contributing to patient's peripheral edema.
   - nutrition consult for TF recommendations: recommending REPLETE WITH
   FIBER (goal of 50 mL/hr)
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt normotensive at this time.
   - will clarify home med regimen
   - can restart antihypertensives as BP allows
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - need to clarify home regimen
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure and had an elevated troponin level, indicating possible myocardial ischemia or demand ischemia in the setting of CHF exacerbation.

The patient's current condition includes persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, sinus pauses on telemetry, and an irregular rhythm. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 114/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased albumin and potassium levels. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 305 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 29 mmHg.

The physical examination reveals general obesity, no jugular venous distention, a holosystolic murmur at the apex, coarse breath sounds with clear lung fields, pitting edema in all four extremities, and dist"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o F with PMHx significant for dCHF, HTN, HL, DM, who was admitted
   OSH with respiratory failure, now s/p intubation. Recent hospital
   course complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural
   effusions, and development of sinus pauses on telemetry, s/p placement
   of a temporary pacer wire.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial, related to infection and
   heart failure. Sputum cx at the OSH grew GPC in pairs and GN
   coccobacilli that were concerning for h.flu. Blood cx were also
   positive for h.flu. On vanc/zosyn. Also likely a component of heart
   failure associated with the patient's respiratory distress. Patient
   does not seem to be compliant with her home medications. Additionally,
   she was noted to have an elevated troponin at the OSH. This could
   represent demand ischemia in the setting of a CHF exacerbation vs.
   active ischemia contributing to the patient's CHF exacerbation.
   Finally, the patient has had episodes of both a.fib with RVR and sinus
   pauses on telemetry. This sinus dysfunction could also be contributing
   to the patient's heart failure.
   - continue diuresis with IV lasix boluses; giving 40 mg IV x 1
   - f/u echo
   - continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - reassess respiratory status this afternoon after diuresis and
   consider extubation
   .
   # Rhythm: As above, the patient has been noted to have episodes of both
   a.fib with RVR as well as sinus pauses on telemetry. This is concerning
   for sick sinus syndrome.
   - consider EP consult for PM placement after infection is better
   controlled
   - continue telemetry
   - IV metoprolol for RVR, holding nodal agents otherwise
   - temporary pacer in place
   - pt not anticoagulated; will likely need to be started on
   anticoagulation in the setting of PAF; starting heparin gtt, can start
   Coumadin after decision re: pacemaker
   .
   # Troponinemia: As above, elevated troponin secondary to demand
   ischemia in the setting of CHF exacerbation vs. secondary to ischemic
   event contributing to CHF exacerbation. Decreased troponin clearance
   likely [**12-30**] ARF.
   - continue to trend CE's
   - f/u echo
   - continue ASA
   .
   # ID: Pt with H.flu in blood and GPC's & GN coccobacilli in sputum at
   OSH. Was on vanc/zosyn there.
   - repeat blood cx here
   - f/u micro data from OSH
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - consider getting ID input
   .
   # ARF: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 54**] [**Last Name (un) 303**] labs, baseline Cr ranges between 0.8 and 1.0.
   Currently, Cr is 1.3. Likely poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   .
   # Diabetes: Unclear of pt's home regimen.
   - ISS for now
   - fingersticks QID
   .
   # Nutrition: Pt is hypoalbuminemic on admission (2.3). NG tube in
   place. Was getting TF's at OSH. Poor nutritional status likely
   contributing to patient's peripheral edema.
   - nutrition consult for TF recommendations: recommending REPLETE WITH
   FIBER (goal of 50 mL/hr)
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt normotensive at this time.
   - will clarify home med regimen
   - can restart antihypertensives as BP allows
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - need to clarify home regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and has since developed persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, and sinus pauses on telemetry. The patient has been intubated and is currently on invasive ventilation. She has tested positive for influenza in her blood and sputum cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, related to infection and heart failure. The presence of GPC in pairs and GN coccobacilli in the sputum culture, along with positive blood cultures for influenza, suggests a possible bacterial infection as well. It is important to continue with appropriate antibiotics and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.

2. Heart Failure: The patient's elevated troponin levels indicate cardiac ischemia, which could be contributing to her heart failure exacerbation. The patient's history of congestive heart failure and the presence of an irregular rhythm with holosystolic murmur at the apex suggest underlying cardiac dysfunction. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram is recommended to assess the severity of heart failure.

3. Sick Sinus Syndrome: The patient's episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and sinus pauses on telemetry indicate sick sinus syndrome. This condition warrants consideration for a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure and developed bilateral pleural effusions. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and has experienced sinus pauses on telemetry, raising concerns for sick sinus syndrome.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, impaired skin integrity, atrioventricular (AV) block, respiratory failure, acute heart failure (CHF), fever, and possible infective endocarditis. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to persistent respiratory failure. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, troponin T levels, and lactate levels. Her sodium, potassium, and chloride levels are within normal range. The patient's blood cultures showed H. influenzae in the sputum culture.

The plan includes continuing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics, intubation, and diuresis with Lasix to achieve negative fluid balance. A left lateral decubitus chest X-ray is recommended to assess the pleural effusion. If the effusion does not resolve, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) may be considered.

   74 y/o F with PMHx significant for dCHF, HTN, HL, DM, who was admitted
   OSH with respiratory failure, now s/p intubation. Recent hospital
   course complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural
   effusions, who developed Afib with RVR and development of sinus pauses
   on telemetry  raising concern for sick sinus syndrome.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial, related to infection and
   heart failure. Most recent Cx data from OSH shows hemophilus influenza
   (beta lactamase positive ) in Sputum cx . Had initially been on
   ceftriaxone at OSH but spiked through ABX so was broadened to
   vanc/zosyn. Also component of heart failure for which she is being
   diuresed with effect. She does have known large R> L pleural effusions
   which could be loculated/hiding an abcess. She continues to have a
   primary respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis,
   with a primary respiratory process that is not resolved despite a RISBI
   of 59. For this reason, continued intubation is desired.
   Recommend left lateral decubitus CXR

   Restart propofol at low dose given plan for continued intubation.
   .
   # Rhythm: As above, the patient has been noted to have episodes of both
   a.fib with RVR as well as sinus pauses on telemetry. This is concerning
   for sick sinus syndrome. Paced at 50, only paces when patient
 HR drops
   below this in sleep.
   -consult EP re temporary pacer, can it be screwed ito placed?
   - consider EP consult for PM placement after infection is better
   controlled
   - continue telemetry
   Continue heparin GTT given differed Coumadin while pacer decision being
   made.
   -IV metoprolol for RVR, holding nodal agents otherwise.

   # Troponinemia: As above, elevated troponin secondary to demand
   ischemia in the setting of CHF exacerbation, afib  vs. secondary to
   ischemic event contributing to CHF exacerbation. Decreased troponin

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a significant past medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure and developed bilateral pleural effusions. She was found to have H. influenzae in her sputum culture, which is beta-lactamase positive.

The patient's current condition includes hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, impaired skin integrity, atrioventricular (AV) block, respiratory failure, acute heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), fever, and possible sick sinus syndrome. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, related to infection and heart failure. She has a high respiratory infection risk score (RISBI) of 59. Continued intubation is recommended.
   - Left lateral decubitus chest X-ray.
   - Intraoperative (IR) guided thoracentesis.
   - If this fails, may consider video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).
   - Continue vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics.
   - Continue furosemide (Lasix) infusion, goal negative 1 liter/day urine output.
   - [Hospital1 7] electrolytes.
   - Control heart rate for better forward flow.
   - Follow-up with OSH lab, request read of pleural fluid, gram stain, and culture with symptoms.

2. Rhythm: The patient has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and sinus pauses on telemetry, concerning for sick sinus syndrome.
   - Consult electrophysiologist (EP) regarding temporary pacer placement.
   - Consider permanent pacemaker (PM) placement after infection control.
   - Continue telemetry.

3. Troponinemia: Elevated troponin secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of CHF exacerbation or secondary to an ischemic event contributing to CHF exacerbation.
   - Stop trending troponin.
   - Follow-up echocardiogram.
   - Continue aspirin.

4. Infection: The patient has H. influenzae in her sputum and gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative (GN) coccobacilli in her sputum at OSH.
   - Follow-up repeat blood culture here.
   - Follow-up micro data from OSH.
   - Continue vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics for now (day 4 of 8-day course).
   - Consider getting infectious disease (ID) input.

5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine range is between 0.8 and 1.0, but currently, it"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. She has a history of hypertension and an unknown allergy to ace inhibitors and losartan. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She is receiving heparin sodium and furosemide infusions. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 161/64 mmHg to 88/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has a history of impaired skin integrity and is currently being treated for hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, atrioventricular block, and fever. Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, potassium, and troponin-T, along with other abnormalities in electrolyte and liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial admission was for respiratory failure, and she remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Heart Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, which increases the risk of worsening cardiac function, fluid overload, and potential development of cardiogenic shock.

3. Atrioventricular"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   74 y/o F with PMHx significant for dCHF, HTN, HL, DM, who was admitted
   OSH with respiratory failure, now s/p intubation. Recent hospital
   course complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural
   effusions, and development of sinus pauses on telemetry, s/p placement
   of a temporary pacer wire.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial, related to infection and
   heart failure. Sputum cx at the OSH grew GPC in pairs and GN
   coccobacilli that were concerning for h.flu. Blood cx were also
   positive for h.flu. On vanc/zosyn. Also likely a component of heart
   failure associated with the patient's respiratory distress. Patient
   does not seem to be compliant with her home medications. Additionally,
   she was noted to have an elevated troponin at the OSH. This could
   represent demand ischemia in the setting of a CHF exacerbation vs.
   active ischemia contributing to the patient's CHF exacerbation.
   Finally, the patient has had episodes of both a.fib with RVR and sinus
   pauses on telemetry. This sinus dysfunction could also be contributing
   to the patient's heart failure.
   - continue diuresis with IV lasix boluses; giving 40 mg IV x 1
   - f/u echo
   - continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - continue to monitor fluid status
   - reassess respiratory status this afternoon after diuresis and
   consider extubation
   .
   # Rhythm: As above, the patient has been noted to have episodes of both
   a.fib with RVR as well as sinus pauses on telemetry. This is concerning
   for sick sinus syndrome.
   - consider EP consult for PM placement after infection is better
   controlled
   - continue telemetry
   - IV metoprolol for RVR, holding nodal agents otherwise
   - temporary pacer in place
   - pt not anticoagulated; will likely need to be started on
   anticoagulation in the setting of PAF; starting heparin gtt, can start
   Coumadin after decision re: pacemaker
   .
   # Troponinemia: As above, elevated troponin secondary to demand
   ischemia in the setting of CHF exacerbation vs. secondary to ischemic
   event contributing to CHF exacerbation. Decreased troponin clearance
   likely [**12-30**] ARF.
   - continue to trend CE's
   - f/u echo
   - continue ASA
   .
   # ID: Pt with H.flu in blood and GPC's & GN coccobacilli in sputum at
   OSH. Was on vanc/zosyn there.
   - repeat blood cx here
   - f/u micro data from OSH
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - consider getting ID input
   .
   # ARF: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 54**] [**Last Name (un) 303**] labs, baseline Cr ranges between 0.8 and 1.0.
   Currently, Cr is 1.3. Likely poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   .
   # Diabetes: Unclear of pt's home regimen.
   - ISS for now
   - fingersticks QID
   .
   # Nutrition: Pt is hypoalbuminemic on admission (2.3). NG tube in
   place. Was getting TF's at OSH. Poor nutritional status likely
   contributing to patient's peripheral edema.
   - nutrition consult for TF recommendations: recommending REPLETE WITH
   FIBER (goal of 50 mL/hr)
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt normotensive at this time.
   - will clarify home med regimen
   - can restart antihypertensives as BP allows
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - need to clarify home regimen
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history significant for congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure and developed bilateral pleural effusions. Blood cultures grew H. influenzae, and she is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and sinus pauses on telemetry, which could be contributing to her heart failure. She also has hypernatremia, impaired skin integrity, and evidence of poor nutritional status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, related to infection and heart failure. It is important to continue monitoring her respiratory status and consider extubation after reassessment.

2. Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure may be exacerbated by her underlying CHF, hypertension, and recent infection. Close monitoring of fluid status and cardiac enzymes is necessary. An echocardiogram should be performed to assess cardiac function.

3. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has experienced episodes of AFib/RVR and sinus pauses on telemetry. This sinus dysfunction could be contributing to her heart failure. An electrophysiology (EP) consult for permanent pacemaker placement after infection control is recommended.

4. Troponinemia: The elevated troponin levels"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with an admission diagnosis of respiratory failure secondary to acute on chronic heart failure. The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on antihypertensive medications. He also has impaired skin integrity and hypothyroidism. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 161/64 to 88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with PSV/SBT ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated sodium levels, indicating hypernatremia. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium, furosemide, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory failure due to acute on chronic heart failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory status, especially if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or if the patient develops further cardiac dysfunction.

2. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, which may worsen during his ICU stay due to factors such as fluid overload, medication non-compliance, or development of new cardiac complications.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels need to be monitored"

   course complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural
   effusions, who developed Afib with RVR and development of sinus pauses
   on telemetry  raising concern for sick sinus syndrome.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial, related to infection and
   heart failure. Most recent Cx data from OSH shows hemophilus influenza
   (beta lactamase positive ) in Sputum cx . Had initially been on
   ceftriaxone at OSH but spiked through ABX so was broadened to
   vanc/zosyn. Also component of heart failure for which she is being
   diuresed with effect. She does have known large R> L pleural effusions
   which could be loculated/hiding an abcess. She continues to have a
   primary respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis,
   with a primary respiratory process that is not resolved despite a RISBI
   of 59. For this reason, continued intubation is desired.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure and developed bilateral pleural effusions. She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and sinus pauses on telemetry, which is concerning for sick sinus syndrome. The patient has elevated troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial ischemia or infarction. She has a positive sputum culture for H. influenzae (beta-lactamase positive) and is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's labs show hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, impaired skin integrity, and acute kidney injury (AKI). She is receiving diuretics for heart failure, and her fluid balance is being closely monitored. The patient's respiratory status has not improved despite a respiratory intensity scoring belt (RISBI) of 59, indicating the need for continued intubation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in her respiratory status, potentially requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
2. Infection: The presence of H. influenzae in the sputum culture suggests a bacterial infection that may not be adequately controlled with current antibiotic therapy, increasing the risk of treatment failure and potential spread"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure and now presents with fever, bilateral pleural effusions, and a focal air space consolidation in the right upper lobe, raising concern for superimposed pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. She has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and recent episodes of sinus pauses on telemetry, which are concerning for sick sinus syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, related to infection and heart failure. Persistent respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis indicates an ongoing primary respiratory process that has not resolved despite a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 98. Continued intubation is desired.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a positive sputum culture for Haemophilus influenzae, a beta-lactamase positive organism. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) have been initiated. Loculated pleural effusion could be hiding an abscess, so further diagnostic evaluation is needed.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of fever, bilateral pleural effusions, and focal air space consolidation in the right upper lobe of the lung, which raises concerns for superimposed pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 181/67 to 182/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (1.3-1.5 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen (32-35 mg/dL), indicating possible kidney dysfunction. The electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with high sodium (349 K/uL), potassium (4.6-5.0 mEq/L), and low chloride (96 mEq/L). The glucose level is significantly elevated at 230 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals pitting edema in all four extremities and a holosystolic murmur at the apex, which may indicate heart failure. The patient's mental status is less alert compared to yesterday, likely due to increased sedation.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, acute heart failure,"

   Code status:
   74 y/o F with PMHx significant for dCHF, HTN, HL, DM, who was admitted
   OSH with respiratory failure, now s/p intubation. Recent hospital
   course complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural
   effusions, who developed Afib with RVR and development of sinus pauses
   on telemetry  raising concern for sick sinus syndrome.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial, related to infection and
   heart failure. Most recent Cx data from OSH shows hemophilus influenza
   (beta lactamase positive ) in Sputum cx . Had initially been on
   ceftriaxone at OSH but spiked through ABX so was broadened to
   vanc/zosyn. Also component of heart failure for which she is being
   diuresed with effect. She does have known large R> L pleural effusions
   which could be loculated/hiding an abcess. She continues to have a
   primary respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis,
   with a primary respiratory process that is not resolved despite a RISBI
   of 59. For this reason, continued intubation is desired.
   Recommend left lateral decubitus CXR
   -IR guided thoracentesis today.
   -if this fails, may consider VATS.
   -continue vanc/zosyn
   -continue lasix GTT ,goal negative 1L/day
   -[**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   -f/u with OSH lab, request read of values of pleural fluid, gram stain
   and culture, with s/s
   -continue to trend fever curve, white count
   Back off propofol, for extubation post thoracentesis.
   .
   # Rhythm: As above, the patient has been noted to have episodes of both
   a.fib with RVR as well as sinus pauses on telemetry. This is concerning
   for sick sinus syndrome. Paced at 50, only paces when patient
 HR drops
   below this in sleep.
   - EP  following re temporary pacer and wthether it can be screwed ito
   placed?
   - possible  PM placement after infection is better controlled
   - continue telemetry
   Continue heparin GTT given differed Coumadin while pacer decision being
   made.
   -IV metoprolol for RVR, holding nodal agents otherwise.
   .
   # Troponinemia: As above, elevated troponin secondary to demand
   ischemia in the setting of CHF exacerbation, afib  vs. secondary to
   ischemic event contributing to CHF exacerbation. Decreased troponin
   clearance likely [**12-30**] ARF.
   - Echo showed hyperdynamics, mild AS, mild functional mitral stenosis,
   and moderate PA systolic HTN.
   - continue ASA
   .
   # ID: Pt with H.flu in sputum and GPC's & GN coccobacilli in sputum at
   OSH. Was on vanc/zosyn there.
   - f/u repeat blood cx here
   - f/u micro data from OSH
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now (day 5 of 8 day course)
   - consider getting ID input
   .
   # ARF: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 54**] [**Last Name (un) 303**] labs, baseline Cr ranges between 0.8 and 1.0.
   Currently, Cr is 1.4 Likely poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   .
   # Diabetes: Unclear of pt's home regimen.
   - ISS for now
   - fingersticks QID
   .
   # Nutrition: Pt is hypoalbuminemic on admission (2.3). NG tube in
   place. Was getting TF's at OSH. Poor nutritional status likely
   contributing to patient's peripheral edema.
   - nutrition consultrecommending REPLETE WITH FIBER (goal of 50 mL/hr)
   -resume tube feeds if continued intubation.
   # Hypertension: Pt hypertensive to 160s.
   Continue home coreg, start hydral.
   Control BP as this is barrier to extubation..

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history significant for congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.
- She was admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure and subsequently intubated.
- The patient has developed bilateral pleural effusions and is suspected to have an infection, specifically Hemophilus influenzae.
- She is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics.
- The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and episodes of sinus pauses, raising concerns for sick sinus syndrome.
- Her rhythm is being monitored with telemetry, and she is being paced at 50 beats per minute.
- The patient has elevated troponin levels due to demand ischemia in the setting of CHF exacerbation or possibly secondary to an ischemic event contributing to CHF exacerbation.
- She has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 1.4, likely due to poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
- The patient is hypoalbuminemic and has peripheral edema, indicating poor nutritional status.
- She has hypertension that needs to be controlled in order to consider extubation.
- Other issues include hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and diabetes management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-inch tall individual weighing 77.8 kg, currently admitted to the ICU. The chief complaint is fever, with a recorded temperature of 987.0F at 04:00 PM on [**2167-2-14**]. The noncontrast CT chest revealed large bilateral pleural effusions, with subtotal collapse of the lower lobes and evidence of loculated fluid in the right hemithorax. Focal air space consolidation in the right upper lobe is a concern for superimposed pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax.

The patient was deferred extubation, restarted propofol-light, and IP will drain loculated effusion in the morning and extubate in the afternoon. By 7 pm, negative 2L was stopped, and lasix GTT was stopped as well. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on [**2167-2-14**] at 08:53 PM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on [**2167-2-15**] at 05:57 AM.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium at 1,300 units/hour and propofol at 10 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications and medications are listed in the note.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o F with PMHx significant for dCHF, HTN, HL, DM, who was admitted
   OSH with respiratory failure, now s/p intubation. Recent hospital
   course complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural
   effusions, who developed Afib with RVR and development of sinus pauses
   on telemetry  raising concern for sick sinus syndrome.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial, related to infection and
   heart failure. Now, s/p extubation. Also, s/p thoracentesis yesterday,
   with removal of 1.6 L of fluid.
   -continue vanc/zosyn
   -continue lasix GTT ,goal negative 1-2L/day
   -[**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   -f/u pleural fluid studies
   -better BP control to prevent flashing, see below
   .
   # Rhythm: As above, the patient has been noted to have episodes of both
   a.fib with RVR as well as sinus pauses on telemetry. This is concerning
   for sick sinus syndrome.
   - EP  following re temporary pacer and whether it should be screwed
   into place prior to d/c
   - possible PM placement after infection is better controlled
   - continue telemetry
   - Continue heparin GTT, holding coumadin while pacer decision being
   made.
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - start metoprolol 5 mg IV QID
   .
   # ID: Pt with H.flu in sputum and GPC's & GN coccobacilli in sputum at
   OSH. Was on vanc/zosyn there.
   - f/u repeat blood cx here
   - f/u micro data from OSH
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - consider getting ID input
   .
   # ARF: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 54**] [**Last Name (un) 303**] labs, baseline Cr ranges between 0.8 and 1.0.
   Currently, Cr is 1.1. Likely was poor forward flow in the setting of
   CHF.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   .
   # Diabetes: Unclear of pt's home regimen.
   - ISS for now
   - fingersticks QID
   .
   # Nutrition:
   - pt needs speech and swallow
   # Hypertension: Pt noted to be hypertensive recently.
   - starting metoprolol 5 mg QID
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - need to clarify home regimen
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently intubated. There is a risk of recurring respiratory failure due to underlying conditions such as infection and heart failure.

2. Bilateral Pleural Effusions: The patient has developed bilateral pleural effusions, which can lead to respiratory distress and impaired gas exchange.

3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has been noted to have episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR) and sinus pauses on telemetry. This raises concern for sick sinus syndrome, which requires further evaluation and management.

4. Hypertension: The patient is hypertensive, and better blood pressure control is needed to prevent further complications.

5. Infection: The patient has a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia with H. influenzae in the sputum and gram-positive cocci and gram-negative coccobacilli in the sputum. There is a risk of ongoing infection that needs to be monitored and treated appropriately.

6. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine levels were between 0.8 and 1.0, but now the creatinine is 1.1. This suggests a possible decline in renal function, possibly due to poor forward flow in the setting of congestive heart failure.

7. Diabetes: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o F with PMHx significant for dCHF, HTN, HL, DM, who was admitted
   OSH with respiratory failure, now s/p intubation. Recent hospital
   course complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural
   effusions, who developed Afib with RVR and development of sinus pauses
   on telemetry  raising concern for sick sinus syndrome.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial, related to infection and
   heart failure. Most recent Cx data from OSH shows hemophilus influenza
   (beta lactamase positive ) in Sputum cx . Had initially been on
   ceftriaxone at OSH but spiked through ABX so was broadened to
   vanc/zosyn. Also component of heart failure for which she is being
   diuresed with effect. She does have known large R> L pleural effusions
   which could be loculated/hiding an abcess. She continues to have a
   primary respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis,
   with a primary respiratory process that is not resolved despite a RISBI
   of 59. For this reason, continued intubation is desired.
   Recommend left lateral decubitus CXR
   -IR guided thoracentesis today.
   -if this fails, may consider VATS.
   -continue vanc/zosyn
   -continue lasix GTT ,goal negative 1L/day
   -[**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   -f/u with OSH lab, request read of values of pleural fluid, gram stain
   and culture, with s/s
   -continue to trend fever curve, white count
   Back off propofol, for extubation post thoracentesis.
   .
   # Rhythm: As above, the patient has been noted to have episodes of both
   a.fib with RVR as well as sinus pauses on telemetry. This is concerning
   for sick sinus syndrome. Paced at 50, only paces when patient
 HR drops
   below this in sleep.
   - EP  following re temporary pacer and wthether it can be screwed ito
   placed?
   - possible  PM placement after infection is better controlled
   - continue telemetry
   Continue heparin GTT given differed Coumadin while pacer decision being
   made.
   -IV metoprolol for RVR, holding nodal agents otherwise.
   .
   # Troponinemia: As above, elevated troponin secondary to demand
   ischemia in the setting of CHF exacerbation, afib  vs. secondary to
   ischemic event contributing to CHF exacerbation. Decreased troponin
   clearance likely [**12-30**] ARF.
   - Echo showed hyperdynamics, mild AS, mild functional mitral stenosis,
   and moderate PA systolic HTN.
   - continue ASA
   .
   # ID: Pt with H.flu in sputum and GPC's & GN coccobacilli in sputum at
   OSH. Was on vanc/zosyn there.
   - f/u repeat blood cx here
   - f/u micro data from OSH
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now (day 5 of 8 day course)
   - consider getting ID input
   .
   # ARF: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 54**] [**Last Name (un) 303**] labs, baseline Cr ranges between 0.8 and 1.0.
   Currently, Cr is 1.4 Likely poor forward flow in the setting of CHF.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   .
   # Diabetes: Unclear of pt's home regimen.
   - ISS for now
   - fingersticks QID
   .
   # Nutrition: Pt is hypoalbuminemic on admission (2.3). NG tube in
   place. Was getting TF's at OSH. Poor nutritional status likely
   contributing to patient's peripheral edema.
   - nutrition consultrecommending REPLETE WITH FIBER (goal of 50 mL/hr)
   -resume tube feeds if continued intubation.
   # Hypertension: Pt hypertensive to 160s.
   Continue home coreg, start hydral.
   Control BP as this is barrier to extubation..
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - need to clarify home regimen
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a significant medical history including congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation (AFib). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure and has since developed bilateral pleural effusions. She has been intubated and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient's recent hospital course has been complicated by persistent respiratory failure, infection with Hemophilus influenzae, and exacerbation of her CHF. She is also showing signs of sick sinus syndrome, with episodes of both AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and sinus pauses on telemetry. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue if the underlying causes, such as infection and heart failure, are not effectively treated. Continued intubation and invasive ventilation may be necessary until her respiratory condition improves.

2. Infection: The patient has an active infection with Hemophilus influenzae, as evidenced by the presence of this organism in her sputum cultures. She is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, but further evaluation and treatment may be required based on the results of her blood cultures and other laboratory tests.

3. Exacerbation of CHF: The patient's CHF appears to be worsening, as indicated by her peripheral edema and elevated B"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with the chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient underwent thoracentesis and invasive ventilation. Fluid removal from the right pleural space was done, and the patient diuresed well. Allergies to ace inhibitors and Cozaar are documented. The patient received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and piperacillin. Heparin sodium infusion was also administered. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/78 mmHg to 125/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight has decreased from 81 kg at admission to 71 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total input of 994 mL and output of 4970 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -3976 mL. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 288 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 290 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 58 mmHg. 

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic systems. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Kidney function tests reveal elevated creatinine (Cr) and urea (BUN) levels. Other lab results, including cardiac markers, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and blood gases, are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with hypernatremia (high sodium), hypothyroidism, impaired skin integrity, atrioventricular (AV) block, respiratory failure, acute heart failure on chronic, fever, and other unspecified problems. The patient is on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, systemic anticoagulation with heparin, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o F with PMHx significant for dCHF, HTN, HL, DM, who was admitted
   OSH with respiratory failure, now s/p intubation. Recent hospital
   course complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural
   effusions, who developed Afib with RVR and development of sinus pauses
   on telemetry  raising concern for sick sinus syndrome.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial, related to infection and
   heart failure. Now, s/p extubation. Also, s/p thoracentesis yesterday,
   with removal of 1.6 L of fluid.
   -continue vanc/zosyn
   -continue lasix GTT ,goal negative 1-2L/day
   -[**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   -f/u pleural fluid studies
   -better BP control to prevent flashing, see below
   .
   # Rhythm: As above, the patient has been noted to have episodes of both
   a.fib with RVR as well as sinus pauses on telemetry. This is concerning
   for sick sinus syndrome.
   - EP  following re temporary pacer and whether it should be screwed
   into place prior to d/c
   - possible PM placement after infection is better controlled
   - continue telemetry
   - Continue heparin GTT, holding coumadin while pacer decision being
   made.
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - start metoprolol 5 mg IV QID
   .
   # ID: Pt with H.flu in sputum and GPC's & GN coccobacilli in sputum at
   OSH. Was on vanc/zosyn there.
   - f/u repeat blood cx here
   - f/u micro data from OSH
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure and later intubated. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR), and sinus pauses on telemetry, raising concern for sick sinus syndrome.

The patient underwent thoracentesis yesterday, with removal of 1.6 liters of fluid. She has been extubated and is currently on noninvasive ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 162/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.

Fluid balance since 68 AM shows an intake of 994 mL and output of 4970 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -3976 mL. The patient's weight has decreased from 81 kg at admission to 71 kg currently.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 46 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.3 mg"

She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure and subsequently intubated. Her hospital course has been complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, and the development of sinus pauses on telemetry, for which she underwent placement of a temporary pacemaker wire. The patient had a loculated fluid in the right hemithorax, which was tapped on [**2-15**] for 1600 cc. She was extubated on 3/21 at 1800, with SpO2 ranging from 96-98% on 50% face tent with met alkalosis and respiratory acidosis (pH 7.40/67/117/43).

Post-extubation, she remains somnolent, and speech and swallow have been deferred. Lasix gtt was stopped in the morning of [**2-16**], and the patient started on diamox to help reverse metabolic alkalosis.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Altered mental status (not delirium)
2. Alkalosis, metabolic
3. Hypernatremia (high sodium)
4. Hypothyroidism
5. Impaired skin integrity
6. Atrioventricular (AV) block

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. She was admitted to the ICU from the operating room with respiratory failure and required intubation. Since then, she has experienced persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, and developed sinus pauses on telemetry, indicating a potential sick sinus syndrome. The patient underwent thoracentesis on Sunday, removing 1.6 liters of fluid. She has been extubated and is currently on supplemental oxygen with a saturation level of 96%. Her current medications include metoprolol, hydralazine, and acetazolamide.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be multifactorial, related to infection and heart failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and arterial blood gases is necessary. Weaning off the shovel mask should be done gradually based on the patient's response. Rales on lung examination indicate ongoing pulmonary issues.

2. Hypertension: The patient has been noted to be hypertensive recently. Current management includes metoprolol 5 mg IV every 6 hours and PRN hydralazine. Scheduled hydralazine IV every 6 hours while NPO should be considered.

3. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) as well as sinus pauses"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a significant medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. She was admitted from the outside hospital with respiratory failure and is currently intubated. Her recent hospital course has been complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, and the development of sinus pauses on telemetry. The patient underwent thoracentesis on Sunday and had 1.6 liters of fluid removed. She was extubated on 3/21 and is currently on supplemental oxygen with an oxygen saturation of 96% on a face mask. She remains hypercarbic despite improvements on serial ABG tests.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial, related to infection and heart failure. Now, s/p extubation.
2. Hypertension: Pt noted to be hypertensive recently.
3. Rhythm: Episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (a.fib with RVR) as well as sinus pauses on telemetry, raising concern for sick sinus syndrome.
4. Alkalosis, metabolic: Hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis.
5. Hypernatremia (high sodium): Sodium level of 141 mg/dL.
6. Hypothyroidism: Currently on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history significant for congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the operating room (OSH) with respiratory failure, intubated, and had persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, and development of sinus pauses on telemetry. She underwent thoracentesis on Sunday and had removal of 1.6 liters of fluid. The patient is now extubated but remains on a shovel mask with oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%. She has continued rales on lung examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and persistent hypercarbia. There is a concern for recurrent respiratory failure due to ongoing infection and heart failure. Continuous monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABG) and weaning of the shovel mask are recommended.

2. Hypertension: The patient has recently been noted to be hypertensive. Starting metoprolol 5 mg QID and considering the addition of IV hydralazine for tighter blood pressure control are advised.

3. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has experienced episodes of both atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and sinus pauses on telemetry. This raises concern for sick sinus syndrome. Temporary pacing has been initiated, and the need for permanent pac"

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 14123**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Looks better this AM with no SOB.
   Temp PM in place with no recent need for pacing.
   Medical Decision Making
   BP meds adjusted.
   Will discuss removing temp PM soon which will allow discharge from CCU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of chronic heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the emergency department with respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, and the development of sinus pauses on telemetry, leading to concern for sick sinus syndrome. She underwent thoracentesis on Sunday, with removal of 1.6 liters of fluid. The patient was extubated on 3/21 and is currently on supplemental oxygen with a saturation level of 96%. She has persistent rales on lung exam and is receiving treatment for Streptococcus pneumoniae infection with Zosyn. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be multifactorial, related to infection and heart failure. She has persistent hypercarbia and continues to have rales on lung exam.
2. Hypertension: The patient has recently been hypertensive and is currently on metoprolol with PRN hydralazine.
3. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) as well as sinus pauses on telemetry, raising concern for sick sinus syndrome. She has a temporary pacemaker set at 50, but there are ongoing discussions regarding the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a significant medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure and subsequently intubated. Her hospital course has been complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, and the development of sinus pauses on telemetry, suggesting sick sinus syndrome. She underwent a thoracentesis, during which 1.6 liters of fluid were removed from the right hemithorax. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, hypothyroidism, impaired skin integrity, atrioventricular block, respiratory failure, acute heart failure, fever, and an infection with H. influenzae.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, related to infection and heart failure. It is crucial to continue monitoring her respiratory status and providing appropriate support if needed.
2. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) as well as sinus pauses on telemetry, raising concern for sick sinus syndrome. It is important to follow up with the electrophysiology (EP) service regarding the timing for intervention with a pacemaker.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o F with PMHx significant for dCHF, HTN, HL, DM, who was admitted
   OSH with respiratory failure, now s/p intubation. Recent hospital
   course complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural
   effusions, who developed Afib with RVR and development of sinus pauses
   on telemetry  raising concern for sick sinus syndrome.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial, related to infection and
   heart failure. Now, s/p extubation. Also, s/p thoracentesis on Sunday,
   with removal of 1.6 L of fluid.  Has been persistently hypercarbic
   although improved on serial abg, currently on shovel mask with 02 sats
   96
s with mask off. Continued rales on lung exam
   -K+ repletion to prompt renal clearance C02
   -Continue acetazolamide PRN
   -serial ABG
   -wean shovel mask
   -continue strep PNA coverage, currently on zosyn, may consider narrow
   to ceftriaxone
   -pleural fluid cx NGTD
   -serial CXR
   -lasix gtt stopped y/d, currently diuresing with acetazolamide. Mildly
   edematous in all 4 extremities
   -[**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   -better BP control to prevent flashing, see below
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt noted to be hypertensive recently.
   - started on metoprolol 5 mg QID, has needed PRN hydral.
   -consider scheduled hydral IV Q6 while NPO.
   .
   # Rhythm: As above, the patient has been noted to have episodes of both
   a.fib with RVR as well as sinus pauses on telemetry. This is concerning
   for sick sinus syndrome.
   - Currently has temporary pacer  set at 50. Has not been triggering on
   tele.  Possible PM placement after infection better controlled. Discuss
   with EP need for PPM vs temp pacer, and if so whether this can be
   screwed more permanently into place.
   - continue telemetry
   - Continue heparin GTT, holding coumadin while pacer decision being
   made.
   .
   # Nutrition:
   - Seen by speech and swallow, very lethargic, NPO for now, will re-eval
   today
   .
   # MS- baseline fully functional prior to hospitalization
   Disoriented this am, uncooperative with exam.
   -may be [**12-30**] hypercarbia, infection
continue to treat
   -serial exams
   -re-eval need for restraints daily.
   .
   # ID: Pt with H.flu in sputum and GPC's & GN coccobacilli in sputum at
   OSH. Was on vanc/zosyn there.
   - CX data negative to date here
   - Strep pneumo
on zosyn, consider narrowing.
   .
   # ARF: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 54**] [**Last Name (un) 303**] labs, baseline Cr ranges between 0.8 and 1.0.
   Currently, Cr is 0.9. Likely was poor forward flow in the setting of
   CHF.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   .
   # Diabetes: Unclear of pt's home regimen.
   - ISS for now
   - fingersticks QID
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - need to clarify home regimen
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure and had a recent hospital course complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR), and development of sinus pauses on telemetry, raising concern for sick sinus syndrome.

The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has been persistently hypercarbic but has shown improvement on serial arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. She is currently on a shovel mask with oxygen saturation (O2 sat) of 96% with the mask off. The patient still has rales on lung examination, indicating the presence of fluid in the lungs.

The assessment and plan include addressing respiratory failure, hypertension, rhythm disturbances, nutrition, mental status changes, infection, acute renal failure (ARF), diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection, heart failure exacerbation, sick sinus syndrome, hypertension, electrolyte imbalances, and renal dysfunction."

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure and subsequently intubated. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and the development of sinus pauses on telemetry, raising concerns for sick sinus syndrome.

The patient has shown improvement in her condition, including extubation and thoracentesis with removal of 1.6 liters of fluid. She remains hypercarbic but is currently on a shovel mask with oxygen saturation of 96% with the mask on. The patient continues to have rales on lung examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, related to infection and heart failure. She is currently on a shovel mask with 02 sats 96% with the mask off. Continued rales on lung exam indicate ongoing pulmonary issues.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient had bilateral pleural effusions, which were drained through thoracentesis. However, there is a possibility of recurrence or complications related to the effusions.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history significant for congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure and subsequently intubated. The patient's recent hospital course has been complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and the development of sinus pauses on telemetry, raising concerns for sick sinus syndrome.

The patient underwent thoracentesis on Sunday, with the removal of 1.6 liters of fluid. She remains hypercarbic but has shown improvement on serial arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. She is currently on a shovel mask with oxygen saturation of 96% while the mask is off. Rales are still present on lung examination.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, related to infection and heart failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and serial ABG analysis is recommended. Weaning off the shovel mask should be considered based on the patient's progress.

2. Pleural Effusion: The patient had bilateral pleural effusions, which were treated with thoracentesis. Serial chest X-rays should be performed to monitor any recurrence or worsening of the effusions. Pleural fluid culture and analysis should also be conducted.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history significant for congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure and developed persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and episodes of sinus pauses on telemetry, which raised concern for sick sinus syndrome.

The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. She underwent thoracentesis on Sunday, with removal of 1.6 liters of fluid. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 163/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. Physical examination findings include a holosystolic murmur at the apex, crackles in the lungs, pitting edema in all four extremities, and decreased bowel sounds.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood chemistry values indicate an elevated blood glucose level but within normal ranges for other parameters such as sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. The arterial blood gas analysis reveals hypercarbia.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure, hypertension, rhythm disturbances, nutritional support,"

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure likely multifactorial, related to infection and heart failure. She has undergone thoracentesis, with removal of 1.6 liters of fluid. The patient continues to show hypercarbia although improved on serial arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. She is currently on a low-flow oxygen mask with an oxygen saturation (O2 sat) of 96%. Rales are still present on lung examination.

The plan includes continuing to follow ABGs, weaning off oxygen as tolerated, and repeating chest X-ray today to look for any changes. The decision to continue antibiotic therapy will be made based on the results of the repeat chest X-ray. Pleural fluid culture is pending, and the patient is being given 20 mg IV lasix today. Better blood pressure control is necessary to prevent flash pulmonary edema.

Regarding the patient's hypertension, she was started on metoprolol tar"

","Based on the provided physician resident progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure due to H. influenza pneumonia and subsequent development of bilateral pleural effusions. The patient has also experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR) and sinus pauses on telemetry, raising concerns for sick sinus syndrome.

The patient's current condition includes persistent respiratory failure, bibasilar opacities and left pleural effusion on chest X-ray (CXR), and poorly controlled hypertension despite medication. The patient has undergone thoracentesis, removing 1.6 liters of fluid, completed a course of Zosyn antibiotic, and is currently on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen support.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and medical history include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function and oxygenation, potentially necessitating increased respiratory support or mechanical ventilation.
2. Pleural effusion: The presence of a left pleural effusion may require additional interventions such as pleurodesis or repeated thoracentesis to manage symptoms and prevent complications like infection or recurrent effusion.
3. Hypertension: The patient's poorly"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o F with PMHx significant for dCHF, HTN, HL, DM, who was admitted
   OSH with respiratory failure, intubated. Recent hospital course
   complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural
   effusions, Afib with RVR and development of sinus pauses on telemetry
   raising concern for sick sinus syndrome.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely multifactorial, related to H. influenza
   pneumonia and heart failure. Now, s/p extubation. Also, s/p
   thoracentesis, with removal of 1.6 L of fluid. Completed course of
   Zosyn. Currently on 4L NC. CXR bibasilar opacities and left pleural
   effusion.
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - pleural fluid cx NGTD; f/u further results
   - diurese with Lasix 40 mg IV
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - treat hypertension as below
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt noted to be hypertensive recently.  Started on
   metoprolol tartrate 25 mg [**Hospital1 7**] and amlodipine 5 mg daily yesterday.
   Still hypertensive this morning.
   - increasing amlodipine to 10 mg daily
   - consider hydral vs clonidine patch if BP remains under poor control
   .
   # Rhythm: As above, the patient has been noted to have episodes of both
   a.fib with RVR as well as sinus pauses on telemetry. This is concerning
   for sick sinus syndrome. Pacer wire has been pulled.
   - continue telemetry
   - Continue heparin GTT for now
   - need to weigh risks vs. benefits of long term anticoagulation with
   Coumadin; will d/w patient
   .
   # Nutrition:
   - S/S recommending ground diet
   .
   # MS- baseline fully functional prior to hospitalization. Slowly
   improving. Likely related to prolonged hospitalization with extended
   intubation.
   -serial exams
   .
   # ARF: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 54**] [**Last Name (un) 303**] labs, baseline Cr ranges between 0.8 and 1.0.
   Currently, Cr is 1.0. Likely was initially elevated [**12-30**] poor forward
   flow in the setting of CHF.
   - continue to trend creatinine
   .
   # Diabetes: Unclear of pt's home regimen.
   - ISS for now
   - fingersticks QID
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - need to clarify home regimen
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily

","Based on the provided physician resident progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history significant for congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by persistent respiratory failure, bilateral pleural effusions, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR), and the development of sinus pauses on telemetry, raising concern for sick sinus syndrome.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure likely due to multifactorial causes such as H. influenza pneumonia and heart failure. She is now post-extubation and underwent thoracentesis, removing 1.6 liters of fluid. The patient has completed her course of antibiotics (Zosyn) and is currently on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. A chest X-ray shows bibasilar opacities and left pleural effusion.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient has hypertension that is not well-controlled despite being on metoprolol tartrate and amlodipine. There is a plan to increase the dose of amlodipine to 10 mg daily and consider alternative antihypertensive options if blood pressure remains poorly controlled.

The patient also has episodes of both Afib with RVR and sinus pauses on telemetry,"
