   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Please see original ICU admission note from Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] dated [**2129-5-21**].
   In brief, 77 yo male with recent VRE bacteremia (from PICC line) and C.
   diff infection
 in early [**Month (only) 807**] who was sent to rehab then  left AMA
   from [**Hospital1 238**]. It seems that at home he became  profoundly dehydrated. He
   called EMS and was hypotensive then PEA in the field with cardiac
   arrest. Went to Green team. He was initially cooled, then stopped.
   Extubated ICU day 2. Post arrest Echo with septal ant and partial
   inferior HK and LVEF 35%, RV free wall HK, and 2+ MR.
   [**Name13 (STitle) **] had a HCT drop from 32 to 22 but had recent [**Last Name (un) **] in [**Month (only) 51**] and plan was
   capsiule endo then outpt follow up unless rebleeds. He was  transferred
   to floor on ICU day 3
 [**5-23**]. His mental status waxed and waned but at
   times reported to be as good as A and O x 3. OIn the floor his main
   issues were aspiration and non anion gap acidosis. On the AM of [**4-24**] he
   had an episode of hand clenching tremor, ECG with new changes lat TWI
   and + trop 0.5 so treated as NSTEMI
 EEG dome without epileptiform
   changes. Head CT without acute change. Overnight [**5-25**] to [**5-26**] dropping
   UOP, and BP and tx to MICU for further management.
   On arrival to MICU, hypothermic to 92, clamped down, poor mental
   status.

   also been an acvute PE on [**5-25**] when he had the non spec ECG changes
   since he has known RV thrombus and hx of DVT and IVC filter but has not
   been anticoag. This would also favor adding pre load challenge.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of recent VRE bacteremia and C. diff infection, who presented to the hospital with profound dehydration. He experienced a cardiac arrest in the field and was resuscitated. Post-resuscitation, he had a significant drop in hemoglobin levels and was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction. He also had an episode of hand clenching tremor, ECG changes, and positive troponin levels, indicating a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was treated with medication for the NSTEMI and underwent an EEG and head CT, which showed no acute changes. He was transferred to the floor but developed hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. He was returned to the ICU due to worsening mental status and hypothermia. On arrival, he had cool extremities, poor capillary refill, and cyanotic toes and fingers. He also had a large ulceration over his right heel. His neurological status has been fluctuating, with periods of good alertness and orientation. His vital signs have been unstable, with low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and rapid breathing. He requires respiratory support with a nasal cannula. He has multiple comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and a history of deep vein thrombosis with an inferior vena cava filter in place.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with hypotension and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypothermia. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and has been monitored closely in the ICU. Review of the lab results indicates abnormalities in various parameters such as hemoglobin, leukocyte count, creatinine, glucose levels, liver enzymes, and electrolytes. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and altered mental status could be indicative of sepsis, especially considering the recent antibiotic administration. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Organ dysfunction: The abnormalities in lab parameters, such as elevated creatinine levels, may suggest organ dysfunction, particularly kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of organ functions and appropriate interventions are necessary.
3. Hypothermia: The patient's current temperature is below the normal range, indicating hypothermia. This can lead to various complications if not promptly addressed.
4. Delirium: Although the patient's mental status is described as ""altered"" rather than ""delirious,"" it is important to consider the possibility of delirium due to the patient's critical condition and the presence of multiple risk factors.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided information"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 73 yo man with h/o PVD, DM, CAD, and recent C diff who
   presented s/p intubation and PEA arrest thought to be [**1-3**] dehydration
   from cdiff infection.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock
 this is the likely etiology for the patient
   hypotension and hypothermia.  The fact that the patient has been
   afebrile, that he has not had a bump in WBC, and that his urine and
   blood cultures have been negative all point away from infection as the
   cause of his hypotension.
   - Overnight, pt got 1 unit blood, a 500 cc saline bolus, and a 250 cc
   saline bolus.  During this time, he also had an increase in his mixed
   venouse O2 ( 43 -> 52 -> 59).
   - Some urine and blood cultures still pending
 will follow up on them
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotic treatment at this point with
   daptomycin, zosyn, PO vanc, and zosyn.
   - Will also continue to use the warming blanket to keep the patient
   temperature WNL.
   # Encephalopathy: EEG showing global encephalopathy, and patient is
   nonvocal this morning with some residual motor and CN defects as noted
   above.  Patient has many reasons for encephalopathy including recent
   NSTEMI, incompleted treated VRE bacteremia, recurrent c. diff, and
   history of CVA now in the setting of hypotension.  Per Neurology,
   current AMS and neurologic deficits may represent recrudescence of
   defects from prior CVA in the setting of hypotension.
   - Appreciate Neuro recommendations
   - Continue to follow neuro exam q2h
   - MRI/MRA head once HD stable
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis: Most likely RTA as diarrhea improved and
   bicarb had been worsening.
   - Urine AG, urine pH
   - Continue to follow stool output
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Continue isotonic bicarb vs PO per renal recs as needed
   # Hypernatremia: Likely lack of free water.
   - Will continue to trend
   - Free water boluses via NGT prn
   # Coagulopathy: Worse than prior. Likely a combination of malnutrition,
   infectious process and ongoing etoh abuse.
   - One dose vitamin K now
   - Continue to trend
   - Nutrition consult for TF recs once NGT in place
   # C. diff colitis: Diarrhea much improved.  Was started on treatment
   for recurrence w/ PO flagyl since [**2129-5-3**], due to be discontinued on
   [**5-25**] once all other antibiotics were discontinued.  Was on PO
   vancomycin during this admission since [**5-21**], but given aspiration, he
   has not rec'd this for the last 24H. No fever spikes, no leukocytosis.
   - NGT for oral meds including PO vanc
   - Continue IV flagyl for now, consider dc as may represent failure
   - Continue to monitor stool output, abdominal exam
   - Resend c. diff stool ag
   # Anemia: Currently stable post-10 point drop.  Has only had one unit
   transfusion this admission on [**5-25**] in the setting of NSTEMI.  Iron
   studies consistent with AOCD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Cont folate
   # CAD w/ current NSTEMI: Troponin continues to increase, but appears to
   be plateauing - last 0.52. CK and MB fraction stable. Rec'd ASA PR, BB
   and attempted statin in the setting of acute event (unable to tolerate
   statin PO due to aspiration).  ECG showing old RBBB w/ ST depression
   and TWI in precordial leads.
   - Medical management as tolerated including IV BB with holding
   parameters given hypotension
   - Hold ASA for now as NPO and history of major GI bleed last month
   - Will send fasting lipids, will likely need statin once able to take
   PO medications or prior to discharge
   - Daily ECGs
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Only ECHO in OMR showing regional LV
   systolic dysfunction c/w CAD w/ EF of 35%.  Medical management limited
   at this time given hypotention.  CXR on admission to MICU c/w pulm
   edema.  Also has LV apical aneurysmal dilatation and interatrial septal
   aneurysm.
   - Hold on further IVF for now
   - Will likely benefit from ACEi once stabilized and hypotension has
   resolved
   - Repeat ECHO in the setting of NSTEMI to assess for worsening failure
   given hypotension/?cardiogenic etiology
   - Could consider anticoagulation given apical aneursym, though with
   history of major GI bleed in recent past and ongoing alcohol abuse at
   home, not a good candidate at this time.
   # Oliguria/acute on chronic renal failure: Likely in the setting of
   hypoperfusion/ATN/RTA. ? pyelo and bilateral renal infarcts on CT
   abdomen.
   - Urine sediment/culture
   - Continue to monitor UOP
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Repeat renal imaging at some point to eval findings on CT prior
   - Hold on further IVF given evidence of pulm edema on CXR
   # Foot ulcer: Followed by podiatry
   - Cont dry dressing
   - Appreciate podiatry recs/mgmt
   # DM type 2 w/ complications:
   - Continue HISS, last A1C was 6% in [**7-9**]
   # COPD: Continue standing inhaler q6hrs (albuterol and atrovent)
   # FEN: Will need NGT for tube feeds, oral meds.
   - Nutrition c/s for TF recommendations
   - Continue prn isotonic bicarb as above
   - Cont folate/thiamine given history of etoh abuse
   # Access: RIJ placed [**5-21**], will need to be replaced if central access
   continues to be necessary.
   # PPX: SQ heparin tid, bowel regimen prn, [**Hospital1 **] PPI

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 HYPOTHERMIA
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a 73 yo man with h/o PVD, DM, CAD,
   and recent C diff who presented s/p intubation and PEA arrest thought
   to be [**1-3**] dehydration from cdiff infection.
   .
   # Hypotension/hypothermia: Unclear precipitant.  Patient has neurologic
   abnormalities concerning for central process though this may be a
   result of his hypotension/?infection.  He has not had any fever spikes
   or hypothermia prior, has no leukocytosis and had been hemodyamically
   stable until this morning.  New petechiae in combination with AMS and
   neurologic abnormalities and hypotension/hypothermia concerning for
   global process such as DIC.  UA, CXR and blood cultures have been
   negative to date.  Foot lesion does not appear acutely infected. Recent
   TTE showed no evidence of endocarditis.
   - DIC labs
   - Send infectious work up including CXR, UA/ucx, blood cultures
   - Will cover with broad spectrum abx for now to cover patient's known
   bugs: daptomycin given incompletely treated VRE bacteremia which will
   cover gram pos organisms and Zosyn given h/o of pseudomonas and for
   broad gram neg and anaerobes
   - Cont c. diff treatment with vanc PO and flagyl
   - Continue warming
   # Encephalopathy: EEG showing global encephalopathy, and patient is
   nonvocal this morning with some residual motor and CN defects as noted
   above.  Patient has many reasons for encephalopathy including recent
   NSTEMI, incompleted treated VRE bacteremia, recurrent c. diff, and
   history of CVA now in the setting of hypotension.  Per Neurology,
   current AMS and neurologic deficits may represent recrudescence of
   defects from prior CVA in the setting of hypotension.
   - Appreciate Neuro recommendations
   - Continue to follow neuro exam q2h
   - MRI/MRA head once HD stable
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis: Most likely RTA as diarrhea improved and
   bicarb had been worsening.
   - Urine AG, urine pH
   - Continue to follow stool output
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Continue isotonic bicarb vs PO per renal recs as needed
   # Hypernatremia: Likely lack of free water.
   - Will continue to trend
   - Free water boluses via NGT prn
   # Coagulopathy: Worse than prior. Likely a combination of malnutrition,
   infectious process and ongoing etoh abuse.
   - One dose vitamin K now
   - Continue to trend
   - Nutrition consult for TF recs once NGT in place
   # C. diff colitis: Diarrhea much improved.  Was started on treatment
   for recurrence w/ PO flagyl since [**2129-5-3**], due to be discontinued on
   [**5-25**] once all other antibiotics were discontinued.  Was on PO
   vancomycin during this admission since [**5-21**], but given aspiration, he
   has not rec'd this for the last 24H. No fever spikes, no leukocytosis.
   - NGT for oral meds including PO vanc
   - Continue IV flagyl for now, consider dc as may represent failure
   - Continue to monitor stool output, abdominal exam
   - Resend c. diff stool ag
   # Anemia: Currently stable post-10 point drop.  Has only had one unit
   transfusion this admission on [**5-25**] in the setting of NSTEMI.  Iron
   studies consistent with AOCD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Cont folate
   # CAD w/ current NSTEMI: Troponin continues to increase, but appears to
   be plateauing - last 0.52. CK and MB fraction stable. Rec'd ASA PR, BB
   and attempted statin in the setting of acute event (unable to tolerate
   statin PO due to aspiration).  ECG showing old RBBB w/ ST depression
   and TWI in precordial leads.
   - Medical management as tolerated including IV BB with holding
   parameters given hypotension
   - Hold ASA for now as NPO and history of major GI bleed last month
   - Will send fasting lipids, will likely need statin once able to take
   PO medications or prior to discharge
   - Daily ECGs
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Only ECHO in OMR showing regional LV
   systolic dysfunction c/w CAD w/ EF of 35%.  Medical management limited
   at this time given hypotention.  CXR on admission to MICU c/w pulm
   edema.  Also has LV apical aneurysmal dilatation and interatrial septal
   aneurysm.
   - Hold on further IVF for now
   - Will likely benefit from ACEi once stabilized and hypotension has
   resolved
   - Repeat ECHO in the setting of NSTEMI to assess for worsening failure
   given hypotension/?cardiogenic etiology
   - Could consider anticoagulation given apical aneursym, though with
   history of major GI bleed in recent past and ongoing alcohol abuse at
   home, not a good candidate at this time.
   # Oliguria/acute on chronic renal failure: Likely in the setting of
   hypoperfusion/ATN/RTA. ? pyelo and bilateral renal infarcts on CT
   abdomen.
   - Urine sediment/culture
   - Continue to monitor UOP
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Repeat renal imaging at some point to eval findings on CT prior
   - Hold on further IVF given evidence of pulm edema on CXR
   # Foot ulcer: Followed by podiatry
   - Cont dry dressing
   - Appreciate podiatry recs/mgmt
   # DM type 2 w/ complications:
   - Continue HISS, last A1C was 6% in [**7-9**]
   # COPD: Continue standing inhaler q6hrs (albuterol and atrovent)
   # FEN: Will need NGT for tube feeds, oral meds.
   - Nutrition c/s for TF recommendations
   - Continue prn isotonic bicarb as above
   - Cont folate/thiamine given history of etoh abuse
   # Access: RIJ placed [**5-21**], will need to be replaced if central access
   continues to be necessary.
   # PPX: SQ heparin tid, bowel regimen prn, [**Hospital1 **] PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and recent Clostridium difficile infection. He presented with post-intubation pulseless electrical activity arrest, which was thought to be due to dehydration from the C. difficile infection. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, hypothermia, hypotension, and neurologic abnormalities, which are concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension/Hypothermia: The patient has neurologic abnormalities and hypotension/hypothermia, which are concerning for global processes such as DIC. DIC labs, infectious workup including chest X-ray, urinalysis, and blood cultures should be sent. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be covered, including daptomycin for incomplete treated vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus bacteremia, and Zosyn for pseudomonas coverage.
2. Encephalopathy: EEG shows global encephalopathy, and the patient is nonvocal with some residual motor and cranial nerve defects. Recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), incomplete treated VRE bacteremia, recurrent C. difficile, and history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) are contributing factors. Neurology recommendations should be appreciated, and the neuro exam should be followed every 2 hours. An MRI/MRA head once hem"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 73 yo man with h/o PVD, DM, CAD, and recent C diff who
   presented s/p intubation and PEA arrest thought to be [**1-3**] dehydration
   from cdiff infection.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock
 this is the likely etiology for the patient
   hypotension.  The fact that the patient has been afebrile, that he has
   not had a bump in WBC, that he has not been hypothermic, and that his
   urine and blood cultures have been negative all point away from
   infection as the cause of his hypotension.
   - Overnight, pt got 1 unit blood, a 500 cc saline bolus, and a 250 cc
   saline bolus.  During this time, he also had an increase in his mixed
   venouse O2 ( 43 -> 52 -> 59).
   - Will give another 250 cc bolus of NS.  Will check mixed venous O2 sat
   after infusion.
   - Some urine and blood cultures still pending
 will follow up on them
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotic treatment at this point with
   daptomycin, zosyn, PO vanc, and zosyn.  Monitor to make sure that
   patient does not have a hidden infection that will declare itself.
   # Renal Failure
   - will continue to monitore patient
s urine output
 if he does produce
   urine, can get urine electrolytes
   - will follow-up on renal recommendations
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis
   - likely secondary to RTA type 4
   - will continue to follow renal recommendations

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and recent Clostridium difficile infection. He presented after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is currently in the ICU. The patient's cardiogenic shock is the likely cause of his hypotension, as other potential causes such as infection have been ruled out based on his clinical presentation and laboratory results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and biventricular hypokinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10% indicate cardiogenic shock. This condition can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

2. Thrombus in Right Ventricle: The presence of a thrombus in the right ventricle apex increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if it dislodges and travels to the pulmonary circulation.

3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated serum creatinine level and decreased urine output suggest acute kidney injury. This condition can progress to renal failure if not managed promptly.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium level indicates hypernatremia. Rapid correction of sodium levels can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, so careful management is necessary.

5. C. difficile Colitis: The patient's recent history of C. difficile infection and ongoing symptoms require continued treatment"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 73 yo man with h/o PVD, DM, CAD, and recent C diff who
   presented s/p intubation and PEA arrest thought to be [**1-3**] dehydration
   from cdiff infection.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock
 this is the likely etiology for the patient
   hypotension and hypothermia.  The fact that the patient has been
   afebrile, that he has not had a bump in WBC, and that his urine and
   blood cultures have been negative all point away from infection as the
   cause of his hypotension.
   - Overnight, pt got 1 unit blood, a 500 cc saline bolus, and a 250 cc
   saline bolus.  During this time, he also had an increase in his mixed
   venouse O2 ( 43 -> 52 -> 59).
   - Will give another 250 cc bolus of NS.  Will check mixed venous O2 sat
   after infusion.
   - Some urine and blood cultures still pending
 will follow up on them
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotic treatment at this point with
   daptomycin, zosyn, PO vanc, and zosyn.
   - Will also continue to use the warming blanket to keep the patient
   temperature WNL.
   # Hypernatremia
   - Sodium currently 148.  Expect that sodium may decrease with
   additional 250 cc bolus of normal saline.
   - Will continue to monitor patient
s sodium levels.
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis: Most likely RTA as diarrhea improved and
   bicarb had been worsening.
   - Urine AG, urine pH
   - Continue to follow stool output
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Continue isotonic bicarb vs PO per renal recs as needed
   # Encephalopathy: EEG showing global encephalopathy., and patient is
   nonvocal this morning with some residual motor and CN defects as noted
   above.  Patient has many reasons for encephalopathy including recent
   NSTEMI, incompleted treated VRE bacteremia, recurrent c. diff, and
   history of CVA now in the setting of hypotension.  Per Neurology,
   current AMS and neurologic deficits may represent recrudescence of
   defects from prior CVA in the setting of hypotension.
   - Will follow neuron recommendations.
   - Continue to follow neuro exam q2h.
   # Coagulopathy: Worse than prior. Likely a combination of malnutrition,
   infectious process and ongoing etoh abuse.
   - One dose vitamin K now
   - Continue to trend
   - Nutrition consult for TF recs once NGT in place
   # C. diff colitis: Diarrhea much improved.  Was started on treatment
   for recurrence w/ PO flagyl since [**2129-5-3**], due to be discontinued on
   [**5-25**] once all other antibiotics were discontinued.  Was on PO
   vancomycin during this admission since [**5-21**], but given aspiration, he
   has not rec'd this for the last 24H. No fever spikes, no leukocytosis.
   - NGT for oral meds including PO vanc
   - Continue IV flagyl for now, consider dc as may represent failure
   - Continue to monitor stool output, abdominal exam
   - Resend c. diff stool ag
   # Anemia: Currently stable post-10 point drop.  Has only had one unit
   transfusion this admission on [**5-25**] in the setting of NSTEMI.  Iron
   studies consistent with AOCD.
   - Continue to trend
   - Cont folate
   # CAD w/ current NSTEMI: Troponin continues to increase, but appears to
   be plateauing - last 0.52. CK and MB fraction stable. Rec'd ASA PR, BB
   and attempted statin in the setting of acute event (unable to tolerate
   statin PO due to aspiration).  ECG showing old RBBB w/ ST depression
   and TWI in precordial leads.
   - Medical management as tolerated including IV BB with holding
   parameters given hypotension
   - Hold ASA for now as NPO and history of major GI bleed last month
   - Will send fasting lipids, will likely need statin once able to take
   PO medications or prior to discharge
   - Daily ECGs
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Only ECHO in OMR showing regional LV
   systolic dysfunction c/w CAD w/ EF of 35%.  Medical management limited
   at this time given hypotention.  CXR on admission to MICU c/w pulm
   edema.  Also has LV apical aneurysmal dilatation and interatrial septal
   aneurysm.
   - Hold on further IVF for now
   - Will likely benefit from ACEi once stabilized and hypotension has
   resolved
   - Repeat ECHO in the setting of NSTEMI to assess for worsening failure
   given hypotension/?cardiogenic etiology
   - Could consider anticoagulation given apical aneursym, though with
   history of major GI bleed in recent past and ongoing alcohol abuse at
   home, not a good candidate at this time.
   # Oliguria/acute on chronic renal failure: Likely in the setting of
   hypoperfusion/ATN/RTA. ? pyelo and bilateral renal infarcts on CT
   abdomen.
   - Urine sediment/culture
   - Continue to monitor UOP
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Repeat renal imaging at some point to eval findings on CT prior
   - Hold on further IVF given evidence of pulm edema on CXR
   # Foot ulcer: Followed by podiatry
   - Cont dry dressing
   - Appreciate podiatry recs/mgmt
   # DM type 2 w/ complications:
   - Continue HISS, last A1C was 6% in [**7-9**]
   # COPD: Continue standing inhaler q6hrs (albuterol and atrovent)
   # FEN: Will need NGT for tube feeds, oral meds.
   - Nutrition c/s for TF recommendations
   - Continue prn isotonic bicarb as above
   - Cont folate/thiamine given history of etoh abuse
   # Access: RIJ placed [**5-21**], will need to be replaced if central access
   continues to be necessary.
   # PPX: SQ heparin tid, bowel regimen prn, [**Hospital1 **] PPI

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. He presented with post-intubation and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was thought to be caused by dehydration from C. diff infection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to hypotension and hypothermia. This is supported by the fact that he has been afebrile, with no significant increase in white blood cell count, and negative urine and blood cultures, suggesting that infection is not the primary cause of his hypotension.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level of 148. This is expected to decrease with the administration of a 250 cc bolus of normal saline.

3. Non-AG Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a non-AG metabolic acidosis, most likely due to renal tubular acidosis (RTA), as diarrhea has improved and bicarbonate levels have been worsening. Monitoring urine AG, urine pH, and stool output is important. Isotonic bicarbonate may be given as needed.

4. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing encephalopathy, possibly due to recent non-ST-elevation myocardial inf"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 73 yo man with h/o PVD, DM, CAD, and recent C diff who
   presented s/p intubation and PEA arrest thought to be [**1-3**] dehydration
   from cdiff infection.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock
 this is the likely etiology for the patient
   hypotension.  The fact that the patient has been afebrile, that he has
   not had a bump in WBC, that he has not been hypothermic, and that his
   urine and blood cultures have been negative all point away from
   infection as the cause of his hypotension.
   - Overnight, pt got 1 unit blood, a 500 cc saline bolus, and a 250 cc
   saline bolus.  During this time, he also had an increase in his mixed
   venouse O2 ( 43 -> 52 -> 59).
   - Will give another 250 cc bolus of NS.  Will check mixed venous O2 sat
   after infusion.
   - Some urine and blood cultures still pending
 will follow up on them
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotic treatment at this point with
   daptomycin, zosyn, PO vanc, and zosyn.  Monitor to make sure that
   patient does not have a hidden infection that will declare itself.
   # Renal Failure
   - will continue to monitore patient
s urine output
 if he does produce
   urine, can get urine electrolytes
   - will follow-up on renal recommendations
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis
   - likely secondary to RTA type 4
   - will continue to follow renal recommendations
   - continue bicarb PO BID
   # Altered Mental Status
   - this is likely due to a global encephalopathy and not a seizure, as
   patient
s mental status changes with his physical condition
   # Coagulopathy.
   - Gave one does of vitamin K yesterday
   - Continue to trend coag
   # Hypernatremia
   - Sodium currently 148.  Expect that sodium may decrease with
   additional 250 cc bolus of normal saline.  Will also increase free
   water boluses.
   - Will continue to monitor patient
s sodium levels.
   # C. diff colitis
   - will keep pt on PO vanc and IV flagyl for now
   # Anemia
   - will continue to monitor Hct
   # CAD w/ current NSTEMI
   - can
t give pt ASA because h/o GI bleed and pt can
t tolerate PO
   statin at this time
   # Foot ulcer
   - pt to continue to be seen by podiatry
   - will follow podiatry recommendations
   # DM
   - Will keep pt on insulin sliding scale
   # COPD
   - keep pt on current PRN inhaler
   # FEN
   - pt has NGT for feeds
   - follow-up nutrition recommendations for tube feedings

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. He presented after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was thought to be caused by dehydration from C. diff infection. The patient underwent intubation and resuscitation.

On admission, the patient was hypotensive and had poor perfusion with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 95/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. His physical examination revealed crackles in the right lower lung, distal lower extremity edema, and a soft non-tender abdomen.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), elevated platelet count, elevated troponin-T levels, and altered liver function tests. His arterial blood gas analysis indicated a pH of 7.42, pCO2 of 20 mmHg, pO2 of 102 mmHg, HCO3- of 13 mEq/L, and base excess of -8 mEq/L. The mixed venous oxygen saturation was initially 43% and increased to 59%.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 HYPOTHERMIA
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   1.       Hypotension
 likely cardiogenic failure progressing to shock.
   Echo has just retunred and shows severe biventricular function
 sig
   worse from [**5-23**] with new RV aneurysm. His mixed venous is 43 and CVP is
   only 5-  8. at this point since he did bump his BP to volume on Tx we
   will try transufins 1 U PRBC
 and small IVF blous tonight  trending
   SCVo2, CVP, lactate, MAPS.  One other though is that there may have
   also been an acvute PE on [**5-25**] when he had the non spec ECG changes
   since he has known RV thrombus and hx of DVT and IVC filter but has not
   been anticoag. This would also favor adding pre load challenge.
   2.       ARF: in setting of hypotension and very poor forward flow with
   also ? throwing clot to kidneys from LV clot and indeed he did get
   contrast for CTPE a few days ago.
   3.        Altered mental status: hypoperfusion and delirium seems most
   likely, with possible recrudescence of CVA
 no acute bleed or changes
   by CT and EEg with seizures. Will raise MAP and follow exam closely.
   POssibel MRI if no improvement but will have to watch closely.
   4.       GI Bleed: HCT stable at present but recent HCT drop and
   diverticular bleed in [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 807**]
 [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8414**] active anti coag at present.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is admitted to the ICU with complaints of hypotension and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for some noted events and conditions.

The patient experienced multi-lumen insertion on May 26th at 12:27 PM and underwent a trans-thoracic echo on the same day at 04:53 PM. Blood and gentle IV fluids were given, which resulted in an increase in the patient's superior vena cava oxygen saturation (SCVO2) from 42 to 59.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient received various antibiotics, including daptomycin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and metronidazole.

The patient is receiving multiple ICU medications, such as pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other medications. The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, but there are fluctuations in blood pressure. The patient's heart rate is elevated, and the mixed venous oxygen saturation is low.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,636 mL and output of 73 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, with an oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are within normal limits.

   worse from [**5-23**] with new RV aneurysm. His mixed venous is 43 and CVP is
   only 5-  8. at this point since he did bump his BP to volume on Tx we
   will try transufins 1 U PRBC
 and small IVF blous tonight  trending
   SCVo2, CVP, lactate, MAPS.  One other though is that there may have
   also been an acvute PE on [**5-25**] when he had the non spec ECG changes
   since he has known RV thrombus and hx of DVT and IVC filter but has not
   been anticoag. This would also favor adding pre load challenge.
   2.       ARF: in setting of hypotension and very poor forward flow with
   also ? throwing clot to kidneys from LV clot and indeed he did get
   contrast for CTPE a few days ago.
   3.        Altered mental status: hypoperfusion and delirium seems most
   likely, with possible recrudescence of CVA
 no acute bleed or changes
   by CT and EEg with seizures. Will raise MAP and follow exam closely.
   POssibel MRI if no improvement but will have to watch closely.
   4.       GI Bleed: HCT stable at present but recent HCT drop and
   diverticular bleed in [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 807**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with hypotension and congestive heart failure. The patient has undergone several interventions and tests, including blood transfusion, echocardiogram, and administration of various medications. 

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/74 mmHg to 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal range. The mixed venous oxygen saturation is between 43-59%, indicating poor tissue perfusion. 

The physical examination reveals coarse bilateral breath sounds with increased respiratory effort, soft hypoactive bowel sounds, cool extremities with poor capillary refill, and large ulceration over the right heel. Neurological examination shows minimal movement and non-responsive verbal output.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and hematocrit, as well as elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium and magnesium. Cardiac markers such as troponin-T and CK-MB are elevated.

The patient's condition is complicated by several potential medical complications. These include:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to severe biventricular dysfunction, as evidenced by the echocardiogram showing a new right ventricular aneurysm.
2. Acute"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing hypotension and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has a history of right ventricular thrombus and recent large gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates poor perfusion and may lead to organ dysfunction. It has been managed with blood and volume administration, which has improved the mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 80.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient's respiratory rate is elevated at 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula. ARF can occur due to hypotension, poor forward flow, and possible pulmonary edema associated with CHF.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has anuria (no urine output) and a history of recent contrast exposure for CT pulmonary embolism (CTPE). AKI can be caused by hypotension, decreased renal perfusion, and potential obstruction from a left ventricular clot.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status with limited response to commands. This could be due to hypoperfusion, delirium, or possible recurrence of a cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

5. GI Bleed: The patient had a recent diverticular bleed, which resulted in a significant drop in hemoglobin levels. Active anticoag"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and recent Clostridium difficile infection. He presented after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was thought to be secondary to dehydration from the C. difficile infection. However, cardiogenic shock is now considered the likely etiology for the patient's hypotension, as he has not shown signs of infection.

The patient's current condition includes renal failure, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, coagulopathy, hypernatremia, C. difficile colitis, anemia, coronary artery disease with current non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), foot ulcer, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and feeding intolerance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension is likely due to cardiogenic shock, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Renal failure: The patient is anuric, indicating a lack of urine output. Acute kidney injury (AKI) may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed appropriately.
3. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: This condition may be secondary to renal tubular acidosis (RTA) type 4 or other causes. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as hypok"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-inch-old individual with a chief complaint of altered mental status. They are currently in the ICU and have been receiving various treatments for their condition. The patient's urine electrolytes have been sent for analysis, and bicarbonate has been started due to acidosis. The patient is also being given increased PO bicarb. A dirty urinalysis was conducted, but the patient is already on vancomycin, zosyn, and daptomycin. Lactate levels were measured and were found to be stable at 2.0. Repeat electrolyte levels were requested at 2119 hours. The patient's prognosis is poor, and arrangements have been made to contact the priest and son regarding disposition first thing Saturday morning. The patient is anuric and will try to avoid hemodialysis. A consultation with Dr. [Last Name] (renal) has been scheduled for the morning. The patient's PPI was changed to Hospital1 dosing, and no new recommendations have been made by the neuro team. An MRI will be conducted when the patient is stable. The patient has no known drug allergies.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's anuria (absence of urine output) suggests a possible AKI. Further evaluation of renal function and ongoing monitoring are necessary to prevent and manage this complication.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 73 yo man with h/o PVD, DM, CAD, and recent C diff who
   presented s/p intubation and PEA arrest thought to be [**1-3**] dehydration
   from cdiff infection.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock
 this is the likely etiology for the patient
   hypotension.  The fact that the patient has been afebrile, that he has
   not had a bump in WBC, that he has not been hypothermic, and that his
   urine and blood cultures have been negative all point away from
   infection as the cause of his hypotension.
   - Overnight, pt got 1 unit blood, a 500 cc saline bolus, and a 250 cc
   saline bolus.  During this time, he also had an increase in his mixed
   venouse O2 ( 43 -> 52 -> 59).
   - Will give another 250 cc bolus of NS.  Will check mixed venous O2 sat
   after infusion.
   - Some urine and blood cultures still pending
 will follow up on them
   - Will continue broad spectrum antibiotic treatment at this point with
   daptomycin, zosyn, PO vanc, and zosyn.  Monitor to make sure that
   patient does not have a hidden infection that will declare itself.
   # Renal Failure
   - will continue to monitore patient
s urine output
 if he does produce
   urine, can get urine electrolytes
   - will follow-up on renal recommendations
   # Non-AG metabolic acidosis
   - likely secondary to RTA type 4
   - will continue to follow renal recommendations
   - continue bicarb PO BID
   # Altered Mental Status
   - this is likely due to a global encephalopathy and not a seizure, as
   patient
s mental status changes with his physical condition
   # Coagulopathy.
   - Gave one does of vitamin K yesterday
   - Continue to trend coag
   # Hypernatremia
   - Sodium currently 148.  Expect that sodium may decrease with
   additional 250 cc bolus of normal saline.  Will also increase free
   water boluses.
   - Will continue to monitor patient
s sodium levels.
   # C. diff colitis
   - will keep pt on PO vanc and IV flagyl for now
   # Anemia
   - will continue to monitor Hct
   # CAD w/ current NSTEMI
   - can
t give pt ASA because h/o GI bleed and pt can
t tolerate PO
   statin at this time
   # Foot ulcer
   - pt to continue to be seen by podiatry
   - will follow podiatry recommendations
   # DM
   - Will keep pt on insulin sliding scale
   # COPD
   - keep pt on current PRN inhaler
   # FEN
   - pt has NGT for feeds
   - follow-up nutrition recommendations for tube feedings

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff) who presented after intubation and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest thought to be secondary to dehydration from C. diff infection. The patient's current condition is characterized by cardiogenic shock, renal failure, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, coagulopathy, hypernatremia, C. diff colitis, anemia, CAD with current non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), foot ulcer, DM, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and signs of poor organ perfusion indicate cardiogenic shock. This condition can lead to further deterioration in organ function and potentially death if not promptly addressed.

2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine and urine output indicate renal failure. This complication can worsen if the patient does not respond to treatment and may require dialysis.

3. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's low bicarbonate level and low base excess suggest non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. This condition can be caused by various factors, including lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, or gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss"
