   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia who presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated upon transfer to the ICU.

The differential diagnosis for the patient's hypercapnic respiratory failure includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The chest X-ray shows bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or pneumonia. The patient has been given IV lasix, which seemed to improve the CXR.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pleural effusions: The patient is on Lasix 60mg PO qd at home, and the differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, diabetic nephropathy causing retention of fluid, and hypothyroidism. The patient received 100mg IV lasix before transit to the unit, which seemed to improve the CXR.

2. Possible pneumonia: The patient has a high risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia due to being in the hospital for 2 days. She has a recent history of lingular pneumonia treated with levofloxacin. She has been afebrile without an increased WBC and no subjective cough. The patient is currently on aztreonam and cipro"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia who presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure. She was intubated upon transfer to the ICU. The differential includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema. The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or pneumonia. She is on baseline Lasix at home and received 100mg IV Lasix upon transfer, which improved her CXR. She remains afebrile without WBC, but hosp-acquired pneumonia should be considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires close monitoring and management of her ventilation parameters.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient's history of chronic fluid retention and recent Lasix administration may indicate underlying conditions such as congestive heart failure, fluid overload, diabetic nephropathy, or hypothyroidism. Close monitoring of I+Os with a goal of at least -1L is recommended.
3. Possible Pneumonia: The patient's risk for hosp-acquired pneumonia should be closely monitored, especially given her recent history of lingular pneumonia and prolonged hospital stay. Antibiotics have been started, but further evaluation and management are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic
   renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal
   blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth
   Levofloxacin who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  CXR shows bilateral basilar densities that could
   represent pleural effusions or pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg
   Lasix at home.  CXR looked better after she received 100mg IV lasix
   upon transfer, pointing more towards pleural effusions. She has
   remained afebrile without WBC as well, although hosp-acquired pneumonia
   should be considered as well.
   - Place a-line
   - Repeat ABGs
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium PRN as needed
   - consider chest CT in am depending on clinic status
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, diabetic
   nephropathy causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism. Received 100mg
   IV lasix before transit to unit with seemingly improved CXR.
   - IV lasix 100mg
   - Monitor closely I+Os with goal of -1L.
   .
   #Possible pneumonia: She has a high risk of hosp-acquired pneumonia as
   she has been in the hospital for 2 days.  She has a recent hx of
   lingular pneumonia s/p levofloxacin treatment.  She has been afebrile
   without an increased WBC and no subjective cough.
   - In the setting of her penicillin allergy and risk for HAP, she was
   placed on aztreonam 1000mg IV q8h and cipro 400mg IV q24h.
   - Monitor temps and WBC.  If she spikes, obtain blood cx x2.
   - Obtain sputum culture.
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences.
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - Currently on nifedipine 90mg PO qd
   - Consider adding back Losartan 100mg po qd and metoprolol 100mg po bid
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On warfarin for anticoagulation
   - continue Warfarin.
   .
   #Glaucoma:
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia
   - Continue simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis
   - Continue tylenol for pain control.
   - Consider oxycodone 2.5mg po q6h PRN if pain not controlled.

","The patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin. She presents to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure. The differential includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. Chest X-ray shows bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or pneumonia. She received 100mg IV Lasix upon transfer, which improved her CXR, suggesting pleural effusions rather than pneumonia. She has remained afebrile without WBC, but hosp-acquired pneumonia should be considered.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with the following settings: Vt (set) 500 mL, RR (set) 18, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 50%. Her current ABG shows pH 7.51, PaCO2 40 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio 176. Her physical examination reveals diminished lung sounds with crackles bilaterally, more on the left than right, and 2+ edema bilaterally.

The patient's laboratory results show a WBC of 7.9, Hct of 31.0, Plt of 241,000/mm3, Cr of 1.4, TropT of <0.01, TCO2 of 36, Glucose of 143 mg/dL, and a blood culture pending. Other labs including electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.

Based on the assessment and plan, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying cause, such as severe pneumonia or pulmonary edema, is not effectively treated.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient's pleural effusions may progress and cause respiratory compromise if not managed appropriately.
3. Possible Pneumonia: The patient is at high risk for hosp-acquired pneumonia, which could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and infection.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and if not controlled, it could increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
5. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes should be closely monitored to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, which can lead to further complications.
6. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function should be monitored to avoid any exacerbation of renal failure.
7. Spinal Stenosis: The patient's spinal stenosis may cause chronic pain or acute exacerbations, which could impact her overall condition.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional clinical details may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient was admitted with cardiogenic pulmonary edema but developed respiratory distress and hypoxemia, leading to being sent to the ICU. The patient's mental status worsened, and a chest X-ray revealed effusions. An arterial line was started twice during the 24-hour period. The patient has allergies to penicillins, aspirin, and ACE inhibitors. 

The patient received antibiotics (Aztreonam and Ciprofloxacin) within the past 24 hours. They were on infusions of fentanyl and midazolam. Other medications included pantoprazole (Protonix) and additional medications as per the flow sheet data.

Vital signs showed a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), current temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/58-192/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient was on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH 7.51, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 40 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 176, and oxygen consumption (VO2) 9.1 L/min. 

The physical examination revealed an intubated and sedated patient with heart sounds regular, decreased breath sounds in the lungs, benign abdomen, and non-edematous extremities. 

Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 7.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, platelet count of 264 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 143 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, glucose of 143 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances. The chest X-ray continued to show worsening effusions. 

The assessment and plan included respiratory failure, acute, not ARDS, with effusions, attempting to diurese and continuing antibiotics. Hypertension was also noted, with plans to diurese and continue anti-hypertensive medications. Diabetes mellitus was managed with insulin. In the ICU, the patient received total parenteral nutrition (TFs), glycemic control, and had various lines inserted, including an arterial line. Prophylaxis was given for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was also monitored."

   CXR today (my read): stable bilateral effusion, slight increase in
   peri-hilar fullness
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic
   renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal
   blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth
   Levofloxacin who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  CXR shows bilateral basilar densities that could
   represent pleural effusions or pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg
   Lasix at home.  CXR looked better yesterday after she received 100mg IV
   lasix upon transfer, pointing more towards pleural effusions. However,
   the sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, making penumonia
   another process likely contricuting to ger respiratory failure as well.
   - does well on AC, can transition to PS, monitor ABGs
   - get chest CT to further assess pleural effusions and any pulmonary
   infections
   - as sputum grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, continue vanc and levo,
   pt has pen allergies so CTX is not ordered
   - Change albuterol and ipratropium PRN to standing
   - Monitor temps and WBC.  If she spikes, obtain blood cx x2
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion (less
   likely) and ? malignant effusion. Pt received 120mg IV lasix yesterday,
   Cr bumped from 1.4 to 1.8
   - non-contrast chest CT today
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily
   - consider TTE to evalulate cardiac function
   - consider thoracentesis, coumadin on hold
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - Continue Losartan 100mg po qd and metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - Switched nifedipine to 10mg tid as the CR form cannot be crushed and
   given via NGT
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On warfarin for anticoagulation
   - hold coumadin given possible thoracentesis
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Continue tylenol for pain control
   - Consider oxycodone 2.5mg po q6h PRN if pain not controlled

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin. The patient was admitted to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure and is currently intubated.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. The ABG results show a PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, indicating hypercapnia. The CXR shows bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or pneumonia. The sputum culture grew out gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, suggesting possible pneumonia as a contributing factor to the respiratory failure.

2. Pleural effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which are causing respiratory distress. The BNP level is low, arguing against congestive heart failure as the major cause. The albumin level is normal, ruling out nephrotic syndrome. The possible differential diagnoses for the pleural effusion include chronic renal insufficiency, parapneumonic effusion, and malignancy. A non-contrast chest CT has been ordered to further assess"

   IMAGING:
   CXR today (my read)
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic
   renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal
   blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth
   Levofloxacin who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  CXR shows bilateral basilar densities that could
   represent pleural effusions or pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg
   Lasix at home.  CXR looked better yesterday after she received 100mg IV
   lasix upon transfer, pointing more towards pleural effusions. However,
   the sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, making penumonia
   another process likely contricuting to ger respiratory failure as well.
   - on AC, pt is a chronic CO2 retainer, so can back down on the RR and
   check repeat ABG
   - as sputum grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, continue vanc and levo,
   pt has pen allergies so CTX is not ordered
   - Change albuterol and ipratropium PRN to standing
   - Monitor temps and WBC.  If she spikes, obtain blood cx x2
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion and ?
   malignant effusion. Pt received 120mg IV lasix yesterday.
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily
   - TTE to evalulate cardiac function
   - consider thoracentesis, coumadin on hold
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - Continue Losartan 100mg po qd and metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - Switched nifedipine to 10mg tid
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On warfarin for anticoagulation
   - hold coumadin given possible thoracentesis
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Continue tylenol for pain control
   - Consider oxycodone 2.5mg po q6h PRN if pain not controlled

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia. The patient presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure and has been intubated.

The assessment and plan indicate several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated upon transfer to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The differential includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The chest X-ray shows bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or pneumonia. The patient received 100mg IV lasix upon transfer, which improved the appearance of the chest X-ray, suggesting pleural effusions. The sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, indicating possible pneumonia as well. The patient will continue on vancomycin and levofloxacin, and albuterol and ipratropium PRN will be added.

2. Pleural Effusions: The patient is on outpatient basis with Lasix 60mg PO qd. The differential includes congestive heart failure (CHF) with cardiac cause, fluid overload, chronic renal insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible"

   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion and ?
   malignant effusion. Pt received 120mg IV lasix yesterday.
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily
   - TTE to evalulate cardiac function
   - consider thoracentesis, coumadin on hold

   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences

   #Hypertension:
   - Continue Losartan 100mg po qd and metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - Switched nifedipine to 10mg tid

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia. She presents to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure.

The assessment and plan include:

1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated upon transfer to the ICU. The differential includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema. CXR shows bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or pneumonia. She is on baseline 60mg Lasix at home. CXR looked better yesterday after she received 100mg IV Lasix upon transfer, pointing more towards pleural effusions. However, the sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, making pneumonia another process likely contributing to her respiratory failure as well.

- Continue vancomycin and levofloxacin.
- Monitor temperatures and WBC. If she spikes, obtain blood culture x2.
- Follow-up cultures.
- Decrease RR and check repeat ABG.
- Consider thoracentesis.

2. Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, the patient is on Lasix 60mg PO qd. The differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and he is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and coagulopathy. He is also experiencing large effusions and possible pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 180/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's labs show elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal insufficiency. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antihypertensives, insulin, and other ICU medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. This can be a serious infection that requires prompt identification and treatment.

2. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids in the past 24 hours, with a total fluid input of 1,788 mL. This can lead to fluid overload, which may contribute to respiratory distress and worsen pulmonary edema.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's serum creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal insufficiency. AKI can occur due to various"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic
   renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal
   blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth
   Levofloxacin who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  CXR shows bilateral basilar densities that could
   represent pleural effusions or pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg
   Lasix at home.  CXR looked better yesterday after she received 100mg IV
   lasix upon transfer, pointing more towards pleural effusions. However,
   the sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, making penumonia
   another process likely contricuting to ger respiratory failure as well.
   - does well on AC, can transition to PS, monitor ABGs
   - get chest CT to further assess pleural effusions and any pulmonary
   infections
   - as sputum grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, continue vanc and levo,
   pt has pen allergies so CTX is not ordered
   - Change albuterol and ipratropium PRN to standing
   - Monitor temps and WBC.  If she spikes, obtain blood cx x2
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion (less
   likely) and ? malignant effusion. Pt received 120mg IV lasix yesterday,
   Cr bumped from 1.4 to 1.8
   - non-contrast chest CT today
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily
   - consider TTE to evalulate cardiac function
   - consider thoracentesis, coumadin on hold
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - Continue Losartan 100mg po qd and metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - Switched nifedipine to 10mg tid as the CR form cannot be crushed and
   given via NGT
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On warfarin for anticoagulation
   - hold coumadin given possible thoracentesis
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Continue tylenol for pain control
   - Consider oxycodone 2.5mg po q6h PRN if pain not controlled

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia who presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure. She was intubated upon transfer to the ICU. The differential diagnosis includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema. The patient is on baseline 60mg Lasix at home and received 100mg IV Lasix upon transfer. The sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, indicating possible pneumonia contributing to her respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral basilar densities on chest X-ray, which could represent pleural effusions or pneumonia. She is on outpatient basis with Lasix 60mg PO qd for pleural effusions. Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia, and malignant effusion.

2. Pneumonia: The sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, suggesting possible pneumonia. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin, but pen allergies have precluded the use of ceftriaxone.

3. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic
   renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal
   blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth
   Levofloxacin who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  CXR shows bilateral basilar densities that could
   represent pleural effusions or pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg
   Lasix at home.  CXR looked better yesterday after she received 100mg IV
   lasix upon transfer, pointing more towards pleural effusions. However,
   the sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, making pneumonia
   another process likely contributing to her respiratory failure as well.
   - does well on AC, can transition to PS, monitor ABGs
   - as sputum grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, continue vanc and levo,
   pt has pen allergies so CTX is not ordered
   - increase vanc to 1500mg
   - f/u with vanc trough
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium PRN as standing
   - Monitor temps and WBC.  If she spikes, obtain blood cx x2
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion (less
   likely) and ? malignant effusion. Pt received 120mg IV lasix yesterday,
   Cr bumped from 1.4 to 1.8
   - c/s IP for diagnostic tap
   - FFP/vit K to get INR <1.5 and hold warfarin
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily
   .
   #Acute renal failure: most likely due to lasix and diuresis.  Cr
   continues to increase to 1.9 today.
   - check urine lytes
   - renal u/s
   - hold losartan in setting of ARF
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - hold nifedipine and losartan
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On warfarin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - hold coumadin given thoracentesis tomorrow
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Continue tylenol for pain control
   - Consider oxycodone 2.5mg po q6h PRN if pain not controlled

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin. She presents to the hospital unit with hypercapnic respiratory failure.

The differential diagnosis for hypercapnic respiratory failure includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, and pulmonary edema.

The sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, making pneumonia another process likely contributing to her respiratory failure as well.

The patient is intubated and sedated, with bibasilar crackles on lung examination. Vital signs are stable, and she is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, indicating an ongoing infection. Blood cultures are pending. Imaging studies reveal significant increased effusions with associated atelectasis/collapse of the lower lobes, ETT tip 2.7cm from the carina, and smooth septal thickening consistent with edema. Valvular and chronic airway disease are also noted. Left adrenal thickening is seen as well.

   significant and bilateral lower lobe collapse.
   CXr--ETT good position, globular heart, large bilateral pleural
   effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo female with initial admission with chest pain--for evaluation of
   possible MI but with progression of respiratory failure patient to ICU
   for further care.  She has significant increase in bilateral effusions
   which may be contributing as possible.  Patient gives limited history
   of significant fever, bandemia interestingly and effusions to have a
   chronic presence and are bilateral arguing more for volume overload
   than acute pneumonic process or empyema.  She did have prominent
   hypercarbia as well as hypoxemia at the time of intubation.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])-This is related in part so
   relatively moderate effusions and more-so in regards to significant
   [**Hospital1 **]-lobar collapse with right and left lower lobes collapse and likely
   pneumonia.
   PEEP will be required to work to re-recruit the lower lobes
   bilaterally.  In addition, patient does have elevations in right heart
   pressures noted on past ECHO
   -Vanco/Levoflox for pneumonia
   -Albuterol is in place although resistance is normal
   -Will pursue diagsnostic thoracentesis
   -Will maintain PEEP and attempt prone position to look for capacity for
   recruitment
   2)Pleural Effusions
Does have bilateral pleural effusions without
   previous diagnostic tap at this time
   -Will maintaine negative fluid balance as possible
   -Will need diagnostic tap and will look to IP for support in completing
   procedure
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Will need urine lytes
   -Will need renal ultrasound
   -Will need to continue to monitor function, urine flow and acid/base
   electrolyte status going forward as negative fluid balance is desired.

   IMPRESSION: 1. Newly appeared moderate pleural effusions. 2. Subsequent
   bilateral dorsal atelectasis. 3. No relevant abnormalities in the
   ventilated lung parenchyma. 4. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube. 5.
   Minimal enlargement of the left adrenal without evidence of a mass
   lesion. Small left renal cyst.
   Renal U/S:
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of stones or hydronephrosis within either
   kidney.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic
   renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal
   blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth
   Levofloxacin who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  CXR shows bilateral basilar densities that could
   represent pleural effusions or pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg
   Lasix at home. sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters,
   making pneumonia another process likely contributing to her respiratory
   failure as well.
   - decrease RR to 10
   - if she does well on AC, can transition to PS, monitor ABGs
   - as sputum grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, continue vanc and levo
   (d3), pt has pen allergies so CTX is not ordered
   - f/u with vanc trough
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium PRN as standing
   - Monitor temps and WBC.  If she spikes, obtain blood cx x2
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion and
   malignant effusion. Cr came down from 1.9 to 1.8.
   - f/u with [**Female First Name (un) 231**] results
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily for I/O goal of even
   .
   #Acute renal failure: most likely due to lasix and diuresis.  FeNa was
   0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.  IVF bolus for decreased urine
   output. Cr decreased to 1.8 today.  Renal u/s was negative.
   - IVF boluses in setting of low urine output
   - losartan held in setting of ARF
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - hold nifedipine and losartan
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On warfarin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - hold coumadin given thoracentesis today
   - restart coumadin after procedure for INR goal of [**3-18**].
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Continue tylenol for pain control
   - Consider oxycodone 2.5mg po q6h PRN if pain not controlled

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin. She presented to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure.

The differential diagnosis for hypercapnic respiratory failure includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The patient's chest X-ray showed bilateral basilar densities, which could represent pleural effusions or pneumonia. She is on baseline 60mg Lasix at home, and her sputum culture grew out gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, suggesting pneumonia as another contributing factor to her respiratory failure.

The plan includes decreasing the respiratory rate to 10, transitioning to pressure support ventilation (PSV), and monitoring arterial blood gases (ABGs). She will continue vancomycin and Levofloxacin, as she has penicillin allergies. Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizations will be given as needed. Temperature and white blood cell count will be monitored, and blood cultures will be followed up.

The patient also has pleural effusions, and the differential includes congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, chronic renal insufficiency causing fluid retention, hypothyroidism, liver disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion due to possible"

   IMPRESSION: No evidence of stones or hydronephrosis within either
   kidney.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic
   renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal
   blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth
   Levofloxacin who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  CXR shows bilateral basilar densities that could
   represent pleural effusions or pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg
   Lasix at home.  CXR looked better yesterday after she received 100mg IV
   lasix upon transfer, pointing more towards pleural effusions. However,
   the sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, making pneumonia
   another process likely contributing to her respiratory failure as well.
   - does well on AC, can transition to PS, monitor ABGs
   - as sputum grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, continue vanc and levo,
   pt has pen allergies so CTX is not ordered
   - increase vanc to 1500mg
   - f/u with vanc trough
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium PRN as standing
   - Monitor temps and WBC.  If she spikes, obtain blood cx x2
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion (less
   likely) and ? malignant effusion. Pt received 120mg IV lasix yesterday,
   Cr bumped from 1.4 to 1.8
   - c/s IP for diagnostic tap
   - FFP/vit K to get INR <1.5 and hold warfarin
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily
   .
   #Acute renal failure: most likely due to lasix and diuresis.  Cr
   continues to increase to 1.9 today.
   - check urine lytes
   - renal u/s
   - hold losartan in setting of ARF
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - hold nifedipine and losartan
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On warfarin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - hold coumadin given thoracentesis tomorrow
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Continue tylenol for pain control
   - Consider oxycodone 2.5mg po q6h PRN if pain not controlled

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin. She presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure and has been intubated.

The differential diagnosis for her respiratory failure includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. A chest X-ray shows bilateral basilar densities, which could represent pleural effusions or pneumonia. She has also received 100mg IV Lasix upon transfer, indicating the possibility of pleural effusions.

The sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, suggesting pneumonia as another contributing factor to her respiratory failure. The patient has penicillin allergies, so ceftriaxone (CTX) is not ordered.

The patient's pleural effusions are being managed with Lasix 60mg PO qd. The differential diagnosis for the effusions includes congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, chronic renal insufficiency causing fluid retention, hypothyroidism, liver disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia, and malignant effusion. The BNP level is only 864, arguing against CHF playing a major role in this pleural effusion. The patient's albumin level is 3.0"

   Pleural Effusions/CHF
Will continue with Lasix for negative fluid
   balance, will get tap to evaluate for possible contribution from
   infection
   Will decrease respiratory rate to allow rise in CO2 more close to
   patient
s chronic levels
will decrease RR to 10
   2)Acute Renal Failure-Suggestion of pre-renal contribution to renal
   failure based upon FeNa
   -Will dose medicaitons as appropriate
   -Wil follow creatinine across time
   -Will need to maintain adequate perfusion

","The patient is a 86-year-old female presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of large bilateral effusions. She has had minimal spontaneous respiratory efforts, which may be in part due to alkalemia and sedation in the setting of acute ventilatory support following hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition of hypercarbic respiratory failure needs to be closely monitored and managed. This could be due to various factors such as pneumonia, pleural effusions, or congestive heart failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation to support her breathing.

2. Pneumonia: There is a possibility of pneumonia, as indicated by the presence of bilateral lower lung field opacities on the chest X-ray. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and levofloxacin, which are antibiotics used to treat pneumonia.

3. Pleural effusions/CHF: The large bilateral effusions seen on the chest X-ray could be due to pleural effusions or congestive heart failure. The patient's respiratory distress may be partly caused by the compression of the lungs by these effusions.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of acute renal failure. This could be due to pre-renal causes, such as decreased blood flow to the kidneys. The patient's medications will be adjusted as appropriate, and close monitoring of renal function will be done.

   CXR today
   Abd U/S: Evaluation is severely limited by patient's body habitus.
   Visualized portions of the bowel appear unremarkable. An NG tube is
   seen in the region of the stomach. There are moderate degenerative
   changes at the lower lumbar spine and bilateral hip joints.
   Cardiomegaly is present. The visualized portions of the lungs are
   unremarkable.
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of intestinal pathology.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic
   renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal
   blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth
   Levofloxacin who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  CXR shows bilateral basilar densities that could
   represent pleural effusions or pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg
   Lasix at home. sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters,
   making pneumonia another process likely contributing to her respiratory
   failure as well.
   - decrease RR to 10
   - if she does well on AC, can transition to PS, monitor ABGs
   - as sputum grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, continue vanc and levo
   (d3), pt has pen allergies so CTX is not ordered
   - f/u with vanc trough
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium PRN as standing
   - Monitor temps and WBC.  If she spikes, obtain blood cx x2
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion and
   malignant effusion. Cr came down from 1.9 to 1.8.
   - f/u with [**Female First Name (un) 231**] results
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily for I/O goal of even
   .
   #Acute renal failure: most likely due to lasix and diuresis.  FeNa was
   0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.  IVF bolus for decreased urine
   output. Cr decreased to 1.8 today.  Renal u/s was negative.
   - IVF boluses in setting of low urine output
   - losartan held in setting of ARF
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - hold nifedipine and losartan
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On warfarin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - hold coumadin given thoracentesis today
   - restart coumadin after procedure for INR goal of [**3-18**].
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Continue tylenol for pain control
   - Consider oxycodone 2.5mg po q6h PRN if pain not controlled

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin. She presents to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are as follows:

1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated upon transfer to the ICU due to severe respiratory failure. The differential includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The presence of bilateral basilar densities on the CXR suggests pleural effusions or pneumonia, which could contribute to the respiratory failure.

2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has a history of Lasix use, which may lead to fluid overload and contribute to the development of pleural effusions. Differential diagnosis includes congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, chronic renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, liver disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion, and malignant effusion. BNP levels are relatively low, suggesting that CHF is less likely to be the major cause. The patient's albumin levels are also not severely low, making nephrotic syndrome unlikely. Pancreatic enzymes are normal, ruling out pancreatitis as a cause. The leading differential"

   CXR today
   Abd U/S: Evaluation is severely limited by patient's body habitus.
   Visualized portions of the bowel appear unremarkable. An NG tube is
   seen in the region of the stomach. There are moderate degenerative
   changes at the lower lumbar spine and bilateral hip joints.
   Cardiomegaly is present. The visualized portions of the lungs are
   unremarkable.
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of intestinal pathology.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic
   renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal
   blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth
   Levofloxacin who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of hypercapnia is still unclear.  CXR shows
   bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or
   pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg Lasix at home. sputum culture grew
   out GPC in pairs and clusters, making pneumonia another process likely
   contributing to her respiratory failure as well.
   - decrease RR to 6 with eventual goal of SBT to further elucidate cause
   of respiratory distress
   - if she does well on AC, can transition to PS, monitor ABGs
   - as sputum grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, continue vanc and levo
   (d4), pt has pen allergies so CTX is not ordered
   - f/u with vanc trough tomorrow 6AM.  Due to leak of vanc this morning,
   if level <20, give another dose tomorrow
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium PRN as standing
   - Monitor temps and WBC.  If she spikes, obtain blood cx x2
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion and
   malignant effusion. Cr came down from 1.8 to 1.7.  Pleural studies show
   an exudative process with LDH ratio of 0.62.  Also shows lymphocytic
   WBC increase with differential including malignancy, TB, or rheumatic
   process.
   - recheck LDH level
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily for I/O goal of even
   - f/u with LFTs
   - consider urine protein study
   .
   #Acute renal failure: most likely due to lasix and diuresis.  FeNa was
   0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.  IVF bolus for decreased urine
   output. Cr decreased to 1.7 today.  Renal u/s was negative.
   - IVF boluses in setting of low urine output
   - losartan held in setting of ARF
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: unclear to when last bm was.  KUB was
   negative for any obstructive picture.
   - continue antiemetics
   - place on bowel regimen
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - hold nifedipine and losartan
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On warfarin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - restart coumadin for INR goal of [**3-18**].
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Continue tylenol for pain control
   - Consider oxycodone 2.5mg po q6h PRN if pain not controlled

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her sputum culture grew Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, suggesting a possible pneumonia. The patient also has pleural effusions, which may be due to chronic renal insufficiency, parapneumonic effusion, or malignancy. She is experiencing vomiting and regurgitation, and there is uncertainty about her last bowel movement. The patient has a history of chest pain, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, glaucoma, diabetes type 2, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be caused by CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, or pulmonary edema. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture shows Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered based on the culture results.
3. Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which could be caused by congestive heart failure,"

   CXR today
   Abd U/S: Evaluation is severely limited by patient's body habitus.
   Visualized portions of the bowel appear unremarkable. An NG tube is
   seen in the region of the stomach. There are moderate degenerative
   changes at the lower lumbar spine and bilateral hip joints.
   Cardiomegaly is present. The visualized portions of the lungs are
   unremarkable.
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of intestinal pathology.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic
   renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal
   blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth
   Levofloxacin who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  CXR shows bilateral basilar densities that could
   represent pleural effusions or pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg
   Lasix at home. sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters,
   making pneumonia another process likely contributing to her respiratory
   failure as well.
   - decrease RR to 10
   - if she does well on AC, can transition to PS, monitor ABGs
   - as sputum grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, continue vanc and levo
   (d3), pt has pen allergies so CTX is not ordered
   - f/u with vanc trough
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium PRN as standing
   - Monitor temps and WBC.  If she spikes, obtain blood cx x2
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion and
   malignant effusion. Cr came down from 1.9 to 1.8.
   - f/u with [**Female First Name (un) 231**] results
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily for I/O goal of even
   .
   #Acute renal failure: most likely due to lasix and diuresis.  FeNa was
   0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.  IVF bolus for decreased urine
   output. Cr decreased to 1.8 today.  Renal u/s was negative.
   - IVF boluses in setting of low urine output
   - losartan held in setting of ARF
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - hold nifedipine and losartan
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On warfarin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - hold coumadin given thoracentesis today
   - restart coumadin after procedure for INR goal of [**3-18**].
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Continue tylenol for pain control
   - Consider oxycodone 2.5mg po q6h PRN if pain not controlled

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin. She presented to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. She has pleural effusions, acute renal failure, and chest pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, or pulmonary edema. Bilateral basilar densities on the CXR indicate possible pleural effusions or pneumonia.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which can be caused by congestive heart failure, fluid overload, chronic renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, liver disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion, or malignant effusion. The BNP level is not elevated, suggesting that CHF is not the main cause. The patient's albumin level is normal, making nephrotic syndrome unlikely. Pancreatic enzymes are also normal, ruling out pancreatitis. The most likely causes at this point are CRI, parapneumonic effusion, and malignant effusion.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo female admit to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   She has had reasonable tolerance of A/C support and PEEP has been
   titrated to attempt to effect some improvement in patency of lower
   lobes.  Pleural fluid tap consistent with exudative effusion.
   1)RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])-Possible pneumonia
   considered and has been with minimal secretions and no evidence of
   prominent fever or bandemia.  She has pleural fluid with exudate but
   without active infection.  This morning we have evidence that patient
   is taking spontaneous breaths but remains with what is likely her
   baseline hypercarbia.   We will move to wean of mechanical ventilation
   and move to PSV trial today.
   -Will move to PSV today or if not tolerated will decrease RR further
   -Will need to determine source of persistent ventilatory failure if
   seen and this will require challenging patient with ventilatory wean
   -Will need to continue with reasonable PEEP to look to recruit lower
   lobes
   -Albuterol/Atrovent
   -Vanco/Levofloxacin
   2)Atelectasis/Collpase-
   -Will need to maintain PEEP at adequate levels
   -Will consider PEEP and bronch for proximal airway obstruction but this
   was not seen on CT scan
   -If persistent hyoxemia or move to extubation will have to consider
   bronchochoscopy

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been tolerating airway control support and PEEP has been adjusted to improve lower lobe patency. Pleural fluid tap shows an exudative effusion. The patient is now taking spontaneous breaths but remains with baseline hypercarbia. Mechanical ventilation weaning and PSV trials will be attempted today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])-Possible pneumonia considered, but minimal secretions and no evidence of prominent fever or bandemia. Pleural fluid with exudate but no active infection. The patient's persistent ventilatory failure needs to be determined, and if seen, a challenging patient with ventilatory wean will be required.
2. Atelectasis/Collpase- Reasonable PEEP levels should be maintained. PEEP and bronch for proximal airway obstruction may be considered, but it was not seen on the CT scan. If persistent hypoxemia or extubation is considered, bronchochoscopy may be necessary.
3. Hypertension, Benign- ICU care will continue with regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, systemic anticoagulation (Coumadin) for DVT prophylaxis, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic
   renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal
   blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth
   Levofloxacin who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of hypercapnia is still unclear.  CXR shows
   bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or
   pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg Lasix at home. Sputum culture grew
   out GPC in pairs and clusters, making pneumonia another process likely
   contributing to her respiratory failure as well.  Patient tolerated PS
   [**1-22**] well yesterday although due to her agitation, her sedation had to
   be increased.
   - for her sedation, switch to propofol and zyprexa with hopes to
   possibly extubate today
   - RSBI after off sedation
   - repeat ABGs
   - for her sputum cx, staph is resistant to levo; maintain on just vanc
   - vanc trough <20; give another dose today
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium PRN as standing
   - Monitor temps and WBC.  If she spikes, obtain blood cx x2
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion and
   malignant effusion. Cr came down from 1.8 to 1.7.  Pleural studies show
   an exudative process with LDH ratio of 0.62.  Repeat LDH level <0.6,
   making it transudative process.  Also shows lymphocytic WBC increase
   with differential including malignancy, TB, or rheumatic process
   although not likely.
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily for I/O goal of even
   - f/u with LFTs
   - consider urine protein study for nephrotic syndrome r/o
   .
   #Acute renal failure: most likely due to lasix and diuresis.  FeNa was
   0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.  IVF bolus for decreased urine
   output. Cr decreased to 1.6 today.  Renal u/s was negative.
   - IVF boluses in setting of low urine output
   - losartan held in setting of ARF
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: unclear to when last bm was.  KUB was
   negative for any obstructive picture.  Last bm was [**11-1**].
   - continue antiemetics
   - place on bowel regimen
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - hold nifedipine and losartan
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On warfarin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - restart coumadin for INR goal of [**3-18**].\
   - INR was 1.3 today
   - add heparin until she is therapeutic
   - coumadin 10mg x1 to increase her INR
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Continue tylenol for pain control
   - Consider oxycodone 2.5mg po q6h PRN if pain not controlled

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia. She was admitted with hypercapnic respiratory failure and intubated. Her sputum culture grew Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating pneumonia as another contributing factor to her respiratory failure. The patient tolerated pressure support well yesterday but required increased sedation due to agitation. The plan is to switch to propofol and zyprexa for sedation, with hopes of extubation today. Repeat ABGs, RSBI, and f/u cultures are also planned. Vancomycin trough should be maintained below 20, and another dose should be given today. 

Pleural effusions are present, with a BNP of 864, arguing against congestive heart failure playing a major role. The leading differential diagnosis includes chronic renal insufficiency, parapneumonic effusion, and malignant effusion. The pleural fluid analysis shows an exudative process with a low LDH ratio, suggesting a transudative process. Lymphocytic WBC increase is seen, with differentials including malignancy, TB, or rheumatic process.

Acute renal failure is likely due to lasix and diuresis, with a FeNa of 0.5 pointing to a prerenal cause. IVF bolus was given for decreased urine output"

   malignant effusion. Cr came down from 1.8 to 1.7.  Pleural studies show
   an exudative process with LDH ratio of 0.62.  Also shows lymphocytic
   WBC increase with differential including malignancy, TB, or rheumatic
   process.

","The patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin. She presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure and is intubated. The differential includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The patient's sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, indicating pneumonia as a possible contributing factor to her respiratory failure. The chest X-ray shows bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or pneumonia.

The patient's pleural effusions are being managed with Lasix 60mg PO qd. The differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia, and malignant effusion. The BNP level was 864, which argues against CHF playing a major role in the pleural effusion. The albumin level is 3.0, not extremely low. The patient's urine analysis only showed 100 protein, not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatic enzymes were normal. Therefore, the leading differential diagnosis at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion, and malignant effusion. The pleural fluid studies show an exudative"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo female with admission to ICU with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure--this did appear to be related in part to supression of patient
   respiratory drive as he has picked up respiratory rate and effort with
   changes in ventilator support and allowing patient to move to baseline
   PCO2.  She is left with significant bilateral lower lobe collapse seen
   at admission and with CXR in follow up.  It has been difficult to
   establish a stable-non-sedated background to evaluate RSBI and perform
   spontaneous breathing trials--this may lead us to need to move to
   extubation when clinically appropriate with quick arousal from
   sedation.  We have not seen complete resolution of bilateral lower lobe
   atelectasis but have seen improved capacity for ventilation.
   1)RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])-
   -Hold sedation this morning
   -If able to maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation will move to
   extubation
   -Will continue treatment for pneumonia as below
   -Avoid sedating medications following extubation
   -Will need aggressive pulmonary toiled following extubation to move to
   re-recruit lower lobes bilaterally.

   -Vanco/Levoflox
will change to Vanco for Rx of gram positive pneumonia
   -Follow up cuture results

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 90-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The respiratory failure appeared to be related to the suppression of respiratory drive, as evidenced by the patient's increased respiratory rate and effort when changes were made to the ventilator support and allowing the patient to move towards baseline PCO2 levels. The patient also had significant bilateral lower lobe collapse seen at admission and in follow-up CXR, which has been difficult to resolve completely. However, there has been an improved capacity for ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient is at risk of continued respiratory failure due to factors such as inadequate ventilation and oxygenation, persistent lower lobe atelectasis, and pneumonia. Extubation may be considered if the patient can maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation, but careful monitoring will be necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, likely caused by a gram-positive organism. Treatment with vancomycin (Vanco) will be continued, and follow-up cultures will be reviewed. The antibiotic regimen may need to be adjusted based on the culture results.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin, should be considered.
4. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The"

   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-5**], there are

   Generalized haziness of the hemithoraces is consistent with layering
   pleural
   effusion. Adjacent compressive bilateral atelectasis is probably
   present.

   tip is
   in good position. Nasogastric tube cannot be seen either in the abdomen
   or in
   the neck where it previously was coiled into the esophagus.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic
   renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal
   blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth
   Levofloxacin who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory
   failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of hypercapnia is still unclear.  CXR shows
   bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or
   pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg Lasix at home. Sputum culture grew
   out GPC in pairs and clusters, making pneumonia another process likely
   contributing to her respiratory failure as well.  Patient tolerated PS
   [**1-22**] well yesterday although due to her agitation, her sedation had to
   be increased.
   - for her sedation, switch to propofol and zyprexa with hopes to
   possibly extubate today
   - RSBI after off sedation
   - repeat ABGs
   - for her sputum cx, staph is resistant to levo; maintain on just vanc
   - vanc trough <20; give another dose today
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium PRN as standing
   - Monitor temps and WBC.  If she spikes, obtain blood cx x2
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion and
   malignant effusion. Cr came down from 1.8 to 1.7.  Pleural studies show
   an exudative process with LDH ratio of 0.62.  Repeat LDH level <0.6,
   making it transudative process.  Also shows lymphocytic WBC increase
   with differential including malignancy, TB, or rheumatic process
   although not likely.
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily for I/O goal of even
   - f/u with LFTs
   - consider urine protein study for nephrotic syndrome r/o
   .
   #Acute renal failure: most likely due to lasix and diuresis.  FeNa was
   0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.  IVF bolus for decreased urine
   output. Cr decreased to 1.6 today.  Renal u/s was negative.
   - IVF boluses in setting of low urine output
   - losartan held in setting of ARF
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: unclear to when last bm was.  KUB was
   negative for any obstructive picture.  Last bm was [**11-1**].
   - continue antiemetics
   - place on bowel regimen
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - hold nifedipine and losartan
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On warfarin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - restart coumadin for INR goal of [**3-18**].\
   - INR was 1.3 today
   - add heparin until she is therapeutic
   - coumadin 10mg x1 to increase her INR
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Continue tylenol for pain control
   - Consider oxycodone 2.5mg po q6h PRN if pain not controlled

","The patient's medical history includes chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD (peripheral vascular disease), and recent lingular pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin. The patient presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure. 

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia who presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure. 

The differential diagnosis for hypercapnic respiratory failure includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The etiology of hypercapnia is still unclear. The chest X-ray shows bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or pneumonia. The sputum culture grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, making pneumonia another process likely contributing to her respiratory failure as well.

The patient tolerated pressure support (PS) well yesterday although due to her agitation, her sedation had to be increased. The plan is to switch to propofol and zyprexa with hopes to possibly extubate today. The RSBI after turning off sedation is also planned. Repeat ABGs are to be done as well.

Regarding the pleural effusions, the patient is on Lasix 60mg PO qd. The differential includes CM with CHF,"

   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion and
   malignant effusion. Cr came down from 1.8 to 1.7.  Pleural studies show
   an exudative process with LDH ratio of 0.62.  Repeat LDH level <0.6,
   making it transudative process.  Also shows lymphocytic WBC increase
   with differential including malignancy, TB, or rheumatic process
   although not likely.
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily for I/O goal of even
   .
   #Acute renal failure: most likely due to lasix and diuresis.  FeNa was
   0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.  IVF bolus for decreased urine
   output. Cr decreased to 1.4 today.  Renal u/s was negative.
   - IVF boluses in setting of low urine output
   - losartan held in setting of ARF
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: unclear to when last bm was.  KUB was
   negative for any obstructive picture.  Last bm was [**11-1**].
   - continue antiemetics
   - place on bowel regimen
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - hold nifedipine and losartan
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On warfarin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - restart coumadin for INR goal of [**3-18**].
   - INR was 1.3 today
   - add heparin until she is therapeutic
   - consider doing TTE after MRI
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure and was intubated upon transfer. The differential diagnosis includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The patient's sputum culture grew gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection. She is currently on invasive ventilation and has shown improvement in her ABGs and vital signs. However, she experienced a failed extubation attempt yesterday, which may indicate CNS pathology. The patient has several comorbidities, including chronic pain, hypertension, glaucoma, diabetes, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and a history of an atrial thrombus. Her renal function is impaired, and she has pleural effusions, which could be due to CHF, fluid overload, CRI, parapneumonic effusion, or malignancy. She also has an acute renal failure, likely caused by lasix and diuresis. The patient's recent laboratory results show an elevated BNP level and a normal albumin level. The pleural fluid analysis indicates an exudative process with a high LDH ratio, suggesting malignancy, TB, or rheumatic process."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypercarbic respiratory compromise leading to admission. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to an inability to maintain upper airway patency or effectively ventilate. The patient had a recent extubation but was unable to initiate breaths and experienced a fully collapsed upper airway. Post-intubation, the patient had an ABG showing pH 7.30, PaCO2 66, and PaO2 282.

The patient's allergies include penicillins, aspirin (which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding), and ACE inhibitors (causing cough). The last doses of antibiotics administered were Levofloxacin at 10:00 AM on 11/6/2138 and Vancomycin at 09:56 PM on 11/6/2138.

The patient is receiving various infusions and medications, including propofol, midazolam (versed), fentanyl, pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include changes to medical and family history, review of systems, and a flowsheet detailing vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results.

The patient's physical examination shows that she is overweight/obese, with dullness on percussion and diminished breath sounds in the chest. The cardiovascular system is relatively normal, with distant S2 heart sounds. Peripheral vascular"

   technical
   limitations related to the degree of exposure and body habitus of the

   Generalized haziness of the hemithoraces is consistent with layering
   pleural
   effusion. Adjacent compressive bilateral atelectasis is probably
   present.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of hypercapnia is still unclear.  CXR shows
   bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or
   pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg Lasix at home. Sputum culture grew
   out GPC in pairs and clusters, making pneumonia another process likely
   contributing to her respiratory failure as well.  In the setting of her
   failed extubation yesterday, CNS pathology is higher on the list in the
   setting of subtherapeutic INR.
   - maintain on current vent settings for MRI today
   - repeat ABGs
   - for her sputum cx, staph is resistant to levo; maintain on just vanc
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium PRN as standing
   - Monitor temps and WBC.  If she spikes, obtain blood cx x2
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion and
   malignant effusion. Cr came down from 1.8 to 1.7.  Pleural studies show
   an exudative process with LDH ratio of 0.62.  Repeat LDH level <0.6,
   making it transudative process.  Also shows lymphocytic WBC increase
   with differential including malignancy, TB, or rheumatic process
   although not likely.
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily for I/O goal of even
   .
   #Acute renal failure: most likely due to lasix and diuresis.  FeNa was
   0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.  IVF bolus for decreased urine
   output. Cr decreased to 1.4 today.  Renal u/s was negative.
   - IVF boluses in setting of low urine output
   - losartan held in setting of ARF
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: unclear to when last bm was.  KUB was
   negative for any obstructive picture.  Last bm was [**11-1**].
   - continue antiemetics
   - place on bowel regimen
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences
   .
   #Hypertension:
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - hold nifedipine and losartan
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On warfarin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - restart coumadin for INR goal of [**3-18**].
   - INR was 1.3 today
   - add heparin until she is therapeutic
   - consider doing TTE after MRI
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Continue tylenol for pain control
   - Consider oxycodone 2.5mg po q6h PRN if pain not controlled

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent lingular pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure and intubated upon transfer. The differential diagnosis includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and her vital signs are stable. She has a pleural effusion, which could be due to congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, chronic renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, liver disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion, or malignant effusion. Her renal function is impaired, likely due to lasix and diuresis, but her creatinine level has improved. She also has vomiting and regurgitation, chest pain, hypertension, PVD, glaucoma, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's INR is subtherapeutic, so she needs to restart warfarin for anticoagulation, particularly considering her history of left atrial thrombus. She will also need to be on heparin until therapeutic INR levels are achieved. An echocardiogram (TTE) after MRI is being considered."

In the setting of her failed extubation yesterday, CNS pathology is higher on the list in the setting of subtherapeutic INR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing due to an accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood, leading to respiratory failure. Possible causes include CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact etiology.

2. Pneumonia: The sputum culture grew GPC in pairs and clusters, indicating a bacterial infection. This could contribute to the patient's respiratory failure and requires"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old female with respiratory failure and MSSA pneumonia. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to a lack of central ventilatory drive. The patient's recent attempts at extubation have not been tolerated, and an MRI of the head shows no acute cerebral vascular accident (CVA). 

The patient is also experiencing hypertension, which is being managed with metoprolol, and bilateral pleural effusions, for which she is receiving lasix to maintain an even fluid balance. Her renal function is improving, and efforts are being made to avoid nephrotoxins. 

The patient has a history of a left atrial clot and is on warfarin. Her current condition indicates that she is critically ill, and the attending physician agrees with the resident's note, including the assessment and plan. 

The patient's daughter is en route from [**Name (NI) 5379**] and will further address the goals of care upon arrival, expected within the next 2-14 days. The patient's code status is set to full code, and her disposition remains in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of hypercapnia is still unclear.  CXR shows
   bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or
   pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg Lasix at home. Sputum culture grew
   out GPC in pairs and clusters, making pneumonia another process likely
   contributing to her respiratory failure as well.  In the setting of her
   failed extubation yesterday, CNS pathology is higher on the list in the
   setting of subtherapeutic INR.
   - currently on AC, will try to wean to PS today
   - for her MSSA in sputum cx, finished a 8d course of vanc (pt has PCN
   allergy)
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium PRN as standing
   - Monitor temps and WBC.  If she spikes, obtain blood cx x2
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion and
   malignant effusion. Cr came down from 1.8 to 1.7.  Pleural studies show
   an exudative process with LDH ratio of 0.62.  Repeat LDH level <0.6,
   making it transudative process.  Also shows lymphocytic WBC increase
   with differential including malignancy, TB, or rheumatic process
   although not likely.
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily for I/O goal of even
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia. She presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure and has been intubated. The differential includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. Sputum culture shows GPC in pairs and clusters, indicating pneumonia. The patient is on AC ventilation and will be weaned to PS today. She has pleural effusions, which may be due to chronic renal insufficiency, parapneumonic effusion, or malignancy. The patient also has acute renal failure likely caused by Lasix diuresis. IVF boluses are given for decreased urine output. The patient has vomiting and regurgitation, chest pain without cardiac causes, hypertension, PVD, glaucoma, diabetes, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure can progress to worsen her hypoxemia and hypercapnia, leading to further deterioration in her condition.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of GPC in the sputum culture suggests ongoing pneumonia. If left untreated or inadequately treated, the pneumonia can worsen and potentially lead to se"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of hypercapnia is still unclear.  CXR shows
   bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or
   pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg Lasix at home. Sputum culture grew
   out GPC in pairs and clusters, making pneumonia another process likely
   contributing to her respiratory failure as well.  In the setting of her
   failed extubation yesterday, CNS pathology is higher on the list in the
   setting of subtherapeutic INR.
   - currently on AC, did not tolerate PS yesterday, had [**Last Name (un) 4599**] [**Doctor Last Name **]
   breathing
   - attempt diuresis today as this may be contributing to her abnormal
   breathing
   - pt may have a defect in central drive for respiration though head
   imaging doesn
t show anything
   - will speak with HCP today and decide whether to extubate and see how
   she does
   - for her MSSA in sputum cx, finished a 8d course of vanc (pt has PCN
   allergy)
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium PRN as standing
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion and
   malignant effusion. Cr came down from 1.8 to 1.7.  Pleural studies show
   an exudative process with LDH ratio of 0.62.  Repeat LDH level <0.6,
   making it transudative process.  Also shows lymphocytic WBC increase
   with differential including malignancy, TB, or rheumatic process
   although not likely.
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily for I/O goal of even
   - IV Lasix PRN today for diuresis
   .
   #Acute renal failure: most likely due to lasix and diuresis.  FeNa was
   0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.  IVF bolus for decreased urine
   output. Cr decreased to 1.3 today.
   - previous renal u/s was negative
   - IVF boluses in setting of low urine output
   - losartan held in setting of ARF
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: unclear to when last bm was.  KUB was
   negative for any obstructive picture.  Last bm was [**11-1**].
   - continue antiemetics
   - place on bowel regimen
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences
   .
   #Hypertension: uncontrolled
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - currently holding nifedipine and losartan, consider restarting one if
   HTN continues to be uncontrolled
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On coumadin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - INR at goal 2.4 today, continue current coumadin dose and follow
   daily INR
   - per curbside cardiology, no need to bridge with heparin
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Change tylenol scheduled to PRN for pain control

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lobar pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin. She presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure and is intubated upon transfer to the ICU.

The assessment and plan indicate the following conditions and potential medical complications:

1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated upon transfer to the ICU due to hypercapnic respiratory failure.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 90-year-old female with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a history of MSSA pneumonia. She was admitted and intubated due to respiratory failure.
- Despite treatment for MSSA pneumonia, the patient failed extubation attempts and showed no spontaneous breathing effort.
- The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, requiring minimal ventilator support but experiencing cluster breathing with attempts to decrease ventilator settings.
- An MRI of the head did not reveal an acute cause for the lack of central drive.
- Sedation weaning and spontaneous breathing trials have been attempted but not tolerated due to the lack of central drive.
- The patient has bilateral pleural effusions and is receiving lasix to maintain an even fluid balance.
- Renal function is improving, and efforts are being made to trend creatinine levels and avoid nephrotoxins.
- The patient has hypertension and is being treated with metoprolol.
- She also has a history of a left atrial clot and is on warfarin.
- The patient's overall condition is critically ill, and her code status is full code. She is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation"

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with multiple medical problems including chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease. She was admitted to the ICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure and did not tolerate pressure support ventilation due to Cheyne-Stokes respiration. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her blood pressure is stable at 128/66 mmHg, heart rate is within normal limits at 80 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 100%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 36.5 degrees Celsius. She has a history of allergies to penicillins, aspirin causing gastrointestinal bleeding, and ACE inhibitors causing cough. The patient's medical history includes chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of left atrial clot. 

The patient's recent laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin at 8.7 g/dL, glucose level of 143 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 28 mg/dL, creatinine at 1.4 mg/dL, and sodium at 135 mEq/L.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with multiple medical problems including chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and possibly a history of myocardial infarction (NI) who was admitted to the ICU with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient failed extubation attempts and is currently on mechanical ventilation with minimal vent requirements but experiences chest wall stiffness (CSR) with attempts to drop to pressure support ventilation (PSV). 

The patient has a history of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia, for which she completed an 8-day course of vancomycin. She also has bilateral pleural effusions, for which she is receiving lasix. 

Laboratory results show stable renal function with improving creatinine levels, and her INR is therapeutic. The patient has a history of hypertension and is on metoprolol. Additionally, she has a history of a left atrial clot and is on warfarin. 

The patient's current medications include calcitonin, vitamin D, simvastatin, pantoprazole, metoprolol, SSI (likely referring to a surgical site infection prophylaxis), inhalers, lasix, coumadin, levothyroxine, and propofol for sedation. 

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of hypercapnia is still unclear.  CXR shows
   bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or
   pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg Lasix at home. Sputum culture grew
   out GPC in pairs and clusters, making pneumonia another process likely
   contributing to her respiratory failure as well.  In the setting of her
   failed extubation yesterday, CNS pathology is higher on the list in the
   setting of subtherapeutic INR.  Currently cause of her decreased
   respiratory drive is unclear, concern for possible alkalemia that may
   be depressing respiratory drive
   - currently on AC, did not tolerate PS yesterday, had [**Last Name (un) 4599**] [**Doctor Last Name **]
   breathing
   -will get repeat ABG since there is concern that patient may have an
   alkalosis and most recent ABG is from [**2138-11-8**], patient may need A-line
   placed if she will need repeated ABG
s due to concern for alkalosis
   -will consider possible theophylline if ABG shows alkalosis to help
   central respiratory drive
   -pt may have a defect in central drive for respiration though head
   imaging doesn
t show anything
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium PRN as standing
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes and TSH were both
   normal. Therefore, the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic
   effusion and malignant effusion.  Pleural studies show an exudative
   process with LDH ratio of 0.62.  Repeat LDH level <0.6, making it
   transudative process.  Also shows predominantly lymphocytic WBC
s with
   differential including malignancy, TB, or rheumatic process although
   not likely.
   - hold home dose of lasix today, since little improvement in clinically
   or in CXR with aggressive diuresis and Cr bumped to 1.6
   .
   #Acute renal failure: originally thought to be due to lasix and
   diuresis.  FeNa was 0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause, patient received
   bolus yesterday with improvement in Cr, Cr=1.6 today, will hold lasix
   today given rising HCO3, Cr, also patient has been 1.5L negative over
   the past 24 hours.  Looking at prior records in the past two years her
   baseline Cr has been between 1.3 to 1.6, higher at times, so she
   appears to currently be at her baseline renal function
   - previous renal u/s was negative
   - continue to hold losartan
   .
   #Hypertension: poorly controlled, patient with increased blood
   pressures to 188/124 over the past 24 hours
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid, will also likely restart nifedipine
   given recent hypertension
   - continue holding losartan for now
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: last BM on [**2138-11-6**]
   - KUB was negative for any obstructive picture.
   - continue antiemetics
   - continue bowel regimen
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On coumadin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - INR at goal 2.3 today, continue current coumadin dose and follow
   daily INR
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes Type I: controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   -Continue to hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Patient currently intubated and sedated, not following commands, not
   needing any prn pain medications at this time
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: No recurrences; cardiac causes ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing hypercapnic respiratory failure, which is indicated by an elevated CO2 level in the blood. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including CNS depression, drug effects, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, or pulmonary edema.

2. Pneumonia: The sputum culture grew gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, suggesting the presence of pneumonia. This infection may contribute to the patient's respiratory failure.

3. Pleural effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which can have multiple causes including congestive heart failure, fluid overload, chronic renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, liver disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion, or malignant effusion.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has been affected, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. This could be due to prerenal causes, such as dehydration or hypotension, or intrinsic renal damage.

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, indicating poorly controlled hypertension. This may be related to underlying conditions or medication interactions.

6. Vomiting and regurgitation: The patient is experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting and regurgitation. This can be associated with various conditions, such as gastritis or gastrointestinal obstruction.

7. Prothrombin time/inr: The patient's INR is being monitored closely due to her anticoagulation therapy for atrial thrombus. It is important to maintain the INR within the therapeutic range to prevent clotting or bleeding complications.

8. Glaucoma: The patient has a history of glaucoma and is on multiple medications to manage this condition. It is essential to continue these medications to prevent further vision loss.

9. Diabetes: Although the patient's diabetes type I is currently controlled with glipizide, it is important to monitor her blood glucose levels closely, especially considering her current critical condition.

10. Hypothyroidism: The patient's recent TSH level indicates that her hypothyroidism is well-controlled with levothyroxine. However, regular monitoring of thyroid function is necessary.

11. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is on simvastatin for hyperlipidemia management. It is important to continue this medication to control her cholesterol levels.

12. Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis: The patient has chronic pain related to spinal stenosis and arthritis. Pain management should be addressed while the patient is in the ICU.

13. Chest pain, NOS: The patient's chest pain has been evaluated, and cardiac causes have been ruled out. Other potential causes, such as musculoskeletal issues or gastrointestinal problems, should be considered.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient based on"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of hypercapnia is still unclear.  CXR shows
   bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or
   pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg Lasix at home. Sputum culture grew
   out GPC in pairs and clusters, making pneumonia another process likely
   contributing to her respiratory failure as well.  In the setting of her
   failed extubation yesterday, CNS pathology is higher on the list in the
   setting of subtherapeutic INR.  Currently cause of her decreased
   respiratory drive is unclear, concern for possible alkalemia that may
   be depressing respiratory drive
   - currently on AC, did not tolerate PS yesterday, had [**Last Name (un) 4599**] [**Doctor Last Name **]
   breathing
   -will get repeat ABG since there is concern that patient may have an
   alkalosis and most recent ABG is from [**2138-11-8**], patient may need A-line
   placed if she will need repeated ABG
s due to concern for alkalosis
   -will consider possible theophylline if ABG shows alkalosis to help
   central respiratory drive
   -pt may have a defect in central drive for respiration though head
   imaging doesn
t show anything
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium PRN as standing
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion and
   malignant effusion. Cr came down from 1.8 to 1.7.  Pleural studies show
   an exudative process with LDH ratio of 0.62.  Repeat LDH level <0.6,
   making it transudative process.  Also shows lymphocytic WBC increase
   with differential including malignancy, TB, or rheumatic process
   although not likely.
   - hold home dose of lasix today, since there was little improvement in
   CXR or clinical symptoms with aggressive diuresis and her Cr has bumped
   to 1.6
   .
   #Acute renal failure: originally thought to be due to lasix and
   diuresis.  FeNa was 0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause, patient received
   bolus yesterday with improvement in Cr, Cr=1.6 today, will hold lasix
   today given rising HCO3, Cr and that patient has been 1.5L negative
   over the past 24 hours
   - previous renal u/s was negative
   - losartan held in setting of ARF
   .
   #Hypertension: poorly controlled, patient with increased blood
   pressures to 188/124 over the past 24 hours
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid, will also likely restart nifedipine
   given recent hypertension
   - continue holding losartan for now
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: last BM on [**2138-11-6**]
   -KUB was negative for any obstructive picture.
   - continue antiemetics
   - continue bowel regimen
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On coumadin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - INR at goal 2.3 today, continue current coumadin dose and follow
   daily INR
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   -Continue to hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Patient currently intubated and sedated, not following commands, no
   need for prn pain medications at this time
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: No recurrences; cardiac causes ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.

   Disposition: ICU for now
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure and is currently intubated.

The differential diagnosis for her respiratory failure includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. The cause of her decreased respiratory drive is unclear, with concerns for possible alkalemia that may be depressing respiratory drive.

The patient has pleural effusions, which could be due to congestive heart failure, fluid overload, chronic renal insufficiency causing fluid retention, hypothyroidism, liver disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia, or malignant effusion. The BNP was only 864, arguing against CHF playing a major role in this pleural effusion. Albumin levels are normal, ruling out nephrotic syndrome.

The patient also has acute renal failure, initially thought to be due to Lasix and diuresis. Her FeNa was 0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause. She received a bolus yesterday with improvement in creatinine, and her Cr is now 1.6. Lasix is being held today given rising HCO3, Cr, and the patient's negative fluid balance over the past 24 hours.

   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of hypercapnia is still unclear.  CXR shows
   bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or
   pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg Lasix at home. Sputum culture grew
   out GPC in pairs and clusters, making pneumonia another process likely
   contributing to her respiratory failure as well.  In the setting of her
   failed extubation yesterday, CNS pathology is higher on the list in the
   setting of subtherapeutic INR.
   - currently on AC, did not tolerate PS yesterday, had [**Last Name (un) 4599**] [**Doctor Last Name **]
   breathing
   - attempt diuresis today as this may be contributing to her abnormal
   breathing
   - pt may have a defect in central drive for respiration though head
   imaging doesn
t show anything
   - will speak with HCP today and decide whether to extubate and see how
   she does
   - for her MSSA in sputum cx, finished a 8d course of vanc (pt has PCN
   allergy)
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium PRN as standing
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes were normal. Therefore,
   the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic effusion and
   malignant effusion. Cr came down from 1.8 to 1.7.  Pleural studies show
   an exudative process with LDH ratio of 0.62.  Repeat LDH level <0.6,
   making it transudative process.  Also shows lymphocytic WBC increase
   with differential including malignancy, TB, or rheumatic process
   although not likely.
   - continue home dose of lasix 60mg daily for I/O goal of even
   - IV Lasix PRN today for diuresis
   .
   #Acute renal failure: most likely due to lasix and diuresis.  FeNa was
   0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.  IVF bolus for decreased urine
   output. Cr decreased to 1.3 today.
   - previous renal u/s was negative
   - IVF boluses in setting of low urine output
   - losartan held in setting of ARF
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: unclear to when last bm was.  KUB was
   negative for any obstructive picture.  Last bm was [**11-1**].
   - continue antiemetics
   - place on bowel regimen
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: Cardiac causes have been ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.  CP has not recurred.
   - Monitor for any recurrences
   .
   #Hypertension: uncontrolled
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - currently holding nifedipine and losartan, consider restarting one if
   HTN continues to be uncontrolled
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On coumadin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - INR at goal 2.4 today, continue current coumadin dose and follow
   daily INR
   - per curbside cardiology, no need to bridge with heparin
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes, T2, controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   - Hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Change tylenol scheduled to PRN for pain control

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia. She presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure and was intubated upon transfer to the ICU.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercapnia, which indicates a buildup of carbon dioxide in her blood. This can be caused by CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, or pulmonary edema. The etiology of hypercapnia is still unclear, but the presence of bilateral basilar densities on the chest X-ray suggests pleural effusions or pneumonia, contributing to her respiratory failure.

2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which could be due to congestive heart failure (CHF), fluid overload, chronic renal insufficiency causing fluid retention, hypothyroidism, liver disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia, or malignant effusion. The B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is relatively low, arguing against CHF as the major cause. The pleural fluid analysis shows an exudative process with a low LDH ratio, indicating it is more likely a transudative process. There is also a lymph"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  Currently she has a decreased central
   respiratory drive of unclear etiology, given no findings on head CT and
   MRI.  Sedation could be playing a role as well, so will try to wean her
   sedation.   Also, her alkalemia could be contributing to her decreased
   respiratory drive.  Currently cause of her decreased central
   respiratory drive is unclear, concern for possible alkalemia that may
   be contributing to depressed respiratory drive.
   - will decrease vent settings to help with alkalemia
   - remains on AC has not tolerated PS due to [**Last Name (un) 4599**] [**Doctor Last Name **] breathing
   -will discuss possibility of trach with family, as patient has become
   agitated in the past with weaning of sedation so she may not be able to
   tolerate
   -pt may have a defect in central drive for respiration though head
   imaging doesn
t show anything
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd, though most recent echo showed an EF>55% and no diastolic
   dysfunction, no improvement in effusions with diuresis.  Prior
   thoracentesis showed a lymphocytic predominance.  Unclear if these
   effusions are playing a role in her respiratory distress.
   .
   #Acute renal failure: originally thought to be due to lasix and
   diuresis, FeNa at the time was 0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.
   Overnight patient with some decreased urine output, so she was bolussed
   500cc NS, will monitor for improvement in urine output.  With holding
   her lasix and giving a bolus she is about even over the past 24 hours,
   still net negative about 2.5L over the course of her ICU stay.  Today
   Cr=1.7, from prior records in the past two years her baseline Cr has
   been between 1.3 to 1.6, higher at times, so she appears to currently
   be at her baseline renal function
   - previous renal u/s was negative
   - continue to hold losartan
   .
   #Hypertension: poorly controlled, patient with a few low blood
   pressures over the past 24 hours so nifedipine was not restarted
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - Nifedipine attempted to be restarted yesterday, but cannot be crushed
   - continue holding losartan for now
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: last BM on [**2138-11-6**]
   - KUB was negative for any obstructive picture.
   - continue antiemetics
   - continue bowel regimen
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On coumadin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - INR at goal 2.3 today, continue current coumadin dose and follow
   daily INR
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes Type II: Regular ISS
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2, Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Patient currently intubated and sedated, not following commands, not
   needing any prn pain medications at this time
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: No recurrences; cardiac causes ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin. She presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure and was intubated upon transfer to the ICU. The cause of her decreased central respiratory drive is unclear, with possible alkalemia contributing to the depression of respiratory drive. Sedation may also be playing a role.

The patient has pleural effusions that have not improved with diuretic therapy, and a thoracentesis showed lymphocytic predominance. There is concern about whether these effusions are contributing to her respiratory distress.

She has acute renal failure, initially thought to be due to lasix and diuresis, but now appears to be at her baseline renal function with a creatinine level of 1.7. Her urine output has been consistently around 25-30cc/hr, and she received a 500cc bolus of normal saline early in the morning.

The patient's hypertension is poorly controlled, and nifedipine was not restarted due to low blood pressures. She continues on metoprolol 100mg po bid.

She experiences vomiting and regurgitation, and her bowel movements are normal. She is on coumadin for anticoagulation due to a history of left atrial thrombus. Her INR is at goal of"

   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd.  Differential includes CM with CHF, fluid overload, chronic renal
   insufficiency causing retention of fluid, hypothyroidism, liver
   disease, low protein, parapneumonic effusion given possible pneumonia,
   and malignant effusion, ascites from such as pancreatitis. BNP was only
   864, arguing against CHF playing the major role in this pleural
   effusion. Albumin 3.0, so not terribly low. UA only showed 100 protein,
   not in nephrotic syndrome. Pancreatitic enzymes and TSH were both
   normal. Therefore, the leading ddx at this point is CRI, parapneumonic
   effusion and malignant effusion.  Pleural studies show an exudative
   process with LDH ratio of 0.62.  Repeat LDH level <0.6, making it
   transudative process.  Also shows predominantly lymphocytic WBC
s with
   differential including malignancy, TB, or rheumatic process although
   not likely.
   - hold home dose of lasix today, since little improvement  clinically
   or in CXR with aggressive diuresis and Cr bumped to 1.6
   .
   #Acute renal failure: originally thought to be due to lasix and
   diuresis, FeNa at the time was 0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause.
   Overnight patient with some decreased urine output, so she was bolussed
   500cc NS, will monitor for improvement in urine output.  With holding
   her lasix and giving a bolus she is about even over the past 24 hours,
   still net negative about 2.5L over the course of her ICU stay.  Today
   Cr=1.7, from prior records in the past two years her baseline Cr has
   been between 1.3 to 1.6, higher at times, so she appears to currently
   be at her baseline renal function
   - previous renal u/s was negative
   - continue to hold losartan
   .
   #Hypertension: poorly controlled, patient with a few low blood
   pressures over the past 24 hours so nifedipine was not restarted
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - Nifedipine attempted to be restarted yesterday, but cannot be crushed
   - continue holding losartan for now
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: last BM on [**2138-11-6**]
   - KUB was negative for any obstructive picture.
   - continue antiemetics
   - continue bowel regimen
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On coumadin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - INR at goal 2.3 today, continue current coumadin dose and follow
   daily INR
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes Type I: controlled with glipizide at home
   - Regular ISS
   -Continue to hold glipizide
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2
   - Continue home dose Levothyroxine

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent lingular pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin. She presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure and was intubated upon transfer to the ICU.

Assessment:
1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has decreased central respiratory drive of unclear etiology, possibly due to alkalemia. Vent settings will be decreased to help with alkalemia. Tracheostomy will be discussed with the family as the patient may not tolerate weaning of sedation.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which could be due to chronic renal insufficiency, parapneumonic effusion, or malignant effusion. Lasix will be held today.
3. Acute Renal Failure: Initially thought to be due to lasix and diuresis, but now appears to be at baseline renal function. Creatinine is 1.7, and urine output has stabilized.
4. Hypertension: Poorly controlled hypertension, with a few low blood pressures over the past 24 hours. Nifedipine was not restarted.
5. Vomiting, Regurgitation: Continue antiemetics and bowel regimen.
6. PVD: Patient is on coumadin for anticoagulation and has a history"

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents

   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  The differential includes CNS depression, drugs,
   neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia,
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of hypercapnia is still unclear.  CXR shows
   bilateral basilar densities that could represent pleural effusions or
   pneumonia.  She is on baseline 60mg Lasix at home. Sputum culture grew
   out GPC in pairs and clusters, making pneumonia another process likely
   contributing to her respiratory failure as well.  In the setting of her
   failed extubation yesterday, CNS pathology is higher on the list in the
   setting of subtherapeutic INR.  Currently cause of her decreased
   respiratory drive is unclear, concern for possible alkalemia that may
   be contributing to depressed respiratory drive

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lobar pneumonia. She presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure and is currently intubated. The differential includes CNS depression, drugs, neuromuscular disorders, acute airway obstruction, severe pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. Her sputum culture grew Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating pneumonia. The cause of her decreased respiratory drive is unclear, but there is concern for possible alkalemia contributing to depressed respiratory drive. She has completed her course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure could worsen if her respiratory drive does not improve.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia, which may require additional antibiotics or interventions.
3. Pleural effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which may require further evaluation and management.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is currently at baseline, but there is a risk of worsening renal failure due to fluid overload or other factors.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is poorly controlled, and there is a risk of complications such as heart attack or stroke if not managed properly.
6. Vomiting and regurgitation: The"

   =====================
   Still concerned that patient's hypoventilation may be partly related to
   sedation. Because there are ongoing concerns about agitation, which
   usually are associated with increases in respiratory rate, I would
   favor proceeding with percutaneous trach so that we can eliminate all
   sedation without concern about discomfort from an oral ETT. Probably
   still volume overloaded by CXR; would continue negative fluid balance.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, and chronic renal failure. The patient is intubated and currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 128/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, aspirin, and ACE inhibitors. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for the following: the patient required a fluid bolus overnight for decreased urine output, which has improved this morning. The patient continues to have few spontaneous breaths.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, overweight, and not in acute distress. There are no abnormalities noted in the eyes, head, ears, nose, throat, cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, respiratory system, abdomen, extremities, musculoskeletal system, or neurologic system. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose, and lactate levels. Imaging reveals large heart, bilateral pleural effusions, and diffuse increase in interstitial markings.

Assessment and plan:
1. Ineffective coping: The patient is unable to provide history due to intubation.
2. Respiratory failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  Currently she has a decreased central
   respiratory drive of unclear etiology, given no findings on head CT and
   MRI.  Sedation could be playing a role as well, so will try to wean her
   sedation.   Also, her alkalemia could be contributing to her decreased
   respiratory drive.  Currently cause of her decreased central
   respiratory drive is unclear, concern for possible alkalemia that may
   be contributing to depressed respiratory drive.
   -family agreeable to trach, IP will place trach and PEG bedside once
   INR is 1.5 or below
   -will wean sedation to see how her respiratory drive improves for now
   -pt likely has defect in central drive for respiration though head
   imaging doesn
t show anything
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd, though most recent echo showed an EF>55% and no diastolic
   dysfunction, no improvement in effusions with diuresis.  Prior
   thoracentesis showed a lymphocytic predominance.  Unclear if these
   effusions are playing a role in her respiratory distress.
   .
   #Acute renal failure: originally thought to be due to lasix and
   diuresis, FeNa at the time was 0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause, but
   CXR shows volume overload and current Cr is at patient
s baseline.
   Overnight urine output has increased to average about 50cc
s per hour.
   She remains about even over the past 24 hours, still net negative about
   2.5L over the course of her ICU stay.  Today Cr=1.5, which is her
   baseline renal function
   - continue to hold losartan
   .
   #Hypertension: poorly controlled, patient with a few low blood
   pressures over the past 24 hours  so no current adjustments will
   monitor BP
s as she comes off sedation
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - Nifedipine cannot be restarted because it cannot be crushed
   - continue holding losartan for now
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: held tube feeds yesterday afternoon because
   she vomitted feeds, had previoulsy been tolerating well, will restart
   today and see how she tolerates
   - continue antiemetics
   - continue bowel regimen
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On coumadin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - INR 2.2 today, will hold coumadin for hopeful trach/PEG tomorrow
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes Type II: Regular ISS
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2, Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue home dose simvastatin
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 90-year-old female with chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia.
- The patient was admitted to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure and was intubated.
- She has decreased central respiratory drive of unclear etiology.
- Her alkalemia could be contributing to her decreased respiratory drive.
- Family agrees to tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.
- Sedation will be weaned to see how her respiratory drive improves.
- The patient's pleural effusions have not improved with diuresis.
- She has acute renal failure, but her current creatinine level is at her baseline.
- Her hypertension is poorly controlled.
- She experienced vomiting and regurgitation, but tube feeds will be restarted.
- The patient is on coumadin for anticoagulation due to PVD and a history of left atrial thrombus.
- She has glaucoma, diabetes type II, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia.
- The patient is currently receiving nutrition through tube feeds, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, VAP, and stress ulcers.
- The family's code status is DNR/DNI, and they are agreeable to tracheostomy and PEG with possible care in a nursing facility"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - goals of care discussion: changed status to DNR/DNI. family feels
   that she still has brain and heart function and do not want to give up
   yet. feel comfortable with trach/peg and send to nursing home for care.
   - CXR: NG tube in correct position
   - hold off on tube feeds for now as she was regurgitating
   - Made patient NPO after midnight with maintenance fluids
   - Page IP at 7 AM to let them know she needs a trach. Ask them about a
   Peg...not sure if they do this, but she needs this.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  Currently she has a decreased central
   respiratory drive of unclear etiology, given no findings on head CT and
   MRI.  Sedation could be playing a role as well, so will try to wean her
   sedation.   Also, her alkalemia could be contributing to her decreased
   respiratory drive.  Currently cause of her decreased central
   respiratory drive is unclear, concern for possible alkalemia that may
   be contributing to depressed respiratory drive.
   -family agreeable to trach, will contact IP for bedside trach placement
   - recheck ABG or VBG to assess alkalemia
   - remains on AC has not tolerated PS due to [**Last Name (un) 4599**] [**Doctor Last Name **] breathing
   -pt likely has defect in central drive for respiration though head
   imaging doesn
t show anything
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd, though most recent echo showed an EF>55% and no diastolic
   dysfunction, no improvement in effusions with diuresis.  Prior
   thoracentesis showed a lymphocytic predominance.  Unclear if these
   effusions are playing a role in her respiratory distress.
   .
   #Acute renal failure: originally thought to be due to lasix and
   diuresis, FeNa at the time was 0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause, but
   CXR shows volume overload and current Cr is at patient
s baseline.
   Overnight urine output has increased to average about 50cc
s per hour.
   She remains about even over the past 24 hours, still net negative about
   2.5L over the course of her ICU stay.  Today Cr=1.5, which is her
   baseline renal function
   - previous renal u/s was negative
   - continue to hold losartan
   .
   #Hypertension: poorly controlled, patient with a few low blood
   pressures over the past 24 hours so nifedipine was not restarted
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - Nifedipine cannot be restarted because it cannot be crushed
   - continue holding losartan for now
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: last BM on [**2138-11-6**]
   - KUB was negative for any obstructive picture.
   - continue antiemetics
   - continue bowel regimen
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On coumadin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - INR 2.2 today, continue current coumadin dose and follow daily INR
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes Type II: Regular ISS
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2, Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue home dose simvastatin
   .
   #Chronic pain/spinal stenosis/arthritis:
   - Patient currently intubated and sedated, not following commands, not
   needing any prn pain medications at this time
   .
   #Chest pain, NOS: No recurrences; cardiac causes ruled out by negative
   cardiac enzymes and stress/nuclear test.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia who presented with hypercapnic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated upon transfer to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has decreased central respiratory drive of unclear etiology, and her alkalemia may be contributing to her decreased respiratory drive. The patient's family agrees to tracheostomy placement. The patient's pleural effusions have not improved with diuretics, and her acute renal failure has resolved. She remains hypertensive and is being held on losartan. The patient is also experiencing vomiting and regurgitation, and she has a history of peripheral vascular disease and glaucoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's decreased central respiratory drive may lead to ongoing respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient's pleural effusions have not improved with diuretics, which could indicate an underlying condition contributing to the effusions.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, but it has since resolved. However, close monitoring of renal function is necessary to detect any further deterioration.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is poorly controlled, and it needs to be managed appropriately to prevent complications such as stroke or heart attack.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   After family discussion yesterday, decision made that patient should be
   DNR. They do want to proceed with trach. Will need to have
   anticoagulation held.
   Afebrile. O2 sats have been good on AC with FIO2=0.4.

   Oxygenation excellent; VE 5-6L/min. Coumadin being held. Plan for trach
   and PEG tomorrow. Suspect with trach, we will be able to keep her off
   sedation and she may be able to breathe sufficiently off the
   ventilator. Unclear if she will be able to eat; PEG likely  will be
   needed on long term basis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated for
   about 13 days.  Trialed on pressure support this morning, doing well
   with respiratory drive on 15/5 and propafol turned down to 10mcgs/ hr.
   -  IP will place trach and PEG today at bedside once INR is 1.5 or
   below
   -will wean sedation to see how her respiratory drive improves for now
   -pt likely has defect in central drive for respiration though head
   imaging doesn
t show anything
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd, though most recent echo showed an EF>55% and no diastolic
   dysfunction, no improvement in effusions with diuresis.  Prior
   thoracentesis showed a lymphocytic predominance.  Unclear if these
   effusions are playing a role in her respiratory distress.
   .
   #Acute renal failure: originally thought to be due to lasix and
   diuresis, FeNa at the time was 0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause, but
   CXR shows volume overload and current Cr is at patient
s baseline.
   Overnight urine output has increased to average about 50cc
s per hour.
   She remains about even over the past 24 hours, still net negative about
   2.5L over the course of her ICU stay.  Today Cr=1.5, which is her
   baseline renal function
   - continue to hold losartan
   .
   #Hypertension: poorly controlled, patient with a few low blood
   pressures over the past 24 hours  so no current adjustments will
   monitor BP
s as she comes off sedation
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - Nifedipine cannot be restarted because it cannot be crushed
   - continue holding losartan for now
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: held tube feeds yesterday afternoon because
   she vomitted feeds, had previoulsy been tolerating well, will restart
   today and see how she tolerates
   - continue antiemetics
   - continue bowel regimen
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On coumadin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - INR 2.2 today, will hold coumadin for hopeful trach/PEG tomorrow
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes Type II: Regular ISS
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2, Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue home dose simvastatin

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent lingular pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure and required intubation for about 13 days. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure. She is currently being supported with pressure support ventilation and propofol infusion. Plans include placing a tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) once the international normalized ratio (INR) is below 1.5. Sedation will be weaned to assess the improvement in respiratory drive.

2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has pleural effusions that have not improved with diuretic therapy. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and impact on her respiratory distress.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially had acute renal failure, but her current creatinine level is at her baseline, indicating improvement. Fluid overload is present on chest X-ray, and urine output has increased.

4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension remains poorly controlled, and adjustments in medication will be considered after she comes off sedation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated for
   about 13 days.  Trialed on pressure support this morning, doing well
   with respiratory drive on 15/5 and propafol turned down to 10mcgs/
   hr.
   -  IP will place trach and PEG today at bedside once INR is 1.5 or
   below
   -will wean sedation to see how her respiratory drive improves for now
   -pt likely has defect in central drive for respiration though head
   imaging doesn
t show anything
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd, though most recent echo showed an EF>55% and no diastolic
   dysfunction, no improvement in effusions with diuresis.  Prior
   thoracentesis showed a lymphocytic predominance.  Unclear if these
   effusions are playing a role in her respiratory distress.
   .
   #Acute renal failure: originally thought to be due to lasix and
   diuresis, FeNa at the time was 0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause, but
   CXR shows volume overload and current Cr is at patient
s baseline.
   Overnight urine output has increased to average about 50cc
s per hour.
   She remains about even over the past 24 hours, still net negative about
   2.5L over the course of her ICU stay.  Today Cr=1.5, which is her
   baseline renal function
   - continue to hold losartan
   .
   #Hypertension: poorly controlled, patient with a few low blood
   pressures over the past 24 hours  so no current adjustments will
   monitor BP
s as she comes off sedation
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - Nifedipine cannot be restarted because it cannot be crushed
   - continue holding losartan for now
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: held tube feeds yesterday afternoon because
   she vomitted feeds, had previoulsy been tolerating well, will restart
   today and see how she tolerates
   - continue antiemetics
   - continue bowel regimen
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On coumadin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - INR 2.2 today, will hold coumadin for hopeful trach/PEG tomorrow
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes Type II: Regular ISS
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2, Continue home dose Levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent lingular pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure and required intubation for about 13 days. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and propofol sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying respiratory failure could worsen if there are any issues with the mechanical ventilation or if the patient develops further lung complications.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has pleural effusions that have not improved with diuresis. These effusions could contribute to her respiratory distress and may require further intervention such as thoracentesis or chest tube placement.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a concern for acute renal failure. Close monitoring of urine output and renal function tests is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is poorly controlled, and adjustments in medication may be required once she is weaned off sedation.
5. Vomiting and Regurgitation: The patient has been experiencing vomiting and regurgitation, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia. Careful monitoring and appropriate measures to prevent aspiration are necessary.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent lingular pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure and has been intubated for about 13 days. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure. She has been trialed on pressure support and is doing well with a respiratory drive of 15/5. Propofol has been turned down to 10 mcg/hr. The plan is to place a tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) once the International Normalized Ratio (INR) is below 1.5. Four bags of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) will be given to correct the INR, and sedation will be weaned to assess respiratory drive improvement.

2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has pleural effusions that have not improved with diuretics. The most recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) >55% and no diastolic dysfunction. The cause of the effusions is unclear, and they may or may not be contributing to the respiratory distress. Monitoring will continue.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated upon
   transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  Currently she has a decreased central
   respiratory drive of unclear etiology, given no findings on head CT and
   MRI.  Sedation could be playing a role as well, so will try to wean her
   sedation.   Also, her alkalemia could be contributing to her decreased
   respiratory drive.  Currently cause of her decreased central
   respiratory drive is unclear, concern for possible alkalemia that may
   be contributing to depressed respiratory drive.
   -family agreeable to trach, IP will place trach and PEG bedside once
   INR is 1.5 or below
   -will wean sedation to see how her respiratory drive improves for now
   -pt likely has defect in central drive for respiration though head
   imaging doesn
t show anything
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd, though most recent echo showed an EF>55% and no diastolic
   dysfunction, no improvement in effusions with diuresis.  Prior
   thoracentesis showed a lymphocytic predominance.  Unclear if these
   effusions are playing a role in her respiratory distress.
   .
   #Acute renal failure: originally thought to be due to lasix and
   diuresis, FeNa at the time was 0.5, pointing to a prerenal cause, but
   CXR shows volume overload and current Cr is at patient
s baseline.
   Overnight urine output has increased to average about 50cc
s per hour.
   She remains about even over the past 24 hours, still net negative about
   2.5L over the course of her ICU stay.  Today Cr=1.5, which is her
   baseline renal function
   - continue to hold losartan
   .
   #Hypertension: poorly controlled, patient with a few low blood
   pressures over the past 24 hours  so no current adjustments will
   monitor BP
s as she comes off sedation
   - Continue metoprolol 100mg po bid
   - Nifedipine cannot be restarted because it cannot be crushed
   - continue holding losartan for now
   .
   #Vomiting, regurgitation: held tube feeds yesterday afternoon because
   she vomitted feeds, had previoulsy been tolerating well, will restart
   today and see how she tolerates
   - continue antiemetics
   - continue bowel regimen
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On coumadin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - INR 2.2 today, will hold coumadin for hopeful trach/PEG tomorrow
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes Type II: Regular ISS
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2, Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue home dose simvastatin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent lingular pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin. She was admitted to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient has decreased central respiratory drive, which could be due to sedation, alkalemia, or an underlying neurological issue. Weaning sedation may improve respiratory drive.

2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has pleural effusions that have not improved with diuretic therapy. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and whether these effusions are contributing to respiratory distress.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially had signs of acute renal failure, but her current creatinine level is at baseline, indicating improvement. Monitoring urine output and adjusting medications accordingly is important.

4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is poorly controlled. Adjusting antihypertensive medications, especially as she comes off sedation, will be necessary.

5. Vomiting and Regurgitation: The patient has been experiencing vomiting and regurgitation. Restarting tube feeds cautiously and continuing antiemetic therapy may help manage these symptoms.

6. Prothrombotic State:"

   ANEMIA
   ========================
   Respiratory status stable on the ventilator. Plan for trach today;
   getting FFP to reverse coumadin for procedure. Patient on PSV now with
   VE 3.5 L/min. Would check VBG - suspect that PaCO2 may be quite high
   and normal saturations are reflecting the supplemental oxygen. Although
   she has shown more evidence of spontaneous breathing in the past few
   days, there was some difficulty with intubation after last extubation.
   Given this and the fact that she was an aspiration risk even before
   this hospitalization, I would still proceed with trach and PEG, both of
   which can be removed in the next few months if she does well.
   Blood pressure has been hgih in the morning. Plan is to change
   frequency of metoprolol.
   Hct stable. No evidence of bleeding. Not at transfusion threshold.
   With anticoagulation being reversed, will need DVT prophylaxis.

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual with respiratory failure and pneumonia, currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. They have a history of anemia and are unable to provide their own history due to sedation and intubation. The patient's allergies include penicillins, aspirin (with a known GI bleed risk), and ACE inhibitors (with a known cough risk). They are receiving multiple ICU medications, including propofol, calcitonin, simvastatin, metoprolol, insulin, chlorhexidine, albuterol, atrovent, lasix, thyroxine, and colace.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/55 mmHg to 132/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Their temperature is within normal range at 37.4°C (99.3°F). The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable blood pressure and heart rate. Fluid balance is noted as positive 1,283 mL total input and negative 1,272 mL total output.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 24 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.29, PaCO2 of "

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated for
   about 13 days.  Trialed on pressure support this morning, doing well
   with respiratory drive on 15/5 and propafol turned down to 10mcgs/
   hr.
   -  IP will place trach and PEG today at bedside once INR is 1.5 or
   below
   - will get 4 bags FFP and recheck INR
   -will wean sedation to see how her respiratory drive improves for now
   -pt likely has defect in central drive for respiration though head
   imaging doesn
t show anything
 check VBG to see if she is hypercapnic
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd, though most recent echo showed an EF>55% and no diastolic
   dysfunction, no improvement in effusions with diuresis.  Prior
   thoracentesis showed a lymphocytic predominance.  Unclear if these
   effusions are playing a role in her respiratory distress.
   - cont to monitor
   .
   #Hypertension: poorly controlled, patient with a few low blood
   pressures over the past 24 hours  so no current adjustments will
   monitor BP
s as she comes off sedation
   - Change metoprolol to 75mg po TID (from 100mg po bid)
   - Nifedipine cannot be restarted because it cannot be crushed
   - continue holding losartan for now
   .
   #Acute renal failure: originally thought to be due to lasix and
   diuresis, FeNa at the time was 0.5, but current Cr appears to be at
   patient
s baseline.  Today Cr=1.4, which we believe is at her baseline
   renal function
   - holding losartan for now, though can consider restarting because Cr
   stable
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On coumadin for anticoagulation as well as hx
   of left atrial thrombus
   - INR 2.0 this AM, but holding coumadin for trach/PEG
   - got vitamin K po 5mg yesterday and will get 4 bags FFP today before
   procedure
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine.
   .
   #Diabetes Type II: Regular ISS

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent lingular pneumonia. She presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure and was intubated for about 13 days. The patient is currently on pressure support and is awake and alert. Tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were performed today. The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, and she has been given medications to manage it. Her recent labs show normal values for most parameters, but her creatinine level is at her baseline. She has multiple medical conditions including hypertension, acute renal failure, PVD, glaucoma, diabetes type II, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypercapnic respiratory failure and required intubation. Although she is now on pressure support and awake, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to her underlying lung condition and potential defects in central respiratory drive.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has pleural effusions that have not improved with diuretic therapy. These effusions may contribute to her respiratory distress, and further evaluation and management are needed.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is poorly controlled, and adjustments to her antihypertensive medication regimen may be necessary as"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated for
   about 13 days before getting Trach and PEG yesterday by IP.   Trialed
   on pressure support this morning, doing well with respiratory drive on
   15/5 and propafol turned off around 7:30am.  she is likely still
   sedated from high doses of fentanyl yesterday for procedure and for
   blood pressure elevation secondary to pain.
   - will restart Coumadin after IP comes by to check on patient
    - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   - can make transition to ventilator rehabilitation center to be weaned
   of vent
   .
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd, though most recent echo showed an EF>55% and no diastolic
   dysfunction, no improvement in effusions with diuresis.  Prior
   thoracentesis showed a lymphocytic predominance.  Unclear if these
   effusions are playing a role in her respiratory distress.
   - cont to monitor
   .
   #Hypertension:  pt had elevated pressure up to 200s systolic overnight
   consistently.  Fentanyl worked the first time to help bring down
   pressures thought to be associated with pain and discomfort
   post-procedure.  IV hydralazine had to be used the second time.
   - restarted home Losartan this AM
   - Change metoprolol to 75mg po TID (from 100mg po bid)
   - Nifedipine cannot be restarted because it cannot be crushed
   - will likely need a third [**Doctor Last Name 23**] to make up for nifedipine which can no
   longer be given
   .
   #Acute renal failure:   appears resolved with Cr at patient
s baseline
   1.4

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent lungular pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin. She presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure and was intubated for about 13 days before getting a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) yesterday. The patient is still sedated from high doses of fentanyl yesterday for a procedure and for blood pressure elevation secondary to pain.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has been on pressure support and is doing well with respiratory drive on 15/5. Propofol was turned off around 7:30 am. She will be restarted on Coumadin after the IP comes by to check on her. Albuterol and ipratropium will be continued, and she can make a transition to a ventilator rehabilitation center to be weaned off the ventilator.

2. Pleural effusions: The patient is on Lasix 60mg PO qd, but most recent echo showed an ejection fraction >55% and no diastolic dysfunction. No improvement in effusions with diuresis has been observed. Prior thoracentesis showed a lymphocytic predominance. It is unclear if these effusions are playing a role in her respiratory distress. Monitoring will continue"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure and pneumonia, and is also experiencing altered mental status. The patient had a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placed yesterday. 

The patient's blood pressure increased last night due to a missed dose of beta blocker. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) at a rate of 15/5 and sedation has been stopped this morning, leading to an improvement in mental status.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/62-146/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the tracheostomy tube.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1485 mL and output of 1520 mL, with a negative balance of 35 mL. The patient is receiving various medications through infusion, including metoprolol, hydralazine, fentanyl, and other ICU medications.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted improvements. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, and normal cardiovascular examination. Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds without crackles or wheezes. Abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender bowel sounds and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated for
   about 13 days before getting Trach and PEG yesterday by IP.   Trialed
   on pressure support this morning, doing well with respiratory drive on
   15/5 and propafol turned off around 7:30am.  she is likely still
   sedated from high doses of fentanyl yesterday for procedure and for
   blood pressure elevation secondary to pain.
   - Started Coumadin
    - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   - can make transition to ventilator rehabilitation center to be weaned
   of vent
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Elevated from yesterday with low grade fever and new LUL
   infiltrate on CXR. Concerning for VAP.
   - Pan culture
   - Empirically treat with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro
   #Agitation: Patient with intermittent agitation where she is pulling at
   her trach and biting nurses. Unclear if she is delirious, possibly
   secondary to infection, sundowning, or pain.
   - Assess for infection as above
   - Consider Zyprexa [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue standing Tylenol for pain
   #Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Increased Cr from 1.4 to 1.8.
   Pre-renal, renal, or post-renal.
   - Urine lytes pending
   - Consider ultrasound if concerning
   - Renally dose medications
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd, though most recent echo showed an EF>55% and no diastolic
   dysfunction, no improvement in effusions with diuresis.  Prior
   thoracentesis showed a lymphocytic predominance.  Unclear if these
   effusions are playing a role in her respiratory distress.
   - cont to monitor
   .
   #Hypertension: Currently with controlled BPs after losartan restarted
   yesterday.
   - Continue Losartan
   - Change metoprolol to 75mg po TID (from 100mg po bid)
   - Nifedipine cannot be restarted because it cannot be crushed
   - Continue to monitor and consider IV hydralazine for sbp > 180
   .
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass. On coumadin at home for anticoagulation as
   well as hx of left atrial thrombus
   - restart coumadin after IP checks her trach and PEG today
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue eye drop regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine
   .
   #Diabetes Type II: Regular ISS
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Recent TSH 2.2, Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue home dose simvastatin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent lingular pneumonia who presented to the hospital with hypercapnic respiratory failure. She was intubated for about 13 days before getting a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) yesterday. The patient has completed a course of vancomycin for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia and is likely still sedated from high doses of fentanyl yesterday for a procedure and for blood pressure elevation secondary to pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for about 13 days before getting a tracheostomy and PEG yesterday. She is likely still sedated from high doses of fentanyl yesterday for a procedure and for blood pressure elevation secondary to pain.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count with low-grade fever and new left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. This is concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Agitation: The patient exhibits intermittent agitation, pulling at her tracheostomy tube and biting nurses. It is unclear if she is delirious, possibly secondary to infection, sundowning, or pain"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo female with respiratory failure and now s/p trach and PEG
   placement.  She has had persistent and continued need for ventilatory
   support.  In addition she has an increase in WBC count from yesterday
   in the setting of low grade fever.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Will send sputum for culture
   -Will need to maintain regular evaluation for evolution of infiltrate
   -Will start antibiotics given rising WBC count, low grade infiltrate
   and new pulmonary infiltrate
will cover for pseudomonas and S.
   Aureus
Vanco/double coverage for GNR
s with Cefepime/Cipro
   -Will minimize sedation and look to maintain in MMV and move to trach
   mask trial
   -Souce of respiratory failure does remain to be full defined but
   combined issues of central and peripheral source of ventilatory failure
   seen
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Concerning increase in creatinine noted and will maintain adquate
   volume support
   -Follow urine ouput and creatinine
   -Urine lytes and ultrasound if worsening seen

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with respiratory failure who has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She continues to require ventilatory support and is being evaluated for the source of respiratory failure. There is an increase in white blood cell count and a low-grade fever, indicating a possible infection. Antibiotics have been started to cover for Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient will be monitored closely for any changes in her condition.

The patient also has acute renal failure, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels. Adequate volume support will be maintained, and urine output and creatinine will be closely monitored. If necessary, urine electrolytes and ultrasound may be performed.

Other findings include hypertension, which is considered benign in this case. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support through enteral feeding and glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale. She has a PICC line in place for medication administration. Prophylactic measures include systemic anticoagulation to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and precautions to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and she will remain in the ICU for further management."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated for
   about 13 days before getting Trach and PEG [**2138-11-13**] by IP.   On
   pressure support overnight, doing well with 12/5 and propafol off all
   day and night.   She did get zyprexa last night which helped with
   agitation and may have sedated her slightly.  Likely has new VAP, in
   context of new LUL infiltrate on CXR.  Placed on PS 5/0 trial this AM.
   - Day # 2 Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro
   - F/U blood/urine/sputum Cxs
   - continue on PS 5/0 as much as pt can tolerate and try trach collar
   while sitting up; can get VBG after a couple of hours on PS 5/0
   - consider PT consult
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   - can make transition to ventilator rehabilitation center to be weaned
   of vent, likely Monday
   .
   #Agitation:  Was not agitated overnight last night, though had
   attempted biting nurses previous night.  Zyprexa had good effect last
   night.  [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to delirium in setting of new
   pneumonia.
   - Zyprexa PRN, consider standing order [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue standing Tylenol for pain
   #Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Increased Cr to 1.9 from 1.4.  Has
   some chronic renal insufficiency, intrarenal.  Likely has some prerenal
   component because hyaline casts in yesterday
s UA, but not given much
   fluid overall.  [**Month (only) 11**] have some post-renal component as well.
   - FeNa 1.9% from [**11-15**]
   - hold off on IVFs now as urine output has picked up from 20cc/hr to
   40cc/hr later this AM and is positive almost 1L in past 8hrs
   - Consider ultrasound if continues to worsen
   - Renally dose medications
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd, though most recent echo showed an EF>55% and no diastolic
   dysfunction, no improvement in effusions with diuresis.  Prior
   thoracentesis showed a lymphocytic predominance.  Unclear if these
   effusions are playing a role in her respiratory distress.
   - cont to monitor
   .
   #Hypertension: Currently with controlled BPs.
   - Continue Losartan
   - Change metoprolol to 75mg po TID (from 100mg po bid)
   - continue PRN zyprexa for agitation which contributes to increased BPs
   - Nifedipine cannot be restarted because it cannot be crushed
   - Continue to monitor and consider IV hydralazine for sbp > 180
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass.  Has hx of left atrial thrombus.  Restarted
   Coumadin [**11-14**] afternoon.
   -  follow INR
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue eye drop regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine
   .
   #Diabetes Type II: Regular ISS
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose Levothyroxine
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue home dose simvastatin

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia who presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure. She was intubated for about 13 days before getting a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy on 11/13/2138. 

The patient is currently on pressure support with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 6 breaths per minute. She has a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and an FiO2 of 40%. Her ABG shows a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 60 mmHg, and PaO2 of 80 mmHg. 

The patient's leukocyte count is elevated at 353 K/uL, and her blood culture shows an increase in leukocytosis with possible left upper lobe opacity on chest X-ray. She has been placed on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been sent for follow-up.

The patient's agitation has been managed with zyprexa, which seems to have had a positive effect. She is currently on propofol and albuterol with ipratropium. The plan is to continue pressure support"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presents
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was intubated for
   about 13 days before getting Trach and PEG [**2138-11-13**] by IP.   On
   pressure support overnight, doing well with 12/5 and propafol off all
   day and night.   She did get zyprexa last night which helped with
   agitation and may have sedated her slightly.  Likely has new VAP, in
   context of new LUL infiltrate on CXR.  Placed on PS 5/0 trial this AM.
   - Day # 2 Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro
   - F/U blood/urine/sputum Cxs
   - continue on PS 5/0 as much as pt can tolerate and try trach collar
   while sitting up; can get VBG after a couple of hours on PS 5/0
   - consider PT consult
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   - can make transition to ventilator rehabilitation center to be weaned
   of vent, likely Monday
   .
   #Agitation:  Was not agitated overnight last night, though had
   attempted biting nurses previous night.  Zyprexa had good effect last
   night.  [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to delirium in setting of new
   pneumonia.
   - Zyprexa PRN, consider standing order [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue standing Tylenol for pain
   #Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Increased Cr to 1.9 from 1.4.  Has
   some chronic renal insufficiency, intrarenal.  Likely has some prerenal
   component because hyaline casts in yesterday
s UA, but not given much
   fluid overall.  [**Month (only) 11**] have some post-renal component as well.  Did
   receive 500ml bolus very early this AM.
   - FeNa 1.9% from [**11-15**]
   - hold off on IVFs now as urine output has picked up from 20cc/hr to
   40cc/hr later this AM and is positive almost 1L in past 8hrs
   - Consider ultrasound if continues to worsen
   - Renally dose medications
   #Pleural effusions: On outpatient basis, patient is on Lasix 60mg PO
   qd, though most recent echo showed an EF>55% and no diastolic
   dysfunction, no improvement in effusions with diuresis.  Prior
   thoracentesis showed a lymphocytic predominance.  Unclear if these
   effusions are playing a role in her respiratory distress.
   - cont to monitor
   .
   #Hypertension: Currently with controlled BPs.
   - Continue Losartan
   - Change metoprolol to 75mg po TID (from 100mg po bid)
   - continue PRN zyprexa for agitation which contributes to increased BPs
   - Nifedipine cannot be restarted because it cannot be crushed
   - Continue to monitor and consider IV hydralazine for sbp > 180
   .
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass.  Has hx of left atrial thrombus.  Restarted
   Coumadin [**11-14**] afternoon.
   -  follow INR w goal [**3-18**]
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue eye drop regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine
   .
   #Diabetes Type II: Regular ISS
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose Levothyroxine, switch back to PO
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue home dose simvastatin

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia who presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated for about 13 days and received tracheostomy and PEG on 11/13. She is currently on pressure support and doing well with a respiratory rate of 12/5. Propofol was discontinued, and she received Zyprexa last night, which helped with agitation and may have sedated her slightly. She is suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with a new infiltrate on chest X-ray. She is being placed on PS 5/0 trial and will be given vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures are pending.

The patient is also experiencing agitation, possibly due to delirium secondary to new pneumonia. Zyprexa is being given PRN, and consideration is being given to a standing order for Zyprexa. Tylenol is being given for pain.

The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is worsening, with an increase in creatinine from 1.4 to 1.9. She has some chronic renal insufficiency, intrarenal, and likely some prerenal component as well. Hyaline casts were found in yesterday"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 90-year-old female with chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia.
- She presented to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure and was intubated for 13 days before receiving a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
- The patient is currently on pressure support and tolerating well, with a recent decrease in minute ventilation to 3-4L due to tidal volumes dropping to 200cc.
- She has been started on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's leukocytosis has increased from yesterday, accompanied by a low-grade fever and new left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, raising concerns for VAP.
- Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been obtained, and empirical treatment with the mentioned antibiotics has been initiated.
- The patient is also experiencing intermittent agitation, pulling at her tracheostomy tube and biting nurses. It is unclear if she is delirious, possibly secondary to infection, sundowning, or pain.
- Zyprexa has been administered as needed, and consideration is being given to a standing order for it.
- The patient's acute-on-chronic renal failure has worsened, with an increase in creatinine from 1"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 91-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure and subsequent tracheostomy in the setting of lobar pneumonia. She presents with altered mental status and persistent need for ventilatory support. The patient has been on a combination of antibiotics including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime. She is currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) which have been well-tolerated. The plan is to wean her off the ventilator and complete pneumonia treatment. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/47 mmHg to 146/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and blood glucose levels. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, aspirin causing gastrointestinal bleeding, and ACE inhibitors causing cough. She is currently sedated and unable to provide a personal history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure and continues to require ventilatory support due to altered mental status and ongoing respiratory status. Weaning off the ventilator may pose challenges.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has lobar pneumonia, and it is crucial to complete the prescribed antibiotic regimen to treat the infection effectively.

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presented
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure. Now s/p trach/peg and
   new LUL VAP.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure c/b VAP: Patient was
   intubated for about 13 days before getting Trach and PEG [**2138-11-13**] by
   IP. She did get zyprexa last night which helped with agitation and may
   have sedated her slightly.  Likely has new VAP, in context of new LUL
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Continue empiric coverage of Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro (Day 3 of 10 Began:
   [**11-14**])
   - F/U blood/urine/sputum Cxs
   - Continue on PS 5/0 as much as pt can tolerate and try trach collar
   while sitting up; can get VBG after a couple of hours on PS 5/0
   - consider PT consult
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   - Likely d/c to rehab facility today
   .
   #Agitation:  Was not agitated overnight last night, though had
   attempted biting nurses previous night.  Zyprexa had good effect last
   night.  [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to delirium in setting of new
   pneumonia. Patient appeared to have become more agitated with grimacing
   when she was moved. Concerning for her chronic pain that is not
   relieved with standing Tylenol.
   - Consider morphine PRN.
   - Zyprexa PRN, consider standing order [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue standing Tylenol for pain
   #Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Improving with Cr to 1.5  from 1.7.
   Has some chronic renal insufficiency, intrarenal.  Likely has some
   prerenal component because hyaline casts in yesterday
s UA, but not
   given much fluid overall.  [**Month (only) 11**] have some post-renal component as well.
   Did receive 500ml bolus very early this AM.
   - FeNa 1.9% from [**11-15**]
   - hold off on IVFs now as urine output has picked up from 20cc/hr to
   40cc/hr later this AM and is positive almost 1L in past 8hrs
   - Consider ultrasound if continues to worsen
   - Renally dose medications
   #Hypertension: Currently with controlled BPs.
   - Continue Losartan
   - Change metoprolol to 75mg po TID (from 100mg po bid)
   - continue PRN zyprexa for agitation which contributes to increased BPs
   - Nifedipine cannot be restarted because it cannot be crushed
   - Continue to monitor and consider IV hydralazine for sbp > 180
   .
   # Constipation: Has not had bowel movement in several days on top of
   getting continuous tube feeds.
   - Change lactulose to standing until patient has a bowel movement
   - Continue PRN colace, senna
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass.  Has hx of left atrial thrombus.  Restarted
   Coumadin [**11-14**] afternoon.
   -  follow INR w goal [**3-18**]

","The patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia who presented to the hospital with hypercapnic respiratory failure. She is now in the ICU for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is s/p trach/peg and new left upper lobe (LUL) VAP.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient tolerated pressure support 5/0 trial, trach collar trial, but became agitated and was given zyprexa with little effect.
- RSBI in the AM is still not sedated overnight.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 144/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated levels of WBC, Hct, and platelets, as well as decreased levels of TCO2, glucose, and albumin.
- The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and her creatinine level has improved from 1.7 to 1.5.
- The patient's agitation is likely secondary to delirium in the setting of new pneumonia, and she may require morphine PRN for chronic pain relief.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lung pneumonia. She presented with hypercapnic respiratory failure and was intubated for about 13 days before getting a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She is now suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to a new left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Agitation: The patient appears to be experiencing agitation, which may be secondary to delirium in the setting of new pneumonia. She also has chronic pain from conditions like spinal stenosis, chronic left arm pain, and neuropathy. Morphine can be considered for pain control, and zyprexa can be reassessed for agitation.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function with creatinine levels improving from 1.7 to 1.5. There are hyaline casts in her urine, indicating some prerenal component. Fluid restriction should be continued, and an ultrasound may be considered if the condition worsens.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled. Medications such as losartan, metoprolol, and nifedipine need to be monitored and adjusted accordingly.
4. Constipation: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, pneumonia, anemia, and renal failure. The patient is currently off the ventilator and on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode. They are also receiving oxygen therapy with a FiO2 of 40% and have a positive fluid balance. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, aspirin, and ACE inhibitors. They are currently being treated for staph tracheobronchitis and are being given antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/56 to 168/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL and renal failure with an elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL. The patient's condition has been improving, but they still require ICU care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status can worsen due to pneumonia and the use of mechanical ventilation. They may develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or have difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
2. Infection: Staph tracheobronchitis is already being treated, but there is"

      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI  IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    MODERATE GROWTH.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presented
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure. Now s/p trach/peg and
   new LUL VAP.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure c/b VAP: Patient was
   intubated for about 13 days before getting Trach and PEG [**2138-11-13**] by
   IP. She did get zyprexa last night which helped with agitation and may
   have sedated her slightly.  Likely has new VAP, in context of new LUL
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Continue empiric coverage of Vanc (Day 5 of 8 Began: [**11-14**]) Prelim
   cultures are coag + Staph Aureus will f/u sensitivities
   - F/U blood/urine/sputum Cxs
   - Continue on PS 5/0 as much as pt can tolerate and try trach collar
   while sitting up; can get VBG after a couple of hours on PS 5/0
   - PT consult pending
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   - Likely d/c to rehab facility today or tomorrow pending the daughter
   decision on facility
   .
   #Agitation: Appeared to grimace upon moving q 2 hours appearing in
   pain, may have had an element of agitation previous night as she
   attempted to bite nurses.  Zyprexa had good effect two nights prior.
   [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to delirium in setting of new pneumonia.  Also,
   concerning she is not adequately pain controlled on standing tylenol
   for her chronic pain.  Spinal stenosis, chronic left arm pain and
   neuropathy all contribute to her chronic pain.
   - d/c zyprexa for now and re-assess need if agitation increases
   - Continue standing Tylenol and add tramadol for pain
   #Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Improving with Cr at 1.6, back to her
   baseline.  Has some chronic renal insufficiency, intrarenal.  Likely
   has some prerenal component because hyaline casts in UA, but not given
   much fluid overall.  [**Month (only) 11**] have some post-renal component as well.
   - Goal of  500cc-1 liter negative today as patient is quite volume up.
   - Renally dose medications
   #Hypertension: Currently with controlled BPs.
   - Continue Losartan
   - Continue metoprolol to 75mg po TID
   - Add Amlodipine 5mg daily
   .
   # Constipation: Pt. with small BM on [**11-17**] and has been getting
   continuous tube feeds.
   - Will continue standing lactulose pending a larger BM
   - Continue PRN colace, senna
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass.  Has hx of left atrial thrombus.  Restarted
   Coumadin [**11-14**] afternoon.

","Summary:
The patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lobar pneumonia who presented with hypercapnic respiratory failure. She was intubated for about 13 days before getting a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient now has new left upper lobe ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is being treated with empiric coverage of vancomycin. Her current vital signs are stable, but she remains on mechanical ventilation. The patient's agitation has improved with the use of zyprexa. She has completed her course of vancomycin for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia. The patient's renal function is improving, and her blood pressure is well-controlled. She also has chronic pain due to spinal stenosis, neuropathy, and a history of chronic renal insufficiency. The patient's hypertension is managed with losartan, metoprolol, and amlodipine. She is also being treated for constipation, peripheral vascular disease, glaucoma, diabetes type II, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is expected to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility soon.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presented
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure. Now s/p trach/peg and
   new LUL VAP.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure c/b VAP: Patient was
   intubated for about 13 days before getting Trach and PEG [**2138-11-13**] by
   IP. She did get zyprexa last night which helped with agitation and may
   have sedated her slightly.  Likely has new VAP, in context of new LUL
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Continue empiric coverage of Vanc (Day 4 of 8 Began: [**11-14**]) Prelim
   cultures are coag + Staph Aureus will f/u sensitivities
   - F/U blood/urine/sputum Cxs
   - Continue on PS 5/0 as much as pt can tolerate and try trach collar
   while sitting up; can get VBG after a couple of hours on PS 5/0
   - PT consult pending
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   - Likely d/c to rehab facility today
   .
   #Agitation: Appeared to grimace upon moving q 2 hours appearing in
   pain, may have had an element of agitation previous night as she
   attempted to bite nurses.  Zyprexa had good effect two nights prior.
   [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to delirium in setting of new pneumonia.  Also,
   concerning she is not adequately pain controlled on standing tylenol
   for her chronic pain.  Spinal stenosis, chronic left arm pain and
   neuropathy all contribute to her chronic pain.
   - Consider morphine PRN.
   - d/c zyprexa for now and re-assess need if agitation increases
   - Continue standing Tylenol for pain
   #Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Improving with Cr to 1.5  from 1.7.
   Has some chronic renal insufficiency, intrarenal.  Likely has some
   prerenal component because hyaline casts in UA, but not given much
   fluid overall.  [**Month (only) 11**] have some post-renal component as well.
   - Goal of  500cc-1 liter negative today as patient is quite volume up.
   - FeNa 1.9% from [**11-15**]
   - Consider ultrasound if continues to worsen
   - Renally dose medications
   #Hypertension: Currently with controlled BPs.
   - Continue Losartan
   - Change metoprolol to 75mg po TID (from 100mg po bid)
   - Nifedipine cannot be restarted because it cannot be crushed
   - Would increase metoprolol if needed for BP control
   .
   # Constipation: Pt. with small BM on [**11-17**] and has been getting
   continuous tube feeds.
   - Will continue standing lactulose pending a larger BM
   - Continue PRN colace, senna
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass.  Has hx of left atrial thrombus.  Restarted
   Coumadin [**11-14**] afternoon.
   -  follow INR w goal [**3-18**]
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue eye drop regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine
   .
   #Diabetes Type II: Well controlled on current regimen
   - Regular ISS
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose Levothyroxine, switch back to PO
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue home dose simvastatin

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia. She presented to the hospital with hypercapnic respiratory failure and was intubated for about 13 days before getting a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient is now suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to new left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. She is also experiencing agitation, possibly secondary to delirium related to the new pneumonia. Other issues include acute on chronic renal failure, hypertension, constipation, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), glaucoma, diabetes type II, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's symptoms and the presence of a new infiltrate on the chest X-ray suggest the possibility of VAP. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic coverage and follow up with culture sensitivities.
2. Delirium: The patient's agitation may be due to delirium caused by the new pneumonia. It is essential to address this issue and provide appropriate pain management.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has worsening renal function, which needs to be closely monitored. Goals include maintaining adequate fluid balance and considering an ultrasound if renal function"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presented
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure. Now s/p trach/peg and
   new LUL VAP.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure c/b VAP: Patient was
   intubated for about 13 days before getting Trach and PEG [**2138-11-13**] by
   IP. She did get zyprexa last night which helped with agitation and may
   have sedated her slightly.  Likely has new VAP, in context of new LUL
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Continue empiric coverage of Vanc (Day 4 of 8 Began: [**11-14**]) Prelim
   cultures are coag + Staph Aureus will f/u sensitivities
   - F/U blood/urine/sputum Cxs
   - Continue on PS 5/0 as much as pt can tolerate and try trach collar
   while sitting up; can get VBG after a couple of hours on PS 5/0
   - PT consult pending
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   - Likely d/c to rehab facility today
   .
   #Agitation: Appeared to grimace upon moving q 2 hours appearing in
   pain, may have had an element of agitation previous night as she
   attempted to bite nurses.  Zyprexa had good effect two nights prior.
   [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to delirium in setting of new pneumonia.  Also,
   concerning she is not adequately pain controlled on standing tylenol
   for her chronic pain.  Spinal stenosis, chronic left arm pain and
   neuropathy all contribute to her chronic pain.
   - Consider morphine PRN.
   - d/c zyprexa for now and re-assess need if agitation increases
   - Continue standing Tylenol for pain
   #Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Improving with Cr to 1.5  from 1.7.
   Has some chronic renal insufficiency, intrarenal.  Likely has some
   prerenal component because hyaline casts in UA, but not given much
   fluid overall.  [**Month (only) 11**] have some post-renal component as well.
   - Goal of  500cc-1 liter negative today as patient is quite volume up.
   - FeNa 1.9% from [**11-15**]
   - Consider ultrasound if continues to worsen
   - Renally dose medications
   #Hypertension: Currently with controlled BPs.
   - Continue Losartan
   - Change metoprolol to 75mg po TID (from 100mg po bid)
   - Nifedipine cannot be restarted because it cannot be crushed
   - Continue to monitor and consider IV hydralazine for sbp > 180
   .
   # Constipation: Has not had bowel movement in several days on top of
   getting continuous tube feeds.
   - Change lactulose to standing until patient has a bowel movement
   - Continue PRN colace, senna
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass.  Has hx of left atrial thrombus.  Restarted
   Coumadin [**11-14**] afternoon.
   -  follow INR w goal [**3-18**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia. She presented to the hospital with hypercapnic respiratory failure and was intubated for about 13 days before getting a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient has developed new lung infiltrates on chest X-ray and is suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is currently on empiric coverage of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia. The preliminary respiratory culture shows moderate growth of coag + Staph aureus, and sensitivities will be followed up.

The patient is also experiencing agitation, likely secondary to delirium in the setting of new pneumonia. She is not adequately pain controlled on standing Tylenol for her chronic pain, which includes spinal stenosis, chronic left arm pain, and neuropathy. Morphine PRN is considered for pain control.

The patient's renal function is improving, with creatinine decreasing from 1.7 to 1.5. There is a goal of negative fluid balance today as the patient is quite volume overloaded. FeNa is 1.9%, and if renal function worsens, an ultrasound may be considered. Renally dosed medications are also considered.

The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled, and she is on losartan,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include respiratory failure, altered mental status, renal failure, anemia, and pneumonia.

From the note, it is evident that the patient has been on mechanical ventilation support due to respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status has been fluctuating, as they were taking very shallow breaths on pressure support ventilation (PSV) last night, prompting an increase in pressure support. In the morning, the patient tolerated PSV 5/5 again, but became tachypneic during a trial of tracheostomy tube extubation.

The patient's creatinine level has slightly improved, and they are being diuresed to achieve a negative fluid balance. However, only a small negative fluid balance was achieved yesterday. The patient's nutritional status is also a concern, as mentioned in the alteration in nutrition section.

The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, anemia, and pneumonia. They are currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic measures such as DVT prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's lab results show some abnormalities, including anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results, including electrolytes and liver function tests, are within normal range.

The patient's vital signs are stable,"

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1529**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of chronic renal failure,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and
   recent lingular pneumonia s/p treatment wth Levofloxacin who presented
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with hypercapnic respiratory failure. Now s/p trach/peg and
   new LUL VAP.
   .
   #Hypercapnic Hypoxemic respiratory failure c/b VAP: Patient was
   intubated for about 13 days before getting Trach and PEG [**2138-11-13**] by
   IP. She did get zyprexa last night which helped with agitation and may
   have sedated her slightly.  Likely has new VAP, in context of new LUL
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Empirically covered by Vanc (Day 6 of 8 Began: [**11-14**]) Sputum cultures
   MSSA; resistent to levoflox. Consider narrowing coverage to Oxacillin;
   - F/U blood Cxs
   - Continue on PS 5/0 as much as pt can tolerate and try trach collar
   while sitting up; can get VBG after a couple of hours on PS 5/0
   - PT consult pending
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   - Likely d/c to rehab facility today or tomorrow pending the daughter
   decision on facility
   .
   #Agitation: Appeared to grimace upon moving q 2 hours appearing in
   pain, may have had an element of agitation previous night as she
   attempted to bite nurses.  Zyprexa had good effect two nights prior.
   [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to delirium in setting of new pneumonia.  Also,
   concerning she is not adequately pain controlled on standing tylenol
   for her chronic pain.  Spinal stenosis, chronic left arm pain and
   neuropathy all contribute to her chronic pain.
   - d/c zyprexa for now and re-assess need if agitation increases
   - Continue standing Tylenol and tramadol prn pain
   #Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Improving with Cr at 1.5, back to her
   baseline.  Has some chronic renal insufficiency, intrarenal.  Likely
   has some prerenal component because hyaline casts in UA, but not given
   much fluid overall.  .
   - Renally dose medications
   #Hypertension: Currently with controlled BPs.  Increases intermittently
   with agitation/pain
   - Continue Losartan
   - Continue metoprolol to 75mg po TID
   - Continue Amlodipine 5mg daily
   - Pain control
   .
   # Constipation: Improved. Pt. with several large bowel movements.
   - Will continue standing lactulose pending a larger BM
   - Continue PRN colace, senna
   #PVD: She is s/p bypass.  Has hx of left atrial thrombus.  Restarted
   Coumadin [**11-14**] afternoon.
   -  follow INR w goal [**3-18**]
   .
   #Glaucoma: pt legally blind
   - Continue eye drop regimen of atropine, cosopt, brimonidine
   .
   #Diabetes Type II: Patient with elevated blood sugars, will add fixed
   dose of glargine 5units QHS and continue ISS
   - Glargine & Regular ISS

","Summary:
Mrs. [Lastname] is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, PVD, and recent lingular pneumonia who presented with hypercapnic respiratory failure. She has been intubated for about 13 days and underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement on [2138-11-13]. She is now suspected of having a new lung infection, specifically ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as evidenced by new left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. Empirical coverage with vancomycin has been initiated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the new lung infiltrate and presence of Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters on sputum culture, there is a high suspicion for VAP. The patient is already on vancomycin, which covers methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), but the sensitivity report suggests resistance to levofloxacin. Considering this, narrowing the coverage to oxacillin may be necessary.
2. Delirium: The patient has been experiencing agitation and grimacing, which could be secondary to delirium in the setting of new pneumonia. Zyprexa has shown good effect in reducing agitation, but it will be important to reassess the need for this medication.
3. Pain management: The patient appears to be inadequ"

   intubated for about 13 days before getting Trach and PEG [**2138-11-13**] by
   IP. She did get zyprexa last night which helped with agitation and may
   have sedated her slightly.  Likely has new VAP, in context of new LUL
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - Empirically covered by Vanc (Day 6 of 8 Began: [**11-14**]) Sputum cultures
   MSSA; resistent to levoflox. Since patient has a pcn allergy, will
   continue with vancomycin to complete full 8 day course
   - F/U blood Cxs; if any growth occurs, will contact rehab facility.
   - Continue on PS 5/0 as much as pt can tolerate and try trach collar
   while sitting up;
   - PT consult pending
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium
   -has already completed course of vancomycin for MSSA pneumonia
   - Likely d/c to rehab facility today or tomorrow pending the daughter
   decision on facility
   .
   #Agitation: Appeared to grimace upon moving q 2 hours appearing in
   pain, may have had an element of agitation previous night as she
   attempted to bite nurses.  Zyprexa had good effect two nights prior.
   [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to delirium in setting of new pneumonia.  Also,
   concerning she is not adequately pain controlled on standing tylenol
   for her chronic pain.  Spinal stenosis, chronic left arm pain and
   neuropathy all contribute to her chronic pain.
   - d/c zyprexa for now and re-assess need if agitation increases
   - Continue standing Tylenol and tramadol prn pain
   #Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Improving with Cr at 1.5, back to her
   baseline.  Has some chronic renal insufficiency, intrarenal.  Likely
   has some prerenal component because hyaline casts in UA, but not given
   much fluid overall.  .
   - Renally dose medications
   #Hypertension: Currently with controlled BPs.  Increases intermittently
   with agitation/pain
   - Continue Losartan
   - Continue metoprolol to 75mg po TID; will change to long acting toprol
   XL upon discharge
   - Continue Amlodipine 5mg daily
   - Pain control

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, spinal stenosis, legal blindness, peripheral vascular disease, and recent lingular pneumonia treated with Levofloxacin. She presented with hypercapnic respiratory failure and was intubated for about 13 days before getting a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on 11/13. She is now suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to new lung infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient has been empirically covered with Vancomycin (Day 6 of 8 started on 11/14) for MSSA; resistant to Levofloxacin. Since the patient has a penicillin allergy, Vancomycin will be continued to complete the full 8-day course. Follow-up blood cultures have been ordered, and if any growth occurs, the rehabilitation facility will be contacted.

The patient's agitation is likely secondary to delirium in the setting of new pneumonia. She has not been adequately pain-controlled on standing Tylenol for her chronic pain, which includes spinal stenosis, chronic left arm pain, and neuropathy. Zyprexa has been effective in controlling agitation two nights prior but has been discontinued for now. Tramadol will be continued as needed for pain.

The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is improving, with creatinine at 1.5,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old obese male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and alteration in nutrition. He presented to the ICU with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. He has been sedated and mechanically ventilated since admission. His mental status has improved now that sedation has been discontinued. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is expected to continue weaning from the ventilator in rehab today. His course of antibiotics will be completed soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with pneumonia, which caused respiratory failure. There is a risk of complications such as worsening infection, sepsis, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus, which can lead to complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, especially if his glycemic control is not managed properly.
3. Hypertension: The patient has benign hypertension, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications if not well-controlled.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. This could be due to chronic disease, blood loss, or other causes. Anemia can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and fatigue.
5. Malnutrition: The patient has alteration in nutrition, which suggests he may be at risk for malnutrition. Poor nutritional status can impair wound healing, immune function, and"
