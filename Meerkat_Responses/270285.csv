 CHEST PAIN
   Mr. [**Known firstname 275**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4964**] [**Known lastname 8175**] is a very nice 60 year-old gentleman with DM2,
   HTN, dyslipidemia, and strong family history of CAD who presented with
   chest pain and was found to have LMCA disease and is awaiting CABG, who
   had CP episode today and is transfered to CV-ICU for monitoring.
   .
   # CAD: Pt presented with DOE, which can be angina-equivalent and with
   CP, which was very suspicious for CAD. TIMI score: 3, which gives him
   13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or
   severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. Due to
   high suspision he was sent directly to cardiac cath, which showed LMCA
   and LAD lessions. Given these findings and most importantly in a DM
   patient, he certainly can benefir much more from CABG compared to PCI.
   He was awaiting CABG and had episode of CP without ECG changes while
   hypertensive. It resolved in minutes and with nitroglycerin gtt.
   - Continue Aspirin 325 mg Daily
   - Stopped nitro drip yesterday- patient asymptomatic
   - Pt on heparin gtt
   - On tricor (home dose) and pravastatin

   BPM
   - Pt on lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - plan for CABG endoscopic on Monday
   - CXR done yesterday
   - will obtain UA, and TTE prior to procedure
   - monitor on tele
   - Started on Vitamin D 1200 IU per day for decreasing cardiovascular
   risk

   very low activity suggesting chronic heart failure. Getting
   echocardiogram to assess EF.
   - Pt on pravastatin, lisinopril; not on beta-blocker

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a strong family history of coronary artery disease. He presented with chest pain and was found to have left main coronary artery disease. The patient is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) but had a cardiac event today and was transferred to the cardiac ICU for monitoring.

The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and depression. He is currently on various medications including aspirin, nitroglycerin, heparin, tricorn, pravastatin, lisinopril, and sertraline. The patient's current vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 97/48 to 142/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the heart or lungs, and his abdomen is soft with no notable findings. Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and glucose levels, but all other parameters are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU for any signs of acute heart failure, given his history of chronic heart failure. An echocardiogram will be obtained to assess the patient's ejection fraction. The patient"

 CHEST PAIN
   Mr. [**Known firstname 275**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4964**] [**Known lastname 8175**] is a very nice 60 year-old gentleman with DM2,
   HTN, dyslipidemia, and strong family history of CAD who presented with
   chest pain and was found to have LMCA disease and is awaiting CABG, who
   had CP episode today and is transfered to CV-ICU for monitoring.
   .
   # CAD: Pt presented with DOE, which can be angina-equivalent and with
   CP, which was very suspicious for CAD. TIMI score: 3, which gives him
   13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or
   severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. Due to
   high suspision he was sent directly to cardiac cath, which showed LMCA
   and LAD lessions. Given these findings and most importantly in a DM
   patient, he certainly can benefir much more from CABG compared to PCI.
   He was awaiting CABG and had episode of CP without ECG changes while
   hypertensive. It resolved in minutes and with nitroglycerin gtt.
   - Continue Aspirin 325 mg Daily
   - Stopped nitro drip yesterday- patient asymptomatic
   - Pt on heparin gtt
   - On tricor (home dose) and pravastatin
   - no plavix as patient is awaiting CABG
   - Holding BB for now, but will start as needed for target HR of 50-70
   BPM
   - Pt on lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - plan for CABG endoscopic on Monday
   - CXR done yesterday
   - will obtain UA, and TTE prior to procedure
   - monitor on tele
   - Started on Vitamin D 1200 IU per day for decreasing cardiovascular
   risk
   .
   # Pump - No signs of acute heart failure at the time, but patient has
   very low activity suggesting chronic heart failure. Getting
   echocardiogram to assess EF.
   -          Pt on pravastatin, lisinopril; not on beta-blocker
   -          Re-start BB after surgery
   .
   # DM Type II with large insulin dose. Last A1C above goal. Will give
   insulin according to home dose. Hold metformin because of dye load. [**Month (only) 8**]
   need to increase basal insulin dose.
   - ISS
   .
   # HTN: Given bradycardia, will not add Beta-blocker. Will continue home
   lisinopril.
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Continue Tricor, niacin. Will change to atorvastatin in
   setting of ACS as above.  Normal LFTs.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose.
   - check TSH given diaphoresis/ heat intolerance.
   .
   # Neck/back pain: Percocet prn.
   .
   # Depression: Continue sertraline.
   .
   # Insomnia: Ambien prn
   .
   # Anxiety: Lorazepam prn
   .
   #. Degenerative disc disease in cervical spine - Pt on percocet for
   pain control. Anesthesia should be aware, given possible cervica
   abnromalities at time of intubation.
   .
   # FEN: NPO tonight for possible IABPC in case CP, CHF or unstability.
   Will monitor electrolytes, Cr.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV's

","The patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and strong family history of coronary artery disease. He presented with chest pain and was found to have left main coronary artery disease. He is currently awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) but had an episode of chest pain today and was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit for monitoring.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/48 mmHg to 142/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. His physical examination is unremarkable except for right groin dressing intact without hematoma.

His laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. However, his creatinine level is slightly elevated at 1.3 mg/dL. His electrolytes are within normal range.

The patient is currently on aspirin, heparin, tricorn, pravastatin, lisinopril, and vitamin D. He will continue with his current medications and will have an endoscopic CABG procedure on Monday. He will also undergo an echocardiogram to assess ejection fraction and obtain a chest X-ray, urine analysis, and trans-thor"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with a history of DM2, HTN, dyslipidemia, and a strong family history of CAD. He presented with chest pain and was found to have LMCA disease. He is awaiting CABG and had an episode of CP without ECG changes while hypertensive, which resolved in minutes with nitroglycerin. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tmax: 37.2 C, Tcurrent: 36.4 C, HR: 63 bpm, BP: 97/48 mmHg, RR: 21 insp/min, and SpO2: 97%. His heart rhythm is SR (Sinus Rhythm). 

Laboratory results show WBC: 6.6, Hct: 37.6, Plt: 171, Cr: 1.1, Glucose: 117 mg/dL, PT/PTT/INR: 13.3/35.3/1.1, Ca++: 10.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.6 mg/dL, and PO4: 4.2 mg/dL. 

The patient is currently on several medications including aspirin, nitroglycerin, heparin, pravastatin, lisinopril, and vitamin D. 

Assessment and plan include the following:
- Continue aspirin 325 mg daily
- Continue nitroglycerin gtt with target SBP <140 mmHg and pain-free
- Pt on heparin gtt
- Continue pravastatin 20 mg daily, but will discuss with pharmacy interactions with Tri-Cor and niacin of lipitor given his severe CAD
- No plavix as patient is awaiting CABG
- Holding BB for now, but will start as needed for target HR of 50-70 bpm
- Pt on lisinopril 10 mg daily
- Plan for CABG endoscopic on Monday
- Will obtain CXR, UA, and TTE prior to procedure
- Monitor on tele
- Starting Vitamin D 1200 IU per day for decreasing cardiovascular risk

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute heart failure due to LMCA disease and LAD lesions.
2. Recurrent episodes of CP (chest pain) which may indicate ongoing ischemia.
3. Complications related to CABG surgery such as bleeding, infection, or adverse reaction to anesthesia.
4. Hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy for DM2.
5. Hypotension or hypertension due to medication effects or cardiovascular instability.
6. Thrombosis or bleeding complications related to anticoagulant therapy.
7. Respiratory infections such as VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
8. DVT (deep vein thrombosis) or PE (pulmonary embolism) due to immobility and risk factors.
9. GIB (gastrointestinal bleeding) due to stress ulcer prophylaxis or other causes.
10. Electrolyte imbalances due to kidney function and fluid management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient underwent an elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery yesterday and has been admitted to the ICU for post-operative care. The patient's allergies include penicillins, which cause hives. The patient was given trazodone and ativan at night for anxiety.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 72 bpm with a range of 52-96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/50 mmHg to 143/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with a range of 13-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,321 mL total, with 361 mL given through the IV line and 4 mL given through the TF line. Output includes 3,840 mL of urine and -2,519 mL in the drain balance. The patient is not on respiratory support and has an oxygen saturation of 98%.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL, platelet count of 171 K/uL, creatinine of 1.1, and glucose level of 194 mg/dL. Other lab values include a PT of 13.3, PTT of 75.9, INR of 1.1, calcium level of 10.1 mg/dL, magnesium level of 2.6 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 4.2 mg/dL.

The patient has been monitored closely with regular vital sign checks, hemodynamic monitoring, and fluid balance tracking. The patient's chest pain is being managed in the ICU, along with nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to being in the ICU and having indwelling lines and drains. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count, is important.
2. Bleeding: The patient's elevated PTT and INR indicate a prolonged clotting time, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of any bleeding or bruising is necessary.
3. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, which may indicate early kidney dysfunction. Monitoring urine output and adjusting medications accordingly is important.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. Monitoring and managing blood pressure is crucial to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
5. Chest pain: The patient's chest pain needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent any complications related to ischemia or other cardiac issues.

   HTN, dyslipidemia, and strong family history of CAD who presented with
   chest pain and was found to have LMCA disease and is awaiting CABG, who
   had CP episode today and is transfered to CV-ICU for monitoring.
   .
   # CAD: Pt presented with DOE, which can be angina-equivalent and with
   CP, which was very suspicious for CAD. TIMI score: 3, which gives him
   13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or
   severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. Due to
   high suspision he was sent directly to cardiac cath, which showed LMCA
   and LAD lessions. Given these findings and most importantly in a DM
   patient, he certainly can benefir much more from CABG compared to PCI.
   He was awaiting CABG and had episode of CP without ECG changes while
   hypertensive. It resolved in minutes and with nitroglycerin gtt.
   - Continue Aspirin 325 mg Daily
   - Stopped nitro drip yesterday- patient asymptomatic
   - Pt on heparin gtt
   - On tricor (home dose) and pravastatin

   BPM
   - Pt on lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - plan for CABG endoscopic on Monday
   - CXR done yesterday
   - will obtain UA, and TTE prior to procedure
   - monitor on tele
   - Started on Vitamin D 1200 IU per day for decreasing cardiovascular
   risk

   # Pump - No signs of acute heart failure at the time, but patient has
   very low activity suggesting chronic heart failure. Getting
   echocardiogram to assess EF.
   - Pt on pravastatin, lisinopril; not on beta-blocker
   - Re-start BB after surgery
   .
   # DM Type II with large insulin dose. Last A1C above goal. Will give
   insulin according to home dose. Hold metformin because of dye load. [**Month (only) 8**]
   need to increase basal insulin dose.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a strong family history of coronary artery disease. He presented with chest pain and was found to have left main coronary artery disease. The patient had a cardiac catheterization, which revealed lesions in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. Due to his high risk for adverse cardiac events, he is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. 

The patient experienced a chest pain episode today but showed no ECG changes while hypertensive. The chest pain resolved with nitroglycerin. 

Medications:
- Aspirin 325 mg daily
- Heparin sodium gtt (continuous infusion)
- Tricor (home dose) and pravastatin
- Lisinopril 10 mg daily
- Holding beta-blocker for now, but will start as needed for target heart rate of 50-70 bpm
- Plan for CABG endoscopic on Monday
- CXR done yesterday
- Will obtain UA and TTE prior to procedure
- Monitor on tele
- Started on Vitamin D 1200 IU per day for decreasing cardiovascular risk

Assessment and Plan:
1. Chest pain: The patient had an episode of chest pain without ECG changes while hypertensive, which resolved in minutes with nitroglycerin. Continue Aspirin 325 mg daily, heparin gtt, Tricor, and pravastatin. Hold nitro drip since the patient is asymptomatic.
2. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a high TIMI score of 3, indicating a 13% risk at 14 days of all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. Given his symptoms and angiographic findings, he will benefit more from CABG rather than percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
3. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient is on a large insulin dose, and his last A1C was above goal. Give insulin according to home dose. Hold metformin due to dye load. Increase basal insulin dose in August.
4. Hypertension: Given bradycardia, will not add beta-blocker. Continue home lisinopril.
5. Dyslipidemia: Continue Tricor, niacin. Will change to atorvastatin in setting of ACS as above. Normal LFTs.

   Assessment and Plan
 CHEST PAIN
   Mr. [**Known firstname 275**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4964**] [**Known lastname 8175**] is a 60 year-old gentleman with DM2, HTN,
   dyslipidemia, and strong family history of CAD who presented with chest
   pain and was found to have LMCA disease, awaiting CABG today, who had
   CP episode and is transferred to CV-ICU for monitoring.
   .
   # CAD: Pt presented with DOE, which can be angina-equivalent and with
   CP, which was very suspicious for CAD. TIMI score: 3, which gives him
   13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or
   severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. Due to
   high suspicion he was sent directly to cardiac cath, which showed LMCA
   and LAD lesions. Given these findings and most importantly in a DM
   patient, he certainly can benefit much more from CABG compared to PCI.
   He was awaiting CABG and had episode of CP without ECG changes while
   hypertensive. It resolved in minutes and with nitroglycerin gtt.
   - Continue Aspirin 325 mg Daily
   - Has been off nitro drip - patient asymptomatic
   - Pt on heparin gtt
   - On tricor (home dose) and pravastatin
   - no plavix as patient is awaiting CABG
   - Holding BB for now, but will start as needed for target HR of 50-70
   BPM
   - Pt on lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - plan for CABG endoscopic on Monday
   - preop cxr and UA wnl
   - TTE prior to procedure showed mild symmetric LVH with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic
   regurgitation. Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.
   - monitor on tele
   - Started on Vitamin D 1200 IU per day for decreasing cardiovascular
   risk
   .
   # Pump - No signs of acute heart failure at the time, but patient has
   very low activity suggesting chronic heart failure. Echo findings as
   above (preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function).
   - Pt on pravastatin, lisinopril; not on beta-blocker
   - Re-start BB after surgery
   .
   # DM Type II with large insulin dose. Last A1C above goal. Will give
   insulin according to home dose. Hold metformin because of dye load. [**Month (only) 8**]
   need to increase basal insulin dose.
   - ISS
   .
   # HTN: Given bradycardia, will not add Beta-blocker. Will continue home
   lisinopril.
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Continue Tricor, niacin. Will change to atorvastatin in
   setting of ACS as above.  Normal LFTs.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose.
   - check TSH given diaphoresis/ heat intolerance.
   .
   # Neck/back pain: Percocet prn.
   .
   # Depression: Continue sertraline.
   .
   # Insomnia: Ambien prn
   .
   # Anxiety: Lorazepam prn
   .
   #. Degenerative disc disease in cervical spine - Pt on percocet for
   pain control. Anesthesia should be aware, given possible cervical
   abnromalities at time of intubation.
   .
   # FEN: NPO for possible IABPC in case CP, CHF or instability. Will
   monitor electrolytes, Cr.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV's
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: Low risk for GIB (no prophylaxis needed), Colace/Senna.
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with a history of DM2, HTN, dyslipidemia, and strong family history of CAD. He presented with chest pain and was found to have LMCA disease, awaiting CABG. The patient had an episode of CP without ECG changes while hypertensive, which resolved with nitroglycerin. He is currently on various medications including aspirin, tricor, pravastatin, heparin, lisinopril, and vitamin D.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): Given the patient's history of CAD and recent episode of CP, there is a potential risk of ACS. Close monitoring of symptoms and ECG changes is essential.
2. Complications related to CABG surgery: The patient is planned for CABG surgery. Post-operative complications such as bleeding, infection, arrhythmias, and respiratory issues need to be closely monitored.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, indicating mild LVH. Monitoring for signs of heart failure and adjusting medications accordingly is important.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has DM2 and requires close glycemic control. Insulin management should be tailored according to home dose and A1C levels.
5. Hypertension: The patient has HTN, and blood pressure should be monitored regularly. Adjustments in antihypertensive medication may be"
