   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   78 yo women with h/o MVR on coumadin, history of multiple falls.
   Presents with fall, head CT with left temporal SDH.  INR was 8.0,
   Given FFP and IV vitamin K.  Came to our ED.  vitals notable for fever
   of 101.  CT here of abd pelvis also showed left buttock hematoma.   Was
   transiently HOTNsive in ED.  Got 500cc NS bolus with improved.  Hct was
   23 in ED, guaiac positive, NGL was negative.  Got 2U FFP for INR of
   2.8, got IV protonix, 2U PRBC.  Also required 3L of oxygen.    Had
   sinus brady with nausea and vomitting.  Dig level was 3.0.

   superficial
   left middle cranial fossa, now measures 9 mm in maximal thickness.
   RIGHT ELBOW RADIOGRAPH, THREE VIEWS: The is exam is WNL. There is no
   acute
   fracture or dislocation. The visualized osseous structures are in good
   anatomic alignment. No elbow joint effusion is noted. The underlying
   soft
   tissues are unremarkable.
   Assessment and Plan
   78yo F w/hx of atrial fibrillation, mechanical MVR who presents with
   multiple falls and found to have a SDH, hematocrit drop, hypotension in
   the setting of an INR of 8.0.
   .
   1. Anemia: Likely due to bleeding given her supratherapeutic INR and
   history of falls.  Buttock hematoma as well as GI bleed are all sources
   of bleeding in this patient.  SDH unlikely to be contributing.  In
   terms of GI bleed appears to be lower given her negative NG lavage.
   She does have a history of PUD per report and may have a duodenal ulcer
   accounting for negative NG lavage.  Bleeding is likely to stop after
   coagulopathy is reversed.
   - INR reversed with FFP (4 units thus far), vitamin K (10mg IV given)
   - transfuse to keep HCT> 25 in the setting of cardiac disease
   - 1 PRBC this AM  -
 check post-transfusion HCT
   - f/u GI recommendations regarding plans for scope
   - NPO
   - continue protonix IV BID
   - active T&S, 2 peripheral IVs
   - F/U Head CT
   .
   2. Mechanical Mitral Valve: She is at increased risk of clot given
   location of valve and also hx of afib.
   - will coordinate with neurosurgery anticoagulation in setting of
   subdural hematoma
   - Consider heparin gtt with goal PTT 40-50
   .
   3. Subdural Hematoma: per neurosurgery, not a surgical candidate and
   the bleed is small.  Mental status is not completely clear but she has
   an unclear baseline and states she hasn't felt right since her son
   died.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] 1000mg IV x 1, then 750mg IV BID for seizure prophylaxis
   - repeat head CT this AM
   - q2 hour neuro checks
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   .
   4. Multiple Falls: unclear why she is falling now.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to
   SDH vs. peripheral neuropathy vs. chronic foot problems.
   - check B12 level, TSH
   - RPR
   - consider NPH although no incontinence per patient
   - consider neurology evaluation as an outpatient for neuropathy/gait
   disturbance
   - PT consult when medically stable
   .
   5. Atrial Fibrillation: rate-controlled
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of acute bleed
   - restart digoxin on home dose
   - hold anticoagulation currently
   .
   6. Fevers: Previously attributed to FFP administration.  CXR does not
   show PNA.  [**Month (only) 51**] be due to blood resorption from hematoma. UA negative
   for infection.
   - check blood cultures after 24 hours from last set
   - F/u all micro
   .
   7. Hypoxia: Currently requring 3L NC. Possibly due to volume overload
   in the setting of blood products and normal saline.  Unknown EF but she
   is on lasix PO at home.
   - Lasix 10mg IV x 1
   - echo in am

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and mechanical mitral valve replacement. She presented with multiple falls and was found to have a subdural hematoma (SDH), anemia, hypotension, and a supratherapeutic INR of 8.0. The patient also has a buttock hematoma, negative NG lavage, and a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The patient's mental status is altered, and she has been agitated. The patient's vital signs include a fever of 101.5°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 122/23 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count, prolonged PT/INR, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's physical examination revealed bibasilar fine crackles on lung auscultation, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and a 6-7 cm firm hematoma with surrounding ecchymosis in the left buttock. The patient's head CT showed no significant short-interval change in the acute-on-chronic subdural hematoma layering over much of the left cerebral convexity. The right elbow radiograph was unremarkable, showing no acute fracture or dislocation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which may be due to bleeding, potentially from the buttock hematoma, gastrointestinal bleed, or other sources. The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, indicating a coagulopathy that needs to be reversed. Once reversed, the bleeding should stop.
2. Mechanical Mitral Valve: The patient is at an increased risk of clot formation due to the location of her valve and history of atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation management is required, considering the subdural hematoma.
3. Subdural Hematoma: The patient has a small subdural hematoma that is not a surgical candidate. Mental status changes are present, and seizure prophylaxis is being administered.
4. Multiple Falls: The cause of the patient's falls is unclear and needs further investigation. Possible causes include the subdural hematoma, peripheral neuropathy, or chronic foot problems.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs rate control, but anticoagulation should be held due to the acute bleed.
6. Fevers: The patient has a fever, which was initially attributed to fresh frozen plasma (FFP) administration. The cause of the fever is still under investigation.
7. Hypoxia: The patient is requiring supplemental oxygen, possibly due to volume overload from blood products and normal saline."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and fever. They have a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate. They have been experiencing episodes of diarrhea and agitation. The patient's blood cultures were drawn, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) was performed. Due to the patient's altered mental status, multiple attempts were made to access their veins for medication administration, resulting in compromised access. The patient also has an increased respiratory rate and requires supplemental oxygen. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels. They are receiving various medications including heparin, morphine, and acetaminophen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and altered mental status suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Bleeding: The patient's low hemoglobin levels and recent attempts at accessing their veins for medication administration may indicate potential bleeding complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's increased respiratory rate and requirement for supplemental oxygen could be indicative of respiratory failure or exacerbation of underlying lung conditions.
4. Diarrhea: The multiple episodes of guaiac-negative diarrhea may suggest an infectious or inflammatory cause, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances."

   superficial
   left middle cranial fossa, now measures 9 mm in maximal thickness.

   acute
   fracture or dislocation. The visualized osseous structures are in good
   anatomic alignment. No elbow joint effusion is noted. The underlying
   soft
   tissues are unremarkable.
   Assessment and Plan
   78yo F w/hx of atrial fibrillation, mechanical AVR who presents with
   multiple falls and found to have a SDH, hematocrit drop, hypotension in
   the setting of an INR of 8.0.
   .
   1. Anemia: Likely due to bleeding given her supratherapeutic INR and
   history of falls.  Buttock hematoma as well as GI bleed are all sources
   of bleeding in this patient.  SDH unlikely to be contributing.  In
   terms of GI bleed appears to be lower given her negative NG lavage.
   She does have a history of PUD per report and may have a duodenal ulcer
   accounting for negative NG lavage.  Bleeding is likely to stop after
   coagulopathy is reversed.
   - INR reversed with FFP (4 units thus far), vitamin K (10mg IV given)
   - transfuse to keep HCT> 25 in the setting of cardiac disease
   - 1 PRBC this AM  -
 check post-transfusion HCT
   - f/u GI recommendations regarding plans for scope
   - NPO
   - continue protonix IV BID
   - active T&S, 2 peripheral IVs
   .
   2. Mechanical Mitral Valve: She is at increased risk of clot given
   location of valve and also hx of afib.
   - will coordinate with neurosurgery anticoagulation in setting of
   subdural hematoma
   .
   3. Subdural Hematoma: per neurosurgery, not a surgical candidate and
   the bleed is small.  Mental status is not completely clear but she has
   an unclear baseline and states she hasn't felt right since her son
   died.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] 1000mg IV x 1, then 750mg IV BID for seizure prophylaxis
   - repeat head CT this AM
   - q2 hour neuro checks
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   .
   4. Multiple Falls: unclear why she is falling now.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to
   SDH vs. peripheral neuropathy vs. chronic foot problems.
   - check B12 level, TSH
   - RPR
   - consider NPH although no incontinence per patient
   - consider neurology evaluation as an outpatient for neuropathy/gait
   disturbance
   - PT consult when medically stable
   .
   5. Atrial Fibrillation: rate-controlled
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of acute bleed
   - restart digoxin on home dose
   - hold anticoagulation currently
   .
   6. Fevers: Previously attributed to FFP administration.  CXR does not
   show PNA.  [**Month (only) 51**] be due to blood resorption from hematoma. UA negative
   for infection.
   - check blood cultures
   .
   7. Hypoxia: Currently requring 3L NC. Possibly due to volume overload
   in the setting of blood products and normal saline.  Unknown EF but she
   is on lasix PO at home.
   - Lasix 10mg IV x 1
   - echo in am

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation and mechanical aortic valve replacement.
- She presents with multiple falls, a subdural hematoma (SDH), hematocrit drop, hypotension, and an elevated INR of 8.0.
- The patient has a buttock hematoma, negative NG lavage, and multiple episodes of guaiac-negative diarrhea.
- She is agitated and has been given Zyprexa.
- Vital signs include fever, elevated JVP, bibasilar fine crackles, and an irregularly irregular heartbeat.
- Labs show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal coagulation profile.
- Imaging shows a relatively thin acute-on-chronic SDH without significant short-interval change.
- The right elbow radiograph is normal.
- The patient's mental status is altered, and she has been on NPO status with plans for GI evaluation and scope.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia due to bleeding, possibly from falls, buttock hematoma, or gastrointestinal bleed. Coagulopathy is being reversed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K. The patient's hematocrit will be monitored, and she will be transfused to maintain a hematocrit level above 25, especially considering her cardiac disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 79-year-old woman with a subdural hematoma (SDH) after falling. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently stable with no further episodes of asystole. Her fever has been managed, and her vital signs are relatively stable, although she is experiencing atrial fibrillation. The patient has been receiving various medications, including morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever. Her physical examination reveals trace edema in both lower extremities and normal neurologic status. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, along with slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values, including electrolytes and liver function tests, are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Subdural hematoma: The patient's SDH appears stable, and she will start a heparin drip without bolus. The goal is to achieve a PTT of 40-50 after checking with the nursing staff.
2. Anemia: There are no signs of melena, and the anemia is likely due to a buttock hematoma. The patient may require a blood transfusion.
3. MVR (Mechanical Ventricular Support): The patient is at high risk of stroke while off anticoagulation and should advance her diet.
