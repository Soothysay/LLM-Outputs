   Assessment and Plan
   54 F with obesity, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**], anxiety, tracheomalacia s/p
   tracheal stenting 10 days ago; admit with generalized weakness and
   worsening dyspnea.
  Dyspnea.  Differential includes muscle weakness (from myasthenia or
   other cause), structural abnormalities/TBM, anxiety, PE (ruled out),
   CAD/ischemia (no ecg changes, not c/w history).  No fever,
   leukocytosis, clear infiltrate to suggest pneumonia as cause.  Mild
   hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis (?acute on chronic, vs. worsening
   bicarb from metabolic source).  Patient retains CO2 at baseline.
   Atelectasis on chest CT.  Tracheal stent patent per CT evaluation.
   Aline placed overnight for continued oxygenation/ventilation
   difficulties.
   -          Try patient off biPAP this AM, ABG prn
   -          Consult IP today
   -          Anxiety control
   -          Management/workup of increased ostomy output as a cause of
   decreased bicarb relative to likely baseline.  Urine lytes to check
   urinary gap.
   -          Continue to monitor for muscular weakness with NIFs and VCs
 NIFs consistently -80; VC of only ?300ml?
   -          Nebs prn (trying to minimize, use xopenex with tachycardia)
   -          Pneumonia coverage if more evidence of infection (patient
   also immunosuppressed host).
   # Generalized weakness.  In patient with known MG.  Notes neck muscle
   weakness and breathing issues as above.  No notable ocular or
   pharyngeal symptoms.
   -          appreciate neuro following; per fellow should be called out
   to neuro once able to leave unit.
   -          ?IVIG today (2g/kg divided over 5 days)
   -          Continue prednisone, mestinon, cellcept.  Bactrim ppx.
   -          No clear dysphagia, but reports some difficulty with pills;
   can hold fosamax for now, consider s&s if concerns of aspiration.
   -          Avoid BB, CCB, quinolones due to potential exacerbation of
   MG.
   #   ANXIETY. Severe impairments from anxiety.  In process of getting
   set up with therapist as outpatient.  On SSRI and benzos (though does
   not have any at home
 not currently taking any)
 very minimal BZ
   requirement and has had side effects from lorazepam in past.
   -          Alprazolam prn
   -          Continue SSRI
   -          SW consult for support/coping
   -          psych consult for anxiety management
   # Tachycardia.  Sinus, unchanged ECG.  Reports this is her baseline;
   past notes document anywhere from 80-130.  Improved into 80s once on
   bipap and less anxious.  ?anxiety related.  No suspicion for
   withdrawal, appears euvolemic, PE ruled out.  Up to 140s with minimal
   exertion, but maintaining 80s at rest.
   -                continue to monitor rates
   -
 Urinary incontinence.  Chronic problem with recent worsening.
   Unclear if this could be related to underlying neuromuscular disease.
   -          f/u U/A and culture
   -          MRI Cspine at some point to rule out trauma from procedures
   per neuro recs.
   #  Diarrhea/fecal incontinence. Also with subacute/chronic fecal
   incontinence.  Diarrhea attributed to mestinon in past.
   -          check c.diff, though low suspicion with lack of
   fever/leukocytosis or infectious picture, but possible that she was
   exposed to antibiotics during recent admits.
   -          chronic diarrhea workup
   -          consider L spine MRI, though incontinence chronic; seems
   less likely.
   # DM.  Also on steroids.
   -          continue ISS and DM diet.
   # GERD. Continue PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with obesity, myasthenia gravis (MG), anxiety, tracheomalacia status post tracheal stenting 10 days ago. She was admitted with generalized weakness and worsening dyspnea. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from her current condition and medical history. These potential complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to her worsening dyspnea, hypoxemia, and respiratory acidosis. She requires non-invasive ventilation and has been placed on CPAP and bipap with low flow rates. There is also evidence of atelectasis on chest CT. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of respiratory support may be necessary.

2. Pneumonia: Although no clear infiltrate is seen on the chest X-ray, the patient is immunosuppressed due to MG treatment and has an increased risk of infections. Pneumonia coverage should be considered if there is evidence of infection.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to prolonged immobilization and risk factors such as obesity, the patient is at increased risk for DVT. Prophylactic SQ UF Heparin has been started.

4. Stress ulcers: The patient is on PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis due to her critical illness and potential risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes mellitus and is on insulin sliding"

She was admitted with generalized weakness and worsening dyspnea. The differential diagnosis for her dyspnea includes muscle weakness (from MG or other causes), structural abnormalities/TBM, anxiety, PE (ruled out), CAD/ischemia (no ECG changes, not c/w history).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of obesity, myasthenia gravis (MG), anxiety, tracheomalacia status post tracheal stenting 10 days ago. She was admitted with generalized weakness and worsening dyspnea.

The patient's current condition includes dyspnea, muscle weakness, structural abnormalities/tracheobronchomalacia (TBM), anxiety, pulmonary embolism (ruled out), and coronary artery disease/ischemia (no ECG changes, not consistent with history). There is also mild hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis (acute on chronic vs. worsening bicarb), and the patient retains CO2 at baseline. Atelectasis was noted on chest CT, but the tracheal stent is patent. An arterial line was placed overnight for continued oxygenation/ventilation difficulties.

The plan includes rechecking ABG overnight, contacting the intensive care unit (ICU) physician, controlling anxiety, monitoring for muscular weakness with noninvasive ventilation (NIFs) and ventilator challenges, administering nebulizers as needed (trying to minimize, using xopenex with tachycardia), and considering pneumonia coverage if more evidence of infection (the patient is also an immunosuppressed host).

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with obesity, myasthenia gravis, anxiety, and tracheomalacia who was admitted with generalized weakness and worsening dyspnea. The patient's dyspnea is attributed to muscle weakness, structural abnormalities, anxiety, pulmonary embolism, and cardiac ischemia. The patient has mild hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis. An atelectasis was noted on the chest CT, but the tracheal stent is patent. 

The patient's current medications include prednisone, mestinon, cellcept, and bactrim for prophylaxis. 

The assessment plan includes rechecking the ABG overnight, contacting the IP today, controlling anxiety, monitoring for muscular weakness, providing nebs as needed, and considering pneumonia coverage if there is evidence of infection. 

The patient's medical history also includes generalized weakness, anxiety, tachycardia, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, diabetes mellitus, and GERD. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, has arterial and venous access, and is on prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient has a full code status and is currently in the ICU."

   acidosis (on top of baseline alkalosis) likely from diarrhea losses
   (negative urinary gap).  Patient retains CO2 at baseline, most notable
   at nighttime and supposed to be on nighttime bipap.
   -          IP to bronch today
   -          Anxiety control
   -          Workup of diarrhea as below.
   -          Continue to monitor for muscular weakness with NIFs and VCs
 NIFs consistently -80; though VC low (500ish today), likely
   reflective of effort.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with obesity, myasthenia gravis (MG), anxiety, tracheomalacia, and a tracheal stent placed 10 days ago. She was admitted with generalized weakness and worsening dyspnea. Her differential diagnosis includes muscle weakness, structural abnormalities/TBM, anxiety, and metabolic acidosis. The patient retains CO2 at baseline and is supposed to be on nighttime BiPAP.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Generalized weakness/myasthenia: The patient has known MG with neck muscle weakness and breathing issues. IVIG has been ordered for this admission, and she will continue on prednisone, mestinon, and cellcept. Bactrim prophylaxis has also been prescribed. She should avoid beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and quinolones due to potential exacerbation of MG.
2. Anxiety: The patient has severe impairments from anxiety. She is already on an SSRI and benzos (although not taking BZs). Clonazepam at a low dose will be tried, and she will continue on the SSRI. A social worker and psychiatric consultation have been arranged for support and coping strategies, as well as anxiety management recommendations.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is in the 140s with minimal exertion but maintains the 80s at rest. This is likely related to anxiety. No suspicion for withdrawal or other"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with obesity, myasthenia gravis, anxiety, tracheomalacia status post tracheal stenting 10 days ago. She was admitted with generalized weakness and worsening dyspnea. The differential diagnosis includes muscle weakness, structural abnormalities, anxiety, and metabolic acidosis. The patient retains CO2 at baseline and has an increased ostomy output. She also has a history of generalized weakness, neck muscle weakness, and breathing issues. No notable ocular or pharyngeal symptoms were reported. The patient is currently on prednisone, mestinon, cellcept, and bactrim prophylaxis. She is also being treated for anxiety with an SSRI and alprazolam as needed. The patient's tachycardia is suspected to be related to anxiety. She has chronic urinary incontinence and subacute/chronic fecal incontinence. The patient also has diabetes mellitus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and diarrhea/fecal incontinence attributed to mestinon in the past. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is currently on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. She is receiving prophylactic UF heparin for DVT and PPI for stress ulcer. The patient's code status is full code, and she is likely to be transferred to the floor on the neurology service."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of obesity, myasthenia gravis (MG), anxiety, tracheomalacia, and tracheal stenting. She was admitted with generalized weakness and worsening dyspnea. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate ranging from 71-127 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/68-182/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula with BIPAP support. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and mildly elevated creatinine levels. The microbiology report shows Gram-positive rods and cocci in pairs, indicating a possible bacterial infection. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Generalized weakness and dyspnea: The differential diagnosis includes muscle weakness (from myasthenia or other cause), structural abnormalities/TBM, anxiety, metabolic acidosis (on top of baseline alkalosis) likely from diarrhea losses (negative urinary gap).

The patient has been withdrawing from high doses of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, and is febrile with a temperature of 100.2 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient has been intermittently using bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) but is maintaining adequate oxygen saturation on a nasal cannula. Allergies include adhesive tape and lorazepam. The patient has received Lasix 20 mg twice with good effect. Antibiotics have been started due to a suspected infection. The patient is on multiple medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure of 139/74 millimeters mercury, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1120 milliliters and output of 1250 milliliters with a negative balance of 130 milliliters. Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, tidal volume of 437 milliliters, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)"

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old female with obesity, myasthenia gravis, anxiety, and tracheomalacia who was admitted with generalized weakness and worsening dyspnea.
- The differential diagnosis for dyspnea includes muscle weakness, structural abnormalities, anxiety, and metabolic acidosis.
- The patient has a history of myasthenia gravis and is currently on treatment with prednisone, mestinon, cellcept, and Bactrim prophylaxis.
- The patient also has anxiety and is being treated with SSRI and benzodiazepines (although not taking BZs).
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 139/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.
- The patient's physical examination reveals slight anxiety, clear lungs, slightly tachycardic heart, and peripheral strength intact with slight left upper extremity (and left lower extremity to a lesser degree) cooler to touch compared to the right side.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated potassium, and normal glucose levels.
- The patient's sputum culture showed >25 PMNs, <10 epithelial cells/100X field, 3+ gram-positive rods, and 1+ gram-positive cocci"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of MG s/p stenting for TBM admitted with
   progressive DOE which does not appear to be related to her TBM or her
   MG.
   Respiratory failure:  at baseline she appears to have progressive
   respiratory acidosis which is reasonably well compensated. There is no
   component of worsening MG, her TBM is stable on bronchoscopy today. She
   may again have some increased work of breathing from her decreased HCO3
   (diarrhea) and increased dead space ventilation from anxiety. At her
   baseline she has some sleep disordered breathing and does not wear her
   BiPAP (again refusing overnight)
   - intermittent BiPap to target a goal pH of >7.35. Goal of O2 sats (she
   needs BiPAP at night for her OHV)
   - no indication for Abx although empiric Abx may be needed if no
   improvement in next 24 hours.
   - MG care as below: serial measurements of bedside FVC
   Acid/base:  she appears to have a mild metabolic acidosis (her baseline
   HCO3 is closer to the mid 40
s). This may be from stool out put (loss
   of HCO3-) which is consistent with her negative urine anion gap.
   - assess previous work up for her diarrhea ? mestinon related.
   - Ongoing lab assessment for etiology of her diarrhea
   MG: neuro service following, do not think this is an MG flare.
   -          cont home dose immunosuppression (cell cept and prednisone)
   and prophylaxis
   -          Will dose IVIG per neurology (regularly scheduled dose)
   Anxiety:  will initiate standing low dose long acting benzodiazepine.
   Other issues per ICU resident note.  She has issues with urinary
   incontinence and ? cyctocele that needs operative repair. Timing of
   repair and route of anesthesia to be decided only when airway issues
   have settled

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) who was admitted with progressive difficulty breathing that does not appear to be related to her MG or thoracic aortic aneurysm (TBM). She has been experiencing respiratory failure at baseline, which seems to be reasonably well-compensated. The patient also has a history of anxiety, sleep disordered breathing, and is not wearing her BiPAP at night, which may contribute to increased work of breathing and decreased HCO3 levels due to diarrhea. Her current vital signs show a mild metabolic acidosis, possibly from stool output loss of HCO3-. She has ongoing lab assessments for the etiology of her diarrhea and is being treated for MG with IVIG and immunosuppression. The patient will be initiated on a standing low-dose long-acting benzodiazepine for anxiety. She has issues with urinary incontinence and a possible cystocele that requires operative repair, but the timing and route of anesthesia will be decided after airway issues have settled. The patient is currently in the ICU and will be transferred to the floor once her condition improves. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient already has respiratory failure at baseline, and if not managed properly, there is a risk of worsening respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia.
2. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may lead to further HCO3-"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She underwent stenting for Transbronchial Mortality (TBM) and is now experiencing progressive dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and increasing respiratory acidosis. Her neurologic examination shows normal tone and purposeful movement, but she has absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Her laboratory results indicate mild anemia and elevated white blood cell count. She has a negative urine anion gap, suggesting metabolic acidosis potentially due to stool output loss of bicarbonate. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 146/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation, FiO2 of 35%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's baseline respiratory acidosis that is reasonably well-compensated may progress further, leading to worsening respiratory failure.
2. Myasthenic crisis: Although the attending physician does not believe this is an MG flare, there is still a possibility of a myasthenic crisis occurring, especially considering the patient's history of MG.
3. Infection: Despite no current"

   54 yo female with hx of MG s/p stenting for TBM now with progressive
   DOE and increasing resp acidosis with near normal NIF values in the ED
   and no clear precipitant of
   her acute decline
   Respiratory failure:  at baseline she appears to have progressive
   respiratory acidosis which is reasonably well compensated. This is
   likely from the progressive effects of the MG. At present her picture
   is not clearly consistent with an acute worsening of her MG (given
   normal NIF) nor does there appear to be an infectious component. It may
   he that she is hyperventilating with shallow tidal volume and
   effectively increasing her dead space ventilation as a function of
   anxiety which also worsens her pre-existing TBM. In addition she has
   some mucus plugging which is also increasing her dead space
   ventilation. Notably the PE portion of her CT scan from [**10-26**] was
   negative.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) who presented to the ICU with progressive dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and increasing respiratory acidosis. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105-126/68-81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. She is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 35% and peak end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), glucose, albumin, and electrolytes. However, her magnesium (Mg++) level is slightly low at 1.9 mg/dL.

The patient's chest X-ray from October 26th was negative for any pulmonary embolism (PE). She also has evidence of crackles in the right base of her lungs, indicating possible mucus plugging.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to progressive effects of MG, compensated respiratory acidosis, and anxiety. She requires pulmonary toilet for secretion clearance, incentive spirometry, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of MG s/p stenting for TBM admitted with
   progressive DOE and hypercarbic respiratory failure since her transfer
   to the floor on [**10-28**] in the setting of ptosis and diplopia, now with
   depressed mental status from hypercarbia
   Respiratory failure:  she has baseline hypercarbia with CO2 in the
   70mmHg range which is normally well compensated by pH. When she was
   initially admitted [**10-27**] we thought a part of her progressive acidosis
   was [**1-24**] non compliance with home BiPAP as well as loss of HCO3 from
   diarrhea. This current presentation is different in the sense that she
   is markedly hypercarbic with accompanynig signs of MG flare. Our plan
   will be to temporize with BiPAP with close observation for further
   decline in mental status necessitating intubation. Our hope is she will
   continue to improve with BiPaP and we can apply treatment to reverse
   the MG component. We will also look for other reversible components
   (infection etc) although recent CXR was not suggestive, will trial
   flumazenil to see if there is any component of sedation effects.
    - intermittent BiPap to target a goal pH of >7.35. Goal of O2 sats
   (she needs BiPAP at night for her OHV). Baseline Co2 is ~ 70 mmHg
   - no indication for Abx although empiric Abx may be needed if no
   improvement in next 24 hours.
   - CXR
   - MG care as below: serial measurements of bedside FVC when able
   - Placement of arterial line for CO2 monitoring
   - Flumazenil trial.
   MG: Concern with evolving neurologic exam for MG crisis. Neuro team

   dose steroids
   -          cont home dose immunosuppression (cell cept and prednisone)
   and prophylaxis
   -          Will dose IVIG per neurology (regularly scheduled dose)

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted to the ICU for progressive dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She presented with ptosis, diplopia, and now has depressed mental status due to hypercarbia. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to her underlying MG, which is exacerbated by an infection. 

The plan is to provide temporary support with BiPAP to target a goal pH of >7.35, aiming to reduce her carbon dioxide levels. The goal oxygen saturation should be around 94%. The patient will also receive intermittent BiPAP at night for her obstructive sleep apnea (OHV). 

No antibiotics are currently indicated, but empiric antibiotics may be needed if there is no improvement within the next 24 hours. A chest X-ray will be obtained to rule out any potential infections. 

For MG management, the patient will undergo serial measurements of bedside forced vital capacity (FVC) when able. An arterial line will be placed for continuous monitoring of carbon dioxide levels. Flumazenil will be trialed to assess any component of sedation effects. 

In terms of MG care, the patient will receive a second dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) today and will also be given high-dose steroids. She will continue with her home dose of immunosuppression (cell cept and prednisone"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already has hypercarbic respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration leading to respiratory failure if BiPAP or mechanical ventilation is not effective.
2. Myasthenic Crisis: The patient's evolving neurological exam raises concern for a myasthenic crisis. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to respiratory muscle weakness and respiratory failure.

   was [**1-24**] non compliance with home BiPAP as well as loss of HCO3 from
   diarrhea. It is again unclear from this admission whether her
   decompensation was related to medications(benzo) vs worsening MG.
   Notably her stent is clear an is unlikely to be contributing to her
   acute component. Her refusal to wear her BiPAP as scheduled for
   overnights wth her sleep disordered breathing complicates her acid-base
   status.  Notably this AM, her CO2 is higher then baseline after
   refusing BiPAP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted to the ICU for progressive dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The cause of her respiratory failure is unclear, with possible exacerbation of MG or medication-related complications. The patient has a baseline hypercarbia with CO2 levels in the 70 mmHg range, which is normally well-compensated by pH. She was initially admitted due to noncompliance with home BiPAP and loss of bicarbonate from diarrhea. The patient's stent is clear and unlikely to contribute to her acute component. Her refusal to wear BiPAP at night complicates her acid-base status. This morning, her CO2 levels are higher than baseline after refusing BiPAP. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she continues to refuse BiPAP, leading to further hypercarbia and potential respiratory acidosis.
2. Myasthenic Crisis: The evolving neurologic exam raises concerns for a myasthenic crisis. If left untreated, this can result in respiratory muscle weakness and respiratory failure.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is on ciprofloxacin for a UTI. If not appropriately managed, this could lead to worsening infection and potential complications such as sepsis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

2. MG crisis, indicated by evolving neurologic exam and concern with neurologic involvement.
3. UTI, for which the patient is currently receiving Ciprofloxacin.
4. Anxiety, for which benzodiazepines are being held.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory status, MG symptoms, and potential complications such as UTI"

   54 yo female with hx of MG s/p stenting for TBM admitted with
   progressive DOE and hypercarbic respiratory failure since her transfer
   to the floor on [**10-28**] in the setting of ptosis and diplopia, now with
   depressed mental status from hypercarbia
    Respiratory failure:  she has baseline hypercarbia with CO2 in the
   70mmHg range which is normally well compensated by pH. When she was
   initially admitted [**10-27**] we thought a part of her progressive aidosis
   was [**1-24**] non compliance with home BiPAP as well as loss of HCO3 from
   diarrhea. It is again unclear from this admission whether her
   decompensation was related to medications(benzo) vs worsening MG.
   Notably her stent is clear an is unlikely to be contributing to her
   acute component. Her refusal to wear her BiPAP as scheduled for
   overnights wth her sleep disordered breathing complicates her acid-base
   status.  Notably this AM, her CO2 is higher then baseline after
   refusing BiPAP.
   - intermittent BiPap to target a goal pH of >7.35. Goal of O2 sats (she
   needs BiPAP at night for her OHV). Baseline CO2 is ~ 70 mmHg
   - recheck ABG
   - MG care as below: serial measurements of bedside FVC when able
   - Cont to follow FVC

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) who was admitted to the ICU due to progressive dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been experiencing worsening symptoms, including ptosis and diplopia, and her mental status has deteriorated from hypercarbia. The patient's respiratory failure is characterized by baseline hypercarbia with CO2 levels in the 70 mmHg range, which is normally well-compensated by pH. Her decompensation may be related to non-compliance with home BiPAP, loss of HCO3 from diarrhea, or worsening MG. The patient's stent is clear and unlikely to contribute to her acute component. She refuses to wear her BiPAP as scheduled, leading to fluctuations in her acid-base status. The plan includes intermittent BiPAP to target a goal pH of >7.35, rechecking ABG, MG care with serial measurements of bedside FVC, continuing home dose immunosuppression, and administering IVIG per neurology. The patient is also being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and anxiety. She is receiving regular diet and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. She has arterial and venous lines inserted for monitoring and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code,"

   is markedly hypercarbic with accompanynig signs of MG flare. Our plan
   will be to temporize with BiPAP with close observation for further
   decline in mental status necessitating intubation. Our hope is she will
   continue to improve with BiPaP and we can apply treatment to reverse
   the MG component. We will also look for other reversible components
   (infection etc) although recent CXR was not suggestive, will trial
   flumazenil to see if there is any component of sedation effects.
     - intermittent BiPap to target a goal pH of >7.35. Goal of O2 sats

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted with progressive dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She presented with ptosis and diplopia, and her mental status has now deteriorated due to hypercarbia. The respiratory failure is attributed to her underlying hypercarbic condition, exacerbated by non-compliance with home BiPAP and loss of bicarbonate from diarrhea. 

The plan is to temporize with BiPAP and observe for further decline in mental status, which may necessitate intubation. The hope is that she will continue to improve with BiPAP and that treatment can be applied to reverse the MG component. Other reversible components (such as infection) will also be looked for, although a recent chest X-ray was not suggestive. Flumazenil will be trialed to assess if there is any component of sedation effects.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/69 mmHg to 144/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.8-16.9 K/uL, hematocrit of 38.6-36.5%, platelet count of 387-289 K/uL, blood glucose of 154-183 mg/dL, and serum creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.24/7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 86 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3) level of 34.4 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 97%.

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including pantoprazole, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications. She is also on a regimen of immunosuppression for MG management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, exacerbation of MG crisis, infection, and complications related to the use of BiPAP or intubation. Close monitoring and prompt intervention will be necessary to manage these potential complications and ensure the patient's well-being."

   54 F with obesity, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**], anxiety, tracheomalacia s/p
   tracheal stenting 10 days PTA; initially admitted to MICU  with
   generalized weakness; now transfer back to MICU with dyspnea,
   significantly worsened weakness and severe hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, possible myasthenic crisis.
  Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Differential of  muscle weakness
   (from myasthenia or other cause) vs medication effect (very small doses
   of clonazepam, but is significantly affected low doses in past.
   Received flumazenil and seemed to improve (vs. improvement from control
   of pCO2 with bipap).  Patient retains CO2 at baseline, most notable at
   nighttime and supposed to be on nighttime bipap.  Intermittent apnea
   while on bipap supports oversedation as cause; however did
tire
 after
   off bipap yesterday evening.
   -          bipap overnight; NC/FM during daytime.
   -          No benzos or sedatives; utilize other forms of anxiety
   management.
   -          Continue to monitor for muscular weakness with NIFs and VCs
 NIFs consistently -80; though VC have been low (500ish today), likely
   reflective of effort (has been able to count [**1-21**] with very poor VCs).
   -          Treatment of myasthenia below.
   -           check ABG now.
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**], ?crisis.  Initially noted neck muscle weakness and
   breathing without ocular or pharyngeal symptoms.  Today with
   significant ptosis on exam and c/o diplopia earlier today, though hard
   to say if this is due to myasthenia or CO2 narcosis.
   -          appreciate neuro following.
   -          IVIG again today (3^rd dose); unclear if plasmapheresis
   offers additional benefit.
   -          Per neuro, additional steroids unlikely to be of benefit
   unless needed for non-myasthenia standpoint. Change back to baseline
   prednisone dosing.
   -          Continue mestinon, cellcept.  Bactrim ppx.
   -          Avoid BB, CCB, quinolones due to potential exacerbation of
   MG.
   # Hypotension.  SBP dropped transiently to 70s following MICU
   admission.  Unclear etiology, one liter IV NS given.  Once Aline placed
   (and since) BPs in 110s - ?true hypotension.  If true, ddx includes med
   effect, sepsis, positive pressure, losses with history of diarrhea.
   Completely resolved overnight.
   #   ANXIETY. Severe impairments from anxiety.  In process of getting
   set up with therapist as outpatient.  On SSRI; issues with benzos as
   above.  Psych consult earlier this admit.
   -          no further benzos.
   -          Continue SSRI
   # UTI: urine culture growing Klebsiella.  Course of cipro.
   # Tachycardia.  Sinus.  Reports this is her baseline; past notes
   document anywhere from 80-130.  Improved into 80s when less anxious and
   resting.  No suspicion for withdrawal, appears euvolemic, PE ruled
   out.  Up to 140s with minimal exertion, but maintaining 80s at rest.
   -                continue to monitor rates
 Urinary incontinence.  Chronic problem with recent worsening.
   Unclear if this could be related to underlying neuromuscular disease.
   -          f/u urine culture
   -          past neuro recs: MRI Cspine at some point to rule out trauma
   from procedures..
   # TBM.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4834**].
   -         Bronched earlier this admission with intact stent.  Unclear
   on plans for stent given lack of symptomatic improvement; ? possible
   removal in future.  IP following.
   # DM.  Also on steroids.
   -          continue ISS and DM diet.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with obesity, myasthenia gravis, anxiety, tracheomalacia status post tracheal stenting, and generalized weakness. She was initially admitted to the MICU with generalized weakness and is now transferred back with dyspnea, significantly worsened weakness, and severe hypercarbic respiratory failure. Possible myasthenic crisis is suspected. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Myasthenic crisis: This is a severe exacerbation of myasthenia gravis symptoms, characterized by muscle weakness and respiratory failure. It is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical intervention.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates difficulty in exhaling carbon dioxide, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and potential organ damage.
3. Infection: The presence of a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI) suggests a risk for developing further infections while in the ICU.
4. Hypotension: The transient drop in blood pressure to the 70s may indicate underlying issues such as medication side effects, sepsis, positive pressure from mechanical ventilation, or fluid losses.
5. Anxiety: Severe impairments from anxiety are reported, which may complicate the patient's overall condition and recovery process.
6. Urinary incontinence: The chronic problem of urinary incontinence with recent worsening needs further evaluation and management.
7. Tracheobronchial malfunction"

","The patient's chief complaint is hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was placed on non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) and an arterial line was started. The patient had intermittent episodes of apnea while on NIPPV and was occasionally taken off NIPPV to eat, but then returned to it due to fatigue. No further flumazenil was administered. The patient has allergies to adhesive tape (topical) and Ativan (oral). 

The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Bactrim (SMX/TMP) on 10/28/2139 at 08:00 AM. The patient is currently receiving infusions of pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. Other medications given include changes to medical and family history.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for progressive dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The cause of her respiratory failure is unclear, with possible exacerbation of MG or medication-related. She has baseline hypercarbia with CO2 levels in the 70mmHg range, which is normally well-compensated by pH. The patient's refusal to wear BiPAP at night for sleep disordered breathing complicates her acid-base status and predisposes her to elevated CO2 levels.

The patient's current assessment includes respiratory failure, potential MG exacerbation, intermittent use of BiPAP targeting a goal pH of >7.35, volume goal of 500 cc out, marked tachycardia related to autonomic dysfunction, MG crisis being monitored by the neurology team, prophylaxis for UTI with Ciprofloxacin, and anxiety management by holding further benzodiazepines.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may progress if she does not adhere to the recommended use of BiPAP and continues to have elevated CO2 levels.
2. Myasthenia gravis exacerbation: The patient's respiratory symptoms could be due to an exacerbation of MG, which can lead to muscle weakness and respiratory compromise if not managed appropriately.

- PaCO2: 77 mmHg
- PaO2: 135 mmHg
- HCO3: 45 mEq/L
- Base excess: -13 mEq/L
- Oxygen saturation: 94%

The patient has received three doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for MG crisis, and will continue with home dose immunosuppression (cell cept and prednisone). She is also on ciprofloxacin for urinary tract infection (UTI) and her anxiety medication has been held.

The patient's laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 11.3 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 386 K/uL
- Platelet count: 387 K/uL
- Sodium: 136 mg/dL
- Potassium: 0.7 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
- Glucose: 154 mg/dL
- Other lab values are within normal range

The patient's plan includes intermittent BiPAP to target a goal pH of >7.35, rechecking ABG, following MG care with serial measurements of bedside forced vital capacity (FVC) when able, continuing to follow FVC, and monitoring for any complications related to MG crisis, UTI, and anxiety.

Potential medical complications that can arise include exacerbation of MG, medication-related respiratory failure, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and urinary tract infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of MG s/p stenting for TBM admitted with
   progressive DOE and hypercarbic respiratory failure , and its unclear
   whether this is a exacerbation of the MG or med related. At least in
   part her hypercarbia is [**1-24**] her refusal to wear BiPAP at night for her
   sleep disordered breathing which perhaps makes her more sensitive to
   medications.
   >Respiratory failure:  she has baseline hypercarbia with CO2 in the
   70mmHg range which is normally well compensated by pH. When she was
   initially admitted [**10-27**] we thought a part of her progressive acidosis
   was [**1-24**] non compliance with home BiPAP as well as loss of HCO3 from
   diarrhea. It is again unclear from this admission whether her
   decompensation was related to medications(benzo) vs worsening MG.
   Notably her stent is clear an is unlikely to be contributing to her
   acute component. Her refusal to wear her BiPAP as scheduled for
   overnights with her sleep disordered breathing complicates her
   acid-base status and pre-disposes her to elevated CO2 levels.
   - intermittent BiPap to target a goal pH of >7.35.  ideally she would
   wear BiPAP at night but she has continually refused to wear this at
   night despite trialing different masks and machines.
   - Volume goal 500 cc out.
    Heart rate: she has marked tachycardia with even slight movement. This
   is unrelated to her volume status, has a neg Chest CT for PE. It

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) who was admitted to the ICU for progressive dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The cause of her respiratory failure is unclear, with possible exacerbation of MG or medication-related factors. The patient has been non-compliant with BiPAP therapy, especially at night, contributing to elevated CO2 levels.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 144/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. She is currently on various medications including Heparin Sodium, Pantoprazole, and Ciprofloxacin.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated levels of potassium and blood urea nitrogen. Other lab values are within normal limits. A chest X-ray reveals increased volume overload with fluid in the fissure and right/left pleural effusion, as well as left lower lobe atelectasis.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's main issues include respiratory failure, potential MG exacerbation, and non-compliance with BiPAP therapy. The plan includes intermittent BiPAP to target a goal pH of >7.35, aiming for a volume goal"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 F with obesity, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**], anxiety, tracheomalacia s/p
   tracheal stenting 10 days PTA; initially admitted to MICU  with
   generalized weakness; now transfer back to MICU with dyspnea,
   significantly worsened weakness and severe hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, possible myasthenic crisis.
   #  Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Differential of  muscle weakness
   (from myasthenia or other cause) vs medication effect (very small doses
   of clonazepam, but is significantly affected low doses in past.
   Received flumazenil and seemed to improve (vs. improvement from control
   of pCO2 with bipap).  Patient retains CO2 at baseline, most notable at
   nighttime and supposed to be on nighttime bipap.  Intermittent apnea
   while on bipap supports oversedation as cause; however did
tire
 after
   off bipap yesterday evening.
   - needs bipap at night, pt reluctant to wear, must be further
   encouraged
   - hold all benzos and sedatives
   - will need close monitoring on floor
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**], ?crisis.  Initially noted neck muscle weakness and
   breathing without ocular or pharyngeal symptoms.  Today with
   significant ptosis on exam and c/o diplopia earlier today, though hard
   to say if this is due to myasthenia or CO2 narcosis.
   -  IVIG three doses complete (11/5
 [**10-30**])
   - change steroids from night to daytime to improve sleep
   - cont mestinon, cellcept.  Bactrim ppx.
   - avoid BB, CCB, quinolones due to potential exacerbation of MG.
   # Hypotension.  SBP dropped transiently to 70s following MICU
   admission.  Unclear etiology, one liter IV NS given.  Once Aline placed
   (and since) BPs in 110s - ?true hypotension.  If true, ddx includes med
   effect, sepsis, positive pressure, losses with history of diarrhea.
   Completely resolved overnight.  Overall, stable past 48hrs.
   #  ANXIETY. Severe impairments from anxiety.  In process of getting set
   up with therapist as outpatient.  On SSRI; issues with benzos as
   above.  Psych consult earlier this admit.
   -  no further benzos.
   -  continue SSRI
   # UTI: urine culture growing Klebsiella.
   - to complete 3d course on [**11-1**]
   # Tachycardia.  Sinus.  Reports this is her baseline; past notes
   document anywhere from 80-130.  Improved into 80s when less anxious and
   resting.  No suspicion for withdrawal, appears euvolemic, PE ruled
   out.  Up to 140s with minimal exertion, but maintaining 80s at rest.
   - continue to monitor rates
   # Urinary/fecal incontinence.  Chronic problem with recent worsening.
   Unclear if this could be related to underlying neuromuscular disease.
   -          past neuro recs: MRI Cspine at some point to rule out trauma

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of obesity, myasthenia gravis, anxiety, and tracheomalacia who was initially admitted to the MICU with generalized weakness. She is now back in the MICU due to dyspnea, worsened weakness, and severe hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is a suspicion of possible myasthenic crisis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/82 mmHg to 158/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 135. Physical examination reveals rales in all lung fields, and neuro exam is intact. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels, as well as normal potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's medical history includes tracheal stenting, generalized weakness, dyspnea, possible myasthenic crisis, anxiety, urinary tract infection, tachycardia, urinary/fecal incontinence, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She is currently on various medications and has had previous treatments including IV"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of arterial line stoppage. The patient has been in the ICU since 10/28/2139 and has multiple medical conditions including diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for recent difficulty wearing bipap for more than a few hours overnight. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 144/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications. The patient's laboratory results show normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, electrolyte levels, and liver function tests. However, there is evidence of renal dysfunction with elevated creatinine levels. The patient's glucose level is within normal range. The patient's arterial line was removed due to stoppage. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's difficulty wearing bipap for extended periods may increase the risk of VAP.
3. Stress Ulcer"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 F with obesity, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**], anxiety, tracheomalacia s/p
   tracheal stenting 10 days PTA; initially admitted to MICU  with
   generalized weakness; now transfer back to MICU with dyspnea,
   significantly worsened weakness and severe hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, possible myasthenic crisis.
  Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Differential of  muscle weakness
   (from myasthenia or other cause) vs medication effect (very small doses
   of clonazepam, but is significantly affected low doses in past.
   Received flumazenil and seemed to improve (vs. improvement from control
   of pCO2 with bipap).  Patient retains CO2 at baseline, most notable at
   nighttime and supposed to be on nighttime bipap.  Intermittent apnea
   while on bipap supports oversedation as cause; however did
tire
 after
   off bipap yesterday evening.
   -          bipap overnight; NC/FM during daytime.
   -          No benzos or sedatives; utilize other forms of anxiety
   management.
   -          Continue to monitor for muscular weakness with NIFs and VCs
 NIFs consistently -80; though VC have been low (500ish today), likely
   reflective of effort (has been able to count [**1-21**] with very poor VCs).
   -          Treatment of myasthenia below.
   -           check ABG now.
   # Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 3383**], ?crisis.  Initially noted neck muscle weakness and
   breathing without ocular or pharyngeal symptoms.  Today with
   significant ptosis on exam and c/o diplopia earlier today, though hard
   to say if this is due to myasthenia or CO2 narcosis.
   -          appreciate neuro following.
   -          IVIG again today (3^rd dose); unclear if plasmapheresis
   offers additional benefit.
   -          Per neuro, additional steroids unlikely to be of benefit
   unless needed for non-myasthenia standpoint. Change back to baseline
   prednisone dosing.
   -          Continue mestinon, cellcept.  Bactrim ppx.
   -          Avoid BB, CCB, quinolones due to potential exacerbation of
   MG.
   # Hypotension.  SBP dropped transiently to 70s following MICU
   admission.  Unclear etiology, one liter IV NS given.  Once Aline placed
   (and since) BPs in 110s - ?true hypotension.  If true, ddx includes med
   effect, sepsis, positive pressure, losses with history of diarrhea.
   Completely resolved overnight.
   #   ANXIETY. Severe impairments from anxiety.  In process of getting
   set up with therapist as outpatient.  On SSRI; issues with benzos as
   above.  Psych consult earlier this admit.
   -          no further benzos.
   -          Continue SSRI
   # UTI: urine culture growing Klebsiella.  Course of cipro.
   # Tachycardia.  Sinus.  Reports this is her baseline; past notes
   document anywhere from 80-130.  Improved into 80s when less anxious and
   resting.  No suspicion for withdrawal, appears euvolemic, PE ruled
   out.  Up to 140s with minimal exertion, but maintaining 80s at rest.
   -                continue to monitor rates
 Urinary incontinence.  Chronic problem with recent worsening.
   Unclear if this could be related to underlying neuromuscular disease.
   -          f/u urine culture
   -          past neuro recs: MRI Cspine at some point to rule out trauma
   from procedures..
   # TBM.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4834**].
   -         Bronched earlier this admission with intact stent.  Unclear
   on plans for stent given lack of symptomatic improvement; ? possible
   removal in future.  IP following.
   # DM.  Also on steroids.
   -          continue ISS and DM diet.
   # GERD. Continue PPI

The differential diagnosis for muscle weakness includes myasthenia gravis or other causes versus medication effect. The patient received flumazenil and showed improvement, suggesting that oversedation may be a contributing factor. The patient also retains CO2 at baseline, especially at night, and is supposed to be on nighttime bipap.

The plan includes using non-benzodiazepine forms of anxiety management, monitoring for muscular weakness with negative inspiratory forces (NIFs) and vital capacity (VC), continuing treatment for myasthenia gravis, and checking arterial blood gases (ABG) now.

The patient's medical history includes myasthenia gravis, anxiety, tracheomalacia with tracheal stenting, generalized weakness, hypotension, urinary tract infection (UTI), tachycardia, urinary incontinence, and chronic bronchitis. The patient is also diabetic and has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening myasthenic crisis,"
