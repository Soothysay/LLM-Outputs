   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 39 yo M with HIV/AIDs with a CD4 30 who presents
   with high grade small bowel obstruction and profuse diarrhea, in the
   setting of incompletely treated cryptosporidium.
   .
   1. SBO with ?pneumotosis: Seen on CT Abdomen on [**12-25**]. Most likely
   secondary to adhesion secondary to surgeries, however given HIV/AIDS
   status could be secondary to underlying infection or lymphoma. to
   multiple prior abdominal surgeries. Surgery aware of patient, though he
   is a poor surgical candidate. Will continue medical management.  Pt
   with copius, projectile  diarrhea this AM.
   -Serial Abdominal exams
   -NPO -including TFs
   -GJ tube to gravity
   -NG tube if patient has vomiting
   -IV fluids: NS @ 400cc/hour given losses
   -continue abx (day 1=[**12-25**]): Zosyn for gut translocation
   -f/u final read of Abdominal CT
   -pain control with IV morphine
   -inform surgery if any hemodynamic change or change in physical exam.
   .
   2. Cryptosporidium: Patient with 4L/day of profuse diarrhea. Initially
   diagnosed on [**11-20**], and started on Nitazonamide, however patient unable
   to take pos prior to this admission. Currently patient is unable to
   take Nitazonamide given SBO. Cdiff negative on [**12-20**]. Long term goal to
   restart HAART/Nitazonamide once SBO resolved.
   -continue NS @ 200cc/hour
   -continue D5W with 50 HCO3 and 20K+ @ 200cc/hour
   -f/u ID recs
   - IV Odansetron PRN
   - Increased standing ativan to 1mg TID for nausea
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   3. Fever: Initial low grade thought to be secondary to crypto
   infection. However spiked to 103.3 on [**12-4**]. BCX from [**12-4**] showed CoNS.
   9 day course of Vanc for CoNS bacteremia discontinued after PICC
   removed. UCX from [**12-4**] grew cipro resistant E Coli, completed 7 day
   course of CTX. IR performed LP on [**12-4**] and results negative for
   infection. Patient has chronic productive cough.  Patient spiked
   another fever on [**12-18**] which was most likely due to post procedural
   inflammation after G-J tube placed. Patient has spiked fevers daily
   starting [**12-21**] through [**12-26**] and has been pan-cultured several times.
   CXR [**12-22**] showed patchy left retrocardiac opacity, which could
   potentially represent an early focus of pneumonia vs pulmonary
   infarction.
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Started HAART on [**12-18**], Lamivudine 100 mg daily (renal dosing),
   Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, Darunavir 600 mg twice daily, Etravirine
   200 mg twice daily, Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily; but will need to be
   d/c'd as of [**12-25**] due to SBO
   - Hold nitazoxanide dosing for crypto as of [**12-25**] due to SBO
   - Changed azithromycin from treatment dose of crypto (600 mg) to MAC
   ppx dose once a week
   - F/U blood cultures and urine culture, all negative to date
   - CMV viral load negative
   - V/Q scan [**12-24**] read as low probability for PE
   #. Anemia. HCT decreased to 22 and was previously stable at 25 after 2
   units pRBC transfusion on [**12-23**]. Likely due to dilution from IVFs. Iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Hemolysis panel
   negative.  Transfused 2 units of pRBCs [**12-23**]. Patient had episode of
   hematemesis on [**12-12**]. EGD showed gastritis and duodenitis.
   - Continue to guaiac all stools
   - Continue PPI
   - Once Daily HCT, unless patient bleeds.
   - Appreciate hematology recs for evaluation of peripheral smear showing
   atypicals, bands, schistocytes, tear drops, etc. and questionable need
   for bone marrow biopsy
   #. HIV/AIDS:
   - Appreciate ID recs.
   - HAART held for now given SBO
   - Restarted on atovaquone 750mg QID for secondary prophylaxis of toxo,
   will also cover PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] PCP prophylaxis switched to inhaled pentamidine as dapsone may cause
   cholestasis, now started on atovaquone as above
   - azithromycin weekly for MAC prophylaxis
   - Will attempt bactrim desensitization when he can safely tolerate it
   prior to discharge
   .
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]: Improving. Likely ATN in the setting of volume depletion. Renal
   US without evidence of hydro. Creatinine peaked at 4.2 on [**12-17**] and 2.0
   today, however this level may be diluted.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   -check [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with aggressive potassium repletion
   - Aggressive volume repletion, will administer half the volume with NS
   and half with D5 with 150meq bicarb each running at 200cc/hr
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Sodium this AM inaccurate. Likely secondary to
   profuse free water loss. Will continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes, as above,
   and may have to give more D5W.
   .
   # Anal HSV: Noted on exam on [**12-26**] AM. Patient started on Acyclovir.
   -continue Acyclovir
   .
   #. Headaches: Currently without headache.  Neuroexam is nonfocal. No
   meningismus. CSF is reassuring.
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia. Likely secondary to
   infection/dehydration/pain.  V/Q scan low probability for PE.
   - Continue current pain control
   - Aggressive IV hydration as above; IVF improves tachycardia to 100s
   but HR will slowly increase once IVF d/c'd and therefore will try
   continuous fluids for now
   .
   #. Chest pain: History and exam c/w costochondirits.
   - Continue current pain regimen
   - Avoid NSAIDs
   .
   #. Depression:
   - Appreciate psychiatric recs
   - continue Mirtazapine, hold while NPO
   - Outpatient neuropsych assessment to evaluate for executive
   functioning/frontal network deficits.
   .
   #. Mild transaminitis: resolved. Unclear etiology but possible related
   to TPN as now normal off of TPN. HBVcore Ab positive in [**2145**] which was
   not treated. Crypto could also infect hepatobilliary tree, but RUQ US
   was reassuring and ERCP on [**12-9**] without evidence of AIDS
   cholangiopathy.  Dapsone d/c'd.
   .
   #. Bilateral femoral avascular necrosis:
   - Ambulating
   - Needs out patient follow up
   .
   #. RML 3 mm pulmonary nodule:
   - Need repeat CT in 12 months
   .
   #. FEN: NPO; PICC placed and TPN started [**12-25**]; continuous IV
   hydration; replete lytes agressively. Albumin 1.9.
   .
   #. Access: PICC and PIV x2
   .
   #. PPX: lovenox discontinued transiently after hematemesis. Continue
   heparin sc bid.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 39M advanced HIV/AIDS (CD4 30, VL 92K) c/b
   HBV, HSV encephalitis, CNS toxo, chronic diarrhea s/p LOA [**11-10**] w/
   wound vac, recently dx w/ cryptosporidiosis. D/c [**11-25**] on TPN, returned
   [**11-27**] w/ increased abdominal pain c/b med noncompliance - course
   further c/b fevers, CNS bacterimia (PICC), UTI (E. Coli), ARF/ATN,
   large volume diarrhea, ?GOO s/p GJ tube placement, and
   tachycardia w/ high grade SBO / pneumotosis on CT prompting ICU
   transfer.  He continues to have significant diarrheal losses- getting
   volume repletion.  Transfused 1 unit PRBC.  ID following with antbx
   changed to zosyn.  Acyclovir held.
   Exam: Tm 99.8 BP 120/80 HR 100-130 RR 25  with sat 96 on RA. -2+ L
   (diarrhea)  Frail, cachectic M, withdrawn, follow commands,
   lungs CTA, RRR 2/6SM / tachy. Distended abd but soft, +BS, Tender with
   + r, warm, no edema.
   Labs reviewed: notable for WBC 5.7K, HCT 24, K+ 3.8, Cr 2.2,
   lactate 1.7, na 134
   Agree with plan to continue to manage SBO / pneumotosis with
   ongoing supportive care--con't GJ to gravity, hold off on NGT, but
   would place if increased emesis, continue NPO, matching GI losses with
   aggressive IVF repletion with NS and D5 + 1 amp HCO3. Continue pain
   control w/ morphine, nausea control with ativan/comp ATC, following
   serial abd exams. Surgery is following closely.  Plan to hold off on
   operative intervention given very high predicted mortality and
   morbidity. ID assistance with antbx regimen appreciated. We con't
   IV zosyn for bowel flora/translocation and hold on additional antbx at
   this time.  Will follow clinical status for development of pna/asp
   given emesis and cough, though remains with stable O2 sats on RA. We
   continue to monitor closely for new infections/c diff, with hope to
   resume PO prophylactic medications, HAART, and Nitazonamide once SBO
   has resolved.   We are holding acyclovir, for ? HSV proctitis in
   setting of ARF. Low threshold to broaden with antifungal
   coverage. Tachycardia most likely related to intravascular volume
   depletion from GI losses and pain, improving with hydration and pain
   control, no evid of PE.  Anemia likely of chronic ds as well as low
   grade GI losses and depressed BM fx, no evidence of hemolysis at this
   time, continue to follow h/h, heme check stools. transfuse,  Remainder
   of plan as outlined above.  NPO, picc line/TPN, 2PIV, PPI, sq hep, Full
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with advanced HIV/AIDS, presenting with high-grade small bowel obstruction (SBO) and profuse diarrhea. He has a history of incompletely treated cryptosporidium and multiple abdominal surgeries. The patient is currently in the ICU for management of his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SBO with possible pneumotosis: The patient has a history of SBO, which may be secondary to adhesion from multiple surgeries or underlying infection or lymphoma. This can lead to further complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis.
2. Cryptosporidium infection: The patient has an ongoing infection with cryptosporidium, causing profuse diarrhea. If left untreated, this can lead to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of chronic productive cough and recent fevers. There is a possibility of pneumonia, especially considering the patchy left retrocardiac opacity seen on the chest X-ray.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, indicating anemia. This could be due to chronic disease, GI losses, or bone marrow suppression.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, likely secondary to profuse free water loss from diarrhea. This can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Renal impairment: The patient has a history of acute kidney injury"

   1. SBO with ?pneumotosis: Seen on CT Abdomen on [**12-25**]. Most likely
   secondary to adhesion secondary to surgeries, however given HIV/AIDS
   status could be secondaryto underlying infection or lymphoma. to
   multiple prior abdominal surgeries. Surgery aware of patient, though he
   is a poor surgical candidate. Will continue medical management.  Pt
   with copius, projectile  diarrhea this AM.
   -Serial Abdominal exams
   -NPO -including TFs
   -GJ tube to gravity
   -NG tube if patient has vomiting
   -IV fluids: NS @ 400cc/hour given losses
   -continue abx (day 1=[**12-25**]): Vanc, Zosyn for gut translocation
   -f/u final read of Abdominal CT
   -pain control with IV morphine
   -inform surgery if any hemodynamic change or change in physical exam.
   .
   2. Cryptosporidium: Patient with 4L/day of profuse diarrhea. Initially
   diagnosed on [**11-20**], and started on Nitazonamide, however patient unable
   to take pos prior to this admission. Currently patient is unable to
   take Nitazonamide given SBO. Cdiff negative on [**12-20**]. Long term goal to
   restart HAART/Nitazonamide once SBO resolved.
   -continue NS @ 200cc/hour
   -continue D5W with 50 HCO3 and 20K+ @ 200cc/hour
   -f/u ID recs
   - IV Odansetron PRN
   - Increased standing ativan to 1mg TID for nausea
   .
   3. Fever: Initial low grade thought to be secondary to crypto
   infection. However spiked to 103.3 on [**12-4**]. BCX from [**12-4**] showed CoNS.
   9 day course of Vanc for CoNS bacteremia discontinued after PICC
   removed. UCX from [**12-4**] grew cipro resistant E Coli, completed 7 day
   course of CTX. IR performed LP on [**12-4**] and results negative for
   infection. Patient has chronic productive cough.  Patient spiked
   another fever on [**12-18**] which was most likely due to post procedural
   inflammation after G-J tube placed. Patient has spiked fevers daily
   starting [**12-21**] through [**12-26**] and has been pan-cultured several times.
   CXR [**12-22**] showed patchy left retrocardiac opacity, which could
   potentially represent an early focus of pneumonia vs pulmonary
   infarction.
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Started HAART on [**12-18**], Lamivudine 100 mg daily (renal dosing),
   Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, Darunavir 600 mg twice daily, Etravirine
   200 mg twice daily, Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily; but will need to be
   d/c'd as of [**12-25**] due to SBO
   - Hold nitazoxanide dosing for crypto as of [**12-25**] due to SBO
   - Changed azithromycin from treatment dose of crypto (600 mg) to MAC
   ppx dose once a week
   - F/U blood cultures and urine culture, all negative to date
   - CMV viral load negative
   - V/Q scan [**12-24**] read as low probability for PE
   #. Anemia. HCT decreased to 22 and was previously stable at 25 after 2
   units pRBC transfusion on [**12-23**]. Likely due to dilution from IVFs. Iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Hemolysis panel
   negative.  Transfused 2 units of pRBCs [**12-23**]. Patient had episode of
   hematemesis on [**12-12**]. EGD showed gastritis and duodenitis.
   - Continue to guaiac all stools

   #. Hypernatremia: Sodium this AM inaccurate. Likely secondary to
   profuse free water loss. Will continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes, as above,
   and may have to give more D5W.
   .
   # Anal HSV: Noted on exam on [**12-26**] AM. Patient started on Acyclovir.
   -continue Acyclovir
   .
   #. Headaches: Currently without headache.  Neuroexam is nonfocal. No
   meningismus. CSF is reassuring.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with HIV/AIDS, presenting with high-grade small bowel obstruction (SBO) and profuse diarrhea. The patient has a CD4 count of 30 and was admitted to the ICU. The patient is unable to tolerate oral medications due to SBO and is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient's condition is complicated by multiple comorbidities including pneumonia, anemia, renal dysfunction, hypernatremia, and anal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SBO with possible pneumobilia: The patient's SBO may lead to complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis. The presence of pneumobilia on CT abdomen suggests the possibility of an underlying infection or lymphoma.
2. Cryptosporidium infection: The patient has been diagnosed with cryptosporidium infection, which can cause profuse diarrhea and contribute to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's daily fevers and patchy left retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray indicate the possibility of pneumonia. This could be caused by an opportunistic infection or community-acquired pathogens.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased to 22 g/dL, indicating anemia. This could be due to chronic disease, blood loss from gastrointestinal bleeding, or dilutional effects from aggressive fluid resuscitation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with HIV/AIDS and a CD4 count of 30. He presents with high-grade small bowel obstruction and profuse diarrhea, in the setting of incompletely treated cryptosporidium. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including anemia, hypernatremia, renal insufficiency, and depression. He is currently in the ICU for clinical improvement and is on various medications including HAART, atovaquone, azithromycin, and pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SBO with possible pneumotosis: The patient's small bowel obstruction could potentially lead to pneumotosis, which is the presence of air in the bowel wall. This can be a serious complication and may require surgical intervention if conservative management fails.
2. Cryptosporidium infection: The patient has an ongoing infection with cryptosporidium, which can cause profuse diarrhea and dehydration. If left untreated, it can lead to severe fluid loss and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to chronic disease or blood loss. It is important to monitor his hemoglobin levels and iron studies to determine the cause and guide appropriate treatment.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, likely secondary to profuse free water loss. This can lead to dehydration and neurological complications if not managed appropriately.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 39 yo M with HIV/AIDs with a CD4 30 who presents
   with high grade small bowel obstruction and profuse diarrhea, in the
   setting of incompletely treated cryptosporidium.
   .
   1. SBO with ?pneumotosis: Seen on CT Abdomen on [**12-25**]. Most likely
   secondary to adhesion secondary to surgeries, however given HIV/AIDS
   status could be secondary to underlying infection or lymphoma. to
   multiple prior abdominal surgeries. Surgery aware of patient, though he
   is a poor surgical candidate. Will continue medical management.  Pt
   with copius, projectile  diarrhea this AM.
   -Serial Abdominal exams
   -NPO -including TFs
   -GJ tube to gravity
   -NG tube if patient has vomiting
   -IV fluids: NS @ 400cc/hour given losses
   -continue abx (day 1=[**12-25**]): Zosyn for gut translocation
   -f/u final read of Abdominal CT
   -pain control with IV morphine
   -inform surgery if any hemodynamic change or change in physical exam.
   .
   2. Cryptosporidium: Patient with 4L/day of profuse diarrhea. Initially
   diagnosed on [**11-20**], and started on Nitazonamide, however patient unable
   to take pos prior to this admission. Currently patient is unable to
   take Nitazonamide given SBO. Cdiff negative on [**12-20**]. Long term goal to
   restart HAART/Nitazonamide once SBO resolved.
   -continue NS @ 200cc/hour
   -continue D5W with 50 HCO3 and 20K+ @ 200cc/hour
   -f/u ID recs
   - IV Odansetron PRN
   - Increased standing ativan to 1mg TID for nausea
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   3. Fever: Initial low grade thought to be secondary to crypto
   infection. However spiked to 103.3 on [**12-4**]. BCX from [**12-4**] showed CoNS.
   9 day course of Vanc for CoNS bacteremia discontinued after PICC
   removed. UCX from [**12-4**] grew cipro resistant E Coli, completed 7 day
   course of CTX. IR performed LP on [**12-4**] and results negative for
   infection. Patient has chronic productive cough.  Patient spiked
   another fever on [**12-18**] which was most likely due to post procedural
   inflammation after G-J tube placed. Patient has spiked fevers daily
   starting [**12-21**] through [**12-26**] and has been pan-cultured several times.
   CXR [**12-22**] showed patchy left retrocardiac opacity, which could
   potentially represent an early focus of pneumonia vs pulmonary
   infarction.
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Started HAART on [**12-18**], Lamivudine 100 mg daily (renal dosing),
   Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, Darunavir 600 mg twice daily, Etravirine
   200 mg twice daily, Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily; but will need to be
   d/c'd as of [**12-25**] due to SBO
   - Hold nitazoxanide dosing for crypto as of [**12-25**] due to SBO
   - Changed azithromycin from treatment dose of crypto (600 mg) to MAC
   ppx dose once a week
   - F/U blood cultures and urine culture, all negative to date
   - CMV viral load negative
   - V/Q scan [**12-24**] read as low probability for PE
   #. Anemia. HCT decreased to 22 and was previously stable at 25 after 2
   units pRBC transfusion on [**12-23**]. Likely due to dilution from IVFs. Iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Hemolysis panel
   negative.  Transfused 2 units of pRBCs [**12-23**]. Patient had episode of
   hematemesis on [**12-12**]. EGD showed gastritis and duodenitis.
   - Continue to guaiac all stools
   - Continue PPI
   - Once Daily HCT, unless patient bleeds.
   - Appreciate hematology recs for evaluation of peripheral smear showing
   atypicals, bands, schistocytes, tear drops, etc. and questionable need
   for bone marrow biopsy
   #. HIV/AIDS:
   - Appreciate ID recs.
   - HAART held for now given SBO
   - Restarted on atovaquone 750mg QID for secondary prophylaxis of toxo,
   will also cover PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] PCP prophylaxis switched to inhaled pentamidine as dapsone may cause
   cholestasis, now started on atovaquone as above
   - azithromycin weekly for MAC prophylaxis
   - Will attempt bactrim desensitization when he can safely tolerate it
   prior to discharge
   .
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]: Improving. Likely ATN in the setting of volume depletion. Renal
   US without evidence of hydro. Creatinine peaked at 4.2 on [**12-17**] and 2.0
   today, however this level may be diluted.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   -check [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with aggressive potassium repletion
   - Aggressive volume repletion, will administer half the volume with NS
   and half with D5 with 150meq bicarb each running at 200cc/hr
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Sodium this AM inaccurate. Likely secondary to
   profuse free water loss. Will continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes, as above,
   and may have to give more D5W.
   .
   # Anal HSV: Noted on exam on [**12-26**] AM. Patient started on Acyclovir.
   -continue Acyclovir
   .
   #. Headaches: Currently without headache.  Neuroexam is nonfocal. No
   meningismus. CSF is reassuring.
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia. Likely secondary to
   infection/dehydration/pain.  V/Q scan low probability for PE.
   - Continue current pain control
   - Aggressive IV hydration as above; IVF improves tachycardia to 100s
   but HR will slowly increase once IVF d/c'd and therefore will try
   continuous fluids for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with HIV/AIDS, presenting with a high-grade small bowel obstruction and profuse diarrhea. He has a CD4 count of 30 and is currently being managed medically due to being a poor surgical candidate. The patient has multiple comorbidities including anemia, hypernatremia, renal insufficiency, and various infections such as cryptosporidium, CoNS bacteremia, and possible pneumonia. He also has a history of anal HSV, headaches, tachycardia, chest pain, depression, mild transaminitis, avascular necrosis of the femoral heads, a pulmonary nodule, and is receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SBO with potential pneumobitis: The patient has a small bowel obstruction, which can lead to complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis if not managed appropriately.
2. Cryptosporidium infection: The patient is experiencing profuse diarrhea due to cryptosporidium infection, which can cause dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
3. CoNS bacteremia: The patient previously had a bloodstream infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which can lead to septicemia and endocarditis if not treated effectively.
4. Possible pneumonia: The patient has spikes in fever and a patchy left retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray, indicating"

   bowel obstruction and profuse diarrhea, in the setting of incompletely
   treated cryptosporidium.
   .
   1. SBO with ?pneumotosis: Seen on CT Abdomen on [**12-25**]. Most likely
   secondary to adhesion secondary to surgeries, however given HIV/AIDS
   status could be secondary to underlying infection or lymphoma. to
   multiple prior abdominal surgeries. Surgery aware of patient, though he
   is a poor surgical candidate. Will continue medical management.  Pt
   with copius, projectile  diarrhea this AM.
   -Serial Abdominal exams
   -NPO -including TFs
   -GJ tube to gravity
   -NG tube if patient has vomiting
   -IV fluids: NS @ 400cc/hour given losses
   -continue abx (day 1=[**12-25**]): Zosyn for gut translocation
   -f/u final read of Abdominal CT
   -pain control with IV morphine
   -inform surgery if any hemodynamic change or change in physical exam.
   .
   2. Cryptosporidium: Patient with 4L/day of profuse diarrhea. Initially
   diagnosed on [**11-20**], and started on Nitazonamide, however patient unable
   to take pos prior to this admission. Currently patient is unable to
   take Nitazonamide given SBO. Cdiff negative on [**12-20**]. Long term goal to
   restart HAART/Nitazonamide once SBO resolved.
   -continue NS @ 200cc/hour
   -continue D5W with 50 HCO3 and 20K+ @ 200cc/hour
   -f/u ID recs
   - IV Odansetron PRN
   - Increased standing ativan to 1mg TID for nausea
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   3. Fever: Initial low grade thought to be secondary to crypto
   infection. However spiked to 103.3 on [**12-4**]. BCX from [**12-4**] showed CoNS.
   9 day course of Vanc for CoNS bacteremia discontinued after PICC
   removed. UCX from [**12-4**] grew cipro resistant E Coli, completed 7 day
   course of CTX. IR performed LP on [**12-4**] and results negative for
   infection. Patient has chronic productive cough.  Patient spiked
   another fever on [**12-18**] which was most likely due to post procedural
   inflammation after G-J tube placed. Patient has spiked fevers daily
   starting [**12-21**] through [**12-26**] and has been pan-cultured several times.
   CXR [**12-22**] showed patchy left retrocardiac opacity, which could
   potentially represent an early focus of pneumonia vs pulmonary
   infarction.
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Started HAART on [**12-18**], Lamivudine 100 mg daily (renal dosing),
   Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, Darunavir 600 mg twice daily, Etravirine

   ppx dose once a week
   - F/U blood cultures and urine culture, all negative to date
   - CMV viral load negative
   - V/Q scan [**12-24**] read as low probability for PE
   .
   #. Anemia. HCT decreased to 22 and was previously stable at 25 after 2
   units pRBC transfusion on [**12-23**]. Likely due to dilution from IVFs. Iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Hemolysis panel
   negative.  Transfused 2 units of pRBCs [**12-23**]. Patient had episode of
   hematemesis on [**12-12**]. EGD showed gastritis and duodenitis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with HIV/AIDS and multiple comorbidities. The patient presents with high-grade small bowel obstruction (SBO) and profuse diarrhea. The SBO is likely due to adhesions from multiple surgeries, but there is a concern for underlying infection or lymphoma, especially given the patient's HIV/AIDS status. 

The patient has been diagnosed with cryptosporidium infection and has been unable to tolerate nitazoxanide due to the SBO. Long-term goals include restarting HAART and nitazoxanide once the SBO is resolved. The patient has also had episodes of fever, which have been attributed to various causes, including bacterial infections and post-procedural inflammation. 

The patient's anemia is likely due to dilution from IV fluids and chronic disease, with a negative hemolysis panel. There is ongoing evaluation for possible hemolytic anemia with a peripheral smear showing atypical cells, bands, schistocytes, tear drops, etc., and a discussion of the need for a bone marrow biopsy. 

The patient's renal function has improved, with a creatinine level now at 2.0, compared to a peak of 4.2 on December 17th. There is ongoing aggressive volume repletion with NS and D5W.

   Fluid analysis / Other labs:
   Imaging: [**12-28**] CXR (my read) fairly clear bilat, no effusions
   [**12-25**] CT chest/abd w.o constrast: 1. Findings consistent with
   high-grade small-bowel obstruction with a potential transition point in
   the right lower quadrant. Pattern of bowel gas suggests air trapped in
   mucosal folds although pneumatosis cannot be entirely
   excluded.   2. Left lower lobe density most consistent with rounded
   atelectasis although  underlying pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
   Clinical correlation is  recommended.  3. HIV-related generalized
   lymphadenopathy.  4. Moderate-sized axial hiatal hernia.  5. Anterior
   abdominal wall incisional wound.  6. Multiple pulmonary nodules, stable
   since CT torso of [**2151-9-8**].

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo M with HIV/AIDs with a CD4 30 who presents with high grade small
   bowel obstruction and profuse diarrhea, in the setting of incompletely
   treated cryptosporidium.
   .
   1. SBO with ?pneumotosis: Seen on CT Abdomen on [**12-25**]. Most likely
   secondary to adhesion secondary to multiple prior surgeries, however
   given HIV/AIDS status could be secondary to underlying infection or
   lymphoma. Surgery aware of patient, but the pt is a very poor surgical
   candidate. Will continue medical management.  Pt with continued copius
   diarrhea this AM.
   -Serial Abdominal exams
   -NPO - including TFs, will discuss with surgery re-starting PO meds as
   pt needs tx for crypto
   -GJ tube to gravity
   -NG tube if patient has vomiting
   -IV fluids: NS @ 400cc/hour given losses
   -continue abx (day 1=[**12-25**]): Zosyn for gut translocation, need to
   verify duration of therapy w. ID
   -pain control with IV morphine prn, can consider PCA if pt appears
   uncomfortable
   -inform surgery if any hemodynamic change or change in physical exam.
   .
   2. Cryptosporidium: Patient with 4L/day of profuse diarrhea. Initially
   diagnosed on [**11-20**], and started on Nitazonamide, however patient unable
   to take pos prior to this admission. Currently patient is unable to
   take Nitazonamide given SBO. Cdiff negative on [**12-20**]. Long term goal to
   restart HAART/Nitazonamide once SBO resolved.
   -continue D5W with 50 HCO3 and 40K+ @ 200cc/hour
   -f/u ID recs
   - IV Odansetron PRN
   - Continue ativan to 1mg TID, Compazine TID for nausea
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   3. Fever: Initial low grade thought to be secondary to crypto
   infection. However spiked to 103.3 on [**12-4**]. BCX from [**12-4**] showed CoNS.
   9 day course of Vanc for CoNS bacteremia discontinued after PICC
   removed. UCX from [**12-4**] grew cipro resistant E Coli, completed 7 day
   course of CTX. IR performed LP on [**12-4**] and results negative for
   infection. Patient has chronic productive cough.  Patient spiked
   another fever on [**12-18**] which was most likely due to post procedural
   inflammation after G-J tube placed. Patient has spiked fevers daily
   starting [**12-21**] through [**12-26**] and has been pan-cultured several times.
   CXR [**12-22**] showed patchy left retrocardiac opacity, which could
   potentially represent an early focus of pneumonia vs pulmonary
   infarction.
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Started HAART on [**12-18**], Lamivudine 100 mg daily (renal dosing),
   Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, Darunavir 600 mg twice daily, Etravirine
   200 mg twice daily, Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily; but currently being
   held given SBO. Can restart when pt able to tolerate POs.
   - Hold nitazoxanide dosing for crypto as of [**12-25**] due to SBO
   - Changed azithromycin from treatment dose of crypto (600 mg) to MAC
   ppx dose once a week , but also holding given SBO
   - F/U blood cultures and urine culture, all negative to date
   - CMV viral load - negative
   - V/Q scan [**12-24**] read as low probability for PE
   .
   #. Anemia. HCT decreased to 22 and was previously stable at 25 after 2
   units pRBC transfusion on [**12-23**]. Likely due to dilution from IVFs. Iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Hemolysis panel
   negative.  Transfused 2 units of pRBCs [**12-23**]. Patient had episode of
   hematemesis on [**12-12**]. EGD showed gastritis and duodenitis.
   - Continue to guaiac all stools
   - Continue PPI
   - Once daily HCT, unless patient becomes hemodynamically unstable or
   has obvious bleeding.
   - Appreciate hematology recs for evaluation of peripheral smear showing
   atypicals, bands, schistocytes, tear drops, etc. and questionable need
   for bone marrow biopsy
   .
   #. HIV/AIDS:
   - Appreciate ID recs.
   - HAART held for now given SBO
   - Also holding atovaquone 750mg QID for secondary prophylaxis of toxo,
   will also cover PCP,
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] PCP prophylaxis switched to inhaled pentamidine as dapsone may cause
   cholestasis, now started on atovaquone as above
   - re-start azithromycin weekly for MAC prophylaxis when able to take
   POs
   - Will attempt bactrim desensitization when he can safely tolerate it
   prior to discharge
   .
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]: Improving. Likely ATN in the setting of volume depletion. Renal
   US without evidence of hydro. Creatinine peaked at 4.2 on [**12-17**] and 2.0
   today.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   -check [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with aggressive potassium repletion
   - Aggressive volume repletion
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Will continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes, as above, and may
   have to give more D5W.
   .
   # Anal HSV: Noted on exam on [**12-26**] AM.  -continue Acyclovir
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   #. Headaches: Currently without headache.  Neuroexam is nonfocal. No
   meningismus. CSF is reassuring.
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia. Likely secondary to
   infection/dehydration/pain.  V/Q scan low probability for PE.
   - Continue current pain control
   - Aggressive IV hydration as above; IVF improves tachycardia to 100s
   but HR will slowly increase once IVF d/c'd and therefore will try
   continuous fluids for now
   .
   #. Chest pain: History and exam c/w costochondirits.
   - Continue current pain regimen
   - Avoid NSAIDs
   .
   #. Depression:
   - Appreciate psychiatric recs
   - holding Mirtazapine while NPO
   - Outpatient neuropsych assessment to evaluate for executive
   functioning/frontal network deficits.
   .
   #. Mild transaminitis: resolved. Unclear etiology but possible related
   to TPN as now normal off of TPN. HBVcore Ab positive in [**2145**] which was
   not treated. Crypto could also infect hepatobilliary tree, but RUQ US
   was reassuring and ERCP on [**12-9**] without evidence of AIDS
   cholangiopathy.  Dapsone d/c'd.
   .
   #. Bilateral femoral avascular necrosis:  The pt is ambulating  but
   will need out patient follow up
   .
   #. RML 3 mm pulmonary nodule:  will need repeat CT in 12 months
   .
   #. FEN: NPO; PICC placed and TPN started [**12-25**]; continuous IV
   hydration; replete lytes aggressively.
   #. Access: PICC and PIV x2
   #. PPX: lovenox discontinued after hematemesis. Continue heparin sc
   bid.
   #. Code: Full code -confirmed with patient on transfer to MICU
   #. Contact: With patient and mother
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Summary of Progress Note:

- He presents with a high-grade small bowel obstruction (SBO) and profuse diarrhea.
- The patient has incompletely treated cryptosporidium infection.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 118/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.
- The patient has a history of multiple surgeries, which could contribute to the development of adhesions leading to SBO.
- The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, elevated creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances.
- Imaging studies reveal findings consistent with a high-grade SBO, potential transition point in the right lower quadrant, air trapping in the mucosal folds, and generalized lymphadenopathy.
- Microbiology cultures have been negative to date.
- The patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, and is receiving continuous IV hydration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SBO: The patient's SBO could lead to complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis due to compromised blood flow."

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with HIV/AIDS, presenting with high-grade small bowel obstruction (SBO), profuse diarrhea, and fever. The patient has a CD4 count of 30 and is experiencing complications related to his condition, including cryptosporidium infection, bacterial infections, anemia, and hypernatremia. The patient has a history of multiple abdominal surgeries, which may contribute to the SBO. He is currently being managed with medical therapy and has been placed on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to his inability to tolerate oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's SBO could potentially worsen or lead to complications such as strangulation, perforation, or ischemia of the bowel.
2. Cryptosporidium infection: The patient has an ongoing infection with cryptosporidium, which can cause severe and persistent diarrhea. This may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
3. Bacterial infections: The patient has had multiple positive cultures for various bacteria, indicating an increased risk of systemic infections. These infections can range from mild to severe and may require antibiotic therapy.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to chronic disease, blood loss, or dilutional effects from fluid resuscitation. It is important to monitor hemoglobin levels and consider transfusions if necessary.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high"

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo M with HIV/AIDs with a CD4 30 who presents with high grade small
   bowel obstruction and profuse diarrhea, in the setting of incompletely
   treated cryptosporidium.
   #. SBO with ? pneumotosis: Seen on CT Abdomen on [**12-25**]. Most likely
   secondary to adhesion secondary to multiple prior surgeries, however
   given HIV/AIDS status could be secondary to underlying infection or
   lymphoma. Surgery aware of patient, but the pt is a very poor surgical
   candidate. Will continue medical management.  Overall, decreased pain
   and tolerating some PO today.
   -Serial Abdominal exams
   -NPO, although restarted Nitazonamide which pt is tolerating well
   -GJ tube to gravity
   -NG tube if patient has vomiting
   -IV fluids as below
   -continue abx (day 1=[**12-25**]): Zosyn for gut translocation, need to
   verify duration of therapy w. ID
   -pain control with IV morphine prn
   -inform surgery if any hemodynamic change or change in physical exam.
   .
   #. Cryptosporidium diarrhea: Patient initially with 4L/day of profuse
   diarrhea, although now with decreased stool output. Initially,
   diagnosed on [**11-20**], and started on Nitazonamide, however patient unable
   to take POs prior to this admission. Re-started Nitazonamide. C. diff
   negative on [**12-20**]. Would like to restart HAART when pt tolerating POs
   fully.
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation with: 1/2NSD5W with 50 HCO3 and 20K+ @
   100cc/hour as well as NS 100cc/hour
 total 200cc/hr.
   -f/u ID recs
 need to discuss duration of therapy of Nitazonamide, as
   well as when we can restart HAART.
   - Continue ativan to 1mg TID, Compazine TID for nausea
   - IV Odansetron PRN
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes for now
   .
   #. Anemia. HCT decreased to 22 and was previously stable at 25 after 2
   units pRBC transfusion on [**12-23**]. Likely due to dilution from IVFs. Iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Hemolysis panel
   negative.  Transfused 2 units of pRBCs [**12-23**]. Patient had episode of
   hematemesis on [**12-12**]. EGD showed gastritis and duodenitis.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Continue PPI
   - Once daily HCT, unless patient becomes hemodynamically unstable or
   has obvious bleeding.
   - Appreciate hematology recs for evaluation of peripheral smear showing
   atypicals, bands, schistocytes, tear drops, etc. and questionable need
   for bone marrow biopsy
   .
   #. HIV/AIDS:
   - Appreciate ID recs re: restarting HAART and other prophylactic meds
   - Also holding atovaquone 750mg QID for secondary prophylaxis of toxo,
   will also cover PCP,
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] PCP prophylaxis switched to inhaled pentamidine as dapsone may cause
   cholestasis, now started on atovaquone as above
   - re-start azithromycin weekly for MAC prophylaxis when able to take
   POs
   - Will attempt bactrim desensitization when he can safely tolerate it
   prior to discharge
   .
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]: Improving. Likely ATN in the setting of volume depletion. Renal
   US without evidence of hydro. Creatinine peaked at 4.2 on [**12-17**] and 2.0
   today.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Check [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with aggressive potassium repletion
   - Aggressive volume repletion as above
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   #. Fever: Initial low grade thought to be secondary to crypto
   infection. However spiked to 103.3 on [**12-4**]. BCX from [**12-4**] showed CoNS.
   9 day course of Vanc for CoNS bacteremia discontinued after PICC
   removed. UCX from [**12-4**] grew cipro resistant E Coli, completed 7 day
   course of CTX. IR performed LP on [**12-4**] and results negative for
   infection. Patient has chronic productive cough.  Patient spiked
   another fever on [**12-18**] which was most likely due to post procedural
   inflammation after G-J tube placed. Patient has spiked fevers daily
   starting [**12-21**] through [**12-26**] and has been pan-cultured several times.
   CXR [**12-22**] showed patchy left retrocardiac opacity, which could
   potentially represent an early focus of pneumonia vs pulmonary
   infarction.
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Started HAART on [**12-18**], Lamivudine 100 mg daily (renal dosing),
   Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, Darunavir 600 mg twice daily, Etravirine
   200 mg twice daily, Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily; but currently being
   held given SBO. Can restart when pt able to tolerate POs and per ID
   recs.
   - Restarted nitazoxanide dosing for crypto as of [**2153-12-28**].
   - Changed azithromycin from treatment dose of crypto (600 mg) to MAC
   ppx dose once a week , but also holding given SBO
   - F/U blood cultures and urine culture, all negative to date
   - CMV viral load - negative
   - V/Q scan [**12-24**] read as low probability for PE
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Will continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes, as above, and may
   have to give more D5W.
   .
   # Anal HSV: Noted on exam on [**12-26**] AM.  - continue Acyclovir
   .
   #. Headaches: Currently without headache.  Neuroexam is nonfocal. No
   meningismus. CSF is reassuring.
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia. Likely secondary to
   infection/dehydration/pain.  V/Q scan low probability for PE.
   - Continue current pain control
   - Aggressive IV hydration as above; IVF improves tachycardia to 100s
   but HR will slowly increase once IVF d/c'd and therefore will try
   continuous fluids for now
   .
   #. Chest pain: History and exam c/w costochondirits.
   - Continue current pain regimen
   - Avoid NSAIDs
   .
   #. Depression:
   - Appreciate psychiatric recs
   - holding Mirtazapine while NPO
   - Outpatient neuropsych assessment to evaluate for executive
   functioning/frontal network deficits.
   .
   #. Mild transaminitis: resolved. Unclear etiology but possible related
   to TPN as now normal off of TPN. HBVcore Ab positive in [**2145**] which was
   not treated. Crypto could also infect hepatobilliary tree, but RUQ US
   was reassuring and ERCP on [**12-9**] without evidence of AIDS
   cholangiopathy.  Dapsone d/c'd.
   .
   #. Bilateral femoral avascular necrosis:  The pt is ambulating  but
   will need out patient follow up
   .
   #. RML 3 mm pulmonary nodule:  will need repeat CT in 12 months
   .
   #. FEN: NPO; PICC placed and TPN started [**12-25**]; continuous IV

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 39M advanced HIV/AIDS (CD4 30, VL 92K) c/b
   HBV, HSV encephalitis, CNS toxo, chronic diarrhea s/p LOA [**11-10**] w/
   wound vac, recently dx w/ cryptosporidiosis. D/c [**11-25**] on TPN, returned
   [**11-27**] w/ increased abdominal pain c/b med noncompliance - course
   further c/b fevers, CNS bacterimia (PICC), UTI (E. Coli), ARF/ATN,
   large volume diarrhea, ?GOO s/p GJ tube placement, and
   tachycardia w/ high grade SBO / pneumotosis on CT prompting ICU
   transfer. N/V now much improved.  Stool ouput decreasing.
   Nitazoxanide restarted.
   Exam: Tm 99-> 96.8 BP 119/80  HR 88-120   RR 12  with sat 96 on RA.  +
   > 5L  Cachectic M, less withdrawn, follow commands, lungs CTA with
   scant b rales, RRR 2/6SM / tachy. less distended, softer, +BS, less
   tender, warm, no edema.
   Labs reviewed: notable for WBC 5.5K, HCT 25.4, K+ 4.7, Cr 1.7, na 138,
   inr 1.3
   Agree with plan to continue to manage SBO with ongoing supportive
   care--con't GJ to gravity, continue NPO, slowly restarting po meds
   (nitzaoxanide).  We continue to match GI losses with aggressive IVF
   repletion (NS and D5 + HCO3 and K) which he is tolerating well without
   signs of volume overload.  Adjust fuid rates as diarrhea decreases.
   N/v, diarrhea, and pain are improving. Continue prn morphine, ativan /
   compazine.  Surgery is following closely. Plan to hold off on operative
   intervention given very high predicted mortality and
   morbidity. Following serial abd exams as repeat imaging at this time
   will not change management. ID assistance with antbx regimen
   appreciated. We con't IV zosyn for bowel flora/translocation, need to
   clarify length of course. D/w ID regarding time frame to resume
   PO prophylactic medications and HAART, likely in next
   1-2 days.   Anemia stable, likely of chronic ds as well as low grade GI
   losses and depressed BM fx, no evidence of hemolysis at this time,
   continue to follow h/h, heme check stools.  ARF continues to improve.
   Adjust zosyn dosing for cr cl. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo M with HIV/AIDs with a CD4 30 who presents with high grade small
   bowel obstruction and profuse diarrhea, in the setting of incompletely
   treated cryptosporidium.
   .#1. SBO with ?pneumotosis: Seen on CT Abdomen on [**12-25**]. Most likely
   secondary to adhesion secondary to multiple prior surgeries, however
   given HIV/AIDS status could be secondary to underlying infection or
   lymphoma. Surgery aware of patient, but the pt is a very poor surgical
   candidate. Will continue medical management.  Pt with continued copius
   diarrhea this AM.
   -Serial Abdominal exams
   -NPO - including TFs, will discuss with surgery re-starting PO meds as
   pt needs tx for crypto
   -GJ tube to gravity
   -NG tube if patient has vomiting
   -IV fluids: NS @ 400cc/hour given losses
   -continue abx (day 1=[**12-25**]): Zosyn for gut translocation, need to
   verify duration of therapy w. ID
   -pain control with IV morphine prn, can consider PCA if pt appears
   uncomfortable
   -inform surgery if any hemodynamic change or change in physical exam.
   .
   #. Cryptosporidium: Patient with 4L/day of profuse diarrhea. Initially
   diagnosed on [**11-20**], and started on Nitazonamide, however patient unable
   to take pos prior to this admission. Currently patient is unable to
   take Nitazonamide given SBO. Cdiff negative on [**12-20**]. Long term goal to
   restart HAART/Nitazonamide once SBO resolved.
   -continue 1/2NSD5W with 50 HCO3 and 20K+ @ 150cc/hour
   -f/u ID recs
   - Continue ativan to 1mg TID, Compazine TID for nausea
   - IV Odansetron PRN
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   #. Anemia. HCT decreased to 22 and was previously stable at 25 after 2
   units pRBC transfusion on [**12-23**]. Likely due to dilution from IVFs. Iron
   studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Hemolysis panel
   negative.  Transfused 2 units of pRBCs [**12-23**]. Patient had episode of
   hematemesis on [**12-12**]. EGD showed gastritis and duodenitis.
   - Continue to guaiac all stools
   - Continue PPI
   - Once daily HCT, unless patient becomes hemodynamically unstable or
   has obvious bleeding.
   - Appreciate hematology recs for evaluation of peripheral smear showing
   atypicals, bands, schistocytes, tear drops, etc. and questionable need
   for bone marrow biopsy
   .
   #. HIV/AIDS:
   - Appreciate ID recs.
   - HAART held for now given SBO
   - Also holding atovaquone 750mg QID for secondary prophylaxis of toxo,
   will also cover PCP,
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] PCP prophylaxis switched to inhaled pentamidine as dapsone may cause
   cholestasis, now started on atovaquone as above
   - re-start azithromycin weekly for MAC prophylaxis when able to take
   POs
   - Will attempt bactrim desensitization when he can safely tolerate it
   prior to discharge
   .
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]: Improving. Likely ATN in the setting of volume depletion. Renal
   US without evidence of hydro. Creatinine peaked at 4.2 on [**12-17**] and 2.0
   today.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   -check [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes with aggressive potassium repletion
   - Aggressive volume repletion
   .
   #. Fever: Initial low grade thought to be secondary to crypto
   infection. However spiked to 103.3 on [**12-4**]. BCX from [**12-4**] showed CoNS.
   9 day course of Vanc for CoNS bacteremia discontinued after PICC
   removed. UCX from [**12-4**] grew cipro resistant E Coli, completed 7 day
   course of CTX. IR performed LP on [**12-4**] and results negative for
   infection. Patient has chronic productive cough.  Patient spiked
   another fever on [**12-18**] which was most likely due to post procedural
   inflammation after G-J tube placed. Patient has spiked fevers daily
   starting [**12-21**] through [**12-26**] and has been pan-cultured several times.
   CXR [**12-22**] showed patchy left retrocardiac opacity, which could
   potentially represent an early focus of pneumonia vs pulmonary
   infarction.
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Started HAART on [**12-18**], Lamivudine 100 mg daily (renal dosing),
   Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, Darunavir 600 mg twice daily, Etravirine
   200 mg twice daily, Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily; but currently being
   held given SBO. Can restart when pt able to tolerate POs.
   - Hold nitazoxanide dosing for crypto as of [**12-25**] due to SBO
   - Changed azithromycin from treatment dose of crypto (600 mg) to MAC
   ppx dose once a week , but also holding given SBO
   - F/U blood cultures and urine culture, all negative to date
   - CMV viral load - negative
   - V/Q scan [**12-24**] read as low probability for PE
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Will continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes, as above, and may
   have to give more D5W.
   .
   # Anal HSV: Noted on exam on [**12-26**] AM.  -continue Acyclovir
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   #. Headaches: Currently without headache.  Neuroexam is nonfocal. No
   meningismus. CSF is reassuring.
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia. Likely secondary to
   infection/dehydration/pain.  V/Q scan low probability for PE.
   - Continue current pain control
   - Aggressive IV hydration as above; IVF improves tachycardia to 100s
   but HR will slowly increase once IVF d/c'd and therefore will try
   continuous fluids for now
   .
   #. Chest pain: History and exam c/w costochondirits.
   - Continue current pain regimen
   - Avoid NSAIDs
   .
   #. Depression:
   - Appreciate psychiatric recs
   - holding Mirtazapine while NPO
   - Outpatient neuropsych assessment to evaluate for executive
   functioning/frontal network deficits.
   .
   #. Mild transaminitis: resolved. Unclear etiology but possible related
   to TPN as now normal off of TPN. HBVcore Ab positive in [**2145**] which was
   not treated. Crypto could also infect hepatobilliary tree, but RUQ US
   was reassuring and ERCP on [**12-9**] without evidence of AIDS
   cholangiopathy.  Dapsone d/c'd.
   .
   #. Bilateral femoral avascular necrosis:  The pt is ambulating  but
   will need out patient follow up
   .
   #. RML 3 mm pulmonary nodule:  will need repeat CT in 12 months
   .
   #. FEN: NPO; PICC placed and TPN started [**12-25**]; continuous IV
   hydration; replete lytes aggressively.
   #. Access: PICC and PIV x2
   #. PPX: lovenox discontinued after hematemesis. Continue heparin sc
   bid.
   #. Code: Full code -confirmed with patient on transfer to MICU
   #. Contact: With patient and mother
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","The patient is a 39-year-old male with HIV/AIDS presenting with high-grade small bowel obstruction and profuse diarrhea. He has a CD4 count of 30 and is currently being treated for cryptosporidium. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including anemia, renal insufficiency, hypernatremia, and fever.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a small bowel obstruction, likely secondary to adhesion from multiple prior surgeries. Given his HIV/AIDS status, it is also possible that the obstruction is due to an underlying infection or lymphoma. The patient is a poor surgical candidate, so medical management will continue.

2. Cryptosporidium: The patient has profuse diarrhea due to cryptosporidium infection. Nitazoxanide was initially started, but due to the small bowel obstruction, the patient is unable to tolerate oral medications. Long-term goal is to restart HAART and nitazoxanide once the small bowel obstruction resolves.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased to 22 after a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells. This is likely due to dilution from IV fluids. Iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease. Hemolysis panel is negative. The patient had an episode of hematemesis on 12/12, and an EGD showed gastritis and duodenitis.

   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke to surgery and OK to re-start Nidanoxide (for cryptospordia).
   Also would not recommmend repeating CT abd (to eval for interval
   improvement in SBO) at this time as would not affect management.
   - pt tolerated several doses of the Nidanoxide without nausea/vomiting.

   Less Active Issues
   .
   #. Fever: Initial low grade thought to be secondary to crypto
   infection. However spiked to 103.3 on [**12-4**]. BCX from [**12-4**] showed CoNS.
   9 day course of Vanc for CoNS bacteremia discontinued after PICC
   removed. UCX from [**12-4**] grew cipro resistant E Coli, completed 7 day
   course of CTX. IR performed LP on [**12-4**] and results negative for
   infection. Patient has chronic productive cough.  Patient spiked
   another fever on [**12-18**] which was most likely due to post procedural
   inflammation after G-J tube placed. Patient has spiked fevers daily
   starting [**12-21**] through [**12-26**] and has been pan-cultured several times.
   CXR [**12-22**] showed patchy left retrocardiac opacity, which could
   potentially represent an early focus of pneumonia vs pulmonary
   infarction.
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Started HAART on [**12-18**], Lamivudine 100 mg daily (renal dosing),
   Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, Darunavir 600 mg twice daily, Etravirine
   200 mg twice daily, Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily; but currently being
   held given SBO. Can restart when pt able to tolerate POs and per ID
   recs.
   - Restarted nitazoxanide dosing for crypto as of [**2153-12-28**].
   - Changed azithromycin from treatment dose of crypto (600 mg) to MAC
   ppx dose once a week , but also holding given SBO
   - F/U blood cultures and urine culture, all negative to date
   - CMV viral load - negative
   - V/Q scan [**12-24**] read as low probability for PE
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Will continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes, as above, and may
   have to give more D5W.
   .
   # Anal HSV: Noted on exam on [**12-26**] AM.  - continue Acyclovir
   .
   #. Headaches: Currently without headache.  Neuroexam is nonfocal. No
   meningismus. CSF is reassuring.
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia. Likely secondary to
   infection/dehydration/pain.  V/Q scan low probability for PE.
   - Continue current pain control
   - Aggressive IV hydration as above; IVF improves tachycardia to 100s
   but HR will slowly increase once IVF d/c'd and therefore will try
   continuous fluids for now
   .
   #. Chest pain: History and exam c/w costochondirits.
   - Continue current pain regimen
   - Avoid NSAIDs
   .
   #. Depression:
   - Appreciate psychiatric recs
   - holding Mirtazapine while NPO
   - Outpatient neuropsych assessment to evaluate for executive
   functioning/frontal network deficits.
   .
   #. Mild transaminitis: resolved. Unclear etiology but possible related
   to TPN as now normal off of TPN. HBVcore Ab positive in [**2145**] which was
   not treated. Crypto could also infect hepatobilliary tree, but RUQ US
   was reassuring and ERCP on [**12-9**] without evidence of AIDS
   cholangiopathy.  Dapsone d/c'd.
   .
   #. Bilateral femoral avascular necrosis:  The pt is ambulating  but
   will need out patient follow up
   .
   #. RML 3 mm pulmonary nodule:  will need repeat CT in 12 months
   .
   #. FEN: NPO; PICC placed and TPN started [**12-25**]; continuous IV
   hydration; replete lytes aggressively.
   #. Access: PICC.
   #. PPX: lovenox discontinued after hematemesis. Continue heparin sc
   bid.   PPI.
   #. Code: Full code -confirmed with patient on transfer to MICU
   #. Contact: With patient and mother
   # Disposition: call out to floor today, obtain PT consult.
","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with HIV/AIDS presenting with high-grade small bowel obstruction and profuse diarrhea. The patient has a CD4 count of 30 and is in the setting of incompletely treated cryptosporidium. The patient has multiple comorbidities including anemia, fever, renal impairment, and respiratory symptoms. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is being managed medically due to being a poor surgical candidate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient has a high-grade small bowel obstruction, which can lead to further complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis if not managed appropriately.
2. Cryptosporidium Infection: The patient has an ongoing infection with cryptosporidium, which can cause persistent diarrhea and may contribute to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Anemia: The patient has developed anemia, which could be secondary to chronic disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Renal Impairment: The patient has evidence of renal impairment, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. This can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, decreased drug clearance, and potential acute kidney injury.
5. Fever: The patient has recurrent fevers, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation. It is important to identify the source of fever to guide appropriate treatment.
6. Respiratory Symptoms"
