","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, presenting with respiratory failure, sepsis, and MSSA bacteremia. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and required intubation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 0.70 and PEEP of 12. He also developed tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and a troponin leak. He was treated with heparin, Plavix, and aspirin.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with a fever spike to 105 degrees Celsius and a low blood pressure. He has been on dialysis due to acute renal failure. Blood cultures were taken, and the patient is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. Influenza testing is pending.

Potential Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and the need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and may develop septic shock, characterized by persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient has had tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, which can potentially progress to other cardiac dysrhythmias and compromise cardiac output.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fevers and sepsis. The patient's medical history includes severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, cardiac dysrhythmia, and a recent episode of sepsis. Upon admission, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and oseltamivir.

24-hour events include the placement of a multi-lumen central line, which was subsequently removed, as well as the cessation of dialysis catheter use. The patient's fever persists, with a maximum temperature of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit. He is currently on midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain control.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and evidence of renal dysfunction. Imaging studies reveal widespread left mid and lower lobe consolidations, right basal consolidation, and bilateral pleural effusion. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates improving acidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: Due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and the presence of ARDS, the patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The use of central lines increases the risk of bloodstream infections, particularly if proper"

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA OTHER
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia
   .
   # Septic shock: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive only for
   staph in the sputum and blood early in OSH course. CXRs with L > R
   infiltrates. We broadened antibiotics empirically yesterday with vanc
   and cefepime.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal
   pneumonia but no other clear source.
    Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in OSH. Elevated Mixed venous Sat
   elevated at  84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of Septic
   etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high Mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given neg Urine legionalla and Prolonged QTc
   at times avoid FQ.
   Over likely sources include line infection, urine, or sinus (given
   sinusitus on CT head). Drug fever also possible. Fevers to 105 may also
   be [**1-4**] a central CNS process.
   - monitor BP for MAP goal > 60
   - CVP goal [**7-14**]
   - mixed venous sat goal > 70
   - monitor fever curve
   - Blood, urine, sputum, stool (c diff) cultures.
   - Repeat DFA
   - trend lactate (1.0 currently)
   - replace naficillin for Vanco and Cefepime for HAP
   - Given convincing viral prodrome continue Tamiflu until repeat DFA
   here.
   - f/u final read CXR
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.
   - ARDS net protocol with TV at 6cc/kg
   - monitor plateau, titrate up PEEP for plateus in low 30s.
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - fluid removal via dialysis
   - RSBI in am
   - fentanyl and versed for sedation.
   # ARF: Cr peak at 7.5 on HD at OSH. Likely ATN. Currently oliguric,
   which will likely continue while he is so sick.
   - Renal following
   - dialysis catheter today.
   # Tachycardia: appears sinus on arrival. Records state Afib, however
   apears sinus on all tracings. OSH EKG with RBBB as recently as [**10-26**].
   This would be an odd presentation of rate related IVCD given the slower
   rate on EKGs with QRS widing. Ddx for sinus tachy includes fever vs
   pain vs agitation vs withdrawl (possible Etoh history).
   - titrate sedation to aggitation.
   - tylenol prn
   - optimize respiratory status
   - abx as above, infectious w/u
   - monitor BP
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix
   # Acidemia: Anion gap metabolic acidosis with normal Lactic acid .
   Likely [**1-4**] renal failure. Combined with Resp acidosis, likely [**1-4**] poor
   ventilation in setting of LLL colapse.
   - dialsis per renal
   - maximize minute ventilation
   - trend ABG.
   # mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   - trend
   - limit tylenol to 2 gm daily
   # DM: BG stable on SS
   - continue Reg SS
   #: FEN; no IVF, lytes prn, on tube feeds but needs nutrition consult
   .
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI

   Access: right IJ and A line.  Needs dialysis line.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital with septic shock caused by Staphylococcus pneumonia. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is currently stable off pressors. The patient's condition has been complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming infection leading to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. The patient's blood pressure has stabilized, but ongoing monitoring and treatment are necessary.

2. ARDS: The patient has developed ARDS, characterized by bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and high oxygen requirement. This condition can progress to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately. The patient is being treated with an ARDS net protocol, including titration of PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated, along with fluid removal via dialysis.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This is suggested by an elevated creatinine level and oliguria. Dialysis catheter placement is planned, and renal function will be closely monitored.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia, which can be attributed to fever, pain, agitation, or withdrawal. It is important to optimize sedation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital after experiencing septic shock caused by Staphylococcus pneumonia. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and has shown improvement. The patient's condition is complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, and tachycardia. Imaging studies show widespread left mid and lower lobe consolidations, as well as right basal consolidation, and bilateral pleural effusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is currently in normal sinus rhythm. However, his mixed venous saturation is elevated, suggesting septic etiology. He has also shown signs of hypoxic respiratory failure, as indicated by low oxygen saturations and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's kidney function is impaired, likely due to acute tubular necrosis. His elevated troponin levels indicate myocardial ischemia, but further evaluation is needed. The patient's acid-base balance is disrupted, with anion gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis. His liver function tests are mildly elevated, possibly due to prolonged hypotension. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and requires nutrition support. He is receiving aggressive treatment, including tube feeds, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and dialysis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Organ dysfunction: The patient is already experiencing organ dysfunction in the form of ARDS, acute renal failure, and potential myocard"

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the emergency department in septic shock caused by Staphylococcus pneumonia. The patient's condition has been complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, and cardiac dysrhythmia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's initial presentation was in septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by a widespread infection and systemic inflammatory response. It is crucial to monitor the patient's blood pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), and mixed venous oxygen saturation to ensure adequate organ perfusion and prevent further deterioration.

2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and high oxygen requirement suggest ARDS. This condition involves severe lung injury, leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure. Management includes implementing ARDS network protocols for mechanical ventilation, titrating FiO2 as tolerated, and considering fluid removal via dialysis.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and oliguria suggest ARF, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Continuous monitoring of renal function, daily weight, and electrolyte balance is necessary. Dialysis may be required to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.

4. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient has experienced"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old man with MSSA pneumonia, sepsis, and ARDS. He remains febrile but shows improvement in respiratory status. The patient has undergone several interventions including changing lines, starting multi-lumen and stopping dialysis catheter, as well as receiving various medications such as midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, cefipime, and tamiflu. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 121/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for improved respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient has MSSA pneumonia and sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction if not properly managed.
2. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient may be at risk for cardiac dysrhythmia due to sepsis and the presence of multiple lines and catheters.
3. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient's renal function should be closely monitored as he may develop acute renal failure due to sepsis and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient already has ARDS, which can worsen if there is"

   Microbiology: All cultures NTD
   Assessment and Plan
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia
   .
   # Septic shock: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive only for
   staph in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.
   Elevated Mixed venous Sat elevated at  84% and mottled appearance most
   suggestive of Septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust
   BP despite tachycardia, high Mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO
   suggests against cardiogenic shock. Given neg Urine legionalla and
   Prolonged QTc at times avoid FQ.
   - Continue Vanco and Cefepime to cover for HAP.  We will continue with
   broad coverage considering improvement, and we will treat for a 15 day
   course from yesterday (today day 3).
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u read of daily CXR
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: O2 saturations have improved.  Bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen requirement suggestive of ARDS.
   Bladder pressures are lower today, suggesting we have room to wean down
   his PEEP.
   - ARDS net protocol with TV at 6cc/kg
   - wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   - fluid removal via dialysis
   - RSBI in am
   - fentanyl and versed for sedation.
   .
   # ARF: Cr peak at 7.5 on HD at OSH. Likely ATN. Currently oliguric,
   which will likely continue while he is so sick.
   - Renal following
   - dialysis catheter today with trial of intermittent dialysis.
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival.  Yesterday had a couple
   runs of tachycardia that appeared to be afib with aberrancy that were
   self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as recently as
   [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring treatment with
   diltiazem.  Yesterday went into AFib w/ RVR during dialysis.  Treated
   w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.  Converted back to sinus
   after 1-2 hours.
   - titrate sedation to agitation.
   - tylenol prn
   - optimize respiratory status
   - abx as above, infectious w/u
   - monitor BP
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix
   .
   # Acidemia: Anion gap metabolic acidosis with normal Lactic acid .
   Likely [**1-4**] renal failure. Combined with Resp acidosis, likely [**1-4**] poor
   ventilation in setting of LLL collapse.
   - dialysis per renal
   - maximize minute ventilation
   - trend ABG, is improved
   .
   # mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.  Improving.
   Added on to today's labs because had not been drawn since [**10-27**]
   - trend
   - limit tylenol to 2 gm daily
   .
   # DM: Was hyperglycemic yesterday and we are starting tube feeds, so we
   will increase his sliding scale.
   - continue Reg SS
   .
   #: FEN; no IVF, lytes prn, on tube feeds but needs nutrition consult

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the emergency department in septic shock secondary to Staphylococcus pneumonia. He has since developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), and tachycardia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray indicative of ARDS. He has a central venous catheter placed through the left internal jugular vein, and his renal function is impaired. The patient also has elevated mixed venous saturation and mottled appearance, suggesting septic etiology. His CVP is at 15, which suggests hypovolemia is unlikely. The patient's blood cultures are negative for Legionella and he has a prolonged QTc interval, so he is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia. 

The patient's current medications include fentanyl and versed for sedation, lopressor, diltiazem, and cefepime with vancomycin. His electrolytes and renal function are being closely monitored, and he is undergoing dialysis. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, but CK and CKMB are not significantly elevated, suggesting demand ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome. 

The patient's acid-base status is complicated by anion gap metabolic acidosis with normal lactate levels, likely due to renal failure, combined with respiratory acidosis from poor ventilation"

   access line has been placed over the left internal jugular vein. The
   tip of
   the line projects over the mid SVC. There is no evidence of
   complications,
   notably no pneumothorax.

   Microbiology: All cultures NTD
   Assessment and Plan
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia
   .
   # Septic shock: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive only for
   staph in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.
   Elevated Mixed venous Sat elevated at  84% and mottled appearance most
   suggestive of Septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust
   BP despite tachycardia, high Mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO
   suggests against cardiogenic shock. Given neg Urine legionalla and
   Prolonged QTc at times avoid FQ.
   - Continue Vanco and Cefepime to cover for HAP.  We will continue with
   broad coverage considering improvement, and we will treat for a 15 day
   course from yesterday (today day 3).
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u read of daily CXR
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: O2 saturations have improved.  Bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen requirement suggestive of ARDS.
   Bladder pressures are lower today, suggesting we have room to wean down
   his PEEP.
   - ARDS net protocol with TV at 6cc/kg
   - wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   - fluid removal via dialysis
   - RSBI in am
   - fentanyl and versed for sedation.
   .
   # ARF: Cr peak at 7.5 on HD at OSH. Likely ATN. Currently oliguric,
   which will likely continue while he is so sick.
   - Renal following
   - dialysis catheter today with trial of intermittent dialysis.
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival.  Yesterday had a couple
   runs of tachycardia that appeared to be afib with aberrancy that were
   self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as recently as
   [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring treatment with
   diltiazem.  Yesterday went into AFib w/ RVR during dialysis.  Treated
   w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.  Converted back to sinus
   after 1-2 hours.
   - repeat EKG today to make sure that he does not have any acute
   ischemic changes in the setting of his Afib
   - Diltiazem 30 QID
   - titrate sedation to agitation.
   - tylenol prn
   - optimize respiratory status
   - abx as above, infectious w/u
   - monitor BP
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix
   .
   # Acidemia: Anion gap metabolic acidosis with normal Lactic acid .
   Likely [**1-4**] renal failure. Combined with Resp acidosis, likely [**1-4**] poor
   ventilation in setting of LLL collapse.
   - dialysis per renal
   - maximize minute ventilation
   - trend ABG, is improved
   .
   # mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.  Improving.
   Added on to today's labs because had not been drawn since [**10-27**]
   - trend
   - limit tylenol to 2 gm daily
   .
   # DM: Was hyperglycemic yesterday and we are starting tube feeds, so we
   will increase his sliding scale.
   - continue Reg SS
   .
   #: FEN; no IVF, lytes prn, on tube feeds but needs nutrition consult
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   Access: right IJ and A line, and HD line
   Code:  Full code confirmed

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented to the hospital after experiencing septic shock caused by Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. He also has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), tachycardia, and elevated troponin levels.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Stabilized blood pressure off pressors
- Positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus in sputum and blood
- CT scan showing left-sided lung infiltrates, no signs of empyema
- Fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
- No clear source of infection identified
- Treatment for flu, but DFA tests negative twice
- Elevated mixed venous saturation and mottled appearance suggestive of septic etiology
- CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely
- Robust blood pressure despite tachycardia and preserved ejection fraction on OSH echo, suggesting against cardiogenic shock
- Prolonged QTc at times, avoiding fluoroquinolones
- Current medications: Vancomycin and Cefepime to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), broad-spectrum antibiotics, and antivirals for flu
- Follow-up cultures and daily chest X-ray
- ARDS protocol with tidal volume at 6cc/kg, weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated, fluid"

   filling pressure high even corrected for PEEP. Would like to remove
   more fluid with dialysis.
   Afib episode yesterday likely due to fluid shifts. Would check cardiac
   enzymes. Follow ECGs for possible ischemia; check AM ECG. No
   significant change in oxygenation to suggest PE; patient on DVT
   prophylaxis with sc heparin and boots. Would like to avoid contrast
   studies in setting of possible ATN.
   Patient with anion gap acidosis probably from acute renal failure.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple health issues. They are experiencing acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, bacteremia, acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, acidosis, and anemia. The patient is sedated and intubated, making them unable to provide their own medical history. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.1°F (39.5°C), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 133/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on ventilator support. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia. 

The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, sedatives, vasodilators, and dialysis. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, overweight, and has scleral edema. There are no signs of acute distress or anxiety. The patient's lungs have coarse breath sounds on the right side, which are more prominent than on the left. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and distended. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. The patient also has anemia and slightly low albumin levels. Other lab values indicate possible infection and inflammation.

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**].
   # Septic shock: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive only for
   MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.
   Elevated mixed venous Sat elevated at  84% and mottled appearance most
   suggestive of septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust
   BP despite tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO
   suggests against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], and radiographic
   evidence of PNA.
   - Would call the lab and ask them to get sensitivities for the Klebs
   culture
   - Pan Cx the pt again today
   - Get surface echo to eval for vegetations
   - Will switch ABx from Vanc/Cefepime to Nafcillin/Merrem. The pt
s MSSA
   was sensitive to Nafcillin at the OSH and he had been Tx
d with it in
   the past. The Merrem will cover the GNR (Klebs) in the sputum. Day 1
   for both will be today [**2117-10-31**].
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u read of daily CXR
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: O2 saturations have improved.  Bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did
   not have any weaning of his vent setting yesterday.
   - ARDS net protocol with TV at 6cc/kg
   - He is currently a little bit respiratory alkalotic, and with a resp
   rate of 30 implying that we can bring down his resp rate and not have
   him blow off so much CO2 and be alkalotic. We will drop his set resp
   rate to 24 with a calculated CO2 (goal CO2) of 44.
   - F/u ABG
s later this afternoon.
   - Fentanyl and versed for sedation
   - Had 1L of fluids removed yesterday at HD and is anuric. Would ask
   renal to be more aggressive with HD tomorrow, as HD removed 1L fluids
   but pt was still net even, and approx 4L positive through LOS.
   # New rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug
   rash, could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be
   more likely. We could continue this ABx course, given that the rash
   does not seem too bad at this point, or switch Cefepime to Ceftazadime,
   which only has 10% cross reactivity between the two, and the pt is
   critically ill and requires ABx. However, based on above ABx
   discussion, will be switching ABx anyways.
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick.
   - Renal following
   - Had HD yesterday and will f/u with renal when to have next HD
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours.
   - Was in sinus rhythm through yesterday  and currently continues in
   sinus
   - Started Diltiazem 30 QID yesterday, will continue
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm
   # DM: Blood sugars continue to be elevated, will need to increase his
   ISS
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   - Continue to trend
   - limit tylenol to 2 gm daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented from OSH after experiencing septic shock with Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia and bacteremia.
- The patient was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime, which led to improvement in his condition.
- The patient remains intubated but is off pressors since October 28th.
- He has a history of multi-focal pneumonia and fluid in the sinuses, but no clear source of infection has been identified.
- The patient's mixed venous saturation is elevated at 84%, suggesting a possible septic etiology.
- His CVP is at 15, indicating hypovolemia is unlikely.
- Robust blood pressure, high mixed venous oxygen saturation, and preserved ejection fraction on OSH echo suggest against cardiogenic shock.
- Current antibiotics include nafcillin and merrem, covering MSSA and GNR (Klebsiella pneumoniae) respectively.
- The patient's O2 saturations have improved, but he still has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- He is being treated with a lung protective ventilation strategy.
- The patient's renal function is impaired, with an elevated creatinine level of 7.8 mg/dL and oliguria.
- He had hemodialysis yesterday and will require further renal support.

   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia
   # Septic shock: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive only for
   staph in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.
   Elevated Mixed venous Sat elevated at  84% and mottled appearance most
   suggestive of Septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust
   BP despite tachycardia, high Mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO
   suggests against cardiogenic shock. Given neg Urine legionalla and
   Prolonged QTc at times avoid FQ.
   - Continue Vanco and Cefepime to cover for HAP.  We will continue with
   broad coverage considering improvement, and we will treat for a 15 day
   course from yesterday (today day 4).
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u read of daily CXR
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: O2 saturations have improved.  Bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen requirement suggestive of ARDS.
   Bladder pressures are lower today, suggesting we have room to wean down
   his PEEP.
   - ARDS net protocol with TV at 6cc/kg
   - wean down PEEP to 5 today
   - RSBI tomorrow morning
   - Had fluids removed yesterday via HD, 1L
   - fentanyl and versed for sedation.
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick.
   - Renal following
   - Had HD yesterday and will f/u with renal when to have next HD
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival.  Yesterday had a couple
   runs of tachycardia that appeared to be afib with aberrancy that were
   self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as recently as
   [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring treatment with
   diltiazem.  Yesterday went into AFib w/ RVR during dialysis.  Treated
   w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.  Converted back to sinus
   after 1-2 hours.
   - Was in sinus rhythm through yesterday
   - Diltiazem 30 QID
   - titrate sedation to agitation.
   - optimize respiratory status
   - abx as above, infectious w/u
   - monitor BP
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix
   # Acidemia: Anion gap metabolic acidosis with normal Lactic acid .
   Likely [**1-4**] renal failure. Combined with Resp acidosis, likely [**1-4**] poor

   - dialysis per renal
   - maximize minute ventilation
   - trend ABG, is improved
   # mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.  Improving.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the emergency department after experiencing septic shock caused by Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. The patient has been in the ICU since then and has developed several complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by an infection. The patient's blood pressure has been stable off pressors, and culture data has shown positive results for Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum and blood.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's oxygen saturations have improved, but he still requires high levels of oxygen. Bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray and high oxygen requirement suggest the presence of ARDS, a condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. He is currently oliguric, meaning he is producing little urine while being so sick. Renal replacement therapy, such as dialysis, may be necessary.

4. Tachycardia/Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has experienced episodes of tachycardia, including runs of atrial fibrillation with aberrancy. These episodes were self-limited and well-tolerated. The patient has been treated with dilt"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the intensive care unit (ICU) after experiencing septic shock caused by Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. The patient's condition has been complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, and tachycardia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 135/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate, and troponin. The patient also has an elevated mixed venous oxygen saturation and a mottled appearance, which is suggestive of septic etiology. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 85 mEq/L, and base excess (BE) of 26 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging studies reveal worsening consolidation in the lower left lung on chest X-ray, and a CT scan shows fluid in the sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia without any signs of empyema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and increased lactate levels. Renal function tests indicate acute renal failure, with a peak creatinine level of 7.5. Liver function tests show mild elevations in liver enzymes.

The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and cefepime antibiotics to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Dialysis catheter placement has been done for intermittent dialysis due to acute renal failure. The patient is also on fentanyl and midazolam for sedation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and cultures will be necessary.

   overbreathes the vent. Consider trying to reduce PEEP. CXR with
   somewhat worse infiltrate on the left. Fluid balance was even yesterday
   and is positive today, thus far.  When dialysis next done, need to take
   off more fluid.
   Patient with drug rash; concern for cephalosporin allergy. Wil replace

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple health issues, including acute respiratory failure, staph bacteremia, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and acute renal failure. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. They have a fever and tachycardia that has improved with the use of oral diltiazem. Fluid balance is even, with a positive total fluid input of 1,618 mL and total fluid output of 1,540 mL. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39°C (102.2°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 138/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has an erythematous rash on their trunk extending to the legs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a high fever and positive blood cultures for staph bacteremia, indicating an ongoing infection that can lead to sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and they are experiencing acute respiratory failure. ARDS is a potential complication due to the presence of pneumonia and the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of complications such as stroke or heart failure.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient had episode of abrupt onset narrow-complex tachycardia to
   160s around 730pm that resolved spontaneously.  Maybe a flutter with
   variable conductance vs ectopic atrial source (different p-wave
   morphology).
   - hypertensive in late afternoon so added metoprolol 25mg PO BID.
   - later in Afib with RVR with rate to 120s.  Gave 5mg IV lopressor and
   noticed that right IJ was low on morning CXR so withdrew it 2-3cm.
   - CXR to confirm IJ placement showed white-out of left lung.  Did
   recruitment maneouvers and increased PEEP.

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**].
   # Septic shock: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive only for
   MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.
   Elevated mixed venous Sat elevated at  84% and mottled appearance most
   suggestive of septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust
   BP despite tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO
   suggests against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], and radiographic
   evidence of PNA.
   - Would call the lab and ask them to get sensitivities for the Klebs
   culture
   - Pan Cx the pt again today
   - Get surface echo to eval for vegetations
   - Continue Nafcillin/Meropenem. The pt
s MSSA was sensitive to
   Nafcillin at the OSH and he had been Tx
d with it in the past. The
   Meropenem will cover the GNR (Klebs) in the sputum. Day 1 for both was
   [**2117-10-31**].
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u read of daily CXR
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: O2 saturations have improved.  Bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did
   not have any weaning of his vent setting yesterday.
   - ARDS net protocol with TV at 6cc/kg
   - He is currently a little bit respiratory alkalotic, and with a resp
   rate of 30 implying that we can bring down his resp rate and not have
   him blow off so much CO2 and be alkalotic. We will drop his set resp
   rate to 24 with a calculated CO2 (goal CO2) of 44.
   - F/u ABG
s later this afternoon.
   - Fentanyl and versed for sedation
   - Had 1L of fluids removed yesterday at HD and is anuric. Would ask
   renal to be more aggressive with HD tomorrow, as HD removed 1L fluids
   but pt was still net even, and approx 4L positive through LOS.
   # New rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug
   rash, could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be
   more likely. We could continue this ABx course, given that the rash
   does not seem too bad at this point, or switch Cefepime to Ceftazadime,
   which only has 10% cross reactivity between the two, and the pt is
   critically ill and requires ABx. However, based on above ABx
   discussion, will be switching ABx anyways.
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the ICU in septic shock due to Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. He had a complicated course with acute renal failure, cardiac dysrhythmia, and respiratory distress syndrome. The patient remains intubated but is off pressors since October 28th. His current condition includes hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, cardiac dysrhythmia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock and continued to have positive cultures for MSSA and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The ongoing infection increases the risk of sepsis and its associated complications.
2. ARDS: The patient has evidence of ARDS with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and high oxygen requirements. ARDS can lead to progressive respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level and is oliguric, indicating acute renal failure. This may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.
4. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient has had episodes of tachycardia, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Monitoring of the heart rhythm and hemodynamics is crucial to prevent cardiac complications.
5. Drug Rash: The patient developed a drug rash, which could be due to"

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella in sputum.
   # Septic shock: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.
   Elevated mixed venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most
   suggestive of septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust
   BP despite tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO
   suggests against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in blood and
   radiographic evidence of PNA.
   - Would call the lab and ask them to get sensitivities for the Klebs
   culture
   - Pan Cx the pt again today
   - Get surface echo to eval for vegetations
   - Continue Nafcillin/Meropenem. The pt
s MSSA was sensitive to
   Nafcillin at the OSH and he had been Tx
d with it in the past. The
   Meropenem will cover the GNR (Klebs) in the sputum. Day 1 for both was
   [**2117-10-31**].
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u read of daily CXR
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: O2 saturations have improved.  Bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did
   not have any weaning of his vent setting yesterday.
   - ARDS net protocol with TV at 6cc/kg
   - He is currently a little bit respiratory alkalotic, and with a resp
   rate of 30 implying that we can bring down his resp rate and not have
   him blow off so much CO2 and be alkalotic. We will drop his set resp
   rate to 24 with a calculated CO2 (goal CO2) of 44.
   - F/u ABG
s later this afternoon.
   - Fentanyl and versed for sedation
   - Had 1L of fluids removed yesterday at HD and is anuric. Would ask
   renal to be more aggressive with HD tomorrow, as HD removed 1L fluids
   but pt was still net even, and approx 4L positive through LOS.
   # New rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug
   rash, could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be
   more likely. We could continue this ABx course, given that the rash
   does not seem too bad at this point, or switch Cefepime to Ceftazadime,
   which only has 10% cross reactivity between the two, and the pt is
   critically ill and requires ABx. However, based on above ABx
   discussion, will be switching ABx anyways.
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick.
   - Renal following
   - Had HD yesterday and will f/u with renal when to have next HD
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the ICU in septic shock. The patient had Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and bacteremia, and was treated empirically with vancomycin and cefepime. The patient's condition improved, and the antibiotic regimen was adjusted based on culture data showing MSSA in the sputum and blood. Klebsiella pneumoniae was also identified in the sputum.

The patient's current medical issues include:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood sugars, likely due to his underlying diabetes and critical illness. Insulin supplementation may be required.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a drug rash, which is likely related to one of the antibiotics he received (possibly cefepime).
3. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient initially presented in septic shock and continues to have evidence of ongoing infection.
4. Cardiac dysrhythmia other: The patient has had episodes of tachycardia, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Diltiazem has been started to maintain sinus rhythm.
5. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he is oliguric (producing little urine). Dialysis may be necessary.

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella in sputum.
   # Septic shock: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.
   Elevated mixed venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most
   suggestive of septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust
   BP despite tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO
   suggests against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in blood and
   radiographic evidence of PNA.
   - Pan-culture today
   - Order TTE: to eval for vegetations given persistent febrility and
   ?septic phenomena in lungs
   - Continue Nafcillin/Meropenem. The pt
s MSSA was sensitive to
   Nafcillin at the OSH. The GNR (Klebsiella) in the sputum are sensitive
   to Meropenem. Day 1 for both was [**2117-10-31**].
   - Add gentamycin (day #1 = [**11-1**]) to double-cover for GNR
s (in sputum
   and blood).
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u daily CXR
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   - Wean down FiO2 from 60 to 50%, then wean down PEEP (PEEP had been
   increased to help recruitment)
   - Check PM ABG
   - Fentanyl and versed for sedation
 wean down as patient was minimally
   responsive this morning.
   - HD today
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on
   gent/meropenem/nafcillin.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick.
   - Renal following
   - HD today
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Yesterday, atrial irritation
   (believed due to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back)
   - Continue Diltiazem 30 QID
   - Monitor, telemetry, now s/p IJ repositioning
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm
   - Was started on metoprolol in setting of tachy/hypertensive; no longer
   occurring; discontinue metoprolol

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes who presented to the hospital with septic shock due to Staphylococcus pneumonia. The patient's condition has been complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, cardiac dysrhythmia, impaired skin integrity, and hyperglycemia. The patient remains intubated and is currently being treated with nafcillin, meropenem, and gentamicin to cover for MSSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and GNR bacteria. The patient's blood cultures have shown growth of MSSA and GNR, while the sputum culture revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae. The chest X-ray shows evidence of pneumonia and possible septic thrombophlebitis. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated mixed venous saturation, high lactate levels, and impaired kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with septic shock indicates a severe infection that has led to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
2. ARDS: The patient's bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and high oxygen requirement suggest acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can lead to severe lung injury and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and oliguria suggest acute kidney injury, which may be due to sepsis or direct renal involvement by the infecting organisms.
4. Cardiac Dysrhythm"

   Assessment and Plan
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella in sputum.
   .
   # Septic shock: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in blood and
   radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of vegetations.
   - Continue Nafcillin/Meropenem. The pt
s MSSA was sensitive to
   Nafcillin at the OSH. The GNR (Klebsiella) in the sputum are sensitive
   to Meropenem. Day 1 for both was [**2117-10-31**].
   - Add gentamycin (day #1 = [**11-1**]) to double-cover for GNR
s (in sputum
   and blood).
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u daily CXR
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   - Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 10.  Continue to attempt to
   wean PEEP

   - Fentanyl and versed for sedation
 wean down as patient was minimally

   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on
   gent/meropenem/nafcillin.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick.
   - Needs new HD line today; renal will attempt to rewire.
   - Renal following
   - HD today

   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Yesterday, atrial irritation
   (believed due to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back)
   - Dilt stopped and lopressor started again according to cardiology recs
   - 24 hour amiodarone will be done at 1430
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital with septic shock and acute respiratory failure (ARF). He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by tachycardia, hypotension, and multi-focal pneumonia. Cultures have revealed the presence of Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Gram-negative rods (GNR) in the blood and sputum. The patient's treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, nafcillin, meropenem, and gentamicin. He also requires hemodialysis (HD) due to acute renal failure (ARF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. It is important to closely monitor the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels to ensure adequate perfusion and organ function.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient's respiratory failure may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory collapse. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial. Weaning off mechanical ventilation should be attempted carefully.
3. Drug Rash: The patient has developed a drug rash, possibly due to vancomycin or cefepime. Monitoring for further skin reactions and adjusting medications accordingly is necessary"

   Critically ill
","The patient is a 37-year-old man with MSSA pneumonia, septic shock, and acute renal failure. He is currently experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella species. The patient also has wide complex tachycardia, which the EP feels is more consistent with a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy.

In the past 24 hours, the patient's fever reached 102.6 degrees Fahrenheit. He received several doses of antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, gentamicin, meropenem, and nafcillin.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, amiodarone, heparin sodium, famotidine, calcium acetate, nafcillin, meropenem, lopressor, and Tylenol.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His weight is currently 122.1 kg, and his height is 69 inches.

The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure"

   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella in sputum.
   .
   # Septic shock: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in blood and
   radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of vegetations.
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u daily CXR
   - send c.diff
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   - Weaned FiO2 to 50% and now with PEEP of 8.
   - Pressure support trial today
   - Check PM ABG
   - Fentanyl and versed for sedation
 wean down as patient was minimally
   responsive this morning, use boluses for agitation rather than
   uptitrating the dose, that is preferred.
   - HD today
   - Meropenem as above
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick.
   - Needs new HD line today due to clot; renal will place
   - Renal following
   - HD today
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.
   - Dilt stopped and lopressor started again according to cardiology recs
   - Dose of lopressor 12.5 TID, will increase today if needed for
   tachycardia.
   - 24 hour amiodarone has completed
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars were elevated, now better controlled.
   - Continue glargine; continue ISS
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Limit tylenol to 2 gm daily; change standing Tylenol to PRN
   #: FEN; no IVF, lytes prn, on tube feeds nutren at 40cc/hr, HD today
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   Access: right IJ and A line, and HD line. Renal to re-adjust lines

   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital after experiencing septic shock. He was found to have Staphylococcus pneumonia and gram-negative rods in his blood and sputum. The patient has been treated empirically with vancomycin and cefepime, and subsequent cultures revealed MSSA in the sputum and blood, as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum. The patient's condition has improved with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but he remains intubated and is being treated for multiple complications, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, cardiac dysrhythmia, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pneumonia with positive cultures for MSSA and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum. He requires ongoing antibiotic therapy to treat the infection.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and requires high levels of supplemental oxygen, suggesting the development of ARDS. This condition can lead to significant respiratory compromise and may require mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function. ARF can complicate sepsis and may require dialysis to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 37-year-old man with MSSA bacteremia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hyperglycemia. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/63 to 169/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and signs of systemic infection, which could lead to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt treatment are necessary.

2. ARDS: The patient has evidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. This condition requires careful management of oxygenation and fluid balance, as well as consideration for lung-protective ventilation strategies.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration for renal replacement therapy may be required.

4. VAP: The patient has ventilator-associated pneumonia, which is a common complication"

   Assessment and Plan
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in sputum.
   .
   # Septic shock: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in blood and
   radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of vegetations.
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u daily CXR
   - send c.diff
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 50% and now with PEEP of 8.
   - Pressure support trial today
   - Check PM ABG
   - Fentanyl and versed for sedation
 wean down as patient was minimally
   responsive this morning, use boluses for agitation rather than
   uptitrating the dose, that is preferred.
   - HD today
   -Meropenem as above
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick.
   - Needs new HD line today due to clot; renal will place
   - Renal following
   - HD today
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as

","The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital with septic shock caused by Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and bacteremia. He was initially treated with nafcillin, meropenem, and gentamicin. The patient's condition has been complicated by acute renal failure (ARF) and tachycardia.

Currently, the patient remains intubated but off pressors. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C (102.1°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 134/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and presented to the hospital after experiencing septic shock with Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and bacteremia. His current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, metoprolol, diltiazem, famotidine, and flowsheet data.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, lactate, and troponin-T levels. Imaging studies reveal mediastinal widening and consolidative opacities in the left lung.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for MSSA in the sputum and blood, Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum,"

   Assessment and Plan
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in sputum.
   .
   # Septic shock: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in blood and
   radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of vegetations.

   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented from the operating room (OSH) after experiencing septic shock with Staphylococcus pneumonia/bacteremia. The patient's condition was complicated by acute renal failure (ARF) and tachycardia. He remains intubated but off pressors since October 28th. Cultures showed MSSA in the sputum and blood early in the OSH course, GNR in blood, and Klebsiella and Pseudomonas in sputum. The patient was treated empirically with vancomycin and cefepime, which resulted in improvement. The patient also tested negative for influenza twice, so Tamiflu was stopped. He has evidence of septic etiology with a mixed venous saturation of 84% and mottled appearance. There is no evidence of cardiogenic shock, and the patient is being treated for MSSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, GNR, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation and widespread organ dysfunction caused by an infection.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). This could be due to sepsis or direct involvement of the renal system"

   There is opacity in the left perihilar region and left lower lobe have
   minimally improved. There are low lung volumes. Cardiac size is top
   normal.
   Widened mediastinum is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or enlarging
   pleural effusion.
   Left subclavian catheter tip is in unchanged position in the left
   brachiocephalic vein/in the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.
   Assessment and Plan
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in sputum.
   .
   # Septic shock: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in blood and
   radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of vegetations.
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 6
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u daily CXR
   - send c.diff
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 50% and now with PEEP of 8.
   - SBT today; wean peep and PS as tolerated.
   - Check PM ABG
   - Fentanyl and propofol for sedation
 wean down as patient was
   minimally responsive this morning, use boluses for agitation rather
   than uptitrating the dose, that is preferred.
   - HD today
   -Meropenem as above
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick.
   - Needs new HD line today due to clot; renal will place
   - Renal following
   - HD today
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.
   - Dilt stopped and lopressor started again according to cardiology recs
   - lopressor dose at 37.5mg TID and consider using dilt since patient is
   responsive to this tomorrow if lopressor does not work
   - 24 hour amiodarone has completed
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   - Adenosine if SVT tonight to see if sinus
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars were elevated, now better controlled.
   - Increase glargine and increase ISS
   - Glargine increase from 18 to 25
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Limit tylenol to 2 gm daily; change standing Tylenol to PRN
   FEN; no IVF, lytes prn, on tube feeds nutren at 40cc/hr, HD today
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   Access: right IJ and A line, and HD line. Renal to re-adjust lines
   today for HD.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the ICU with septic shock. He has been intubated but is now off pressors. The patient has a history of Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection in the blood and sputum, as well as a GNR in the blood. Klebsiella pneumoniae was found in the sputum from a previous hospitalization. The patient is currently being treated with meropenem and other antibiotics based on the culture data. He has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition is stable, and he is being weaned off ventilator support. He also has a rash on his back, abdomen, and thighs, which appears to be a drug rash, possibly due to cefepime. The patient's renal function is impaired, and he requires hemodialysis. He also has tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, for which he is receiving beta-blockers. His blood sugars are better controlled with increased insulin. There are no signs of cardiogenic shock or vegetations on echocardiogram. The patient's elevated troponin levels may be due to demand ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, likely due to prolonged hypotension. The patient is on prophylactic heparin and a proton pump inhibitor. His access lines are in place for hemodialysis, and he is awaiting clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of bacteria in his blood and sputum.
2. ARDS: The patient's bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray indicate ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory failure and hypoxemia.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest renal impairment, which may progress to renal failure if not managed appropriately.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient has experienced episodes of tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of cardiac complications.
5. Drug Rash: The patient's drug rash could worsen or spread to other areas of the body.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's increased insulin dosage may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
7. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's mildly elevated liver function tests may indicate hepatic dysfunction, which could be exacerbated by ongoing hypotension or other factors."

   Assessment and Plan
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in sputum.
   .
   # Septic shock: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in blood and
   radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of vegetations.
   Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**]
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 6
   - get culture today from HD line and triple lumen and again tomorrow am
   - consider abdominal CT to look for source of infection
   - f/u daily CXR
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 50% and now with PEEP of 8.  Too altered for SBT at this
   time despite adequate RSBI
   - SBT today; wean peep and PS as tolerated.
   - Check PM ABG
   - Fentanyl and propofol for sedation
 wean down as patient was
   minimally responsive this morning, use boluses for agitation rather
   than uptitrating the dose, that is preferred.
   - HD today
   -Meropenem as above
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick.
   - Needs new HD line today due to clot; renal will place
   - Renal following
   - HD today
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed after SVT/VT/
   - Dilt stopped and lopressor started again according to cardiology recs
   - increase lopressor dose to 50 mg TID and consider using dilt since
   patient is responsive to this tomorrow if lopressor does not work
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   - Adenosine if SVT tonight to see if sinus
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars were elevated, now better controlled.
   - Increase glargine and increase ISS
   - Glargine increase from 18 to 25
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Limit tylenol to 2 gm daily; change standing Tylenol to PRN
   FEN; no IVF, lytes prn, on tube feeds nutren at 40cc/hr, HD today
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   Access: right IJ and A line, and HD line. Renal to re-adjust lines
   today for HD.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented to the hospital with septic shock. The patient's medical history includes a previous hospitalization for Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and bacteria, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and tachycardia. 

The patient remains intubated but is off pressors since October 28th. Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) was found in both blood and sputum cultures, while Gram-negative rods (GNR) were isolated in the blood culture. Klebsiella pneumoniae was identified in the sputum from a previous hospitalization. 

The patient has been treated empirically with vancomycin (Vanc) and cefepime, which showed improvement in the patient's status. Antibiotics were broadened to include meropenem due to the presence of MSSA and GNR. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, indicated by bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and high oxygen requirement suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows an elevated mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 84%, suggesting septic etiology. 

The patient also has a rash on the back, abdomen, and thighs, which appears consistent with a drug rash, possibly due to cefepime.

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic [**Doctor Last Name 281**] with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in sputum.
   .
   # Septic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 7
   - get culture today from HD line and triple lumen (cultured yesterday
   too), and culture tomorrow (until cultures negative x48 hours, per ID)
   - consider abdominal CT to look for source of infection
   - f/u daily CXR
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 5.  Too altered for SBT at this
   time despite adequate RSBI
   - SBT today; pressure support trial as tolerated
   - Fentanyl and propofol for sedation
 wean down as patient was
   minimally responsive this morning, use boluses for agitation rather
   than uptitrating the dose, that is preferred. Stop Propofol, wean down
   fentanyl; if then mental status appropriate, consider repeat SBT.
   -Meropenem as above
   - Daily CXR
   - If anxious d/t intubation, try zyprexa
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick.
   - Renal following
   - No HD today
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed after SVT/VT/
   - Restart diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Increase metoprolol from 50mg tid to 75 mg tid
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   - Adenosine if SVT tonight to see if sinus; if need to [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] so in
   synced mode; put adenosine at bedside
   - d/c labetalol gtt

   # DM: Blood sugars were elevated, now better controlled.
   - Increase glargine from 25 to 28, and continue ISS
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES

   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of [**First Name3 (LF) 281**] and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in sputum.
   .
   # Septic shock: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 7
   - get culture today from HD line and triple lumen (cultured yesterday
   too)
   - consider abdominal CT to look for source of infection
   - f/u daily CXR
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 5.  Too altered for SBT at this
   time despite adequate RSBI
   - SBT today; pressure support trial as tolerated
   - Fentanyl and propofol for sedation
 wean down as patient was
   minimally responsive this morning, use boluses for agitation rather
   than uptitrating the dose, that is preferred.
   -Meropenem as above
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick.
   - Renal following
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed after SVT/VT/
   - Dilt stopped and lopressor started again according to cardiology recs
   - Increase lopressor dose to 50 mg TID and consider using dilt since
   patient is responsive to this tomorrow if lopressor does not work
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   - Adenosine if SVT tonight to see if sinus
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars were elevated, now better controlled.
   - Continue glargine 25 and ISS
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   Improved/stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Limit tylenol to 2 gm daily; changed standing Tylenol to PRN
   FEN; no IVF, lytes prn, on tube feeds nutren at 40cc/hr, HD schedule

","Based on the provided information, the patient's progress note indicates several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Hypertension (malignant): The patient's blood pressure readings consistently show elevated values, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. This requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.

2. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient's temperature has been elevated on multiple occasions, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. It is important to identify the source of infection and adjust treatment accordingly.

3. Pneumonia (other): The patient has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Gram-negative rods in blood and sputum. This suggests a bacterial infection in the lungs, which requires appropriate antibiotic therapy.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, indicating poor glycemic control. Insulin therapy should be initiated or adjusted to maintain optimal blood sugar levels.

5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has developed a rash on their back, abdomen, and thighs, which appears consistent with a drug rash. Discontinuation of the suspected medication (Vanc or Cefepime) and implementation of alternative treatment options should be considered.

6. Sepsis (severe) with organ dysfunction: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a systemic infection leading to sepsis. Prompt recognition and aggressive management of se"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old individual with diabetes mellitus who is currently in the ICU. They have been diagnosed with influenza and are suffering from various infections, including ESBL-producing bacteria in their blood and sputum, as well as MSSA in both blood and sputum. The patient has been experiencing daily fevers, and their mental status is unresponsive with withdrawal to pain. They have been prescribed labetalol, lopressor, famotidine, fentanyl, and propofol for their condition.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate ranging from 84 to 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/51 to 183/93 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 0 to 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. They are receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 676 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 67. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, HCO3- of 84 mEq/L, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 210, and ventilation rate of 13.4 L/min.

   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in sputum.
   .
   # Septic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].

   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 5.  Too altered for SBT at this
   time despite adequate RSBI
   - SBT today; pressure support trial as tolerated
   - Fentanyl and propofol for sedation
 wean down as patient was
   minimally responsive this morning, use boluses for agitation rather
   than uptitrating the dose, that is preferred. Stop Propofol, wean down
   fentanyl; if then mental status appropriate, consider repeat SBT.
   -Meropenem as above
   - Daily CXR
   - If anxious d/t intubation, try zyprexa
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash

   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick.
   - Renal following
   - No HD today

   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed after SVT/VT/
   - Restart diltiazem 30mg qid

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the ICU with septic shock secondary to Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. The patient remains intubated but is currently off pressors since October 28th. The patient has been diagnosed with various medical conditions including hypertensive crisis, pneumonia (other), hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, cardiac dysrhythmia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate ranging from 80 to 165 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 174/87 mmHg to 128/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, propofol, diltiazem, adenosine, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), famotidine (Pepcid), and metoprolol.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate, and blood glucose levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, PaO2 of 215 mmHg, and HCO3- of 24 mEq/L. The patient's chest X-ray reveals bilateral infiltrates suggestive of ARDS.

The patient's medical team has implemented several interventions including broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem), treatment for MSSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, daily chest X-rays, weaning of ventilator settings, and sedation management. The patient's renal function is being monitored closely due to acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Progressive ARDS: The patient's bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and high oxygen requirement suggest the possibility of worsening ARDS.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal impairment, which may require further intervention such as dialysis.
3. Sepsis: Despite current antibiotic therapy, the patient remains at risk for sepsis due to the presence of multiple organisms in the blood cultures.
4. Cardiac dysrhythmias: The patient's history of tachycardia and atrial fibrillation increases the risk of recurrent dysrhythmias.
5. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity puts him at risk for developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobilization.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobilization and critical illness increase the risk of DVT formation.

It is important to closely monitor"

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic [**Doctor Last Name 281**] with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in sputum.
   .
   # Septic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 8. Length of
   hospital course?
 f/u with ID (likely pending presence of negative
   blood cultures first)
   - get culture today from HD line and triple lumen (cultured yesterday
   too), and culture tomorrow (until cultures negative x48 hours, per ID)
   - f/u daily CXR
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Too altered for SBT at this
   time despite adequate RSBI
   - Increasing propofol to help with hypertension/tachycardia (see
   below); so will postpone doing an SBT today as feel that increased
   sedation will result in an SBT failure
   - Continue pressure support for today
   -Meropenem as above
   - Daily CXR
   - If anxious d/t intubation, try zyprexa
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick. Urine output increasing
   considerably over past few days.
   - F/u renal recs
   - No HD today, next planned for Monday
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension yesterday & today.
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Continue metoprolol at 125mg tid
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   - Apply clonidine patch 0.2 (know that there will be a delay before it
   starts affecting BP)
   - Increase propofol until the clonidine patch
s effectiveness increases
   - Adenosine if SVT tonight to see if sinus; if need to [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] so in
   synced mode; adenosine is at bedside; alternatively could also try
   diltiazem is another SVT occurs as that broke it previously too

   # DM: Blood sugars were elevated, now much better controlled.
   - Increase glargine from 28 to 30, and continue ISS

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on several medications, including meropenem for septic shock with ESBL klebs bacteremia, propofol and fentanyl for sedation and pain management, and metoprolol and diltiazem for hypertension. The patient also has pneumonia, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, cardiac dysrhythmia, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 101.1°F (fever)
- Heart rate: 84 bpm (tachycardia)
- Blood pressure: 180/88 mmHg (hypertension)
- Respiratory rate: 33 breaths per minute (tachypnea)
- Oxygen saturation: 99% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, high creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's recent blood cultures have been negative, indicating that there is no active infection. The patient's renal function is impaired, and they are scheduled for hemodialysis tomorrow.

The patient's ARDS is being managed with a low tidal volume ventilation strategy and the goal is to wean off propof"

   CXR [**2114-11-7**]:  In comparison with the study of [**11-6**], there is probably
   little
   overall change. Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
   Extensive
   opacification in the lower half of the left lung is again seen. Again
   this is
   probably consistent with pneumonia and pleural effusion. Small amount
   of
   opacification at the right base most likely represents atelectasis.

   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic [**Doctor Last Name 281**] with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 9. Length of
   hospital course?
 f/u with ID (likely pending presence of negative
   blood cultures first)
   - get culture today from HD line and triple lumen (cultured the prior
   two days too), and culture tomorrow (until cultures negative x48 hours,
   per ID)
   - f/u daily CXR
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Too altered for SBT at this
   time despite adequate RSBI
   - Increasing propofol to help with hypertension/tachycardia (see
   below); so will postpone doing an SBT today as feel that increased
   sedation will result in an SBT failure
   - Continue pressure support for today, attempt to decr PEEP to 7 and
   re-eval.
   -Meropenem as above
   - Daily CXR
   - If anxious d/t intubation, try zyprexa
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick. Urine output increasing
   considerably over past few days.
   - F/u renal recs
   - No HD today, next planned for Monday
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension yesterday & today.
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Continue metoprolol at 125mg tid
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   - Adenosine if SVT tonight to see if sinus; if need to [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] so in
   synced mode; adenosine is at bedside; alternatively could also try
   diltiazem is another SVT occurs as that broke it previously too
   - d/c labetalol gtt
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Apply clonidine patch 0.2 (know that there will be a delay before it
   starts affecting BP)
   - Increase propofol until the clonidine patch
s effectiveness increases
   - Cont Dilt and Metop.
   - Start Amlodipine 5mg PO daily.
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars were elevated, now much better controlled.
   - Increase glargine from 28 to 30, and continue ISS
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of [**First Name3 (LF) 281**] and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   Improved/stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs

   CXR [**2114-11-7**]:  In comparison with the study of [**11-6**], there is probably
   little
   overall change. Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
   Extensive
   opacification in the lower half of the left lung is again seen. Again
   this is
   probably consistent with pneumonia and pleural effusion. Small amount
   of
   opacification at the right base most likely represents atelectasis.

   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic [**Doctor Last Name 281**] with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in sputum.
   .
   # Septic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 9. Length of
   hospital course?
 f/u with ID (likely pending presence of negative
   blood cultures first)
   - get culture today from HD line and triple lumen (cultured the prior
   two days too), and culture tomorrow (until cultures negative x48 hours,
   per ID)
   - f/u daily CXR
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Too altered for SBT at this
   time despite adequate RSBI
   - Increasing propofol to help with hypertension/tachycardia (see
   below); so will postpone doing an SBT today as feel that increased
   sedation will result in an SBT failure
   - Continue pressure support for today
   -Meropenem as above
   - Daily CXR
   - If anxious d/t intubation, try zyprexa
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick. Urine output increasing
   considerably over past few days.
   - F/u renal recs
   - No HD today, next planned for Monday
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension yesterday & today.
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Continue metoprolol at 125mg tid
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   - Apply clonidine patch 0.2 (know that there will be a delay before it
   starts affecting BP)
   - Increase propofol until the clonidine patch
s effectiveness increases
   - Adenosine if SVT tonight to see if sinus; if need to [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] so in
   synced mode; adenosine is at bedside; alternatively could also try
   diltiazem is another SVT occurs as that broke it previously too

   # DM: Blood sugars were elevated, now much better controlled.
   - Increase glargine from 28 to 30, and continue ISS

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to an infection with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedation. The patient has a history of septic shock with ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia, for which he was treated with meropenem. The patient also has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is on FiO2 of 0.4. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient is experiencing high blood pressure, which may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
2. Fever: The patient has a fever, indicating possible ongoing infection or inflammation.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has high blood sugar levels, which can be a result of stress and illness.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may have compromised skin due to the use of invasive lines and tubes.
5. Sepsis: The patient's condition suggests severe sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction if not treated promptly.
6. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient has an abnormal heart rhythm, which needs to be monitored and managed.
7. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, requiring hemodialysis.
8. ARDS: The patient has developed ARDS, a serious lung injury that requires careful management.
9. Barriers to extubation: The patient's sedation is currently a barrier to extubation (removal of the breathing tube).
10. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a more comprehensive analysis."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and presents with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the ventilator settings need to be adjusted or if there are any complications related to the endotracheal tube.

2. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient has an ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia, indicating a severe infection. There is a high risk of sepsis progressing to septic shock if the infection is not adequately controlled with appropriate antibiotics.

3. Pneumonia: The patient is diagnosed with pneumonia, which may require further management such as broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care.

4. Hypertension: The patient has malignant hypertension, which requires aggressive treatment to prevent complications like intracranial hemorrhage or cardiovascular events.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, indicating possible insulin resistance or impaired glucose metabolism. This needs to be monitored and managed to prevent further complications.

6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and other skin infections. Regular repositioning and proper skin care are essential to prevent these complications.

7. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient has experienced tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia ("

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic [**Doctor Last Name 281**] with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 9. Length of
   hospital course?
 f/u with ID (likely pending presence of negative
   blood cultures first)
   - get cultures daily from HD line and triple lumen (until cultures
   negative x48 hours, per ID)
   - f/u daily CXR
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   - Consider bronchoscopy.
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.
   - Increasing propofol to help with hypertension/tachycardia (see
   below).
   - Continue pressure support for today, attempt to decr PEEP to 7 and
   re-eval.
   -Meropenem as above
   - Daily CXR
   - If anxious d/t intubation, try zyprexa
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen

","The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital with septic shock secondary to Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of hypertension, which is currently poorly controlled. He also has renal failure, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level and oliguria. The patient's oxygenation status is compromised, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 300 and an increased respiratory system compliance.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is elevated and poorly controlled, putting him at risk for hypertensive crisis.

2. Fever: The patient has an elevated body temperature, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. There is also evidence of multi-focal pneumonia, suggesting a possible secondary infection.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, which increases his risk for hyperglycemia.

5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has developed a rash on his back, abdomen, and thighs, which could be due to an allergic reaction to one of the medications he is receiving.

6. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of septic shock indicates systemic involvement of infection, which can lead to organ"

   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].

   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 9. Length of

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic [**Doctor Last Name 281**] with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 9. Length of
   hospital course?
 f/u with ID (likely pending presence of negative
   blood cultures first)
   - get cultures daily from HD line and triple lumen (until cultures
   negative x48 hours, per ID)
   - f/u daily CXR
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   - Consider bronchoscopy.
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.
   - Increasing propofol to help with hypertension/tachycardia (see
   below).
   - Continue pressure support for today, attempt to decr PEEP to 7 and
   re-eval.
   -Meropenem as above
   - Daily CXR
   - If anxious d/t intubation, try zyprexa
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick. Urine output increasing
   considerably over past few days.
   - F/u renal recs, HD per renal.
   - HD yesterday.
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension yesterday & today.
   - Adenosine if SVT tonight to see if sinus; if need to [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] so in
   synced mode; adenosine is at bedside; alternatively could also try
   diltiazem is another SVT occurs as that broke it previously too.
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Continue metoprolol at 125mg tid
   - Increase amlodipine to 10mg daily.
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine patch 0.2 (know that there will be a delay before
   it starts affecting BP)
   - Increase propofol until the clonidine patch
s effectiveness increases
   - Cont Dilt and Metop.
   - Increase Amlodipine to 10 mg PO daily.
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars were elevated, now much better controlled.
   - glargine increased to 30, and continue ISS
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of [**First Name3 (LF) 281**] and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   Improved/stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Limit tylenol to 2 gm daily; changed standing Tylenol to PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital with septic shock caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection.
- He was intubated and remains on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient has a history of hypertension, which has been difficult to control despite multiple medications.
- He also has renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria.
- The patient's blood glucose levels were initially elevated but are now well-controlled with insulin therapy.
- His troponin levels were elevated, suggesting possible myocardial ischemia or injury, but cardiac enzymes have stabilized.
- There is a mild elevation in liver function tests, which may be attributed to prolonged hypotension.
- The patient has a rash on his back, abdomen, and thighs, which appears consistent with a drug rash, possibly due to vancomycin or cefepime.
- Cultures have grown Gram-negative rods in the blood, and sputum cultures show Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
- Imaging studies reveal left lower lobe opacification and right basilar atelectasis.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by malignant hypertension, fever, pneumonia, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, sepsis, cardiac dysrhythmia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented to the hospital with septic shock and pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. He remains intubated but off pressors since October 28th. The patient has a history of multi-focal pneumonia, fluid in the sinuses, and elevated mixed venous saturation suggestive of septic etiology. He also has renal failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypertension, and an elevated troponin level indicating possible myocardial ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he is at risk for hypertensive crisis, which can lead to end-organ damage if not managed promptly.
2. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could indicate an ongoing infection or sepsis.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by MSSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This infection may worsen if not treated effectively.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria. Proper management is necessary to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
5. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and an elevated troponin level, suggesting possible myocardial ischemia"

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic [**Doctor Last Name 281**] with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 9. Will treat with
   14 total days Meropenem since first negative blood culture = course
   should be from [**11-5**] to [**11-19**].
   - get cultures daily from HD line and triple lumen (until cultures
   negative x48 hours, per ID)
   - Requested speciation and sensitivities of GNRs in sputum cxr, as
   concern for treatment failure given growth while pt on appropriate abx
   therapy.
   - f/u daily CXR
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Now intubated 18 days
   ([**11-10**]).
   -Meropenem as above
   - Daily CXR
   - If anxious d/t intubation, try zyprexa
   - Will decrease fentanyl, propofol and start precedex x 24 hours to
   attempt to extubate today.
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will

   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension yesterday & today.

   Disposition: pending extubation and clinical improvement
","The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented from OSH after experiencing septic shock with Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. The patient has been intubated but is currently off pressors since 10/28/2117. Blood cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in the sputum and blood early in the OSH course. A CT scan showed left-sided infiltrates but no signs of empyema. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were empirically started with vancomycin and cefepime, which improved the patient's status. The patient also tested negative for influenza twice and another negative DFA here, so treatment for flu was stopped. Elevated mixed venous saturation and mottled appearance suggested a septic etiology, ruling out cardiogenic shock. The patient's blood cultures also grew Gram-negative rods (GNRs), including Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the sputum, as well as GNRs in the blood. Radiographic evidence of pneumonia was observed.

The patient has been treated for MSSA found in the blood/sputum from OSH, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum from Hospital1 on 11/19. The patient is currently on meropenem, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, for 14 days since the first negative blood"

   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic [**Doctor Last Name 281**] with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive for MSSA
   in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L > R
   infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 9. Will treat with
   14 total days Meropenem since first negative blood culture = course
   should be from [**11-5**] to [**11-19**].
   - get cultures daily from HD line and triple lumen (until cultures

   - Increasing propofol to help with hypertension/tachycardia (see

   - Continue pressure support for today, attempt to decr PEEP to 7 and
   re-eval.
   -Meropenem as above
   - Daily CXR
   - If anxious d/t intubation, try zyprexa
   - Will decrease fentanyl, propofol and start precedex x 24 hours to
   attempt to extubate tomorrow

   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash

   likely continue while he is so sick. Urine output increasing
   considerably over past few days.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to an infection caused by ESBL Klebsiella bacteria. The patient has septic shock with ESBL klebs bacteremia and is being treated with cefiderocol (Cont meropenem). 

The patient also has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is on mechanical ventilation. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.49, indicating respiratory alkalosis, which is common in ARDS. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 170, suggesting moderate ARDS.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypertension, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, cardiac dysrhythmia, acute renal failure, and ARDS. 

The patient is currently receiving various treatments such as meropenem for the infection, diltiazem and metoprolol for hypertension, and hemodialysis for acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/43 mmHg to 181/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%.

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic [**Doctor Last Name 281**] with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 9. Will treat with
   14 total days Meropenem since first negative blood culture = course
   should be from [**11-5**] to [**11-19**].
   - Added vancomycin on [**11-10**] for GPC
   - get cultures daily from HD line and triple lumen (until cultures
   negative x48 hours, per ID)
   - Requested speciation and sensitivities of GNRs in sputum cxr, as
   concern for treatment failure given growth while pt on appropriate abx
   therapy.
   - f/u daily CXR
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p
   precedex, benzo use to help with anxiety while intubated).
   -Meropenem as above
   - Daily CXR
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick. Urine output increasing
   considerably over past few days.
   - F/u renal recs, holding on HD for now
   - Per renal recs, will give PRN Lasix to keep total daily UOP > 500 mL.
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension yesterday & today.
   - Adenosine if SVT tonight to see if sinus; if need to [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] so in
   synced mode; adenosine is at bedside; alternatively could also try
   diltiazem is another SVT occurs as that broke it previously too.
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Continue metoprolol at 125mg tid
   - Increased amlodipine to 10mg daily.
   - Continue hydralazine 500mg Q6 hrs
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine patch 0.2
   - Cont Dilt and Metoprolol
   - Continue Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily.
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars were elevated, now much better controlled.
   - Glargine increased to 40 QD, and continue ISS
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of [**First Name3 (LF) 281**] and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   Improved/stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs

The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the ICU from the operating room after experiencing a septic crisis. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has a history of pneumonia, including Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in the sputum and blood, as well as growth of Gram-negative rods in the blood culture. He was treated empirically with vancomycin and cefepime, which resulted in improvement. Subsequently, the antibiotics were changed to meropenem, and vancomycin was added for Gram-positive cocci in clusters. The patient's renal function is impaired, with an elevated creatinine level and oliguria. He has tachycardia and hypertension, for which he is being treated with clonidine, metoprolol, amlodipine, and hydralazine. The patient also has a rash on his back, abdomen, and thighs, which is suspected to be a drug rash. He is being treated with topical medications for the rash. The patient's blood glucose levels were initially elevated but are now better controlled with glargine and insulin sensitivity syndrome (ISS). The patient's elevated troponin levels are likely due to demand ischemia or renal failure. His liver function tests are mildly elevated but have improved. The patient's code status is full code confirmed. He has a right internal jugular"

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic [**Doctor Last Name 281**] with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 9. Will treat with
   14 total days Meropenem since first negative blood culture = course
   should be from [**11-5**] to [**11-19**].
   - Added vancomycin on [**11-10**] for GPC
   - get cultures daily from all possible lines (until cultures negative
   x48 hours, per ID)
   - pull as many lines today as possible (aline, HD line, TLC)
   - Requested speciation and sensitivities of GNRs in sputum cxr, as
   concern for treatment failure given growth while pt on appropriate abx
   therapy; also spec/[**Last Name (un) 270**] of GPC
   - f/u daily CXR
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p
   precedex, benzo use to help with anxiety while intubated).
   Significantly resolving.
   -Meropenem, vancomycin as above
   - Daily CXR
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick. Urine output increasing
   considerably over past few days.
   - F/u renal recs, holding on HD for now
   - Per renal recs, will give PRN Lasix to keep total daily UOP > 2L
   - ask renal if we can pull HD line today given positive blood cultures
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension yesterday & today.
   - Adenosine if SVT tonight to see if sinus; if need to [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] so in
   synced mode; adenosine is at bedside; alternatively could also try
   diltiazem is another SVT occurs as that broke it previously too.
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Continue metoprolol at 125mg tid
   - Increased amlodipine to 10mg daily.
   - Continue hydralazine 500mg Q6 hrs
   - add 10mg IV hydral q6h prn SBP >140
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine patch 0.2
   - Cont Dilt and Metoprolol
   - Continue Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily.
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars were elevated, now much better controlled.
   - Glargine increased to 40 QD, and continue ISS
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of [**Hospital1 281**] and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   Improved/stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Limit tylenol to 2 gm daily; changed standing Tylenol to PRN

","The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the emergency department after experiencing septic shock. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, renal failure, and hyperglycemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 194/99 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate levels. Blood cultures have grown Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, identified as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Sputum cultures have grown Gram-negative rods, including Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The patient's treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, specifically meropenem and vancomycin, to cover for MSSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient is also receiving antihypertensive medications such as metoprolol, diltiazem, amlodipine, and clonidine.

The patient's recent events include extubation on 11/10"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented with respiratory failure due to an infection caused by ESBL Klebsiella bacteria. The patient also had septic shock with ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia. He was initially on invasive ventilation but has now been extubated and is doing well.

The patient's condition includes hypertension, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, cardiac dysrhythmia, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem, to treat the bacterial infection. His blood cultures showed the presence of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 182/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nasal cannula. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests.

The patient's current plan includes continuing with aggressive glycemic control, removing central lines, hemodialysis for acute renal failure, and managing other medical issues as per the ICU team.

   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic [**Doctor Last Name 281**] with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in sputum.
    Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with adenosine.
   .
   # Septic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 12. Will treat with
   14 total days Meropenem since first negative blood culture = course
   should be from [**11-5**] to [**11-19**].
   - Added vancomycin on [**11-10**] for GPC
   - Now pt is on cefepime, meropenem and Vanc
   - get cultures daily from all possible lines (until cultures negative
   x48 hours, per ID)

   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p

   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick. Urine output increasing
   considerably over past few days.
   - F/u renal recs, holding on HD for now
   - Per renal recs, will give PRN Lasix to keep total daily UOP > 2L
   - pulled HD line today given positive blood cultures
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension yesterday & today.
   - Adenosine if SVT tonight to see if sinus; if need to [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] so in

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement, stay in ICU
","The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus presenting from the emergency department with septic shock and pneumonia. He has been intubated but is currently off pressors. The patient has a history of hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmia, renal failure, and hyperglycemia. 

The patient's current condition includes severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, malignant hypertension, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure. 

The patient's treatment plan includes the following: 
- Antibiotics: The patient is currently receiving meropenem, vancomycin, and cefepime for suspected MSSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas infections.
- Hemodynamic support: The patient is being closely monitored for blood pressure and heart rate, and appropriate medications are being administered to manage hypertension and tachycardia.
- Renal support: The patient is on dialysis and is holding HD for now. Lasix is being given to maintain adequate urine output.
- Pulmonary support: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with weaning efforts ongoing.
- Skin care: The patient's rash is being monitored, and topical creams are being applied for local relief.
- Cardiac monitoring: The patient's cardiac enzymes are being trended, and appropriate medications are being given for tachycardia and hypertension.
- Nutritional support: The patient is planned to start tube feeds soon.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to the presence of multiple lines and the immunocompromised state.
2. Kidney injury: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening renal function if appropriate measures are not taken.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, and there is a risk of prolonged need for mechanical ventilation and potential respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac events: The patient has a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, and the current state of hypertension and tachycardia puts him at risk for cardiac events.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient has impaired skin integrity, and there is a risk of developing pressure ulcers or other skin complications.

The patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU setting."

   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic shock/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 12. Will treat with
   14 total days Meropenem since first negative blood culture = course
   should be from [**11-5**] to [**11-19**].
   - s/p  removal of aline, HD line, TLC
   - Added vancomycin on [**11-10**] for GPC
   - Cefepime was added to meropenem and Vanc overnight as coverage for
   [**Month/Day (4) **]-resistant Pseudomonas (given + sputum cxrf from [**11-10**]).  Will dc
   cefepime for now, as Pseudomonas is likely contaminate.
   - F/u ID recs for: double coverage of ? pseudomonal PNA, also re: abx
   coverage for coag pos staph bacteremia, duration of therapy
   - get cultures daily  (until cultures negative x48 hours, per ID)
   - f/u daily CXR, sputum cxr, sensitivities, speciation
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p
   precedex, benzo use to help with anxiety while intubated).
   Significantly resolving.
   -Meropenem, vancomycin as above
   - Daily CXR
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick. Urine output increasing
   considerably over past few days.
   - F/u renal recs, holding on HD for now
   - Per renal recs, will give PRN Lasix to keep total daily UOP > 2L
   - pulled HD line yesterday ([**11-11**]) given positive blood cultures
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine patch 0.3
   - Cont Dilt and Metoprolol
   - Continue Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily.
   - Continue hydralazine 500mg Q6 hrs, can consider dc
ing and starting
   ACEI in [**12-4**] days when stable improved kidney fxn
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam (started on [**11-11**])
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars poorly controlled.
   - Glargine increased to 50 QD and continue ISS
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension for 2 days. Tachycardia resolved x 5 days
   as of [**11-12**].
   - Adenosine at bedside in case of SVT
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Continue metoprolol at 125mg tid
   - Increased amlodipine to 10mg daily.
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   Improved/stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Limit tylenol to 2 gm daily; changed standing Tylenol to PRN
   .
   FEN; no IVF, lytes prn, started tube feeds, speech & swallow and PT

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic [**Doctor Last Name 281**] with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic [**Year (2 digits) 281**]. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 9. Will treat with
   14 total days Meropenem since first negative blood culture = course
   should be from [**11-5**] to [**11-19**].
   - Added vancomycin on [**11-10**] for GPC
   - get cultures daily from all possible lines (until cultures negative
   x48 hours, per ID)
   - pull as many lines today as possible (aline, HD line, TLC)
   - Requested speciation and sensitivities of GNRs in sputum cxr, as
   concern for treatment failure given growth while pt on appropriate abx
   therapy; also spec/[**Last Name (un) 270**] of GPC
   - f/u daily CXR
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p
   precedex, benzo use to help with anxiety while intubated).
   Significantly resolving.
   -Meropenem, vancomycin as above
   - Daily CXR
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick. Urine output increasing
   considerably over past few days.
   - F/u renal recs, holding on HD for now
   - Per renal recs, will give PRN Lasix to keep total daily UOP > 2L
   - ask renal if we can pull HD line today given positive blood cultures
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension yesterday & today.
   - Adenosine if SVT tonight to see if sinus; if need to [**Last Name (LF) 281**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] so in
   synced mode; adenosine is at bedside; alternatively could also try
   diltiazem is another SVT occurs as that broke it previously too.
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Continue metoprolol at 125mg tid
   - Increased amlodipine to 10mg daily.
   - Continue hydralazine 500mg Q6 hrs
   - add 10mg IV hydral q6h prn SBP >140
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine patch 0.2
   - Cont Dilt and Metoprolol
   - Continue Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily.
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars were elevated, now much better controlled.
   - Glargine increased to 40 QD, and continue ISS
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of [**Hospital1 281**] and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   Improved/stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Limit tylenol to 2 gm daily; changed standing Tylenol to PRN
   .
   FEN; no IVF, lytes prn, start tube feeds (place NG tube), HD schedule

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement, stay in ICU
","The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presents with septic shock, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. The patient's medical history is significant for a recent hospitalization at another facility for septic shock and pneumonia. He was treated with nafcillin, meropenem, and gentamicin but developed a resistant infection with gram-negative rods in the blood culture. He was then switched to solely meropenem and also received vancomycin for gram-positive cocci. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 8. He has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggestive of ARDS. His serum creatinine is elevated at 7.8, and he is oliguric. The patient's blood pressure is stable off pressors, and his mixed venous oxygen saturation is elevated at 84%. He has a history of atrial fibrillation with aberrancy and was treated with diltiazem. The patient's current medications include meropenem, vancomycin, Lasix, hydralazine, clonazepam, glargine, clobetasol, clotrimazole, and heparin. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient's family was updated on his condition this morning.

   - Added vancomycin on [**11-10**] for GPC
   - Cefepime was added to meropenem and Vanc overnight as coverage for
   [**Month/Day (4) **]-resistant Pseudomonas (given + sputum cxrf from [**11-10**]).  Will dc
   cefepime for now, as Pseudomonas is likely contaminate.

   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p
   precedex, benzo use to help with anxiety while intubated).
   Significantly resolving.
   -Meropenem, vancomycin as above
   - Daily CXR
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   #Altered mental status:  Given patient
s prolonged intubation and
   sedation as well as ongoing infection, think pt
s MS is likely due to
   toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.   Will cont to monitor for 2-3 days
   (from [**11-12**]), and if no improvement can consider head CT, EEG
   monitoring and AMS w/u.
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick. Urine output increasing
   considerably over past few days.
   - F/u renal recs, holding on HD for now
   - Per renal recs, will give PRN Lasix to keep total daily UOP > 2L
   - pulled HD line yesterday ([**11-11**]) given positive blood cultures
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine patch 0.3
   - Cont Dilt and Metoprolol
   - Continue Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily.
   - Continue hydralazine 500mg Q6 hrs, can consider dc
ing and starting
   ACEI in [**12-4**] days when stable improved kidney fxn
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam (started on [**11-11**])
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars poorly controlled.
   - Glargine increased to 50 QD and continue ISS
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension for 2 days. Tachycardia resolved x 5 days
   as of [**11-12**].
   - Adenosine at bedside in case of SVT
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Continue metoprolol at 125mg tid
   - Increased amlodipine to 10mg daily.
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   Improved/stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Limit tylenol to 2 gm daily; changed standing Tylenol to PRN
   .
   FEN; no IVF, lytes prn, started tube feeds, speech & swallow and PT

   Disposition: call out to floor
","The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital after experiencing septic shock with Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and bacteremia. He has since developed several complications, including malignant hypertension, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, cardiac dysrhythmia, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient has been intubated but is currently off pressors since October 28th. His blood cultures have grown methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in the sputum and blood, as well as Gram-negative rods (GNR) in the blood. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been identified in the sputum.

The patient's treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics with meropenem, vancomycin, and cefepime. He is also receiving sedation and pain management, as well as antihypertensive medications. Daily chest X-rays and sputum cultures are being obtained to monitor his condition.

The patient's mental status is likely due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. If there is no improvement within the next 2-3 days, further evaluation with a head CT, EEG, and assessment of altered mental status will be considered.

His renal function remains impaired, with an elevated creatinine level of 7.8 mg/dL"

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic shock/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult, patient changed from nafcillin/meropenem/gent to:
   solely Meropenem (day 1 was [**2117-10-31**]).  Now on day 12. Will treat with
   14 total days Meropenem since first negative blood culture = course
   should be from [**11-5**] to [**11-19**].
   - s/p  removal of aline, HD line, TLC
   - Added vancomycin on [**11-10**] for GPC
   - F/u ID recs for: double coverage of ? pseudomonal PNA, also re: abx
   coverage for coag pos staph bacteremia, duration of therapy
   - get cultures daily  (until cultures negative x48 hours, per ID)
   - f/u daily CXR, sputum cxr, sensitivities, speciation
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p
   precedex, benzo use to help with anxiety while intubated).
   Significantly resolving.
   -Meropenem, vancomycin as above
   - Daily CXR
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   #Altered mental status:  Given patient
s prolonged intubation and
   sedation as well as ongoing infection, think pt
s MS is likely due to
   toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.   Will cont to monitor for 2-3 days
   (from [**11-12**]), and if no improvement can consider head CT, EEG
   monitoring and AMS w/u.
   .
   # ARF: Cr currently elevated at 7.8, currently oliguric, which will
   likely continue while he is so sick. Urine output increasing
   considerably over past few days.
   - F/u renal recs, holding on HD for now
   - Per renal recs, will give PRN Lasix to keep total daily UOP > 2L
   - pulled HD line yesterday ([**11-11**]) given positive blood cultures
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine patch 0.3
   - Cont Dilt and Metoprolol
   - Continue Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily.
   - Continue hydralazine 500mg Q6 hrs, can consider dc
ing and starting
   ACEI in [**12-4**] days when stable improved kidney fxn
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam (started on [**11-11**])
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars poorly controlled.
   - Glargine increased to 50 QD and continue ISS
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension for 2 days. Tachycardia resolved x 5 days
   as of [**11-12**].
   - Adenosine at bedside in case of SVT
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Continue metoprolol at 125mg tid
   - Increased amlodipine to 10mg daily.
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   Improved/stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Limit tylenol to 2 gm daily; changed standing Tylenol to PRN
   .
   FEN; no IVF, lytes prn, started tube feeds, speech & swallow and PT

","The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the ICU with septic shock, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, altered mental status, and hypertension. He has been on mechanical ventilation and has had multiple episodes of tachycardia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure of 160/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and has been on insulin therapy. His blood glucose levels have been poorly controlled, so his glargine dose has been increased. 

The patient's renal function is compromised, with an elevated creatinine level of 7.8 mg/dL. He has been oliguric but his urine output has been improving. 

His electrolyte levels show hypernatremia, with a sodium level of 150 mEq/L. 

The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, but his troponin levels are within normal range. 

His liver function tests show mild elevation, likely due to prolonged hypotension. 

The patient has a rash on his back, abdomen, and thighs, which appears consistent with a drug rash, possibly from vancomycin or cefepime. 

His chest X-ray shows persistent hazy infiltrates at the left base.

   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension for 2 days. Tachycardia resolved x 5 days
   as of [**11-12**].
   - Adenosine at bedside in case of SVT
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Continue metoprolol at 125mg tid
   - Increased amlodipine to 10mg daily.
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   Improved/stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Limit tylenol to 2 gm daily; changed standing Tylenol to PRN
   .

","The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented from the emergency department with septic shock secondary to Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. The patient has had multiple complications during his hospital course, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), altered mental status, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and an elevated troponin level. 

The patient's current condition is stable, but he remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He is receiving meropenem for his infections, including MSSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Vancomycin has been added for gram-positive cocci (GPC) coverage. 

The patient's renal function is improving, with an increase in urine output. However, his serum creatinine level remains elevated at 7.8 mg/dL. The healthcare team is monitoring his renal function closely and plans to reassess his medication dosing in relation to his renal function.

The patient's hypertension is being managed with a combination of clonidine patch, diltiazem, metoprolol, and amlodipine. His hyperglycemia is being treated with glargine insulin.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to prolonged intubation, sedation, and ongoing infection. The healthcare team is monitoring his mental status and will consider further evaluation with a head CT scan, EEG, and assessment for delirium if"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who is experiencing respiratory failure due to an infection caused by an Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including impaired balance, knowledge, muscle performance, transfers, hypertension, fever, pneumonia, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, cardiac dysrhythmia, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing with meropenem for ESBL klebs bacteremia/pneumonia, bipap for acute respiratory failure, vancomycin for GPC bacteremia (coag neg staph/cornynebacterium), and various medications to manage hypertension, tachycardia, and acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure leading to further ARDS or death, progression of sepsis and organ dysfunction, development of diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia due to poor glycemic control, worsening renal function, and potential cardiovascular events such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, blood glucose levels, renal function, and cardiac rhythm. Timely administration of appropriate antibiotics, strict glycemic control, fluid management, and supportive care are essential in managing this patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic shock/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult: should treat with 14 total days Meropenem since first
   negative blood culture = course should be from [**11-5**] to [**11-19**] (coag neg
   staph on [**11-9**] and [**11-10**] likely staph epi and a contaminant).
   - Meropenem re-dosed for pt
s improved renal function, also added
   vancomycin on [**11-10**] for GPC
   - s/p removal of aline, HD line, TLC
   - F/u ID recs
   - get cultures daily  (until cultures negative x48 hours, per ID)
   - daily CXR
   - f/u sputum cxr, sensitivities, speciation
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p
   precedex, benzo use to help with anxiety while intubated).
   Significantly resolving. Continues to have episodes of respiratory
   disress and requires frequent suctioning, nebs and respiratory toilet.
   -Meropenem, vancomycin as above
   - Daily CXR
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Frequent suctioning and CPT as tolerated
   .
   #Altered mental status:  Given patient
s prolonged intubation and
   sedation (>3 weeks) as well as ongoing infection, think pt
s MS is
   likely due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.   If no improvement can
   consider head CT, EEG monitoring and AMS w/u.
   - Monitor for now.
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially elevated at 7.8 and pt was oliguric, while patient
   was in septic shock. Urine output increasing considerably over past few
   days and pt
s GFR is likely normal at this point.
   - F/u renal recs, no HD and HD line removed
   - Per renal recs, will give PRN Lasix to keep total daily UOP > 2L
   .
   # Hypernatremia
   -          improved with 1/2D5 at 240 ml/hr overnight but then worsened
   after lasix given for resp distress
   -          - will add free H20 flushes
   -          Re check electrolytes this pm
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine patch 0.3
   - Cont Dilt and Metoprolol
   - Continue Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily.
   - Continue hydralazine 500mg Q6 hrs, can consider decreasing when ACEI
   uptitrated.
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam (started on [**11-11**])
   - star lisinopril and titrate to effect
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars poorly controlled but pt on D5 for hypernatremia
   yesterday.
   - Glargine 50 QD and continue ISS, will readdress in AM
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension for 2 days. Tachycardia resolved x 5
   7 days as of [**11-14**].
   - Adenosine at bedside in case of SVT
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Continue metoprolol at 125mg tid
   - Increased amlodipine to 10mg daily.
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   Improved/stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Limit tylenol to 2 gm daily; changed standing Tylenol to PRN
   .
   FEN; Lytes prn, tube feeds, speech & swallow and PT consults, HD per
   renal
 holding for now given improved renal fxn. Calculate free water
   deficit given hypernatremia
 give D5W at 120cc/hr x1L, check pm lytes
   and urine lytes (hyperna could be contributing to AMS).

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes who presented to the hospital with septic shock and pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative rods. The patient's condition has been complicated by acute respiratory failure (ARF), altered mental status, renal failure, hypertension, and tachycardia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with non-invasive ventilation support. He is receiving multiple antibiotics, including meropenem, vancomycin, and cefepime, as well as other medications for his various conditions. The patient's laboratory results show elevated mixed venous oxygen saturation, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, consistent with ARDS. The patient's current medical issues include septic shock/pneumonia, hypoxic respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. nosocomial infection
3. worsening ARDS
4. sepsis
5. multi-organ failure
6. deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)
7. ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)
8. medication-induced side effects or allergic reactions
9. worsening hypernatremia or hyponatremia
10. uncontrolled hypertension"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the ICU after experiencing septic shock with Staphylococcus pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient has been intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation but is now off pressors. He also has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), altered mental status, acute kidney injury (AKI), hypernatremia, hypertension, and a history of atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with septic shock due to Staphylococcus pneumonia and bacteremia. Although the patient's condition has improved with appropriate antibiotic therapy, there is still a risk of ongoing infection and potential complications such as multi-drug resistant organism (MDRO) infection or septic shock recurrence.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS may progress or worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise and potential need for increased ventilatory support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. AKI: The patient's AKI may persist or progress, requiring ongoing renal support and potentially delaying weaning from mechanical ventilation.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia should be closely monitored and managed to prevent neurological complications.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be controlled to prevent end-organ damage and ensure adequate perfusion.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented with respiratory failure due to an ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU and has been on non-invasive ventilation since November 11th. The patient had an episode of respiratory distress/hypoxemia that resolved with nebulized bronchodilators and repositioning. A chest X-ray showed mainstem mucous plugging, which was addressed and repeated X-rays were planned. 

The patient has multiple medical issues including hypernatremia, dyspnea, impaired balance, impaired knowledge, impaired muscle performance, hypertension, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, and acute renal failure. The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated but are being managed with D5W (5% dextrose in water). 

The patient is still experiencing poor mental status, which may be due to ongoing ICU delirium. His renal function is improving, and he is being treated for ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia/pneumonia with meropenem. He also has GPC bacteremia being treated with vancomycin. 

The patient's hypertension is being managed with multiple antihypertensive medications, including diltiazem, metoprolol, clonidine, and enalapril. Additionally, he is being given prn hydralazine for further control of his blood pressure.

   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic shock/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult: should treat with 14 total days Meropenem since first
   negative blood culture = course should be from [**11-5**] to [**11-19**] (coag neg
   staph on [**11-9**] and [**11-10**] likely staph epi and a contaminant).
   - Meropenem re-dosed for pt
s improved renal function, also added
   vancomycin on [**11-10**] for GPC
   - s/p removal of aline, HD line, TLC
   - F/u ID recs
   - get cultures daily  (until cultures negative x48 hours, per ID)
   - daily CXR
   - f/u sputum cxr, sensitivities, speciation
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p
   precedex, benzo use to help with anxiety while intubated).
   Significantly resolving. Continues to have episodes of respiratory
   disress and requires frequent suctioning, nebs and respiratory toilet.
   -Meropenem, vancomycin as above
   - Daily CXR
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Frequent suctioning and CPT as tolerated
   .
   #Altered mental status:  Given patient
s prolonged intubation and
   sedation (>3 weeks) as well as ongoing infection, think pt
s MS is
   likely due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.   If no improvement can
   consider head CT, EEG monitoring and AMS w/u.
   - Monitor for now.
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially elevated at 7.8 and pt was oliguric, while patient
   was in septic shock. Urine output increasing considerably over past few
   days and pt
s GFR is likely normal at this point.
   - F/u renal recs, no HD and HD line removed
   - Per renal recs, will give PRN Lasix to keep total daily UOP > 2L
   .
   # Hypernatremia
   - improved with 1/2D5 at 240 ml/hr overnight but then worsened after
   lasix given for resp distress
   - Increased free H20 flushes to 300cc q4h
   - Re check electrolytes this pm
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine patch 0.3
   - Cont Dilt and Metoprolol
   - Continue Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily.
   - Continue hydralazine 500mg Q6 hrs, can consider decreasing when ACEI
   uptitrated.
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam (started on [**11-11**])
   - star lisinopril and titrate to effect

   # DM: Blood sugars poorly controlled but pt on D5 for hypernatremia
   yesterday.
   - Glargine 50 QD and continue ISS, will readdress in AM

   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension for 2 days. Tachycardia resolved x 5
   7 days as of [**11-14**].
   - Adenosine at bedside in case of SVT

   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital with septic shock secondary to Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. He has been in the ICU for several weeks and has developed multiple complications.

1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, leading to hypernatremia. This could be due to inadequate water intake or excessive water loss. The patient's daily fluid intake needs to be assessed, and measures should be taken to increase free water administration.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and requires high levels of oxygen, suggesting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to ongoing episodes of respiratory distress. Frequent suctioning, nebulizer treatments, and respiratory toilet are necessary.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's prolonged intubation and sedation, along with ongoing infection, may have contributed to his altered mental status. It is important to monitor the patient closely, and if there is no improvement, further evaluation with head CT, EEG monitoring, and assessment of the airway may be necessary.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient initially had elevated creatinine levels and was oliguric. However, urine output has improved, and the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is likely normal now. Renal recommendations include maintaining a daily urine output of more than 2 liters and avoiding"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented to the hospital after experiencing septic shock with Staphylococcus aureus (Staph) pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient's condition was complicated by acute renal failure (ARF) and tachycardia. He remains intubated but is off pressors since October 28th.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Septic shock/Pneumonia: The patient was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime empirically due to MSSA in the sputum and blood. Subsequently, meropenem was added for GNR in the blood. The patient's status improved with this broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and requires high levels of oxygen, suggesting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was extubated on November 10th but continues to experience episodes of respiratory distress and requires frequent suctioning, nebulizers, and respiratory toilet.

3. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient's prolonged intubation and sedation (>3 weeks) along with ongoing infection are likely contributing to his altered mental status. Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy is suspected, and if no improvement, further evaluation such as head CT, EEG monitoring, and assessment of ammonia levels may be considered.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's initial elevated creatinine level improved with increased urine output and likely normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Renal function is currently stable, and the patient is advised to maintain a daily urine output of more than 2 liters.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, possibly due to dehydration. Free water flushes have been increased, and D5W is being administered to correct this electrolyte imbalance.

6. Hypertension: The patient has persistent hypertension despite antihypertensive medications. Clonidine patch, diltiazem, metoprolol, and amlodipine have been prescribed. Lisinopril has also been started and titrated to effect.

7. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient's blood sugars have been poorly controlled, but this could be attributed to recent interventions. Insulin therapy has been initiated.

8. Tachycardia/Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has experienced episodes of tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. Adenosine has been used to manage SVT, and diltiazem has been prescribed for rate control.

9. Rash: The patient developed a drug rash, possibly due to cefepime, which has been discontinued. Topical creams have been applied to the affected areas.

10. Elevated Troponin: The patient's troponin levels were elevated, indicating possible myocardial ischemia. However, cardiac enzymes are no longer trending, and ACS treatment has been discontinued.

11. Mild LFT Elevation: The patient's liver function tests were mildly elevated but have improved and stabilized.

In summary, the patient's medical complications include septic shock/pneumonia, hypoxic respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tachycardia/atrial fibrillation, rash, elevated troponin,"

   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic shock/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**], growing
   Pseudomonas and Klebsiella.  s/p removal of aline, HD line, TLC
   - Per ID consult: should treat with 14 total days Meropenem since first
   negative blood culture = course should be from [**11-5**] to [**11-19**] (coag neg
   staph on [**11-9**] and [**11-10**] likely staph epi and a contaminant).
   - Meropenem re-dosed for pt
s improved renal function, also added
   vancomycin on [**11-10**] for GPC
   - F/u ID recs
   - daily CXR
   - d/c daily  cultures given negative x48 hours, per ID
   - f/u sputum cxr, sensitivities, speciation
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p
   precedex, benzo use to help with anxiety while intubated).
   Significantly resolving. Continues to have episodes of respiratory
   disress and requires frequent suctioning, nebs and respiratory toilet.
   -Meropenem, vancomycin as above
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - NAC nebs x1 day to help prevent mucus plugging
   - Frequent suctioning and CPT as tolerated
   .
   #Altered mental status:  Given patient
s prolonged intubation and
   sedation (>3 weeks) as well as ongoing infection, think pt
s MS is
   likely due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.   If no improvement can
   consider head CT, EEG monitoring and AMS w/u.
   - Monitor for now.
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially elevated at 7.8 and pt was oliguric, while patient
   was in septic shock. Urine output increasing considerably over past few
   days and pt
s GFR is likely normal at this point.
   - F/u renal recs, no HD and HD line removed
   - Per renal recs, will give PRN Lasix to keep total daily UOP > 2L
   .
   # Hypernatremia/Volume Status:  Improved with 1/2D5 at 240 ml/hr
   overnight but then worsened after lasix given for resp distress.
   - D5W x2L
   - Increased free H20 flushes to 300cc q4h PM of [**11-14**]; continue
   - f/u Renal recs
   - Assess I/O and use Lasix for diuresis if necessary in PM
   - Re check electrolytes this pm
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine patch 0.3
   - Cont Dilt and Metoprolol
   - Continue Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily.
   - Continue hydralazine 500mg Q6 hrs, can consider decreasing when ACEI
   uptitrated.
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam (started on [**11-11**])
   - star lisinopril and titrate to effect
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars poorly controlled but pt on D5 for hypernatremia
   yesterday.
   - Glargine 50 QD and continue ISS, increase SSI for sugars in 200
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension for 2 days. Tachycardia resolved x 5
   7 days as of [**11-14**].
   - Adenosine at bedside in case of SVT
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Continue metoprolol at 125mg tid
   - Increased amlodipine to 10mg daily.
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   Improved/stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the hospital with septic shock and pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. He was intubated and received broad-spectrum antibiotics, which improved his condition. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation but is now off pressors. He has had episodes of respiratory distress and requires frequent suctioning and nebulizer treatments. His mental status is altered likely due to prolonged intubation and sedation.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypernatremia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute kidney injury, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and an elevated troponin level. He has also experienced tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. A drug rash was initially observed but has improved.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be managed. D5W should be given at 120cc/hr x1L, and electrolytes should be checked.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires ongoing respiratory support with frequent suctioning and nebulizer treatments. Weaning of FiO2 and PEEP is recommended.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's prolonged intubation and sedation may be contributing to his altered mental status. Monitoring and further evaluation are necessary.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's renal function has improved, but close monitoring and follow"

   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic shock/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**].
   - Per ID consult: should treat with 14 total days Meropenem since first
   negative blood culture = course should be from [**11-5**] to [**11-19**] (coag neg
   staph on [**11-9**] and [**11-10**] likely staph epi and a contaminant).
   - Meropenem re-dosed for pt
s improved renal function, also added
   vancomycin on [**11-10**] for GPC
   - s/p removal of aline, HD line, TLC
   - F/u ID recs
   - daily CXR
   - d/c daily  cultures given negative x48 hours, per ID
   - f/u sputum cxr, sensitivities, speciation
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p
   precedex, benzo use to help with anxiety while intubated).
   Significantly resolving. Continues to have episodes of respiratory
   disress and requires frequent suctioning, nebs and respiratory toilet.
   -Meropenem, vancomycin as above
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - NAC nebs x1 day to help prevent mucus plugging
   - Frequent suctioning and CPT as tolerated
   .
   #Altered mental status:  Given patient
s prolonged intubation and
   sedation (>3 weeks) as well as ongoing infection, think pt
s MS is
   likely due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.   If no improvement can
   consider head CT, EEG monitoring and AMS w/u.
   - Monitor for now.
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially elevated at 7.8 and pt was oliguric, while patient
   was in septic shock. Urine output increasing considerably over past few
   days and pt
s GFR is likely normal at this point.
   - F/u renal recs, no HD and HD line removed
   - Per renal recs, will give PRN Lasix to keep total daily UOP > 2L
   .
   # Hypernatremia
   - improved with 1/2D5 at 240 ml/hr overnight but then worsened after
   lasix given for resp distress
   - Increased free H20 flushes to 300cc q4h
   - Re check electrolytes this pm
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine patch 0.3
   - Cont Dilt and Metoprolol
   - Continue Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily.
   - Continue hydralazine 500mg Q6 hrs, can consider decreasing when ACEI
   uptitrated.
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam (started on [**11-11**])
   - star lisinopril and titrate to effect
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars poorly controlled but pt on D5 for hypernatremia
   yesterday.
   - Glargine 50 QD and continue ISS, will readdress in AM
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension for 2 days. Tachycardia resolved x 5
   7 days as of [**11-14**].
   - Adenosine at bedside in case of SVT
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Continue metoprolol at 125mg tid
   - Increased amlodipine to 10mg daily.
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   Improved/stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Limit tylenol to 2 gm daily; changed standing Tylenol to PRN
   .
   FEN; Lytes prn, tube feeds, speech & swallow and PT consults, HD per
   renal
 holding for now given improved renal fxn. Calculate free water
   deficit given hypernatremia
 give D5W at 120cc/hr x1L, check pm lytes
   and urine lytes (hyperna could be contributing to AMS).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented to the ICU after experiencing septic shock with Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and bacteremia. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation but was successfully extubated on [**11-10**]. The patient has a history of altered mental status, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), hypernatremia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. He also had episodes of tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and a drug rash. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 135/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on high-flow nasal cannula, and a sinus rhythm. The patient's physical examination reveals obesity with soft abdomen and no edema. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate levels, as well as elevated troponin and liver enzymes. Imaging studies show diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray and widened mediastinum. The patient's medical team has initiated appropriate antibiotic therapy and continues to manage his multiple comorbidities and complications.

   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic shock/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**], growing
   Pseudomonas and Klebsiella.  s/p removal of aline, HD line, TLC
   - Per ID consult: should treat with 14 total days Meropenem since first
   negative blood culture = course should be from [**11-5**] to [**11-19**] (coag neg
   staph on [**11-9**] and [**11-10**] likely staph epi and a contaminant).
   - Meropenem re-dosed for pt
s improved renal function
   - Continue vancomycin, started on [**11-10**] for GPC, 7 day course, d/c [**11-16**]
   - F/u ID recs
   - hold on daily CXR given continued improvement
   - d/c daily  cultures given negative x48 hours, per ID
   - f/u sputum cxr, sensitivities, speciation
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p
   precedex, benzo use to help with anxiety while intubated).

   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), GNR in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic shock/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**], growing
   Pseudomonas and Klebsiella.  s/p removal of aline, HD line, TLC
   - Per ID consult: should treat with 14 total days Meropenem since first
   negative blood culture = course should be from [**11-5**] to [**11-19**] (coag neg
   staph on [**11-9**] and [**11-10**] likely staph epi and a contaminant).

   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p

The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented to the ICU after experiencing septic shock and pneumonia. The patient remains intubated but is off pressors since October 28th. He has a history of ARF (acute renal failure), hypertension, hypoxic respiratory failure, altered mental status, and hypernatremia. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 122/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on high-flow nasal cannula. 

The patient's recent lab results show normal WBC count, Hct, and Plt levels. However, his Cr levels were initially elevated at 7.8 but have since improved. His glucose levels are poorly controlled, but he is currently receiving insulin therapy. Other notable lab results include elevated TCO2, CK, Troponin-T, ALT/AST, and LDH levels, with decreased Albumin, Ca++, and PO4 levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old man with diabetes mellitus who is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to an infection caused by ESBL Klebsiella. He has been admitted to the ICU and is being treated with antibiotics and aggressive pulmonary toilet. The patient also has bacteremia from GPC and is receiving vancomycin treatment. He has shown some improvement in muscle strength and mental status but still exhibits weakness, impaired skin integrity, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. The patient is on multiple medications for hypertension and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The presence of ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia and bacteremia increases the risk of secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications like hypertensive crisis or end-organ damage.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels indicate uncontrolled diabetes, which may increase the risk of diabetic complications and poor wound healing.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity could lead to pressure ulcers or infections if not addressed properly.
6. ICU Myopathy: The patient's weakness and impaired muscle performance suggest the possibility of ICU-acquired myopathy"

   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), Klebsiella in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic shock/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**], growing
   Pseudomonas and Klebsiella.  s/p removal of A.line, HD line, TLC
   - On meropenem; per ID consult: should treat with 14 total days
   Meropenem since first negative blood culture = course should be from
   [**11-5**] to [**11-19**] (coag neg staph on [**11-9**] and [**11-10**] likely staph epi and a
   contaminant).
   - Completed 7 day course of vancomycin on [**11-16**]
   - F/u ID recs
   - CXR tomorrow (Qod CXRs)
   - f/u sputum cxr, sensitivities, speciation
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p
   precedex, benzo use to help with anxiety while intubated).
   Significantly resolving. Continues to have episodes of respiratory
   disress and requires frequent suctioning, nebs and respiratory toilet.
   NAC nebs x1 day to help prevent mucus plugging.
   -Meropenem as above
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
 doing well on 2L NC
   - Frequent suctioning and CPT as tolerated
   .
   # Volume Status: Monitoring hypernatremia. No D5 yesterday.
   - Cont free water flushes 200cc q4h
   - Consider U lytes if hyponatremia worsens, though likely [**1-4**] volume
   overload
   - Per renal recs, will give PRN Lasix to keep total daily UOP > 2L; f/u
   Renal recs
   - Assess I/O and use Lasix for diuresis if necessary in PM
   - Re check electrolytes this pm
   .
   # Hypertension
 currently overly well-controlled. Will discontinue
   Dilt.
   - Hydralazine and clonidine patch discontinued yesterday.
   - Continue Lisinopril 10mg Qday, Metop 150 TID
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars better controlled with CBGs 120-150s
   - Glargine 50 QD and continue ISS,
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   #Altered mental status:  Given patient
s prolonged intubation and
   sedation (>3 weeks) as well as ongoing infection, think pt
s AMS was
   likely due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.   If no improvement or
   worsening of encephalopathy, can consider head CT, EEG monitoring and
   LP.
   - Overall, much improved today ([**11-17**]), and pt is oriented,
   interactive, verbal, appropriate.
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially elevated at 7.8 and pt was oliguric, while patient

   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension for 2 days. Tachycardia resolved x 5
   7 days as of [**11-14**].

","The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented from outside the hospital with septic shock and Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. The patient's course has been complicated by acute renal failure and tachycardia, and he remains intubated but off pressors since October 28th. Cultures have grown MSSA in the sputum and blood, as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae in the blood. The patient was treated empirically with vancomycin and cefepime, and then later switched to meropenem based on the sensitivity results. The patient's current medications include meropenem, lisinopril, metoprolol, glargine, and ISS. The patient is also on prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin and a proton pump inhibitor.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 125/76 mmHg to 140/85 mmHg, a heart rate of 72 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula, and a temperature of 36.4°C. The patient's physical examination reveals fairly clear to bilaterally auscultated lungs, trace edema bilaterally in the lower extremities, and 2+ pitting edema bilaterally in the hands.

   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), Klebsiella in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic shock/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**], growing
   Pseudomonas and Klebsiella.  s/p removal of aline, HD line, TLC
   - On meropenem
   - Per ID consult: should treat with 14 total days Meropenem since first
   negative blood culture = course should be from [**11-5**] to [**11-19**] (coag neg
   staph on [**11-9**] and [**11-10**] likely staph epi and a contaminant).
   - Completed 7 day course of vancomycin on [**11-16**]
   - F/u ID recs
   - hold on daily CXR given continued improvement (Qod CXRs)
   - f/u sputum cxr, sensitivities, speciation
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p
   precedex, benzo use to help with anxiety while intubated).
   Significantly resolving. Continues to have episodes of respiratory
   disress and requires frequent suctioning, nebs and respiratory toilet.
   NAC nebs x1 day to help prevent mucus plugging.
   -Meropenem as above
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Frequent suctioning and CPT as tolerated
   .
   # Volume Status: Monitoring hypernatremia. No D5  yesterday.
   - Cont free water flushes 200cc q4h
   - Consider U lytes if hyponatremia worsens, though likely [**1-4**] volume
   overload
   - Per renal recs, will give PRN Lasix to keep total daily UOP > 2L; f/u
   Renal recs
   - Assess I/O and use Lasix for diuresis if necessary in PM
   - Re check electrolytes this pm
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Hydralazine and clonidine patch discontinued
   - Lisinopril 10mg Qday, Dilt 30 QID, Metop 150 TID
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam PRN anxiety (started on [**11-11**])
   - Consider initiating Celexa 20mg daily for anxiety with goal of
   d/c
ing Clonazepam once SSRI becomes effective
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars poorly controlled but pt on D5 for hypernatremia
   yesterday.
   - Glargine 50 QD and continue ISS, increase SSI for sugars in 200
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   #Altered mental status:  Given patient
s prolonged intubation and
   sedation (>3 weeks) as well as ongoing infection, think pt
s MS is
   likely due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.   If no improvement can
   consider head CT, EEG monitoring and AMS w/u.
   - Monitor for now.
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially elevated at 7.8 and pt was oliguric, while patient
   was in septic shock. Urine output increasing considerably over past few
   days and pt
s GFR is likely normal at this point.  Resolved Cr, HD line
   removed.

   37 y/o with DM presents from OSH after presenting in septic shock with
   Staph PNA / bacteria with a course complicated by ARF and tachycardia,
   currently remains intubated but off pressors since [**2117-10-28**]. Staph in
   blood/sputum (OSH), Klebsiella in blood, klebsiella and pseudomonas in
   sputum.  Has gone into SVT (wide complex) in the past, resolved with
   adenosine.
   .
   # Septic shock/Pneumonia: BP stable off pressors. Culture data positive
   for MSSA in the sputum and blood early in OSH course.  CT scan with L >
   R infiltrates, but no sign of empyema. We broadened antibiotics
   empirically with vanc and cefepime with improvement in the patient
   status.  CT scan did show fluid in sinuses and multi-focal pneumonia
   but no other clear source.  Treated for flu although DFA neg x 2 in
   OSH, with another negative DFA here we stopped Tamiflu.  Elevated mixed
   venous Sat elevated at 84% and mottled appearance most suggestive of
   septic etiology. CVP at 15, hypovolemia unlikely. Robust BP despite
   tachycardia, high mixed venous, and preserved EF on OSH ECHO suggests
   against cardiogenic shock. Given negative urine legionalla and
   prolonged QTc at times, we have avoided using a fluoroquinolone.
   Currently, we are treating for the MSSA found on blood/sputum from OSH,
   Klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas in the sputum from [**Hospital1 19**], GNR in
   blood and radiographic evidence of PNA.  TTE normal, no signs of
   vegetations.  Gram negative rods in blood culture from [**11-1**], growing
   Pseudomonas and Klebsiella.  s/p removal of A.line, HD line, TLC
   - On meropenem; per ID consult: should treat with 14 total days
   Meropenem since first negative blood culture = course should be from
   [**11-5**] to [**11-19**] (coag neg staph on [**11-9**] and [**11-10**] likely staph epi and a
   contaminant).
   - Completed 7 day course of vancomycin on [**11-16**]
   - F/u ID recs
   - hold on daily CXR given continued improvement (Qod CXRs)
   - f/u sputum cxr, sensitivities, speciation
   - prn Tylenol for fevers
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp failure: Bilateral infiltrates on CXR and high oxygen
   requirement suggestive of ARDS.  Did not have any weaning of his vent
   setting yesterday, other than decreased RR to counteract alkalosis.
   Weaned FiO2 to 40% and now with PEEP of 8.  Extubated on [**11-10**] (s/p
   precedex, benzo use to help with anxiety while intubated).
   Significantly resolving. Continues to have episodes of respiratory
   disress and requires frequent suctioning, nebs and respiratory toilet.
   NAC nebs x1 day to help prevent mucus plugging.
   -Meropenem as above
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Frequent suctioning and CPT as tolerated
   .
   # Volume Status: Monitoring hypernatremia. No D5 yesterday.
   - Cont free water flushes 200cc q4h
   - Consider U lytes if hyponatremia worsens, though likely [**1-4**] volume
   overload
   - Per renal recs, will give PRN Lasix to keep total daily UOP > 2L; f/u
   Renal recs
   - Assess I/O and use Lasix for diuresis if necessary in PM
   - Re check electrolytes this pm
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Hydralazine and clonidine patch discontinued
   - Lisinopril 10mg Qday, Dilt 30 QID, Metop 150 TID
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam PRN anxiety (started on [**11-11**])
   - Consider initiating Celexa 20mg daily for anxiety with goal of
   d/c
ing Clonazepam once SSRI becomes effective
   .
   # DM: Blood sugars poorly controlled but pt on D5 for hypernatremia
   yesterday.
   - Glargine 50 QD and continue ISS, increase SSI for sugars in 200
   .
   OTHER STABLE ISSUES
   .
   #Altered mental status:  Given patient
s prolonged intubation and
   sedation (>3 weeks) as well as ongoing infection, think pt
s MS is
   likely due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.   If no improvement can
   consider head CT, EEG monitoring and AMS w/u.
   - Monitor for now.
   .
   # ARF: Cr initially elevated at 7.8 and pt was oliguric, while patient
   was in septic shock. Urine output increasing considerably over past few
   days and pt
s GFR is likely normal at this point.  Resolved Cr, HD line
   removed.
   - F/u renal recs
   - Per renal recs, will give PRN Lasix to keep total daily UOP > 2L
   .
   # Tachycardia/ AFib: appeared sinus on arrival, then through his course
   had couple runs of tachycardia that appeared to be Afib with aberrancy
   that were self-limited and well-tolerated.   OSH EKG with RBBB as
   recently as [**10-26**], and reports of atrial fibrillation requiring
   treatment with diltiazem.  Several days ago, went into AFib w/ RVR
   during dialysis.  Treated w/ lopressor 10, dilt 20 IV and dilt PO60.
   Converted back to sinus after 1-2 hours. Atrial irritation believed due
   to IJ that was too deep, now pulled back.  Cause of aberrant SVT during
   second HD session likely due to intracellular shifts, although cause
   not clear.   24 hour amiodarone has completed. Patient with persistent
   tachycardia and hypertension for 2 days. Tachycardia resolved x 5
   7 days as of [**11-14**].
   - Adenosine at bedside in case of SVT
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg qid
   - Continue metoprolol at 150 tid
   - anxiety component of tachy/HTN seems apparent, start 1mg [**Hospital1 **]
   clonazepam
   - Watch hemodynamics and rhythm; on telemetry
   .
   # Rash on back, abdomen, thighs: appears consistent with a drug rash,
   could be Vanc or Cefepime, but statistically Cefepime would be more
   likely. Discontinued vanc/cefepime on [**10-31**]; now on meropenem. Improved
   clinically, less erythematous.
   - Monitor
   - Clobetasol [**Hospital1 **] 0.05% for abdomen
   - Clotrimazole/hydro groin cream for rash
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: CK elevated, CKMB flat. most likely demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and persistent tachycardia vs elevated [**1-4**]
   renal failure. ACS given age unlikely, d/c ACS treatment including ASA,
   heparin gtt, plavix. No longer trending cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Mild LFT elevation: likely [**1-4**] prolonged hypotension.
   Improved/stable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Limit tylenol to 2 gm daily; changed standing Tylenol to PRN
   .
   FEN; Lytes prn, tube feeds, speech & swallow and PT consults, pt failed

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by an infection with ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient has been receiving intravenous antibiotics and aggressive pulmonary toilet to address the respiratory failure. He also has hypernatremia, dyspnea, impaired muscle performance, hypertension, pneumonia, hyperglycemia, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is already suffering from a severe infection caused by ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia. There is a risk of further complications or spread of the infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying cause is not adequately treated.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has high blood sugar levels, which can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
4. Hypertension: The patient has malignant hypertension, which can lead to complications like stroke, heart attack, or organ damage if not properly managed.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores.
6. Muscle Weakness: The patient is experiencing impaired muscle performance, which can affect his mobility and increase the risk of muscle atrophy and weakness.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels in the blood, which can cause dehydration and"
