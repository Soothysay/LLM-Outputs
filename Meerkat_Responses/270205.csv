","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type 1, diastolic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and a history of tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction. She presents with dyspnea and was admitted from home.

The patient experienced several events during her stay in the ICU:

1. At 11:30 PM on [2191-6-11], an EKG was performed.
2. At 1:03 AM on [2191-6-12], a multi-lumen was started.
3. At 1:30 AM on [2191-6-12], blood cultures were obtained.

The patient had difficulty maintaining intravenous access, and femoral access was eventually obtained. She also experienced nausea and vomiting, which were difficult to control. Medications given included Zofran, Reglan, and Ativan.

At around 9:00 PM, the patient became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s. The patient had refused all oral medications, and no anti-hypertensives had been given except for nitroglycerin, which had been off for about two hours after the loss of access. The patient's blood pressure improved after receiving 2.5 liters of fluid and levofed. Olanzapine may have contributed to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with multiple medical complications including morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type 1, diastolic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and a history of tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction. She presents with dyspnea and is currently in the ICU.

The patient has experienced several events over the past 24 hours. At 11:30 PM on [**2191-6-11**], an EKG was performed. At 1:03 AM on [**2191-6-12**], multi-lumen access was started, and blood cultures were collected at 1:30 AM.

The patient was given lasix 80 IV twice and had good diuresis, but then became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s. The patient had refused all oral medications since [**3-14**] and had nausea and vomiting twice, which were difficult to control. She was given zofran, reglan, ativan, and zydis (olanzapine SL) to manage these symptoms.

At approximately 9 PM, the patient's blood pressure improved after receiving 2.5 L of fluids and levofed. It is possible that olanzapine may have contributed to the improvement in blood pressure.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 54-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, and a history of tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction.
- She presented with dyspnea and was admitted from home.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/58 mmHg to 157/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- She has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, which has been difficult to control.
- The patient has tenuous IV access and eventually obtained femoral access due to the inability to obtain subclavian or internal jugular access.
- She received Lasix 80 IV twice and diuresed well.
- At around 9 pm, the patient became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s. This was possibly related to olanzapine for nausea and vomiting. Her blood pressure improved after receiving 2.5 L of fluids and levofed.
- The patient's low blood glucose level of 42 was corrected with an amp of D50.
- She has allergies to vancomycin, iod"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old obese male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of nausea and vomiting. The patient's medical history is significant for multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. 

During the 24-hour period, the patient experienced several events. At 11:30 PM on [**2191-6-11**], an EKG was performed. At 1:03 AM on [**2191-6-12**], a multi-lumen central line was started. Blood cultures were also drawn at 1:30 AM. 

The patient had tenuous IV access and eventually obtained femoral access after being unable to get subclavian and internal jugular access. The patient continued to have difficulty controlling nausea and vomiting and was given various medications including zofran, reglan, ativan, and zydis (olanzapine SL). 

At around 9 PM, the patient became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s. The patient had refused all oral medications on [**3-14**] due to nausea, and no anti-hypertensives had been given except for nitroglycerin, which had been off for approximately two hours after losing access. The patient's blood pressure improved after receiving 2.5 liters of fluid and levofed, possibly related to olanzapine for nausea.

   I have reviewed the above progress note on [**2191-6-12**] at 11:22 PM by
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3458**] and have reviewed the history with the patient, and was
   present during the physical examination noted above.  I concur with the
   assessment and treatment plan as outline above.   Mrs. [**Known lastname 3007**]
   presented with severe dyspnea due to acute on chronic left ventricular
   diastolic heart failure.  She also has a history of sarcoidosis,
   pulmonary hypertension, and Type I diabetes with gastroparesis.  She
   was diuresed aggressively over the past 24 hours but developed
   hypotension to 60 systolic yesterday likely med related complicated by
   rapid diuresis.  She responded to IVF and a brief course of levophed
   was given.  Currently, she is still dyspneic but her nausea is
   improved.  Our plan is outlined above and involves continued treatment
   of her diastolic heart failure and gentle diuresis.  We will assess in
   the morning the need for a right heart catheterization to assess her
   left and right heart filling pressures and pulmonary hypertension.
   This plan was communicated with the patient and all questions were
   addressed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type 1, diastolic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and sarcoidosis status post tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction. She presents with dyspnea and is experiencing multiple medical complications.

The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology, most likely due to overdiuresis and poor oral intake/nausea/vomiting combined with medications. Cardiogenic shock is less likely given the unchanged EKG, normal left ventricular function on bedside echo, no evidence of tamponade/new cardiac events, and negative cardiac markers. She does not appear septic as she is afebrile despite mild leukocytosis, dirty urinalysis appears chronic, and dirty sputum culture appears chronic.

The patient's dyspnea/diastolic heart failure is felt to be multifactorial, including diastolic CHF, reactive airways, and pulmonary hypertension. Her current presentation and chest X-ray seem consistent with CHF exacerbation likely related to hypertension and under-diuresis given progressive lower extremity edema. She will be monitored for fever curve, cardiac index, and right heart catheterization versus indwelling Swan-Ganz catheter. Diuresis goal is -1L/day with Lasix 20 IV to start, uptitrate ACE and beta-blocker for afterload"

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type 1, diastolic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and sarcoidosis who presented with dyspnea. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be due to overdiuresis, poor oral intake, and certain medications. This condition needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.

2. Diastolic heart failure: The patient's dyspnea is believed to be caused by diastolic heart failure, along with reactive airways and pulmonary hypertension. Close monitoring and management of her cardiac function is necessary.

3. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). It is important to continue managing her risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle, taking prescribed medications like aspirin, beta-blockers, and statins.

4. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting, which may be related to gastroparesis. Management includes the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and promoting gastric motility.

5. Asthma: The patient's asthma diagnosis is unclear, but her FEV1/FVC ratio is preserved. It is recommended to continue"

Ms. [Known Lastname 3007] is a 54-year-old woman with morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type 1, diastolic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and a history of tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction. She presents with dyspnea from home. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/57 mmHg to 137/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on aerosol-cool 35% tracheal collar. 

The patient has been on several medications including lopressor, lasix, heparin, lorazepam, and lantus. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for occasional wheezing and cough. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,065 mL with outputs totaling 2,245 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,180 mL. 

The patient has been on respiratory support with an aerosol-cool 35% tracheal collar and has an SpO2 of 100%. 

Physical examination reveals an obese, tachypneic patient with regular rhythm, distant heart sounds, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi, 2+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type 1, diastolic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and a history of tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction. She presents with dyspnea from home and has a medical history of numerous complications including coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting, gastroparesis, asthma, and type 1 diabetes with various complications. The patient's current presentation suggests an exacerbation of congestive heart failure likely related to hypertension and under-diuresis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be due to overdiuresis and poor oral intake/nausea/vomiting combined with medications. It is important to monitor her blood pressure closely and adjust diuretic dosage accordingly.
2. Dyspnea/Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's dyspnea can be attributed to diastolic congestive heart failure, reactive airways, and pulmonary hypertension. Management should focus on optimizing diuretic therapy based on right heart catheterization results, uptitration of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers for afterload reduction, and continued use of inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids for reversible airway obstruction.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient had a previous coronary artery bypass grafting procedure with all grafts widely patent. It is crucial to continue aspir"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type 1, diastolic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and a history of tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction. She presents with dyspnea and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has multiple complications related to her diabetes, including coronary artery disease that required CABG surgery, gastroparesis, asthma, and neuropathy. She also has a history of nephropathy and retinopathy. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, dyspnea, diastolic heart failure, and abdominal pain. She is currently on several medications including lantus, levothyroxine, losartan, metoprolol, aspirin, and statins.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation: The patient's presentation and chest X-ray suggest an exacerbation of diastolic heart failure, which can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and respiratory distress.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate poor perfusion and organ hypoxia. This can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's history of pulmonary hypertension increases the risk of right heart strain and failure due to increased afterload.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's obesity, tracheostomy, and gastroparesis increase the"

   gastroparesis.  Although she was diuresed approximately 1 L fluid over
   the past 24 hours, she has remained significantly dyspnea.   In order
   to better follow her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and pulmonary
   artery pressures to guide her diuresis, a pulmonary artery catheter was
   placed an showed a PA pressure 110/50 and a PCWP = 45 mmHg, indicating
   that much more diuresis was needed.  Accordingly, we have implemented a
   furosemide infusion to enhance the diuresis.   This plan was

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type 1, diastolic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and sarcoidosis presenting with severe dyspnea. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. Her current condition is consistent with an exacerbation of diastolic heart failure due to multifactorial causes including diastolic CHF, reactive airways, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient has been diuresed with furosemide but remains significantly dyspneic. A pulmonary artery catheter was placed, showing elevated pulmonary artery pressure and capillary wedge pressure, indicating the need for further diuresis. A furosemide infusion has been initiated to enhance diuresis. The patient is also being treated for coronary artery disease, abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting possibly related to gastroparesis, asthma, type 1 diabetes, and fungal/gastrointestinal issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to severe dyspnea and possible fluid overload.
2. Cardiogenic shock secondary to worsening diastolic heart failure.
3. Ventricular arrhythmias or heart block due to electrolyte imbalances and underlying cardiac conditions.
4. Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis due to immobility and risk factors.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old obese female with a history of cardiomyopathy, type I diabetes mellitus, and allergies to vancomycin, iodine, nausea/vomiting, and ibuprofen. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to acute heart failure exacerbation. The patient's vital signs on admission were tachycardic, hypertensive, and hypotensive at times. She received right heart catheterization with a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 45, pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure of 110, and PA diastolic pressure of 50.

The patient was given lasix 40mg IV initially and then increased to 80mg IV in the cath lab. Her urine output was tapered off, and she was started on a lasix drip at 1800. However, the patient developed persistent tachycardia and her blood pressure dropped to 50-60's around midnight. Her heart rate decreased from 120-130's to 90's after receiving an increased dose of metoprolol, so the lasix drip was discontinued. Two liters of normal saline (NS) were given, but the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) remained in the 30-40's. Levophed was started with the goal MAP of 55.

The patient has several allergies, including vancomycin, iodine, nausea/vomiting, and ibuprofen. She is currently on multiple medications, including norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and furosemide (Lasix).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Her flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, but her blood glucose levels are elevated.

The patient's medical history includes cardiomyopathy, type I diabetes mellitus, nausea/vomiting, and an unknown allergy to levofloxacin. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is still in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and cardiac arrhythmias. These complications should be closely monitored and managed accordingly."

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 3007], a 54-year-old woman with morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, and a history of tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction, presented from home with dyspnea. The patient has numerous complications from her DM1, including neurogenic bladder, coronary artery disease (CAD), neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. She underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in [2179], with all grafts widely patent. The patient's current presentation and chest X-ray are consistent with an exacerbation of CHF likely related to hypertension and under-diuresis, as indicated by progressive lower extremity edema.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: Resolved, but most likely due to overdiuresis and poor oral intake/non-invasive ventilation combined with medications.
- Follow up blood, urine, and sputum cultures.
- Monitor fever curve, central intravenous (CIS) line.
- Restart losartan and metoprolol as blood pressure allows.

2. Dyspnea/diastolic heart failure: Felt to be from multifactorial causes: diastolic CHF, reactive airways, pulmonary hypertension. Her current presentation and chest X-ray seem consistent with CHF exacerbation likely related to hypertension and under-diuresis given"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-inch tall individual with acute respiratory failure and a history of chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization procedure on 06/13/2191 at 09:15 AM and a PA catheterization started on the same day at 03:10 PM. Blood cultures were taken on 06/14/2191 at 12:01 AM, and an EKG was performed as well.

The patient has allergies to vancomycin, iodine, and ibuprofen, which may cause rash, mouth ulcers, nausea/vomiting, and renal toxicity. Levofloxacin is also noted to potentially cause renal toxicity.

In terms of medications, the patient is receiving norepinephrine at a dose of 0.03 mcg/kg/min, furosemide (Lasix) since 06/13/2191 at 12:40 PM, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis since 06/14/2191 at midnight.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), a heart rate of 77 bpm with a range of 72-118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 50/30 mmHg to 171/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute with a range of 9-32 breaths per"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure. The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy, type I diabetes mellitus, and allergies to vancomycin, iodine, and ibuprofen.

The patient underwent right heart catheterization, which showed mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (mPCWP) of 45, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) of 111/47 (80), and a cardiac output (CO) of 7.5 L/min with a cardiac index (CI) of 3.2 L/min/m^2. The mixed venous oxygen saturation was 72%.

The patient was started on IV lasix with a dose of 40mg and then increased to 80mg. The patient became tachycardic to the 110's and hypertensive with a blood pressure range of 150-160s. Lopressor was uptitrated to 37.5mg TID. The patient continued to have persistent tachycardia at 120's, and an EKG showed sinus tachycardia, possibly due to diuresis with transient intravascular volume depletion or infection.

The patient's blood pressure dropped to 50-60's at 0100, approximately two hours after receiving an increased dose of metoprolol, which decreased the heart rate from 120-130"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, and a previous tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction. She presents with respiratory failure and acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF. She has been receiving various medications including diuretics, vasopressors, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she continues to experience hypotension and tachycardia. She also has fluid overload as indicated by pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. Further investigations such as a right heart catheterization have been planned to guide management.

Potential Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may indicate a compensatory response to hypotension or infection.
3. Fluid Overload: The presence of pulmonary edema suggests fluid overload, which can worsen pulmonary hypertension and lead to further respiratory compromise.
4. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count raise concerns for an ongoing infection, potentially leading to sepsis.
5. Diabetic Complications: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state if not properly managed.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, and a history of tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction. She presents with dyspnea and was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from her current condition. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of low blood pressure, which were initially attributed to overdiuresis and poor oral intake. Close monitoring of fluid balance and medication adjustments will be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

2. Dyspnea/diastolic heart failure: The patient's dyspnea is believed to be caused by multifactorial factors including diastolic CHF, reactive airways, and pulmonary hypertension. Diuretic therapy and afterload reduction medications may be required based on the results of the right heart catheterization.

3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. It is important to continue antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and statins, and beta-blockers should be continued as well.

4. Abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting: The patient's abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting are likely related to gastroparesis, a complication of diabetes. Pro"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of morbid obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diabetes mellitus type 1, pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), and sarcoidosis. She was admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's current condition includes hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute on chronic diastolic CHF. The patient has been receiving diuretics, vasopressors, and other cardiac medications. She also has abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting, which may be related to gastroparesis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Leukocytosis: The rising white blood cell count with low-grade fever may indicate an impending infection. Monitoring for clinical signs of infection and obtaining blood, urine, and sputum cultures is necessary.
3. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's stiff ventricle and severe diastolic dysfunction make her very volume-sensitive. Careful management of fluid balance and diuretic therapy is crucial to prevent further exacerbation of CHF.
4. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's underlying pulmonary hypertension should be managed with inhaled steroids and bronchodilators for the component of restrictive"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), and sarcoidosis. She was admitted to the ICU for acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has been experiencing nonproductive cough, worse than baseline, but no fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath (SOB), or abdominal pain.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient received right heart catheterization (RHC) which showed mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (mPCWP) of 45, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) of 111/47 (80), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (mvO2%) of 72%. The patient was given furosemide (Lasix) 40mg and 80mg intravenously in the cath lab, resulting in urine output (UOP) tapering off. The patient was started on Lasix gtt at 1700.

The patient became tachycardic to 110's and hypertensive to systolic blood pressure (SBP) 150'-160s. Lopressor was uptitrated to 37.5mg TID. Despite this, the patient remained tachycardic to 120"

   I have reviewed the above progress note on [**2191-6-14**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   The physical examination is consistent with my own examination today.
   I concur with the assessment and treatment plan as outline above.
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 3007**] presented with severe dyspnea due to acute on chronic
   left ventricular diastolic heart failure.  She also has a history of
   sarcoidosis, pulmonary hypertension, and Type I diabetes with
   gastroparesis.  She has diuresed over 3 L over the past 24 hours but
   developed hypotension that briefly required Levophed and IV fluids.
   Although her PA pressures have fallen over time, there is quiet a bit
   of lability to her pressures.   We will continue optimize her ginger
   diuresis.    This plan was communicated with the patient and all
   questions were addressed   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5899**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8906**], MD   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8924**]

The patient presented with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's 24-hour events include:
- Right heart catheterization (RHC) showing mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (mPCWP) of 45, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) of 111/47 (80), and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 457 dynes/sec x cm-5.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of morbid obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), sarcoidosis, and tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction associated with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate (HR) of 67 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 106/57mmHg to 131/66mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an aerosol-cool device.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is comfortable and alert, with dry mucous membranes, distant regular heart sounds, diminished anterior lung sounds, obesity with no nasal gastric tube in situ, hypoactive bowel sounds, and 1+ pitting edema to the sacrum bilaterally without calf tenderness.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) levels between 29% and 34.2%, platelet count (Plt) between 150 K/uL and"

The patient has been weaned off pressors and remains hemodynamically stable with systolic blood pressures in the range of 100-110 mmHg. The plan is to monitor blood pressures with diuresis and continue diuresis with Lasix at a goal of 1-2 liters negative if hemodynamics allow (negative 50cc/hr). The patient's leukocytosis has improved, and follow-up urine and blood cultures are planned. 

The patient has acute on chronic diastolic CHF, with high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and pulmonary artery (PA) pressures noted in the catheterization lab. Hemodynamics improved after diuresis, so it is important to continue diuresis with Lasix and uptitrate angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and beta-blockers (BB) for afterload reduction as blood pressure allows. 

The patient also has pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN) and is being treated with inhaled steroids and bronchodilators for a component of restrictive air"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), sarcoidosis, and tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction associated with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's current condition includes hypotension, leukocytosis, acute on chronic diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, CAD post CABG, abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting, diabetes type 1, and nutrition management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be due to intravascular volume depletion from diuresis and poor intake, along with the effects of antihypertensive medications. The patient's preload dependence should be considered, and the differential diagnosis includes septic shock, acute pulmonary embolism, and hypovolemic shock. Monitoring the blood pressure and adjusting fluid and medication administration accordingly is important.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. However, there are no clinical signs of infection at this time. It is recommended to follow up with urine, blood cultures, and repeat chest X-ray to monitor for any signs of infection.

3. Acute on chronic diastolic CH"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with morbid obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), sarcoidosis, and tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction secondary to acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

24-hour events:
- Diuresis limited by low systemic blood pressure.
- At 2 pm, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) were 49/24 mmHg with a mean pressure of 34 mmHg, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) was 21 mmHg. The patient was 600 ml positive.
- The patient was not weaned off levofed until approximately 12 pm.
- Lasix drip was restarted at 5 units per hour at 3 pm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be due to intravascular volume depletion from diuresis/poor intake and antihypertensive medications. This could lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a rising white blood cell count with low-grade fever. Although there are no clinical signs of infection at the moment, further investigation is needed to rule out"

   The physical examination is consistent with my own examination today.
   I concur with the assessment and treatment plan as outline above.  I
   believe that Mrs. [**Known lastname 3007**] is close to her therapeutic endpoint of
   diuresis understanding her lower PA pressures and PCWP and intermittent
   episodes of hypotension with diuresis.  We will hope to keep her fluids
   balanced today  and continue her medication for her diastolic
   dysfunction.   This plan was communicated with the patient and all
   questions were addressed   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5899**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8906**], MD   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8924**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of morbid obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), and sarcoidosis. She was admitted with upper airway obstruction and acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is currently in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation and has been on diuretics for diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, particularly during diuresis. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to ensure hemodynamic stability.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a potential infection. Further investigation of urine and blood cultures is recommended.
3. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's high pulmonary artery (PA) pressures and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) suggest ongoing diastolic dysfunction. Continuous diuresis with lasix and optimization of afterload reduction medications may be required.
4. Pulmonary HTN: Although the patient's PA pressures have improved, she still has pulmonary hypertension. Inhaled steroids and bronchodilators may help manage the component of reactive airway disease (RAD), and calcium channel blockers can be added when the patient is normotensive.
5. CAD s/p CABG: The patient had previous coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, and all grafts were found to be widely patent. It is essential to continue antiplatelet therapy (ASA), beta-blockers, and statins as prescribed.
6. Gastroparesis: The patient has stable gastroparesis, and proton pump inhibitors along with prokinetic agents should be continued.
7. DM Type I: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 1 is sub-optimally controlled, and insulin therapy needs to be optimized with sliding scale insulin and basal lantus.
8. Nutrition: The patient requires a diabetic/HH diet.
9. Other considerations: The patient has a code status of full code, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be continued."

   I have reviewed the above progress note on [**2191-6-16**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3458**].
   The history and physical examination are consistent with my own
   examination today.  I concur with the assessment and treatment plan as
   outline above.  A modest diuresis was achieved yesterday but her PCWP
   has slipped up to 21 mmHg, likely secondary to redistribution of the
   third space fluid from the periphery.  We are converting her to oral
   medications and getting her up in a chair.  We will coordinate her home
   care with the CHF VNA in order to target daily adjustments of her Laxis
   dose if needed.    [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5899**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8906**], MD   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8924**]

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of morbid obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), sarcoidosis, and tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction associated with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is currently in the ICU and is being monitored for various conditions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate (HR) of 61 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 108/56 mmHg to 150/65 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%, and sinus rhythm (SR) on electrocardiogram (ECG).

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 798 mL, output of 2,130 mL, and a negative balance of 1,332 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and has been started on lasix 40 mg PO daily. The patient's tracheostomy and right Swan-Ganz catheter insertion sites are clean and dry.

The patient's laboratory results indicate the following abnormalities: white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.3 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 275 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.2 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 68 mg/dL to 295 mg/dL, and an elevated troponin-T level. Other lab values, such as electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac markers, are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, distant heart sounds with regular rate and rhythm, diminished breath sounds anteriorly, 1+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally, and an umbilical hernia.

The patient's current assessment and plan include monitoring for hypotension, continuing diuresis with lasix, uptitration of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers for afterload reduction as BP allows, and repeat PCWP measurement later today. The patient's pulmonary hypertension has improved, and she is hemodynamically stable with improved dyspnea. The patient's coronary artery disease status post CABG is stable, and all grafts are widely patent. The patient's gastroparesis is stable, and she will continue on proton pump inhibitors and promotility agents. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 1 is sub-optimally controlled, and her sliding scale insulin will be continued with an uptitration of basal insulin to 34 units.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include hypotension, acute on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of morbid obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), sarcoidosis, and tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction associated with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's current condition includes hypotension, leukocytosis, acute on chronic diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, gastroenteritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, gastroparesis, and nutrition management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within the desired range of 100-110 mmHg, but it should be closely monitored, especially during diuresis.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection. Further follow-up of urine and blood cultures is needed to identify the cause.
3. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's hemodynamics have improved after diuresis, but ongoing monitoring is required. Diuretics should be continued with a goal of 1-2 liters negative if hemodynamics allow. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers should be uptitrated for afterload reduction as blood pressure allows.
4. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary artery pressures have"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), sarcoidosis, and previous tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction. She is currently admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), leukocytosis, gastroparesis, and uncontrolled DM1.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient was previously on pressors but has been weaned off and remains hemodynamically stable with systolic blood pressures (SBP) ranging from 100-110 mmHg. Close monitoring of blood pressures is recommended, especially with diuresis.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has improved. Follow-up urine and blood cultures are needed to rule out any potential infections.
3. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient has high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and pulmonary artery (PA) pressures. Hemodynamics improved after diuresis, so continued diuresis with Lasix is advised. ACE and beta-blockers should be uptitrated for afterload reduction as blood pressure allows. Electrolytes should be managed appropriately.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's PA pressures are improved, and she is hemodynamically stable with improved dyspnea"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a medical history of morbid obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diabetes mellitus type 1, pulmonary hypertension, sarcoidosis, and tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction. She is currently admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's recent events include stopping lasix gtt and starting lasix 40 mg PO daily. She reports that her shortness of breath is close to baseline, with no chest pain or pressure, fevers, or chills. She also experiences tolerable nausea but reports constipation and no bowel movements since admission. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension - The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored, especially with the diuretic therapy.
2. Leukocytosis - Follow-up urine and blood cultures are needed to assess for any ongoing infection.
3. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF - Diuretics will continue to be administered to manage fluid balance and hemodynamics. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may be uptitrated for afterload reduction as tolerated. Electrolyte imbalances should be managed accordingly.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension - Inhaled steroids and bronchodilators will be used to manage the component of restrictive airway disease. Calcium channel blockers may be added when the patient is norm"

The patient's current condition shows improvement in breathing, with no oxygenation issues and improved heart rhythm. The physical examination reveals general comfort, obesity, normal airway, clear lungs, distant heart sounds with no murmurs or gallops, diminished breath sounds anteriorly, no wheezing or rales, and 1+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, along with low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating, ranging from 68 to 328 mg/dL. 

The patient's plan includes continuing diuresis with lasix PO, uptitration of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers for afterload reduction as tolerated, electrolyte management, and possibly discontinuing the PA catheter if there is improvement. The patient is also on inhaled steroids and bronchodilators for asthma, anticoagulation prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and glycemic control.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with morbid obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), sarcoidosis, and tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction associated with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, acute on chronic diastolic CHF, pulmonary HTN, CAD s/p CABG, gastroparesis, and uncontrolled DM1.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is at risk for hypotension due to diuretic use and ongoing fluid management.
2. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient's high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and pulmonary artery pressures indicate ongoing diastolic dysfunction. Close monitoring and continued diuretic therapy are necessary to manage fluid balance and prevent worsening heart failure.
3. Pulmonary HTN: The patient's PA pressures are still elevated, indicating ongoing pulmonary hypertension. Treatment with inhaled steroids and bronchodilators is recommended to manage this condition.
4. CAD s/p CABG: The patient has a history of CAD and previous CABG surgery. It is important to monitor graft patency and continue antiplatelet therapy to prevent graft closure.
5. Gastroparesis: The"

The patient was admitted with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and is currently in the ICU. 

24-hour events include receiving 40mg PO lasix and continuing to diurese throughout the day. The patient also got out of bed to a chair with partial pressure (PT) and made an appointment with Dr. [First Name (Title)] in [Hospital] clinic for heart failure. The patient has not had a bowel movement for six days, and the bowel regimen has been increased by adding colace, dulcolax, and increasing PO magnesium.

The patient has allergies to vancomycin, iodine/iodine-containing products, nausea/vomiting, and an unknown allergy. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [date]. The patient is currently on various medications including lansoprazole (Prevacid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted bowel movements. The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings are provided in detail.
