","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), stomach; renal failure, chronic (chronic renal failure, CRF, chronic kidney disease); atrial fibrillation (AFIB); Parkinson's disease; diabetes mellitus (DM), type II; anemia, chronic; and cholestasis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple complications, including acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, pericarditis, pneumonia, and pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's current condition of acute renal failure can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis).
2. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The presence of gastrointestinal bleed can result in hypotension, anemia, and potential sepsis if there is an associated infection.
3. Pericarditis: Pericarditis can lead to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and potential cardiac tamponade if severe.
4. Pneumonia: Pneumonia can progress to respiratory failure and sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
5. Pleural Effusion: The accumulation of fluid in the pleural space can compromise lung function and potentially lead to respiratory distress.
6. Cholestasis: Obstruction of bile flow can cause jaundice, itching,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. These include:

1. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient has an acute rise in creatinine, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. They also have a decreased urine output and became anuric. The renal team recommended starting hemodialysis (HD), which the family agreed to. Due to the patient's tenuous blood pressure, continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was started.

2. Dyspnea: The patient is experiencing worsening dyspnea. This is likely due to fluid overload, metabolic acidosis, and pneumonia. CVVH, high flow mask as needed, and completing the 14-day course of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) were recommended.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleed, Other (GIB): The patient had guaiac positive stool in the ostomy, but their hematocrit (hct) levels over the past 5 days have been stable. Daily monitoring of hct and transfusion for hct <21 were recommended.

4. Pericarditis, Other: This is likely due to uremia. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of increased effusion. CVVH and following up with renal recommendations were advised.

5. Pneumonia, Other: The patient developed multilobar pneumonia while hospitalized. Their white blood cell count is trending"

The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about renal failure, acute respiratory distress, gastrointestinal bleeding, pericarditis, pneumonia, chronic anemia, Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus type II, hospital-acquired barotrauma, cholestasis, pleural effusion, and potential complications related to the ongoing management of these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has an acute rise in creatinine levels, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. The patient is anuric, indicating a complete cessation of urine output. Renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis (HD), has been initiated due to the patient's tenuous blood pressure and the need for fluid removal.

2. Dyspnea: The patient has worsening dyspnea, which may be due to fluid overload, uremia, and pneumonia. The patient is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and high-flow oxygen as needed.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient had guaiac-positive stool in the ostomy, but recent hematocrit levels have been stable. Close monitoring of hematocrit and transfusion for a hematocrit level below 21 are recommended.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications include:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have risen significantly, indicating impaired kidney function. The presence of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia further supports acute renal failure. Renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis) has been initiated.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing worsening dyspnea, likely due to fluid overload, metabolic acidosis (possibly uremia), and pneumonia. High-flow oxygen therapy and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) have been started.

3. Cholelithiasis (gallstones): The patient's biliary obstruction is causing cholestasis. A revision of the common bile duct stent was performed recently.

4. Pleural effusion: The patient had an acute pleural effusion on the right side, which was drained through thoracentesis.

5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient had guaiac positive stool, their hemoglobin levels have remained stable over the past five days. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion if necessary should continue.

6. Pericarditis: The patient likely has uremic pericarditis, indicated by an echocardiogram showing no increased effusion.

7. Pneumonia: The patient developed multilobar pneumonia while hospitalized.

8. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia and is taking epoetin as an outpatient"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint includes respiratory failure, bacteremia, cholangitis, renal failure, pericarditis, and pleural effusion. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, pericarditis, pneumonia, chronic anemia, Parkinson's disease, type II diabetes mellitus, hospital-acquired conditions, cholestasis, and pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's breathing pattern with expiratory grunt and increased accessory muscle use indicates fluid overload and possible heart failure.
2. Bacteremia: The patient is on a two-week course of antibiotics, indicating an ongoing infection.
3. Cholangitis: The patient's liver function tests are improving, suggesting improvement in biliary obstruction.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, with decreased urine output despite fluid boluses. Elevated potassium levels indicate potential hyperkalemia, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
5. Pericarditis: The presence of a pericardial friction rub obscuring heart sounds suggests inflammation of the pericardium.
6. Pleural Effusion: The patient has an acute pleural effusion, as evidenced by the thoracentesis performed by the interventional radiology (IR) team.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 8."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, pneumonia, cholestasis, and acute renal failure. He was admitted to the ICU due to worsening symptoms and required mechanical ventilation. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and anuria. He has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, possibly secondary to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 122/59 to 124/59 mmHg, heart rate between 81-84 bpm, respiratory rate of 25-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on high-flow facemask.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and recent thoracentesis procedures increase the risk of infection spreading to other organs, leading to sepsis.

2. Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS): Given the patient's acute renal failure, hypoxemia, and potential sepsis, there is a risk of MODS, where multiple organs fail due to systemic inflammation.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's current need for mechanical ventilation indicates respiratory failure, which may continue if underlying conditions do not improve.

4. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and borderline blood pressure readings suggest a possible cardiac involvement. Cardiac complications, such"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOXEMIA
   Pt continues to require high flow facemask for low O2 sats. Pleural
   effusion; some fluid overload, treating for pneumonia. Continue
   levo/zosyn. Fluconazole already started for biliary yeast. Pleural
   fluid c/w communication from biliary drain procedure, positive yeast
   suggestive of same organism moving through similar space. Would not
   change fluconazole at this point, unlikely to be separate process.
 CHOLESTASIS
   [**2-14**] biliary obstruction from duodenal mass likely due to recurrence of
   gastric cancer.  Internal CBD stent revision by IR on [**1-4**]. Not
   revising this further.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Improving control.
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE
   R thoracentesis on [**1-4**] by IR with removal of 700 cc fluid. Appears
   that fluid and past PTX consistent with perf of diaphragm in the
   process of IR procedure in biliary system. Would not intervene further.
   Pleural rub fading/gone at this point
indicates that inflammatory state
   in this area is decreasing.
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Pt has multilobular infiltrates on CXR.  Curentlly treating for HAP.
   See
hypoxemia
 above.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Acute rise in creatinine with decreased urine output, hyperkalemia, and
   hyperphosphatemia; now on CVVH.

   GOALS OF CARE
   Discussing goals of care with family; we are not anticipating a major
   turnaround for Mr [**Known lastname 86**] and it is important that they know this.
   Thus far their goal has been transfer to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital when
   possible, so we will continue to try to make this feasible.

   Respiratory status remains good off of venitlator. CXR continues to
   show prominent infiltrates, however. The infiltrates have a somewhat
   peripheral predominance, suggestive of eosinophilic pneumonia. Will
   check WBC differential. Some of the infiltrate may represent volume
   overload. Dialysis in process.
   Afebrile with stable WBC. Continues on antibiotics for cholangitis.
   Bilirubin still elevated. Yeast growing from pleural fluid, but we know
   that pleural space was compromised by the external pleural space.
   Patient on fluconazole. Absent fever and rising WBC, would not access
   pleural space at this time, would not place chest tube.
   Patient getting dialysis now; there are problems with the dialysis
   catheter which will need to be addressed by renal.
   Mental status waxes and wanes. Difficult to know how much of this is
   due to uremia vs worsening acidosis (combined respiratory and metabolic
   acidosis). Patient is not to be reintubated per family directions. Will
   discuss potential imminence of demise due to acidosis with family and
   their goals to get patient back to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.
   Hct stable. Not at transfusion threshold now.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include respiratory failure, cholangitis, bacteremia, renal failure, pericarditis, and anemia. The patient's condition is stabilized, with improvements in hemodynamics and no fever for the past 24 hours. However, there are ongoing concerns regarding hypoxemia, cholestasis, diabetes mellitus type II, pleural effusion, pneumonia, acute renal failure, acidosis, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient continues to require high-flow facemask for low oxygen saturation levels. This indicates inadequate oxygenation of the blood, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not promptly addressed.

2. Cholestasis: The patient has biliary obstruction due to a duodenal mass likely related to recurrent gastric cancer. This obstruction can cause impaired bile flow, leading to jaundice and liver dysfunction.

3. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient has elevated fasting glucose levels throughout the day, indicating uncontrolled blood sugar levels. If left untreated, it can result in further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

4. Pleural Effusion, Acute: The patient had thoracentesis performed to remove 700 cc of fluid from the right pleural space. If the fluid accumulation recurs or becomes infected, it may lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential respiratory failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 80 y/o M w/history of diabetes, gastric cancer, initially p/w
   painless jaundice, GNR bacteremia, biliary obstruction [**2-14**] duodenal
   mass positive for adenocarcinoma, transferred to ICU with respiratory
   distress and bilaterally pulmonary infiltrates, progressing renal
   failure, PTX and pleural effusion, now made CMO with plans to transfer
   back to CCH to be closer to home.
   .
   #Recurrent pancreatic cancer
 causing biliary obstruction
   #Pleural effusions: very large R sided effusion seen on CT, smaller L
   sided possibly parapneumonic vs malignant vs transudative.
   -tap during IR guided procedure
   -send fluid fo chemitries, cell count/diff and cultures
   -volume removal may improve symptoms of o2 dependence
   .
   #Pneumothorax - most likely [**2-14**] IR guided procedure and entrance of
   biliary drain above diaphragm.  No significant resp/hemodynamic
   compromise from PTX at this point.
   -monitor for resolution
   .
   #Biliary obstruction: h/o gastric cancer with tumor infiltration of
   duodenum seen on ERCP.  Biopsies taken during ERCP show poorly
   differentiated adenocarcinoma c/w recurrance of gastric cancer.  Plan
   for IR guided extension of CBD stent today, INR within rage of 1.3.
   Also with sparse growth of [**Female First Name (un) 188**] from bile cx on [**1-29**].
   -f/u IR reccs post procedure
   -continue fluconazole for biliary cultures positive for [**Female First Name (un) 188**]
   -discuss/fax results prior to D/C to patients oncologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 189**] at
   CCH [**Telephone/Fax (1) 190**]
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Had resolving ATN and post-ATN
   diuresis on transfer out of ICU previously, now once again has rising
   creatinine likely due to additional hypoperfusion insult.  Creatinine
   trending up for past several days and he has had marginal urine
   output.  On exam he also has a persistant pericardial friction rub
   worrisome for possiblity of uremic pericarditis.  Renal team has been
   following, no indication for dialysis at this point given that he is
   making good urine and creatinine stabilized.
   -Trend creat, renally dose meds
   -f/u renal reccs, no indication for dialysis at this time
   -continue with tube feeds to maintain hydration
   -goal even today
   -IVF boluses for urine output as long as responding
   -send ua, urine lytes
   -f/u renal reccs
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation - new onset during this admission, has been in
   sinus since restarting dilt, patient's family denies any prior h/o
   afib.  Most likely [**2-14**] fevers/concomittant illness, pneumonia,
   pericarditis.  Ruled out for MI by CE's, troponin elevation [**2-14**] ARF.
   -continue with dilt 60 po TID as tolerated by BP was on cartia xt 180
   po daily as an outpatient.

   #Guiac positive colostomy output - significantly decreased, with stable
   HCT following transfusion.
   -[**Hospital1 **] HCT
   -monitor colostomy output
   -IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], can change to po at this point once reliably taking po's
   -FFP if significant bloody output or drop in HCT, transfuse for HCT <21
   or significant drop in setting of signific bleed
   .
   #Coagulopathy - Improvement in INR to 1.3 following po Vit K x3 doses
   from [**Date range (1) 191**], Vit K IV and FFP.  Likely [**2-14**] malnutrition, long term

   #Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates: differential includes aspiration
   pneumonitis/pneumonia vs. flash pulmonary edema however CXR appearance
   and rapid clinical resolution less consistent with pulmonary edema.  He
   has obscured diaphragms on CXR worrisome for infiltrate.
   -continue with current treatment of vanc, zosyn and levo given
   likelihood of aspiration pnemonitis/pneumonia to complete 14 day course
   then d/c
   -will need f/u CXR's and possibly CT to ensure resolution of

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of diabetes, gastric cancer, and recurrent pancreatic cancer. He was initially presented with painless jaundice and bacteremia. The patient has been transferred to the ICU due to respiratory distress and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, progressing renal failure, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrent pancreatic cancer causing biliary obstruction: The patient has a history of gastric cancer with tumor infiltration of the duodenum. Biopsies taken during ERCP show poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with recurrence of gastric cancer. There is a plan for IR-guided extension of CBD stent today.
2. Pleural effusions: The patient has very large right-sided effusion seen on CT, and smaller left-sided effusion. These effusions may be due to malignant, parapneumonic, or transudative causes. A tap during IR-guided procedure is planned to send fluid for chemistries, cell count/diff, and cultures.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient has a pneumothorax most likely caused by IR-guided procedure and entrance of biliary drain above the diaphragm. The patient will be monitored for resolution.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient had resolving acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and post-ATN diures"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of diabetes, gastric cancer, and recurrent pancreatic cancer. The patient presented with painless jaundice and was found to have bacteremia, biliary obstruction, and a duodenal mass positive for adenocarcinoma. He was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory distress and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, progressing renal failure, pneumothorax (PTX), and pleural effusion.

The patient's current condition includes fever, tachypnea, hypotension, and altered mental status. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/48 mmHg to 131/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, but he has low albumin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.

Radiology findings include bilateral opacifications on chest X-ray, which may be behind the clinical improvement. The patient has also tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) in his stool.

The assessment and plan include several conditions: recurrent pancreatic cancer, biliary obstruction due to tumor infiltration of the duodenum,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints include respiratory failure, renal failure, cholangitis, pleural effusion, and pericarditis. The patient has decided to shift the emphasis of care to comfort measures.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 81 bpm with a range of 71-84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/48 mmHg to 131/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery and has an ABG result of //25.

The physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress. There are coarse, diffuse crackles in the chest and a loud pericardial friction rub heard. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. The extremities do not show cyanosis or clubbing, and the neurologic examination is attentive with simple commands followed.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and elevated potassium and phosphorus levels. The creatinine levels are also elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. Other lab values show abnormalities in liver function tests, electrolytes, and blood glucose levels.

The assessment and plan include acute renal failure, hypoxemia, cholangitis, diabetes mellitus type II, pleural effusion, pneumonia, and"
