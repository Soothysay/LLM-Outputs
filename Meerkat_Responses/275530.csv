   Disposition:
","The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to worsening respiratory distress. A nasal swab was performed, an EKG was conducted, and blood cultures were drawn. The patient developed a fever of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit and has been on midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management, respectively.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/49 to 125/88 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,852 mL with an output of 750 mL, resulting in a net balance of 2,102 mL. Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation with set tidal volume (Vt) of 350 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits.

Physical examination findings are incomplete due to the patient being intubated. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values, including liver enzymes, electrolytes, and cardiac markers, are also within normal limits.

The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute fever, and altered mental status. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is noted as in the ICU."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of AIDS, HIV, dilated cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid syndrome. The patient presented with right shoulder pain and shortness of breath.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. She has been experiencing tachypnea, fever, and an elevated respiratory rate. The initial arterial blood gas (ABG) showed respiratory alkalosis, indicating hyperventilation. The patient's oxygen saturation was maintained at 99% with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume (Vt) of 350 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and pressure support (PS) of 10 cmH2O.

The chest X-ray revealed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, consistent with pneumonia. The patient's CD4 count is unknown, but she has been non-compliant with HAART therapy in the past. The patient is at risk for opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), aspergillosis, and viral pneumonia. Therefore, broad coverage antibiotics, such as vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, have been initiated, and additional diagnostic tests including sputum cultures, blood cultures,"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]) in setting of pneumonia.
   Currently on vanco/zosyn.  Unable to get sputum for GS, C&S, PCP,
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1156**].  Given her smoking hsitory and age over 40 will also evaluate
   airways for endobronchial lesions.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  After bronchoscopy willl consider starting IV
   heparin without a bolus.  LENIs negative.
 HYPOTENSION:  Likely related to relative volume depletion albeit also
   concerned for early sepsis.  Was volume resusitated
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN) secondary
   to pneumonia, possible sepsis.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Likely in the setting of acute
   pulmonary infection.  Head CT unremarkable.  Unable to assess now on
   sedative, will wean and re-evaluate.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Currently in sinus rhythm. On digoxin.
 ANTICARDIOLIPIN/CLOTTING HISTORY on coumadin albeit subtherapeutic on
   admission.
 HYPONATREMIA:  Porbable SIADH.  Send urine/serum osoms, lytes.
   Follow labs.  Free water restriction.
 HEMOPTYSIS:  Most likely secondary to acute pneumonia and exacerbated
   by anticoagulation.  She does have a PE in the area of the RLL
   infiltrate, also has anticardiolipin syndrome subtherapeutic on
   coumadin. After bronchoscopy later today will consider starting heparin
   without a bolus.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Likely component of ATN in setting of
   hypotension/hypovolemia.  Urine output improved, volume resusitated.
 DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY:  Continues digoxin.  Consider adding ACE I if
   renal function improves.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with acute respiratory failure, hypotension, and various medical complications. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. They are currently receiving multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, fluconazole, metoprolol, ASA, and Coumadin. The patient's vital signs indicate a fever, tachycardia, and low blood pressure. The respiratory support shows that the patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with set tidal volume (Vt) of 350 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 22, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate normal oxygenation but slightly acidic pH. Physical examination reveals crackles in both lung bases, warm skin, and no pain. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and other abnormalities. Imaging shows an endotracheal tube in good position, right lower lobe opacifications, and fluid in fissure. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia, which is a known complication of severe lung infections.

2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of smoking, age over 40"

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of AIDS, HIV, dilated cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid syndrome. She presents with right shoulder pain and shortness of breath. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachypnea, and respiratory alkalosis. Her vital signs include a temperature of 102.4°F, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 92/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate set at 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, normal hemoglobin, and elevated levels of troponin-T and lactate. Imaging reveals bilateral lower lobe infiltrates on chest CT. The patient has a filling defect on CT and new blood suctioned. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, as indicated by her tachypnea, low oxygen saturation, and need for mechanical ventilation.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Ms [**Known lastname 4135**], and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has had continued bloody secretion output but currently has
   tolerated CPAP/ PSV trial for nearly 2 hrs ( [**5-10**] cms). She responds to
   simple commands and has improved strength in lower extermities too. Her
   resting tachycardia unchanged at 120 and is likely reflective of
   increased adrenergic tone.
   Exam notable for young BF Tmof 99.7 BP 110/79  HR of 115-120  RR  of 26
   with sats of 100% on 40% fio2 . she has bronchial breath sounds at
   right base.
   Labs notable for WBC of 8.1 K, HCT of 36.9, K+ 4.3, Cr of 1.1, lactate
   of < 2 and ABG of 7.42/32/92 CXR with RLL infiltrate and mild
   interstitial edema. she has massive cardiomegaly.
   Agree with plan to continue prolonged PSV/CPAP trial today and then
   assess ability to extubate if no evidence for worsening respiratory
   fatigue. She will need help with secretion clearance after extubation
   and possibly biPAP. I doubt PE has contributed to respiratory decline
   as INR was close to 2 on admission. hemoptysis likely on account of CAP
   ( while on anticoagulation)
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of AIDS, HIV, dilated cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid syndrome. She presents with right shoulder pain and shortness of breath.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and the attending physician suspects it may be due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or aspiration pneumonia. The plan is to trial pressure support ventilation (PSV) and check arterial blood gas (ABG) to determine if the patient can be extubated. If there is acidosis on ABG, the patient will not be extubated and a new endotracheal tube will be placed.

The patient also has a fever, likely due to pneumonia. Treatment for pneumonia includes continuing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics, and withdrawing vancomycin if the blood cultures are negative. A galactomannan test is also planned to rule out invasive fungal infection.

The patient has altered mental status, which is likely due to delirium in the setting of infection and possibly secondary to cocaine use. Minimizing sedation is recommended.

The patient's HIV status is mentioned, indicating that she is not adherent to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the past. A new CD4 count will be checked, and no other HAART therapy is currently being administered.

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of AIDS, HIV, dilated cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid syndrome. She presents with right shoulder pain and shortness of breath. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure, suspected to be caused by community-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. She is currently on invasive ventilation but has been extubated and is tachypneic afterward. Her sodium level is 130, and her INR is 1.5.

The patient's other medical history includes non-adherence to HAART therapy, with a previous CD4 count of 184. She also has dilated cardiomyopathy and may be experiencing hypervolemia from low ejection fraction and fluids given in the emergency department or possibly SIADH secondary to recent pneumonia.

The patient's physical examination reveals a regular rapid heart rate with S3 and S4 heart sounds, course ventilated sounds anteriorly, and 1+ left lower extremity edema. Her neurologic examination shows symmetric strength in both lower extremities.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 173 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL, platelet count of 153,000, and creatinine level of 1.1. The chest X-ray shows a segmental infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. Bronchial washings reveal 4+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes and 1+"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of AIDS, HIV, dilated cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid syndrome. She presents with right shoulder pain and shortness of breath. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, suspected to be due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or aspiration pneumonia. The patient is also experiencing altered mental status, likely secondary to infection or cocaine use. She has a history of nonadherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV and no recent CD4 count available. The patient's dilated cardiomyopathy may contribute to her symptoms, possibly exacerbated by cocaine use. She has evidence of SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone) and is hypervolemic. The patient's acid-base balance is non-gap metabolic acidosis, possibly due to diarrhea or renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Her antiphospholipid syndrome requires therapeutic INR levels, currently held for a possible thoracentesis. The patient's condition is stable, and she is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of AIDS, HIV, dilated cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid syndrome. She presented with right shoulder pain and tachypnea. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation but was later extubated and remained tachypneic. She had bloody secretions, RUQ pain (likely due to PE/pna), and her LFTs showed transaminases in the 50s. GNR in sputum was detected, but no GP was found, so vancomycin was stopped after 48 hours. Coumadin was restarted, and low-dose carvedilol was given for tachycardia. The patient was hypotensive but responded well to a 500cc bolus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and was initially intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. There is a suspicion of CAP/aspiration pneumonia as the cause of respiratory failure. The patient is now extubated but still tachypneic. Optimizing respiratory status will be attempted with atrovent nebs, mucinex 600mg, and good pain control. If the CXR tomorrow shows the same or worse findings, a thoracentesis may be performed.

2. Multilobar PNA: The patient has bilateral lower lobe involvement on chest CT, suggesting a multilobar"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of AIDS, HIV, dilated cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid syndrome. She presents with respiratory failure, obstructive lung disease, and pleural effusion. The patient also has altered mental status, which may be due to an opportunistic infection such as toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, or lymphoma. Other findings include non-gap metabolic acidosis, potential syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), and antiphospholipid syndrome.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and tachypnea indicate a possible respiratory failure. This could be exacerbated by underlying conditions like pleural effusion or pneumonia.
2. Obstructive lung disease: The presence of end-expiratory wheezes suggests an obstructive component to her lung disease. This could be due to factors such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or bronchial constriction related to an allergic reaction.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient's symptoms may be influenced by the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which can impair lung function and lead to respiratory distress.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental state could be a result of an opportunistic infection affecting the central nervous system, such as toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, or lymph"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of AIDS, HIV, dilated cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid syndrome. She presents with complaints of right shoulder pain and shortness of breath. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or aspiration pneumonia. She has been extubated and tolerating supplemental oxygen.

The patient's mental status remains lethargic but she is not aspirating. She will be given atrovent nebs, mucinex 600mg, and pain control with dilaudid q6h. If the patient continues to experience pain, morphine may be given as needed.

The patient also has multilobar pneumonia in both lower lobes on chest CT, which is most likely bacterial pneumonia. The patient was recently admitted for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). However, since the patient is HIV positive, there is a broad differential including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), fungal pneumonia, and other infections. The patient's fever is attributed to the pneumonia.

The patient also has altered mental status, which is improving off sedation. It is likely due to delirium in the setting of infection or altered sensorium secondary to cocaine use. A CT head was negative on admission, and further investigation will be done if the patient does not improve.

The patient has dilated cardiomyopathy and may be in a hypervolemic state"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a known HIV+ individual with altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing ventricular bigeminy without evidence of hemodynamic compromise. They remain extubated and have a hoarse voice. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), with a current temperature of 35.8 C (96.5 F), heart rate of 97 bpm (88-114 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 108/76 mmHg to 128/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute (21-38 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and anticoagulation.

The patient's review of systems is largely unchanged from admission, except for experiencing hoarseness and experiencing ventricular bigeminy. Physical examination findings are generally within normal limits, but the patient has an altered mental status attributed to pneumonia and chronic drug use. The patient has advanced cardiomyopathy that is stable, and they have a history of poor compliance with HIV medications.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows hypoxemia.
