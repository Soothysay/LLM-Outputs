","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU for management of alcohol withdrawal. She also has a reported subarachnoid hemorrhage but further evaluation showed it to be more consistent with motion artifact, and no acute surgical management was required. The patient is currently experiencing confusion, possibly due to alcohol withdrawal, and has a history of falls with possible head trauma. She has multiple small superficial lesions on her back and lower extremities with mild erythema, concerning for skin infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 144/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. However, her glucose level is low at 46 mg/dL. The patient is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and multivitamins. She is also on prophylactic heparin and has a nicotine patch for tobacco abuse. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and appropriate interventions are being taken as needed."

 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Assessment and Plan: 62 year old female with a history of alcohol abuse
   transferred to this hospital for management of a possible subarachnoid
   hemorrhage now admitted to the MICU for management of alcohol
   withdrawal.  She was not considered to have competency to leave AMA
   last night.
   Decision making: She has very poor insight into her overall situation
   and does not appear worried by her repeated falls while intoxicated at
   home.  She was seen by psych last night who did not feel she had
   capacity to risk withdrawal at home last night.  She does not have
   improved capacity today, but her risk of withdrawal is now largely
   passed.
   - Will talk again w/ psych this morning.  Her competency has not
   improved, but her imminent medical risk has also decreased.
   Alcohol withdrawal:  Self reports long history of alcohol abuse which
   she says is improving, though alcohol level was in the 600s on
   presentation to [**Hospital3 **].  This morning she is calm,
   non-tremulous with CIWA scores of [**2-18**] off of valium.  She is unable to
   give a clear plan of how she will remain sober at home, but does not
   want to consider rehab.
   - valium 10 mg IV Q1H:PRN CIWA > 10
   - thiamine, folate, multivitamins
   - social work consult -> she is now willing to talk to social work.
   s/p fall:  Patient currently confused and reports history of fall with
   possible head trauma.  Transferred for possible subarachnoid hemorrhage
   at OSH.  Here CT head and C-spine negative, C-spine cleared yesterday.
   She is still at high risk of falls at home and cannot articulate a plan
   to be safer at home.
   - PT eval.
   Skin Lesions:  Patient with multiple small superficial lesions on her
   back and lower extremities with mild erythema.  She has no leukocytosis
   or fevers and lesions do not appear super-infected.  We can continue
   Keflex while she is here pending wound cultures, but she does not need
   to go home with a course of antibiotics.
   - f/u blood and wound cultures.
   Tobacco Abuse:
   - nicotine patch
   FEN: regular diet, replete electrolytes.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   Communication: w/ patient and husband.  [**Name (NI) 133**] contact PCP today by
   email.

   Dispo: She should stay here through the day to see if we can resolve
   pending issues and send her home tonight.  To floor in evening if still
   here.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Assessment and Plan: 62 year old female with a history of alcohol abuse
   transferred to this hospital for management of a possible subarachnoid
   hemorrhage now admitted to the MICU for management of alcohol
   withdrawal.  She was not considered to have competency to leave AMA
   last night.
   Decision making: She has very poor insight into her overall situation
   and does not appear worried by her repeated falls while intoxicated at
   home.  She was seen by psych last night who did not feel she had
   capacity to risk withdrawal at home last night.  She does not have
   improved capacity today, but her risk of withdrawal is now largely
   passed.
   - Will talk again w/ psych this morning.  Her competency has not
   improved, but her imminent medical risk has also decreased.
   Alcohol withdrawal:  Self reports long history of alcohol abuse which
   she says is improving, though alcohol level was in the 600s on
   presentation to [**Hospital3 **].  This morning she is calm,
   non-tremulous with CIWA scores of [**2-18**] off of valium.  She is unable to
   give a clear plan of how she will remain sober at home, but does not
   want to consider rehab.
   - valium 10 mg IV Q1H:PRN CIWA > 10
   - thiamine, folate, multivitamins
   - social work consult -> she is now willing to talk to social work.
   s/p fall:  Patient currently confused and reports history of fall with
   possible head trauma.  Transferred for possible subarachnoid hemorrhage
   at OSH.  Here CT head and C-spine negative, C-spine cleared yesterday.
   She is still at high risk of falls at home and cannot articulate a plan
   to be safer at home.
   - PT eval.
   Skin Lesions:  Patient with multiple small superficial lesions on her
   back and lower extremities with mild erythema.  She has no leukocytosis
   or fevers and lesions do not appear super-infected.  We can continue
   Keflex while she is here pending wound cultures, but she does not need
   to go home with a course of antibiotics.
   - f/u blood and wound cultures.
   Tobacco Abuse:
   - nicotine patch
   FEN: regular diet, replete electrolytes.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   Communication: w/ patient and husband.  [**Name (NI) 133**] contact PCP today by
   email.
   Code: Full code.
   Dispo: She should stay here through the day to see if we can resolve
   pending issues and send her home tonight.  To floor in evening if still
   here.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Overnight, demanding to leave but unable to explain reasons to leave.
   Seen by psych who agreed that pt lacked capacity to make this
   decision.  Received 60 Valium, last at 9am (requested, not meeting req
   for CIWA).
   Now, improved.  Appears calmer and clearer.
   VS notable for borderline tachy to 100
s, sat
ing on room air.
   Exam: unchanged.  Ronchi b/l.  No tremors.
   Labs, meds reviewed.
   Agree with plan for with SW, Psych re-eval, PT if agreeable.
   Difficult situation as lacks insight, but whether truly lacks capacity
   is not clear.
   Based on d/w psych, is not committable to psych facility.  Does lack
   insight (and thus capacity) d/t dementia regarding medical decision
   making, and likely to return home to EtOH abuse and subsequent falls.
   No medical reasons to keep her as is improved from withdrawal
   standpoint, no further treatment needed.
   Pt is adamant about leaving, and says that she will stop drinking and
   be more careful to avoid falling.  Currently appears that risks of
   pharmacological and physical restraints likely needed to keep patient
   here, outweigh potential benefits.
   D/w resident, pt, husband, to the best of my ability, need to stop EtOH
   abuse and need to ensure safety at home.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, currently admitted to the ICU for management of alcohol withdrawal. She was transferred from another hospital for a possible subarachnoid hemorrhage but her CT scan came back negative. The patient's current vital signs are within normal limits, with a blood pressure of 144/87 mmHg, heart rate of 92 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is alert and oriented, with no signs of distress or discomfort.

The patient has multiple superficial lesions on her back and lower extremities, which appear to be mild and without signs of infection. She has been prescribed Keflex as prophylaxis, and blood and wound cultures are pending. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is on a regular diet.

The patient's mental status is notable for poor insight into her overall situation, but she does not appear to be in immediate medical danger. She has been started on valium for alcohol withdrawal symptoms and has shown improvement. She is calm and non-tremulous, with a CIWA score of 2-18 off of valium. The patient has expressed a desire to leave the hospital against medical advice (AMA), but lacks the capacity to make this decision. She has been seen by psychiatry, who agrees that she lacks capacity and can be kept against her will. The patient is willing to stay at least overnight"

   Assessment and Plan: 62 year old female with a history of alcohol abuse
   transferred to this hospital for management of a possible subarachnoid
   hemorrhage now admitted to the MICU for management of alcohol
   withdrawal.  There are now significant concerns for her safety at home.
   Dementia/decision making: She has very poor insight into her overall
   situation and does not appear worried by her repeated falls while
   intoxicated at home.  She is showing more signs of dementia at this
   time, though we do not know her baseline functional status.  She does
   not show signs of delirium.  We cannot provide a safe discharge plan at
   this time and she does not have capacity to decide to leave AMA.
   - f/u psych recommendations
   - establish contact with patient
s PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Social work is trying to establish contact with her daughter.
   Alcohol withdrawal:  Now stable and has not gotten valium for over
   24hrs, making her stable for transfer to the floor.  Self reports long
   history of alcohol abuse which she says is improving, though alcohol
   level was in the 600s on presentation to [**Hospital3 **].  This
   morning she is calm, non-tremulous with CIWA scores of [**2-18**] off of
   valium.  She is unable to give a clear plan of how she will remain
   sober at home, but does not want to consider rehab.
   - continue valium 10 mg IV Q1H:PRN CIWA > 10
   - thiamine, folate, multivitamins
   - social work consult
   s/p fall:  Physical therapy felt the patient is so unsteady that she
   should have placement with 24 hour supervision/assistance and use a
   walker at all times if at home.  She was transferred for possible
   subarachnoid hemorrhage at OSH.  Here CT head and C-spine negative,
   C-spine cleared yesterday.  Her inability to understand that she is at
   imminent risks for falls is probably the main reason she needs to stay
   inpatient at this time.
   UTI:  Patient
s urine culture grew >100,000 gram negative rods.  She
   was already on Keflex for possible super-infection of her skin
   lesions.  We will not start any other antibiotics unless the GNRs are
   cephalosporin resistant.
   Skin Lesions:  Patient with multiple small superficial lesions on her
   back and lower extremities with mild erythema.  She has no leukocytosis

 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Assessment and Plan: 62 year old female with a history of alcohol abuse
   transferred to this hospital for management of a possible subarachnoid
   hemorrhage now admitted to the MICU for management of alcohol
   withdrawal.  She was not considered to have competency to leave AMA
   last night.
   Decision making: She has very poor insight into her overall situation
   and does not appear worried by her repeated falls while intoxicated at
   home.  She was seen by psych last night who did not feel she had
   capacity to risk withdrawal at home last night.  She does not have
   improved capacity today, but her risk of withdrawal is now largely
   passed.
   - Will talk again w/ psych this morning.  Her competency has not
   improved, but her imminent medical risk has also decreased.
   Alcohol withdrawal:  Self reports long history of alcohol abuse which
   she says is improving, though alcohol level was in the 600s on
   presentation to [**Hospital3 **].  This morning she is calm,
   non-tremulous with CIWA scores of [**2-18**] off of valium.  She is unable to
   give a clear plan of how she will remain sober at home, but does not
   want to consider rehab.
   - valium 10 mg IV Q1H:PRN CIWA > 10
   - thiamine, folate, multivitamins
   - social work consult -> she is now willing to talk to social work.
   s/p fall:  Patient currently confused and reports history of fall with
   possible head trauma.  Transferred for possible subarachnoid hemorrhage
   at OSH.  Here CT head and C-spine negative, C-spine cleared yesterday.
   She is still at high risk of falls at home and cannot articulate a plan
   to be safer at home.
   - PT eval.
   Skin Lesions:  Patient with multiple small superficial lesions on her
   back and lower extremities with mild erythema.  She has no leukocytosis
   or fevers and lesions do not appear super-infected.  We can continue
   Keflex while she is here pending wound cultures, but she does not need
   to go home with a course of antibiotics.
   - f/u blood and wound cultures.
   Tobacco Abuse:
   - nicotine patch
   FEN: regular diet, replete electrolytes.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   Communication: w/ patient and husband.  [**Name (NI) 133**] contact PCP today by
   email.
   Code: Full code.
   Dispo: She should stay here through the day to see if we can resolve
   pending issues and send her home tonight.  To floor in evening if still
   here.
