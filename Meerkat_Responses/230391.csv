   Assessment and Plan
   This [**Age over 90 **]M with CAD, dementia, afib, and prior strokes presents with
   hypotension and respiratory distress.
   1. Sepsis, pna
   Most likely pulmonary source, though consider also line infection
   (uncertain when PICC was placed). UTI also a consideration, though no
   bacteria on UA here. Given prior strokes at risk for aspiration.
   - continue empiric vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro for HAP coverage
   - culture blood, urine, sputum. need peripheral blood cx and PICC cx.
   check urine legionella ag. follow up outside micro.
   - clarify when PICC was placed
   - CVP goal of 10 with IV NS PRN
   - levophed to maintain map>65
   - check SVO2 goal >70
   - attempt to ventilate per ardsnet, but patient had wild swings in
   tidal volume.  Placed patient on PS and did much better
   - Monitor ABG
   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, very likely to
   have developed ATN in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - holding ACEI
   - urine lytes, eosinophils
   - renal recs appreciated, may need CVVH, at this point not indicated
   .
   3. Hypernatremia
   High sodium in the setting of poor PO intake, increased free H20 loss
   in the setting of fever. Estimated free water deficit ~4.6L
   - start D5W @ 125/hr to correct for water deficit and ongoing losses,
   changed overnight to D51/2 NS and then converted back to D5W.
   - follow Na q4hrs goal 0.5meq/hr correction
   - Start TF today with free water flushes to attempt to correct sodium
   and decrease need for IV therapy
   .
   4. Acidosis
   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   -          hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional
   volume resuscitation
   -          Avoid changing vent to increase RR and decrease CO2 as
   previously mentioned
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue amiodarone drip x24hrs per cards recs-last dose 2 PM today,
   will consider transitioning back to metoprolol subsequently, if not on
   pressure support and able to tolerate
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH though interpretation may be clouded by current
   illness
   .
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. In setting
   of infection must consider DIC but this seems less likely. Nutritional
   deficiency may be more likely.
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   - Followup smear, FDP, D-dimer- no evidence of DIC
   .
   7. CAD
   Patient's admission EKG with STD/TWI, most likely demand ischemia in
   setting of rapid rate. Tropn elevated but renal failure also
   complicates interpretation.
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes x2-elevated, but peaked
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 325
   .
   8. Anemia
   Hct 37 at admission was above recent baseline of ~33 likely reflecting
   hemoconcentration decrease to 32 on repeat today follows significant
   IVF resuscitation. No evidence of active bleeding
   - Follow Hct, coags, type and screen active
   .
   9. Tongue twitching
   ?Unmasking of old stroke in setting of infection. Consider also
   seizure.
   - Per Neuro start Keppra and continue to monitor, will consider need
   for long term treatment given other co-morbidities and prognosis
   .
   10. Depression
   - Holding remeron given altered mental status
   .
   11. Glaucoma
   - Continue home eye drops

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a chronically ill male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), dementia, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and prior strokes. He presents with hypotension and respiratory distress. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a suspected pulmonary source of infection, which may lead to sepsis. Empiric antibiotics have been started to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and possible line infection. Cultures have been ordered, including blood, urine, and sputum.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient likely had pre-renal acute kidney injury (AKI) due to decreased oral intake and subsequent hypotension. Monitoring urine output and adjusting medications accordingly is important. Renal replacement therapy may be required if the condition worsens.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which could be due to poor oral intake and increased free water loss. Estimated free water deficit is approximately 4.6 L. Intravenous fluids are being administered to correct the water deficit and ongoing losses.

4. Acidosis: The patient has mixed acid-base disturbances, including non-gap metabolic acidosis and gap metabolic acidosis related to renal failure. Further management will involve careful fluid resuscitation and adjustment of ventilator settings.

5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's AFib has resolved into"

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of chronic anemia, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU for aspiration pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and mixed acidosis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving oxygen and medications through various infusions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at higher risk of developing stress ulcers due to increased gastric acid secretion.

   Assessment and Plan
   This [**Age over 90 **]M with CAD, dementia, afib, and prior strokes presents with
   hypotension and respiratory distress.
   1. Sepsis, pna
   Most likely pulmonary source, though consider also line infection
   (uncertain when PICC was placed). UTI also a consideration, though no
   bacteria on UA here. Given prior strokes at risk for aspiration.
   - empiric vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro for HAP coverage
   - culture blood, urine, sputum. need peripheral blood cx and PICC cx.
   check urine legionella ag. follow up outside micro.
   - clarify when PICC was placed
   - CVP now ~10 so will hold off on additonal fluid resuscitation, target
   [**7-27**]
   - levophed to maintain map>65
   - check SVO2 goal >70
   - ventilate per ardsnet
   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, very likely to
   have developed ATN in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - holding ACEI
   - urine lytes, eosinophils
   - renal recs appreciated, may need CVVH
   .
   3. Hypernatremia
   High sodium in the setting of poor PO intake, increased free H20 loss
   in the setting of fever. Estimated free water deficit ~4.6L
   - start D5W @ 125/hr to correct for water deficit and ongoing losses
   - follow Na q4hrs goal 0.5meq/hr correction
   .
   4. Acidosis
   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   - hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional volume
   resuscitation
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue amiodarone drip x24hrs per cards recs, will consider
   transitioning back to metoprolol subsequently
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH though interpretation may be clouded by current
   illness
   .
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. In setting
   of infection must consider DIC but this seems less likely. Nutritional
   deficiency may be more likely.
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   - Followup smear, FDP, D-dimer
   .
   7. CAD
   Patient's admission EKG with STD/TWI, most likely demand ischemia in
   setting of rapid rate. Tropn elevated but renal failure also
   complicates interpretation.
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes x2
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 325
   .
   8. Anemia
   Hct 37 at admission was above recent baseline of ~33 likely reflecting
   hemoconcentration decrease to 32 on repeat today follows significant
   IVF resuscitation. No evidence of active bleeding
   - Follow Hct, coags, type and screen active
   .
   9. Tongue twitching
   ?Unmasking of old stroke in setting of infection. Consider also
   seizure.
   - D/w neuro re further eval ?role for keppra
   .
   10. Depression
   - Holding remeron given altered mental status
   .
   11. Glaucoma
   - Continue home eye drops

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a chronically ill appearing man in his 90s with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), dementia, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and prior strokes. The patient presents with hypotension and respiratory distress. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis, pneumonia: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis with a possible pulmonary source, which could be due to a hospital-acquired infection or a urinary tract infection (UTI). Empiric antibiotics have been started to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension. Close monitoring of urine output, renal dosing of medications, and consideration for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) will be necessary.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may be due to poor oral intake and increased free water loss. Correction of the sodium imbalance will require careful management.

4. Acidosis: The patient has a mixed disturbance of acid-base balance, with non-gap acidosis likely caused by fluid resuscitation and gap acidosis related to renal failure. Adjustments to fluid resuscitation and renal support will be needed.

5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient is now in sinus"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 94M with CAD, dementia, afib, and prior strokes presents with
   hypotension and respiratory distress.
   1. Sepsis, pna
   Most likely pulmonary source, though consider also line infection
   (uncertain when PICC was placed). UTI also a consideration, though no
   bacteria on UA here. Given prior strokes at risk for aspiration.
   - continue empiric vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro for HAP coverage
   - Sputum growing GNR, urine growing enterococcus
   - remove PICC today
   - CVP goal of 10 with IV NS PRN
   - levophed to maintain map>65
   - check SVO2 goal >70
   - attempt to extubated today given patient requiring minimal amount of
   support on ventilator
   - Monitor ABG
   -Place NG tube
   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, very likely to
   have developed ATN in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor urine output-has been good
   - renally dose meds
   - holding ACEI
   - urine lytes, eosinophils
   - renal recs appreciated, may need CVVH, at this point not indicated

   3. Hypernatremia
   High sodium in the setting of poor PO intake, increased free H20 loss
   in the setting of fever. Estimated free water deficit ~4.6L
   - start D5W @ 125/hr to correct for water deficit and ongoing losses,
   changed overnight to D51/2 NS and then converted back to D5W.
   - follow Na q6hrs goal 0.5meq/hr correction
   - Hold tube feeds today in anticipation of extubation, will start d5W
   at 75 cc/hour until TF resumed
   .
   4. Acidosis
   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   -          hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional
   volume resuscitation
   -          Avoid changing vent to increase RR and decrease CO2 as
   previously mentioned
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue amiodarone drip x24hrs per cards recs-last dose 2 PM
   yesterday, transition to metoprolol not successful, will start PO
   amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH when over illness
   .
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. In setting
   of infection must consider DIC but this seems less likely. Nutritional
   deficiency may be more likely. Followup smear, FDP, D-dimer- no
   evidence of DIC
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   .
   7. CAD
   Patient's admission EKG with STD/TWI, most likely demand ischemia in
   setting of rapid rate. Tropn elevated but renal failure also
   complicates interpretation.
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes x2-elevated, but peaked
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 325
   .
   8. Anemia
   Hct 37 at admission was above recent baseline of ~33 likely reflecting
   hemoconcentration decrease to 32 on repeat today follows significant
   IVF resuscitation. No evidence of active bleeding
   - Follow Hct, coags, type and screen active
   .
   9. Tongue twitching-?Unmasking of old stroke in setting of infection.
   Consider also seizure.
   -currently on [**Last Name (LF) 5122**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] discontinue today as sodium resolved and
   monitor patient closely for signs of recurrence
   .
   10. Depression
   - Holding remeron given altered mental status
   .
   11. Glaucoma
   - Continue home eye drops

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of chronic anemia, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU with aspiration pneumonia and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's current condition is as follows:

- Vital signs: The patient has a temperature of 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius), heart rate of 112 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 103/45 mmHg to 74/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) is ranging from 65-70 mmHg, and cardiac output is not assessed.
- Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 4,200 mL of fluids since midnight, with 2,027 mL given through IV fluids. The total output is 2,170 mL, including 320 mL of urine output.
- Respiratory support: The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 489 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 37.
- ABG results show pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, PaO2 of 225 mmHg, and HCO3- of 20 mEq/L.
- Physical examination findings are not assessed in peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other areas.
- Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.3 K/uL, elevated blood glucose level of 178 mg/dL, elevated creatinine level of 4.4 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 30.8%.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities including pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, chronic anemia, coronary artery disease, mixed acidosis, and coagulopathy.

Based on this information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis progression with organ dysfunction: The patient initially presented with sepsis without organ dysfunction but there is a risk of progression to septic shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute kidney injury: The elevated creatinine level and low urine output indicate potential acute kidney injury, which may require further evaluation and management.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and there is a risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances and underlying coronary artery disease.
5. Hyperglycemia: The elevated blood glucose level indicates poor glycemic control and requires monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating potential fluid overload, which can contribute to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory status.

It is important to note that"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 94M with CAD, dementia, afib, and prior strokes presents with
   hypotension and respiratory distress.
   1. Sepsis, pna
   Most likely pulmonary source, though consider also line infection
   (uncertain when PICC was placed). UTI also a consideration, though no
   bacteria on UA here. Given prior strokes at risk for aspiration.
   - continue empiric vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro for HAP coverage
   - culture blood, urine, sputum. need peripheral blood cx and PICC cx.
   check urine legionella ag. follow up outside micro.
   - clarify when PICC was placed
   - CVP goal of 10 with IV NS PRN
   - levophed to maintain map>65
   - check SVO2 goal >70
   - attempt to ventilate per ardsnet, but patient had wild swings in
   tidal volume.  Placed patient on PS and did much better
   - Monitor ABG
   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, very likely to
   have developed ATN in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - holding ACEI
   - urine lytes, eosinophils
   - renal recs appreciated, may need CVVH, at this point not indicated
   .
   3. Hypernatremia
   High sodium in the setting of poor PO intake, increased free H20 loss
   in the setting of fever. Estimated free water deficit ~4.6L
   - start D5W @ 125/hr to correct for water deficit and ongoing losses,
   changed overnight to D51/2 NS and then converted back to D5W.
   - follow Na q4hrs goal 0.5meq/hr correction
   - Start TF today with free water flushes to attempt to correct sodium
   and decrease need for IV therapy
   .
   4. Acidosis
   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   -          hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional
   volume resuscitation
   -          Avoid changing vent to increase RR and decrease CO2 as
   previously mentioned
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue amiodarone drip x24hrs per cards recs-last dose 2 PM today,
   will consider transitioning back to metoprolol subsequently, if not on
   pressure support and able to tolerate
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH though interpretation may be clouded by current
   illness
   .
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. In setting
   of infection must consider DIC but this seems less likely. Nutritional
   deficiency may be more likely.
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   - Followup smear, FDP, D-dimer- no evidence of DIC
   .
   7. CAD
   Patient's admission EKG with STD/TWI, most likely demand ischemia in
   setting of rapid rate. Tropn elevated but renal failure also
   complicates interpretation.
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes x2-elevated, but peaked
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 325
   .
   8. Anemia
   Hct 37 at admission was above recent baseline of ~33 likely reflecting
   hemoconcentration decrease to 32 on repeat today follows significant
   IVF resuscitation. No evidence of active bleeding
   - Follow Hct, coags, type and screen active
   .
   9. Tongue twitching
   ?Unmasking of old stroke in setting of infection. Consider also
   seizure.
   - Per Neuro start Keppra and continue to monitor, will consider need
   for long term treatment given other co-morbidities and prognosis
   .
   10. Depression
   - Holding remeron given altered mental status
   .
   11. Glaucoma
   - Continue home eye drops

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 94-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, dementia, atrial fibrillation, and prior strokes. The patient presents with hypotension and respiratory distress. The medical team suspects sepsis, possibly with a pulmonary source, but also considers line infection and urinary tract infection as potential causes. They have initiated empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and ciprofloxacin.

The patient has several other medical issues that need to be addressed. The team notes acute on chronic renal failure, hypernatremia, mixed acidosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, coagulopathy, coronary artery disease, chronic anemia, and depression. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, further electrolyte imbalances, persistent or new cardiac arrhythmias, infection-related complications, and potential deterioration in mental status. 

It is important for the medical team to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, urine output, electrolyte levels, and renal function. They should continue aggressive fluid resuscitation as needed, optimize antibiotic coverage, and provide supportive care for respiratory distress. Regular reassessment of the patient's condition and prompt management of any complications are crucial for the patient's well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   This [**Age over 90 **]M with CAD, dementia, afib, and prior strokes presents with
   hypotension and respiratory distress.
   1. Hypotension/Sepsis: Currently under treatment for PNA with untyped
   GNR in sputum.  His blood pressure and heart rate remain labile,
   although they have been stable since an episode of hypotension/Afib
   overnight.  The cause/effect relationship between his blood pressure
   and afib is unclear.  Successfully extubated and satting well on room
   air.
   - Zosyn/Cipro for HAP coverage
   - Sputum growing GNR, urine growing enterococcus
   - CVP goal of 10 with IV NS PRN
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, very likely to
   have developed ATN in the setting of hypotension. UOP and creatinine
   improving.
   - monitor urine output-has been good
   - renally dose meds
   - holding ACEI
   3. Hypernatremia
   High sodium in the setting of poor PO intake, increased free H20 loss
   in the setting of fever.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Na checks
   - Free water bolus with tube feed, Hold IVF
   4. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue Amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH when over illness
   5. Acidosis: Improving
   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   -          hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional
   volume resuscitation
   -          Avoid changing vent to increase RR and decrease CO2 as
   previously mentioned
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. No evidence
   of DIC or hemolysis
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   7. CAD
   Patient's admission EKG with STD/TWI, most likely demand ischemia in
   setting of rapid rate. Tropn elevated but renal failure also
   complicates interpretation.
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes x2-elevated, but peaked
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 325
   8. Anemia: Hct 37 at admission was above recent baseline of ~33 likely
   reflecting hemoconcentration decrease to 32 on repeat today follows
   significant IVF resuscitation. No evidence of active bleeding
   - Follow Hct, coags, type and screen active
   9. Tongue twitching-?Unmasking of old stroke in setting of infection.
   Consider also seizure.
   -currently on [**Last Name (LF) 5122**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] discontinue today as sodium resolved and
   monitor patient closely for signs of recurrence
   10. Depression
   - Holding remeron given altered mental status
   11. Glaucoma
   - Continue home eye drops

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly man with a history of CAD, dementia, atrial fibrillation, and prior strokes. He presented with hypotension and respiratory distress. He was intubated but successfully extubated without difficulty. The patient has been treated for pneumonia with an unidentified Gram-negative rod (GNR) in his sputum. His blood pressure and heart rate have been labile but stable since an episode of hypotension and atrial fibrillation overnight. He is currently on Zosyn/Cipro for hospital-acquired pneumonia coverage, and his sputum is also growing enterococcus. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) goal is set at 10 with intravenous normal saline (NS) as needed. 

The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, likely pre-renal with decreased oral intake. He may have developed acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension. His urine output and creatinine levels are improving. Renal dosing of medications is recommended, and ACE inhibitors should be held. The patient also has hypernatremia, possibly due to poor oral intake, increased free water loss in the setting of fever, and high sodium levels. Frequent sodium checks and a free water bolus with tube feeds are advised. 

The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which has now resolved. Amiodarone 200 mg is being"

   Disposition:
","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. The patient had a PICC line placed at an unknown date and it was stopped on [**2163-1-3**] at 10:05 AM. The patient was also on invasive ventilation, which was stopped and the patient was extubated without difficulty. Tube feeds were restarted, and the patient complained of pain, unable to localize, given Tylenol. Renal recommended starting D51/2NS as maintenance fluids along with tube feeds and flushes for hypernatremia and elevated creatinine. The patient went back into atrial fibrillation at 8:30 PM, was hypotensive, and received a 500cc fluid bolus. By 11 PM, the patient was back in normal sinus rhythm in the 70s with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 70 without giving metoprolol. Vancomycin levels were at 17.1, and 1 gram of Vancomycin was given. The nurse commented that the patient's pupils are not reactive, but it is unclear if this is secondary to cataract surgery.

   Assessment and Plan
   This [**Age over 90 **]M with CAD, dementia, afib, and prior strokes presents with
   hypotension and respiratory distress.
   1. Sepsis, pna
   Most likely pulmonary source, though consider also line infection
   (uncertain when PICC was placed). UTI also a consideration, though no
   bacteria on UA here. Given prior strokes at risk for aspiration.
   - continue empiric vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro for HAP coverage
   - Sputum growing GNR, urine growing enterococcus
   - remove PICC today
   - CVP goal of 10 with IV NS PRN
   - levophed to maintain map>65
   - check SVO2 goal >70
   - attempt to extubated today given patient requiring minimal amount of
   support on ventilator
   - Monitor ABG
   -Place NG tube
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, very likely to
   have developed ATN in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor urine output-has been good
   - renally dose meds
   - holding ACEI
   - urine lytes, eosinophils
   - renal recs appreciated, may need CVVH, at this point not indicated
   3. Hypernatremia
   High sodium in the setting of poor PO intake, increased free H20 loss
   in the setting of fever. Estimated free water deficit ~4.6L
   - start D5W @ 125/hr to correct for water deficit and ongoing losses,
   changed overnight to D51/2 NS and then converted back to D5W.
   - follow Na q6hrs goal 0.5meq/hr correction
   - Hold tube feeds today in anticipation of extubation, will start d5W
   at 75 cc/hour until TF resumed
   4. Acidosis
   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   -          hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional
   volume resuscitation
   -          Avoid changing vent to increase RR and decrease CO2 as
   previously mentioned
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue amiodarone drip x24hrs per cards recs-last dose 2 PM
   yesterday, transition to metoprolol not successful, will start PO
   amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH when over illness
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. In setting
   of infection must consider DIC but this seems less likely. Nutritional
   deficiency may be more likely. Followup smear, FDP, D-dimer- no
   evidence of DIC
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   7. CAD
   Patient's admission EKG with STD/TWI, most likely demand ischemia in
   setting of rapid rate. Tropn elevated but renal failure also
   complicates interpretation.
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes x2-elevated, but peaked
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 325
   8. Anemia: Hct 37 at admission was above recent baseline of ~33 likely
   reflecting hemoconcentration decrease to 32 on repeat today follows
   significant IVF resuscitation. No evidence of active bleeding
   - Follow Hct, coags, type and screen active
   9. Tongue twitching-?Unmasking of old stroke in setting of infection.
   Consider also seizure.
   -currently on [**Last Name (LF) 5122**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] discontinue today as sodium resolved and
   monitor patient closely for signs of recurrence
   10. Depression
   - Holding remeron given altered mental status
   11. Glaucoma
   - Continue home eye drops
   FEN: Hold TF-restart when extubated with free water flushes,
   IVF-D5W-d/c when taking TF, replete lytes

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of CAD, dementia, atrial fibrillation, and prior strokes. He presented with hypotension and respiratory distress. The patient's current condition includes sepsis, pneumonia, acute-on-chronic renal failure, hypernatremia, acidosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, coagulopathy, coronary artery disease, anemia, tongue twitching, depression, and glaucoma.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is likely suffering from sepsis due to a pulmonary source, possibly a lung infection. This can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is an infection in the lungs. This can cause respiratory distress and further complications if left untreated.

3. Acute-on-chronic renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can be exacerbated by factors such as hypotension and dehydration. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as well as the accumulation of waste products in the body.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high levels of sodium in his blood, likely due to poor oral intake and increased free water loss. If not corrected, this can lead to neurological complications.

5. Acidosis: The patient has a mixed disturbance of acid-base balance, with both non-gap and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with severe dementia, a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), atrial fibrillation (AFib), who presented with respiratory distress, fever, and AF from a nursing home. He was treated for sepsis/pneumonia and intubated yesterday. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/36 to 218/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. He is currently receiving invasive ventilation, and his ABG results indicate a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 286. The patient's physical examination reveals that he is thin, has normal heart sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and no skin abnormalities. Laboratory results show normal WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin and platelet levels, elevated creatinine and blood glucose levels, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's respiratory failure has improved, and he is likely recovering from aspiration pneumonia. His atrial fibrillation is currently rate-controlled on amiodarone. The patient's acute on chronic renal failure has also improved with hydration. He is being provided with nutrition through a fiber source and free water through tube feeding. The patient's"
