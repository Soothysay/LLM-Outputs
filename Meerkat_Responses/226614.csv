   Assessment and Plan
   37F with widely advanced metastatic colon CA, now presenting with
   fever, hypoxia, repsiratory distress, and probable sepsis.
   .
   #. Hypoxia/respiratory failure - DDx includes infectious process,
   although unlikely flu given recent negative DFA. Has a history of RML
   bronchial collpase due to tumor progression, and LUL threatening on
   recent CT, so this may be the etiology as well +/- post obstrcutive
   PNA. finally, given malignancy, PE is also on the differential.
   -- continue broad spectrum antibiosis with vanc/cefepime. Will not add
   levo as she worsened with this as an outpatient
   -- no flu treatment given recent negative DFA
   -- sputum for G+S and culture, fungal culture and PCP given steroid use
   -- per IP, no possibility of stenting via bronch given subsegmental
   nature of any collapse
   -- continue current vent settings for now
   -- defer CT-A for now as would be unable to anticoagulate given ongoing
   brain mets and recent brain surgery/XRT
   .
   #. Hypotension - sepsis is most liekly etiology. In ED, never required
   pressors, with a normal lactate. Nonetheless, was febrile and
   tachypneic with suspected pulm source, making sepsis most likely. PE or
   pericardial effusion could explain hypoTN, but no effusion seen on CT 1
   week ago, and would be unable to treat PE given brain mets/recent
   surgery.
   -- IVF boluses to CVP 8-12
   -- prn pressors for MAP >55
   -- broad spectrum antibiotics as above
   -- f/u blood and urine cultures, send sputum as above
   -- stress dose hydrocostisone given ongoing outpt dexamethasone use
   -- check pulsus
   .
   #. Stage 4 metastatic colon CA - s/p
   -- will contact outpatient oncology team, no inpatient tx for now
   -- continue keppra
   -- onc SW consult
   .
   # FEN:
   -- begin TFs via OGT after nutrition consult
   .
   PPX:
   --DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   --Bowel regimen colace/senna
   --Pain management with IV sedation (fent/midaz)
   .
   # CODE STATUS:
   Confirmed full code in ED. Discussed extensively with patient and HCP,
   patient agreed to full code for now with intubation, but is clear that
   she would not like to be vented long-term and understands the risks of
   not ever getting off of the ventilator.

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of advanced metastatic colon cancer, presenting with fever, hypoxia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis. She is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation. The patient has a wide range of medical issues, including stage 4 metastatic colon cancer, respiratory failure, hypotension, and possible pulmonary embolism. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and sedation. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. Her blood work indicates leukocytosis and an elevated lactate level. She has multiple lines and drains in place, including an arterial line, multi-lumen catheter, and indwelling port. The patient's code status is full code, and she has expressed a desire not to be ventilated long-term. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress suggests a possible infectious process, which could lead to sepsis. Immediate management should focus on continued broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and source control.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already on invasive ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Continued monitoring and management of her respiratory status are crucial. Adjustments to ventilator settings may be necessary, and weaning off ventilation should be considered once the patient's condition improves.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure"

   37F with widely advanced metastatic colon CA, now presenting with
   fever, hypoxia, repsiratory distress, and probable sepsis.
   .
   #. Hypoxia/respiratory failure - DDx includes infectious process,
   although unlikely flu given recent negative DFA. Has a history of RML
   bronchial collpase due to tumor progression, and LUL threatening on
   recent CT, so this may be the etiology as well +/- post obstrcutive
   PNA. finally, given malignancy, PE is also on the differential.
   -- continue broad spectrum antibiosis with vanc/cefepime. Will not add
   levo as she worsened with this as an outpatient
   -- no flu treatment given recent negative DFA
   -- sputum for G+S and culture, fungal culture and PCP given steroid use
   -- per IP, no possibility of stenting via bronch given subsegmental
   nature of any collapse
   -- continue current vent settings for now
   -- defer CT-A for now as would be unable to anticoagulate given ongoing
   brain mets and recent brain surgery/XRT
   .
   #. Hypotension - sepsis is most liekly etiology. In ED, never required
   pressors, with a normal lactate. Nonetheless, was febrile and
   tachypneic with suspected pulm source, making sepsis most likely. PE or
   pericardial effusion could explain hypoTN, but no effusion seen on CT 1
   week ago, and would be unable to treat PE given brain mets/recent
   surgery.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with widely advanced metastatic colon cancer presenting with fever, hypoxia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis. The patient is intubated and sedated, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 101/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on invasive ventilation, multi-lumen, arterial line, and indwelling port.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient has alopecia and a well-healed craniotomy scar. Physical examination reveals bronchial breath sounds at the left lower lobe with coarsened breath sounds throughout, indicating potential lung involvement. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 280 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, normal glucose level of 100 mg/dL, low sodium level of 0.1 mg/dL, normal potassium level of 22 mEq/L, elevated magnesium level of 6 mg/dL, and normal calcium level of 7.4 mg/dL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 37-year-old female with advanced metastatic colon cancer presenting with fever, hypoxia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis.
- The patient is intubated and sedated, with no spontaneous respiratory effort.
- She has a history of right middle lobe bronchial collapse due to tumor progression and left upper lobe threatening collapse on recent CT scan.
- Possible causes of hypoxia include infectious process, post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA), and pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanc/cefepime), levofloxacin for atypical coverage, and flagyl for anaerobic coverage.
- Sputum cultures, fungal culture, and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) testing are planned due to steroid use.
- Ventilator settings are being continued for now.
- A computed tomography angiogram (CT-A) has been deferred due to ongoing brain metastases and recent brain surgery/XRT.
- Hypotension is likely due to sepsis, with an initial plan to give IV fluid boluses to maintain CVP between 8-12 and titrate levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65.
- Blood and urine cultures, as well as sputum cultures, are pending.
- Stress dose hydrocortisone is being administered due to ongoing outpatient dexamethasone"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK):  Hypovolemic or sepsis.  Aggressively volume
   resusitated overnight with increased urine output.  Weaning pressors.
   She has been on steroids so she is on stress dose steroids.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), COLORECTAL (COLON CANCER):  Brain and
   lung mets, refractory to prior courses of chemoRx.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]) ON CHRONIC:  Colon Ca with
   mets to the lung, now with superimposed pneumonia, can't rule out a
   postobstructive component.  Secretions now smaller in amount from ETT,
   rusty in color.  No frank hemoptysis.  On vanco/cefipime.  Will add
   atypical coverage wih levoquin and flagyl for anaerobic coverage.

   Assessment and Plan
   37F with widely advanced metastatic colon CA, now presenting with
   fever, hypoxia, repsiratory distress, and probable sepsis.
   .
   #. Hypoxia/respiratory failure - DDx includes infectious process,
   although unlikely flu given recent negative DFA. Has a history of RML
   bronchial collpase due to tumor progression, and LUL threatening on
   recent CT, so this may be the etiology as well +/- post obstrcutive
   PNA. finally, given malignancy, PE is also on the differential.
   -- continue broad spectrum antibiosis with vanc/cefepime. Will add
   levofloxacin for atypical coverage as well as flagyl for anaerobic
   coverage given possibility of post-obstructive PNA
   -- no flu treatment given recent negative DFA
   -- sputum for G+S and culture, fungal culture and PCP given steroid use
   -- per IP, no possibility of stenting via bronch given subsegmental
   nature of any collapse
   -- continue current vent settings for now
   -- defer CT-A for now as would be unable to anticoagulate given ongoing
   brain mets and recent brain surgery/XRT
   .
   #. Hypotension - sepsis is most liekly etiology. In ED, never required
   pressors, with a normal lactate. Nonetheless, was febrile and
   tachypneic with suspected pulm source, making sepsis most likely. PE or
   pericardial effusion could explain hypoTN, but no effusion seen on CT 1
   week ago, and would be unable to treat PE given brain mets/recent
   surgery.
   -- IVF boluses to CVP 8-12
   -- levophed titrate to MAP > 65; currently on 0.03, ct wean
   -- broad spectrum antibiotics as above
   -- f/u blood and urine cultures, send sputum as above
   -- stress dose hydrocostisone given ongoing outpt dexamethasone use
   -- check pulsus
   -- check PM HCT
   .
   #. Stage 4 metastatic colon CA - s/p
   -- will contact outpatient oncology team, no inpatient tx for now
   -- continue keppra
   -- onc SW consult
   .
   # FEN:
   -- begin TFs via OGT after nutrition consult
   .  .
   # CODE STATUS:
   Confirmed full code in ED. Discussed extensively with patient and HCP,
   patient agreed to full code for now with intubation, but is clear that
   she would not like to be vented long-term and understands the risks of
   not ever getting off of the ventilator.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with widely advanced metastatic colon cancer, who is now presenting with fever, hypoxia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient experienced desaturation in the afternoon, and chest X-ray was not significantly different.
- The patient appeared to be fighting the ventilator, so the ventilator settings were changed.
- The patient's oxygen saturation levels improved to 95-100% after the changes in ventilator settings.
- No further IVF boluses were given due to concern about pulmonary edema as the cause of earlier desaturation.
- The patient became more hypotensive and received a 500cc normal saline bolus overnight. Levo was still at 0.5.
- Allergy information is documented, including a dystonic reaction to Compazine (oral).
- The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics (Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, Cefepime, Metronidazole) at different times.
- Infusions include norepinephrine, fentanyl, and midazolam.
- Other medications are also listed, including ICU-specific medications.
- The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are all documented.

   37F with widely metastatic colon CA, now presenting with fever,
   hypoxia, repsiratory distress, and probable sepsis.
   .
   #. Respiratory failure - Has a history of RML bronchial collpase due to
   tumor progression, and LUL threatening on recent CT, so this may be the
   etiology as well +/- post obstrcutive PNA. Finally, given malignancy,
   PE is also on the differential.
   -- continue broad spectrum coverage with
   vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin/flagyl
   -- f/u pending culture
   -- per IP, no possibility of stenting via bronch given subsegmental
   nature of any collapse
   -- Satting 100% -> wean FIO2
   -- defer CTA for now
   .
   #. Hypotension - Sepsis is most likely etiology. Pericardial effusion
   could explain hypoTN, but no effusion seen on CT one week ago. PE in
   differential but would be difficult to treat given brain mets/recent
   surgery.
   -- IVF boluses to CVP 8-12
   -- levophed titrate to MAP > 65; currently on 0.5
   -- f/u pending culture
   -- stress dose hydrocostisone given ongoing outpt dexamethasone use
   -- check PM HCT

   Code status:  FULL
   Confirmed full code in ED. Discussed extensively with patient and HCP,
   patient agreed to full code for now with intubation, but is clear that
   she would not like to be vented long-term and understands the risks of
   not ever getting off of the ventilator.
   Disposition: [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of widely metastatic colon cancer, presenting with fever, hypoxia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 108/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2. She is also receiving vasopressor support with norepinephrine. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 23500 cells/mm3, elevated lactate levels at 4 mg/dL, and decreased platelet count at 28000/mm3. Her blood cultures are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure - The patient has a history of right middle lobe bronchial collapse due to tumor progression, and left upper lobe threatening on recent CT scan. This may be the etiology of her current respiratory failure, possibly in combination with post-obstructive pneumonia. Pneumothorax is also on the differential. The patient will continue on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin/flagyl), and her response will be monitored. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) will be deferred"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/73 to 154/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range, and fluid balance shows an intake of 3,274 mL and output of 2,180 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's laboratory results indicate normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, but elevated levels of creatinine and lactic acid. The patient's troponin-T level is below the detection limit.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are below the normal range, indicating hypotension. This could be due to sepsis or volume depletion.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, suggesting acute respiratory failure. Further evaluation is needed to determine if it is"

   Assessment and Plan
   37F with widely metastatic colon CA, now presenting with fever,
   hypoxia, repsiratory distress, and probable sepsis.
   .
   #. Respiratory failure - Has a history of RML bronchial collpase due to
   tumor progression, and LUL threatening on recent CT, so this may be the
   etiology as well +/- post obstrcutive PNA. Finally, given malignancy,
   PE is also on the differential.
   -- continue broad spectrum coverage with
   vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin/flagyl
   -- f/u pending culture
   -- per IP, no possibility of stenting via bronch given subsegmental
   nature of any collapse
   -- Satting 100% -> wean FIO2
   -- defer CTA for now
   .
   #. Hypotension - Sepsis is most likely etiology. Pericardial effusion
   could explain hypoTN, but no effusion seen on CT one week ago. PE in
   differential but would be difficult to treat given brain mets/recent
   surgery.
   -- IVF boluses to CVP 8-12
   -- levophed titrate to MAP > 65; currently on 0.5
   -- f/u pending culture
   -- stress dose hydrocostisone given ongoing outpt dexamethasone use
   -- check PM HCT

   Code status:  FULL
   Confirmed full code in ED. Discussed extensively with patient and HCP,

   Disposition: [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer presenting with fever, hypoxia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis. The patient has a history of right middle lobe bronchial collapse due to tumor progression, left upper lobe threatening on recent CT, and thus respiratory failure may be etiology as well. There is also a possibility of pulmonary embolism.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a decreased FiO2 to 40%, given albumin 25 gm IV, changed vancomycin dosing from 1000 mg Q12H to 1250 mg Q12H, weaned levophed, and received a 500 cc NS bolus to support BP due to SBP of high 70s. The patient was restarted on levophed after Lasix bolus but experienced bradycardia in the 40s. Pacer pads were placed, and atropine was drawn up, but the patient had spontaneous improvement in heart rate. A stat CXR was ordered, and the patient was lightly sedated and fighting the vent -> desatted to 60s for a few seconds -> increased sedation with normalization of O2 saturation and other vital signs.

The patient has a trace LE edema, symmetric, 2+ dorsalis pedis/posterior tibial pulses. The most recent labs show a WBC count of 8.8, H"

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of widely metastatic colon cancer, presenting with fever, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis. She has a history of right middle lobe bronchial collapse due to tumor progression and left upper lobe threatening on recent CT, suggesting possible etiology for her respiratory failure. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin/flagyl) and being monitored for cultures.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension, which is likely due to sepsis. A pericardial effusion could explain her low blood pressure, but no effusion was seen on the recent CT scan. Pulmonary embolism is another possibility, but it would be difficult to treat given her brain metastases and recent surgery. The patient is receiving IV fluid boluses to maintain CVP between 8-12, levophed titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60, and stress dose hydrocortisone due to ongoing outpatient dexamethasone use.

Additionally, the patient has stage 4 metastatic colon cancer and is being followed up with oncology recommendations. She is on keppra for seizure prophylaxis in the setting of brain metastases. Oncology SW consult and repeat head imaging are being considered.

The patient had an episode of bradycardia in the 40s, for which she was put"

","The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of metastatic colon cancer, presenting with fever, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to bronchial collapse caused by tumor progression, as well as hypotension likely secondary to sepsis. The patient also has stage 4 metastatic colon cancer and brain metastases.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. The bronchial collapse caused by tumor progression may worsen, leading to further compromise in lung function.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, hypertension, and worsening oxygenation suggest an ongoing infection, which can progress to sepsis if not adequately managed. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis-induced vasodilation. If not promptly treated, it can lead to organ hypoperfusion and dysfunction. IV fluid boluses and vasopressor support have been started, but the response should be closely monitored.

4. Stage 4 metastatic colon cancer: The patient's underlying malignancy continues to progress, with multiple metastatic sites. Treatment options should be discussed with the oncology team, considering the patient's current"

   #. Respiratory failure - Has a history of RML bronchial collpase due to
   tumor progression, and LUL threatening on recent CT, so this may be the
   etiology as well +/- post obstrcutive PNA.
   -- continue broad spectrum coverage with vanc/ cefepime/ levofloxacin/
   flagyl
   -- f/u pending cultures
   -- keep on current level of sedation
   -- family mtg to d/c GOC
   .
   #. Hypotension - Sepsis is most likely etiology. Pericardial effusion
   could explain hypoTN, but no effusion seen on CT one week ago. PE in
   differential but would be difficult to treat given brain mets/recent
   surgery.
   -- IVF boluses to CVP 8-12
   -- levophed titrate to MAP > 60
   -- f/u pending cultures
   -- stress dose hydrocostisone given ongoing outpt dexamethasone use

","The patient is a 37-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who presented with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, fever, and probable sepsis. The patient's medical history includes RML bronchial collapse due to tumor progression and LUL threatening on recent CT. 

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 15 cmH2O. Her oxygen saturation is maintained at 96% with an FiO2 of 50%. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/62 mmHg to 150/76 mmHg, and a temperature of 36.4°C. 

The patient has a history of colon cancer with widespread metastasis. The assessment indicates that the patient may be experiencing respiratory failure due to the tumor progression causing bronchial collapse and potential post-obstructive pneumonia. 

Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage is being continued with vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, and flagyl, pending culture results. The patient's sedation level will be kept at the current level. 

The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis. Intravenous fluid boluses will be given to maintain a central venous pressure between 8-12 mmHg. Levophed will be titrated to maintain a mean"

","The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of colorectal cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to lung metastases and pneumonia. The patient is intubated and sedated, with vital signs stable but showing signs of potential complications such as bradycardia and fluid imbalance. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose levels, and liver enzymes. Chest X-ray shows stable bilateral infiltrates and an endotracheal tube in place.

The assessment and plan include monitoring for hemorrhage, continuing antibiotics, addressing ventilator settings, and considering a head CT to evaluate for any potential hemorrhage. The patient also has a port-a-cath placed for medication administration and an arterial line for continuous blood pressure monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI)."

","Summary:
The patient is an intubated 47-year-old male with a history of colorectal cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to lung metastasis and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/62 to 93/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 96%, and temperature within normal range. The patient is receiving various medications including sedatives, analgesics, antibiotics, and other ICU medications. Fluid balance and hemodynamic monitoring are being closely monitored. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Chest X-ray shows stable bilateral infiltrates with endotracheal tube and central venous line in place. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, with plans to discuss goals of care with the family. Potential complications may include worsening respiratory failure, infection, and bleeding due to the use of anticoagulant therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is closely monitored due to lung metastasis and pneumonia. Any deterioration in oxygenation or ventilation parameters may indicate a worsening respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating a concern for infection. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis or infection is important, and appropriate antibiotic"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension and is being weaned off the pressor as tolerated.
- The patient also has bradycardia, which has improved but will be continued to be monitored. A head CT is being considered to investigate potential hemorrhage if the bradycardia continues.
- The patient has a history of colon cancer (malignant neoplasm) and is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to lung metastases and pneumonia.
- Antibiotics have been continued, and the patient is being transitioned to pressure support ventilation (PSV) with consideration for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) in the morning.
- The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and management of arterial lines, multi-lumen lines, and an indwelling port.
- Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory failure and pneumonia increase the risk of further deterioration in lung function, potentially leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures can"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to lung metastases and pneumonia. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 15 cmH2O. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 103/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics since admission, including levofloxacin, cefepime, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of hypotension and bradycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying condition of respiratory failure may worsen due to the presence of lung metastases and pneumonia. Monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be crucial to assess the effectiveness of the current management plan.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management, such as weaning off the pressor as tolerated, will be necessary to maintain adequate perfusion.

3. Bradycardia: The patient is experiencing bradycardia, which could be related to the patient's overall condition or potential medication effects. Regular monitoring of heart rate"

   Confirmed full code in ED. Discussed extensively with patient and HCP,

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer, presenting with fever, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by multifactorial issues such as pneumonia, bronchial collapse, and tumor progression. She also has hypotension likely due to sepsis and a possible pericardial effusion. She has stage 4 metastatic colon cancer, for which she requires oncology recommendations and a consult. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of probable sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate septic shock, which can further compromise organ perfusion and lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
4. Pericardial effusion: Although not confirmed on recent CT scan, the presence of a pericardial effusion could explain the hypotension and may require intervention to prevent cardiac tamponade.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and malignancy increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to potentially fatal complications like pulmonary embolism if not prevented with appropriate proph"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has a history of widely metastatic colon cancer and is currently presenting with fever, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis.
- The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including pneumonia, bronchial collapse due to tumor progression, and left upper lobe collapse.
- The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin/flagyl) and will follow up pending cultures.
- The patient's sedation level will be kept current, and a family meeting will be conducted to discuss goals of care.
- The patient's hypotension is believed to be caused by sepsis, and IVF boluses are being given to maintain CVP between 8-12. Levophed will be titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
- The patient has stage 4 metastatic colon cancer and will be followed up with oncology recommendations. Seizure prophylaxis with keppra will continue in the setting of brain metastases, and an oncology social worker consult will be made.
- The patient's nutrition plan involves tube feeds, and glycemic control will be maintained using an insulin sliding scale.
- The patient has multiple lines in place, including a multi-lumen line inserted on 12/4, an indwelling port inserted"

   Assessment and Plan
   37 yo female with history of colon cancer--widely metastatic to lung
   and brain, and now presenting with respiratory failure with significant
   pneumonia and pulmonary edema accompanied by sepsis leading to
   prolonged intubation.  She now has persistent and significant O2 and
   PEEP requirement with inability to establish a wean in levels of
   support across time.  The primary barrier  at this point is related to
   the patients metastatic colon cancer and likely related post
   obstructive pneumonia which has led to persistent and signfiicant
   hypoxemia and substantial requirement for continued ventilatory
   support.
   1)Sepsis-
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Levo/Flagyl
   -Continue with Hydrocortisone support to aid with sepsis support but
   has resolved with pressors discontinued and infection improved in
   regards to systemic insult which is likely from pulmonary primary
   2)Cancer--Colon Cancer with Pulmonary Metastases
has gone through max
   dosing and evaluation for XRT at this time.
   -Keppra
   -Will have continued issues with obstruction and pneumonia fully
   treated
   -Will have to discuss move to CMO status following intervention
   3)Respiratory Failure-
   -Will continue with A/C support
   -Will re-trial PSV as possible but will have continued issue with
   worsening LUL collapse.

","The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of metastatic colon cancer, presenting with respiratory failure due to significant pneumonia and pulmonary edema accompanied by sepsis. The patient requires prolonged intubation and has persistent and significant O2 and PEEP requirements, with an inability to wean off ventilatory support. The primary barrier to weaning is the patient's metastatic colon cancer and related post-obstructive pneumonia, leading to persistent hypoxemia and substantial continued ventilatory support.

The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics (Vancomycin, Cefepime, Levofloxacin, and Metronidazole) for sepsis, as well as hydrocortisone to aid with sepsis support. The cancer is being managed with medication and evaluation for radiation therapy. The respiratory failure is being supported with assist-control ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening pneumonia and pulmonary edema, persistent hypoxemia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and barotrauma. The patient's underlying malignancy may also contribute to additional complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, including oxygenation and ventilation parameters, and adjust the ventilator settings accordingly. Regular assessment of blood cultures and antibiotic therapy should be done to ensure appropriate management of sepsis. Frequent evaluation of the patient's pulmonary function and imaging studies will help monitor the progression of pneumonia and pulmonary"

- She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a decreased PEEP from 15 to 12, and FiO2 from 50% to 40%.
- The patient has experienced episodes of desaturation in the 80s with movement, hypertension, tachycardia, and dyssynchrony with the ventilator.
- She continues to have large residuals (>60 cc) on 10cc/hr tube feeds and has not had a bowel movement in several days.
- The patient opens her eyes spontaneously but does not track.
- PEEP was decreased from 12 to 10, resulting in lower oxygen saturation levels.
- The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pneumonia and sepsis.
- She has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, and stage 4 metastatic colon cancer.
- The patient is being closely monitored and managed for ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty in breathing, which may be due to multifactorial causes such as pneumonia, bronchial collapse, and tumor progression. Continuous monitoring and management of her respiratory status"

   Confirmed full code in ED. Discussed extensively with patient and HCP,
   patient agreed to full code for now with intubation, but is clear that
   she would not like to be vented long-term and understands the risks of
   not ever getting off of the ventilator.
   Disposition: [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
","The patient is a 37-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who presents with fever, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 110/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 8.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, sodium of 112 mg/dL, potassium of 3.7 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.2 mg/dL, and glucose of 136 mg/dL. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) values are pH 7.45, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 50 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 253, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) 99%. 

The patient has a history of stage 4 metastatic colon cancer and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis. She is also on seizure prophylaxis with Keppra due to brain metastases. 

The patient's medical team is planning to continue aggressive efforts for now, as per the family's request. They are decreasing the positive end"

   Confirmed full code in ED. Discussed extensively with patient and HCP,
   patient agreed to full code for now with intubation, but is clear that
   she would not like to be vented long-term and understands the risks of
   not ever getting off of the ventilator.
   Disposition: [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer, currently in the ICU for fever, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis. She has respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes including pneumonia, bronchial collapse, and tumor progression. She is also hypotensive, likely due to sepsis, and has a pericardial effusion. The patient has stage 4 metastatic colon cancer and requires oncology follow-up. She is receiving aggressive care in the ICU, including tube feeds, insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, multi-lumen lines, an indwelling port, arterial line, DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP bundle. The patient has a full code status and has expressed her wishes not to be ventilated long-term.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to various factors such as pneumonia, bronchial collapse, and tumor progression. If not managed properly, this could lead to further respiratory compromise and potential need for long-term mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient is presenting with signs of sepsis, including fever, hypoxemia, and hypotension. If not promptly treated, sepsis can progress to septic shock, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially fatal outcomes.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be attributed to sepsis or"

   Assessment and Plan
   37 yo female with significant extensive metastatic colon cancer noted
   and with persistent respiratory failure in the setting of extensive
   pulmonary lesions and with likely superimposed bacterial pneumonia.
   She has persistent and significant respiratory failure which has been
   refractory to weaning attempts in past but we have moved to decrease
   the PEEP levels with mild decrease in PaO2 noted.
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])-This remains a dominant
   problem
we have compliance of 20 this morning and with wean of PEEP we
   have seen substantial decrease in PaO2 and have concern for worsening
   atelectasis in the lower lobes noted.  This is likely secondary to
   malignancy and with superimposed infection.  We do not have, however,
   evidence of significant active infection present as WBC has normalized,
   fever  is absent.
   -Will continue with Cefepime
   -WIll continue with Hydrocort
   -Versed/Fentanyl
   -Will return PEEP to 15 if unable to tolerate current decrease
   2)Breast Cancer-
   -We have not evidence of any therapeutic intervention available and
   will continue to provide supportive care at this time.
   -This was presented with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 239**] and no intervention is possible

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 37-year-old female with extensive metastatic colon cancer and persistent respiratory failure.
- She has been unresponsive to weaning attempts and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10 and FiO2 of 0.4.
- The patient's oxygen saturation decreased to 90% when PEEP was decreased, indicating potential worsening atelectasis in the lower lobes.
- Her current goals of care are to continue current levels of support.
- The patient has high residuals in the setting of only 10cc/hr tube feeds.
- She has allergies to Compazine and has received antibiotics including Levofloxacin, Metronidazole, Vancomycin, and Cefepime.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/60 to 149/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 93%.
- The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 8 mmHg, total in of 1,870 mL, total out of 900 mL, and fluid balance of 970 mL.
- Her respiratory support includes ventilation mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set Vt of 350 mL, RR of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and ABG results.
- Physical examination findings include general appearance of being thin, endotracheal tube in place, distant S2, symmetric chest expansion, dullness percussion, diminished breath sounds, soft abdomen, and distended abdomen.
- Laboratory results show hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, leukocyte count of 256 K/uL, sodium of 112 mg/dL, potassium of 0.2 mg/dL, chloride of 32 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 25.1%, BUN of 11 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.2 mg/dL, glucose of 136 mg/dL, and other lab values.
- Imaging shows an expiratory film with modest improvement in airation of the left upper lobe.
- The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure due to extensive pulmonary lesions and superimposed bacterial pneumonia.
- She will continue on Cefepime and hydrocortisone, and PEEP will be returned to 15 if unable to tolerate the current decrease.
- The patient also has breast cancer with no evidence of therapeutic intervention available.
- ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT and VAP, and communication with the family regarding the fixed issue with cancer driving respiratory failure and no intervention possible."

   Disposition: [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
","The patient is a 47-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who presented with fever, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 134/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support.

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. The respiratory status is being closely monitored, with plans to wean the ventilator as tolerated. The patient remains normotensive and off pressors for several days.

The patient has stage 4 metastatic colon cancer, and oncology recommendations will be followed. The patient is also on keppra for seizure prophylaxis due to brain metastases.

The patient is experiencing constipation, likely related to high-dose sedatives/narcotics and possible related to colon cancer. Miralax has been added to the bowel regimen, and a kidney/ureter/bladder ultrasound may be considered to rule out obstruction in this patient with metastatic colon cancer.

The patient is receiving tube feeds for nutrition, insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and various prophylactic measures including venodynes and heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), proton pump inhibitor"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a chief complaint of metastatic colon cancer. She is currently admitted to the ICU and presents with fever, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/82 mmHg to 103/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is intubated and sedated, with spontaneous eye opening but not tracking.

Her physical examination reveals well-healed surgical scars, edema of all four extremities, and dorsalis pedis pulses. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set Vt of 350 mL, RR set at 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, PIP of 33 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 30 cmH2O. Her ABG results show pH 7.50, PaCO2 44 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 195.

The patient's laboratory values indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 21000/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL,"

   Disposition: FICUDisposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a diagnosis of metastatic colon cancer who presented with fever, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis. She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 144/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her central venous pressure is within normal range at 8 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests with elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values, such as glucose and electrolyte levels, are within normal limits.

The patient has multiple medical complications that require attention. These include respiratory failure, hypotension, stage 4 metastatic colon cancer, and constipation. 

Respiratory failure is indicated by the patient's ongoing need for mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The plan is to continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and wean the ventilator as tolerated.

Hypotension is not currently present as the patient's blood pressure is within normal range. However, the patient has been off pressors for several days, and ongoing monitoring is recommended. IV fluid boluses may be given as"

   Code status:  FULL
   Confirmed full code in ED. Discussed extensively with patient and HCP,
   patient agreed to full code for now with intubation, but is clear that
   she would not like to be vented long-term and understands the risks of
   not ever getting off of the ventilator.
   Disposition: FICUDisposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer and respiratory failure. The patient presented with fever, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to metastatic disease progression and possible acute infectious process. Broad-spectrum coverage with antibiotics is being continued, and plans for weaning the ventilator are being discussed.

2. Hypotension: Although the patient is currently normotensive and off pressors, there is a risk of recurrent hypotension. IV fluid boluses will be given as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Blood cultures have been negative.

3. Stage 4 Metastatic Colon Cancer: The patient has stage 4 metastatic colon cancer. Oncology recommendations should be followed up, and seizure prophylaxis with keppra should continue in the setting of brain metastases.

4. Constipation: The patient has increased residuals with minimal tube feeds and has not had a bowel movement in several days. This is likely related to high-dose sedatives/narcotics and possible related to colon cancer. Further measures such as adding lactulose and rectal exam with possible manual disimpaction may be necessary.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring and management of these potential complications are required."

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer, who presented with fever, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and probable sepsis. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has had episodes of tachycardia and hypotension. The respiratory support is being adjusted to improve oxygenation and weaning from the ventilator. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated due to suspected infection. The patient's constipation is being managed with laxatives, and her nutritional needs are being met through tube feeds. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's high compliance is a barrier to extubation, likely due to multifactorial causes such as lobar collapse from metastatic disease progression and an acute infectious process.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been normotensive and off pressors for several days, but stress dose hydrocortisone has been given due to ongoing outpatient dexamethasone use.
3. Stage 4 metastatic colon cancer: The patient's cancer is being managed with ongoing oncology recommendations, including seizure prophylaxis with keppra.
4. Constipation: The patient has increased residuals with minimal rare tube feeds and has not had a bowel movement in several days, possibly related to high-dose sedatives/narcotics and colon cancer. Lactulose has been added to the"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2193-12-13**] 08:45 AM
   -Had sustained 41-beat run of polymorphic VT around 0915 on [**12-13**]
   etiology is likely metabolic, due to hypokalemia (maybe dropped K from
   large bowel movement night prior?) as metabolic disturbances would
   cause polymorphic VT (monomorphic more from scar tissue)
   - we started amiodarone bolus & ggt will transition to po amio 400 [**Hospital1 **]
   after drip is done, got 12 lead EKG, wrote event note
   - d/c'd reglan and zofran as these can prolong QT interval (although
   this would lead to torsades rather than polymorphic VT)
   - TTE done shows no wall motion abnl, LVEF 70% no big obvious tumours,
   small pericardial effusion but no evidence of tamponade
   - had family meeting at 4pm with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5077**], Dr [**First Name (STitle) 11801**] [**Name (STitle) 11802**] (for
   pal care not ethics) and the very large extended family. Family still
   wants everything done, wants to know if there are stronger abx, chemo
   or XRT options. Definitely still a FULL code. Spoke to them about
   potential harms of chest compressions. They are orthodox catholic and
   want their priest present; chaplain services were called but they did
   not wish to speak w chaplain because she was female. they want another
   family mtg on Monday to discuss traching her. This does differ from her
   initial wishes in the ED where she explicitly stated she only wanted to
   be on the ventilator for a short period of time. Frank from social work
   knows the family and will be back on Monday and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 239**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of widely metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain. She presented with respiratory distress and experienced a run of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) that was likely caused by electrolyte imbalance (hypokalemia) and/or medication side effect. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics and is being weaned off the ventilator, but her high compliance makes extubation difficult. The patient's family wants to pursue aggressive treatment options including stronger antibiotics, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy despite her initial wishes for limited interventions. There is ongoing discussion about tracheostomy and goals of care with the family. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely caused by multifactorial factors such as lobar collapse due to metastatic disease progression and an acute infectious process. The patient's high compliance makes extubation challenging.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced a run of polymorphic VT, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated. This could recur if the underlying causes (electrolyte imbalance and/or medication side effect) are not addressed.
3. Metastatic Colon Cancer: The patient has stage 4 metastatic colon cancer with spread to the lungs and brain. The disease progression may continue to compromise her"

   cause polymorphic VT (monomorphic more from scar tissue)
   - we started amiodarone bolus & ggt will transition to po amio 400 [**Hospital1 **]
   after drip is done, got 12 lead EKG, wrote event note
   - d/c'd reglan and zofran as these can prolong QT interval (although
   this would lead to torsades rather than polymorphic VT)
   - TTE done shows no wall motion abnl, LVEF 70% no big obvious tumours,
   small pericardial effusion but no evidence of tamponade
   - had family meeting at 4pm with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5077**], Dr [**First Name (STitle) 11801**] [**Name (STitle) 11802**] (for
   pal care not ethics) and the very large extended family. Family still
   wants everything done, wants to know if there are stronger abx, chemo
   or XRT options. Definitely still a FULL code. Spoke to them about
   potential harms of chest compressions. They are orthodox catholic and
   want their priest present; chaplain services were called but they did
   not wish to speak w chaplain because she was female. they want another
   family mtg on Monday to discuss traching her. This does differ from her
   initial wishes in the ED where she explicitly stated she only wanted to
   be on the ventilator for a short period of time. Frank from social work
   knows the family and will be back on Monday and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 239**]
   (outpatient oncologist) will be present then as well

   Assessment and Plan
   37F with widely metastatic colon CA to lungs and brain, who presented
   with repsiratory distress, s/p polymorphic VT.
   # Polymorphic VT- no further episodes of polymorphic VT since yesterday
   AM. Pt still on amiodarone drip 0.5mg/min until 10am.
   Etiology likely electrolyte imbalance (prior hypokalemia) and/or
   medication side effect. Reglan and Zofran were discontinued due to
   their ability to prolong QT interval (although this would cause
   torsades). TTE shows no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and
   normal LVEF
   -- transition to amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] today, 1^st dose at 8pm
   -- continue monitoring and replete lytes PRN for K > 4, Mg >2, check
   [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   -- 12 lead EKG
   #. Respiratory failure
 High compliance is a barrier to extubation.
   Likely multifactorial, lobar collapse due to metastatic disease
   progresson (RML, LUL collapse) as well as contribution from an acute
   infectious process.
   -- continue broad spectrum coverage with
   vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin/flagyl
   -- f/u pending respiratory culture
   -- Continue PEEP of 12 for now, monitor sats.
   -- patient could not tolerate pressure support at all, will likely not
   be able to be extubated
   -- ongoing discussion with the family re: trach/ goals of care; family
   mtg on Monday w/ SW
   .
   #. Hypotension
 Normotensive, off pressors for several days.
   Afebrile.
   -- IVF boluses as needed for MAP>60
   -- blood cultures negative
   -- stress dose hydrocostisone given ongoing outpt dexamethasone use
   .
   #. Stage 4 metastatic colon CA -
   -- f/u oncology recs
   -- continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis in setting of brain mets
   -- onc SW consult

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 47-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain, presenting with respiratory distress and subsequent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 106/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2. The patient's cardiac rhythm is currently sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of allergies to Compazine, and has received multiple courses of antibiotics including levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient is currently receiving amiodarone intravenously at a rate of 0.5 mg/min, fentanyl and midazolam infusions, and oral amiodarone 400 mg from Hospital1.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Electrolyte imbalances are present with hypokalemia (potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L) and hyponatremia (sodium level of 133 mg/dL). Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's chest X-ray shows no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and normal left ventricular ejection fraction. The E"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who is currently experiencing significant respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 116/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia, but it is currently not present. She also has sepsis presumed to be of pulmonary origin and is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. The patient's colon cancer is in a metastatic stage, and no further treatment options are available at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure needs to be closely monitored and managed. The elevated plateau pressure indicates the potential for lung injury, and adjustments to ventilation settings may be necessary to optimize oxygenation and minimize further lung damage.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: Although the patient's ventricular tachycardia is currently not present, it remains a potential complication that could arise. Continuation of amiodarone therapy and close monitoring for any signs or symptoms of arrhythmias are essential.
3. Sepsis: The patient is presumed to have sepsis of pulmonary origin. It is important to complete the current antibiotic regimen and monitor for any signs of infection or"

   Assessment and Plan
   37F with widely metastatic colon CA to lungs and brain, who presented
   with repsiratory distress, s/p polymorphic VT.
   #. Respiratory failure
 High compliance is a barrier to extubation.
   Likely multifactorial, lobar collapse due to metastatic disease
   progresson (RML, LUL collapse) as well as contribution from an acute
   infectious process.
   -- has completed 10 day course of antibiotics, have stopped all Abx
   yesterday
   -- f/u pending respiratory culture (sputum fungal culture)
   -- Continue PEEP of 12 for now, monitor sats.  Keep on current settings
   -- patient could not tolerate pressure support at all, will likely not
   be able to be extubated
   -- ongoing discussion with the family re: trach/ goals of care; family
   mtg on Monday w/ SW
   # Polymorphic VT- no further episodes of VT since yesterday AM. Pt now
   on amiodarone 400mg po BID.  Etiology likely electrolyte imbalance
   (prior hypokalemia) and/or medication side effect. Reglan and Zofran
   were discontinued due to their ability to prolong QT interval (although
   this would cause torsades). TTE shows no evidence of wall motion
   abnormalities and normal LVEF
   -- Continue amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] today
   -- continue monitoring and replete lytes PRN for K > 4, Mg >2, check
   [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   -- 12 lead EKG if  happens again
   .
   #. Stage 4 metastatic colon CA -
   -- f/u oncology recs
   -- continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis in setting of brain mets
   -- onc SW consult

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has metastatic colon cancer and is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/54 to 172/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to Compazine and antibiotics such as Levofloxacin, Cefipime, Metronidazole, and Vancomycin. The patient has received infusions of Fentanyl and Midazolam. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.9-10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, sodium level of 142 mg/dL, potassium level of 0.2 mg/dL, magnesium level of 30 mEq/L, glucose level of 161-243 mg/dL, and an albumin level of 2.2 g/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals marked scleral edema, regular heart rhythm with occasional ectopy, course ventilated breath sounds, and stable edema of all four extremities. 

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by lobar collapse due to metastatic disease progression"

","The patient is a 47-year-old male with metastatic colon cancer presenting with respiratory distress. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 90/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including levofloxacin, cefepime, metronidazole, and vancomycin. He is also on fentanyl and midazolam infusions for sedation. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, normal sodium and potassium levels, elevated blood glucose level, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's physical examination reveals marked scleral edema, a well-healed surgical scar, stable edema in all four extremities, and normal dorsalis pedis pulses. The patient's cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm with occasional ectopy, normal S1 and S2 sounds, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist, auto flow, set tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate respiratory acidosis.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring and management of electrolyte imbalances, continuation of amiodarone for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), and evaluation for extubation readiness. The patient's family has been informed about the potential need for a tracheostomy and goals of care. The patient's stage 4 metastatic colon cancer is being followed by the oncology team, and seizure prophylaxis is being provided due to brain metastases.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's high PEEP and low tidal volume strategy aims to minimize VILI, but the patient's high compliance may still pose a barrier to extubation. The ongoing use of antibiotics and bundle protocols help reduce the risk of VAP. Prophylactic heparin and venodynes are being used to prevent DVT."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 37-year-old individual with advanced metastatic colon cancer, experiencing respiratory distress and hypoxia. They have been sedated and unable to provide a medical history. The patient has allergies to Compazine and dystonia reactions. They have received various antibiotics since admission.

Infusions of Midazolam and Fentanyl are ongoing, along with other ICU medications for prophylaxis and treatment purposes. The patient's vital signs show a temperature within normal range, stable heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The plateau pressure is 33 cmH2O, and compliance is 17.5 cmH2O/mL. The patient's blood gases indicate a pH of 7.5, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 31 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 22.2 mEq/L.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, blood glucose level of 167 mg/dL, and serum potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L. Other lab values include elevated liver enzymes, low albumin level, and normal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) - Non-sustained VT has occurred, but no further episodes have been reported. The patient is now on amiodarone 400mg twice a day.
2. Hypotension - The patient is experiencing hypotension, but not in shock. This may be related to underlying conditions.
3. Cancer - The patient has stage 4 metastatic colon cancer with spread to the lungs and brain. This is likely contributing to respiratory failure.
4. Respiratory failure - The patient's high respiratory compliance is a barrier to extubation. The cause of respiratory failure is multifactorial, including lobar collapse due to metastatic disease progression and an acute infectious process. Antibiotics have been completed, and the patient is no longer receiving them. Respiratory culture results are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure - The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of metastatic disease progression and an acute infectious process. Continued monitoring and management are necessary.
2. Ventricular tachycardia - The patient experienced an episode of non-sustained VT, which has been treated with amiodarone. Close monitoring and management of electrolyte imbalances are important to prevent further episodes.
3. Hypotension - The patient is experiencing hypotension,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with advanced metastatic colon cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have experienced episodes of bradycardia and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. They have a history of allergies to Compazine and have received antibiotics for an infectious process. The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and several others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to lobar collapse caused by metastatic disease progression and an acute infectious process. The low compliance makes extubation difficult.
2. Polymorphic VT: The patient had an episode of polymorphic VT, which has been treated with amiodarone. The etiology of the VT is likely electrolyte imbalance and medication side effects.
3. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension that is not in shock state.
4. Stage 4 Metastatic Colon Cancer: The patient has stage 4 metastatic colon cancer with widespread metastasis to the lungs and brain.
5. Seizure Prophylaxis: The patient requires seizure prophylaxis due to brain metastasis, for which keppra is being continued.
6. Oncology Follow-up: The patient needs to follow up with oncology recommendations.
7. Potential Infection: Although the patient has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics, there is still a possibility of an ongoing infectious process.
8. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient has a midline scar and positive bowel sounds, indicating potential gastrointestinal issues.
9. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload as evidenced by a high total input and output balance.
10. Potential Complications from Long-Term Mechanical Ventilation: Prolonged mechanical ventilation can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), muscle weakness, and increased risk of infection."

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with advanced metastatic colon cancer, presenting with hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a medical history. The patient has a known allergy to Compazine (Oral) and has been receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected infections. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and is receiving sedation and pain management through infusions of midazolam and fentanyl.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 124/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an input of 1534 mL and output of 1545 mL since 12 AM. The patient's weight has increased from 47 kg at admission to 60.7 kg currently.

Physical examination reveals clear lungs bilaterally, a midline scar on the abdomen, mild distension, and blood clots in the Foley catheter. The patient has 1+ edema in all extremities. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 200 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal renal function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range except for hypok"

   Assessment and Plan
   37 yo female with widely metastatic colon cancer now with persistent
   and significant respiratory compromise who now has had full treatment
   for bacterial pneumonia but remains with profound respiratory
   compromise and inability to wean from ventilator.  Given the findings
   on bronchoscopy we see strong evidence for proximal obstruction with
   endobronchial lesions which are too distal for any IP based
   intervention for stenting.
   1)Respiratory Failure-patient with persistent severe impairment in
   regards to compliance and maintains lobar collapse and persistence of
   bilateral infiltrates.
   -Will decrease RR to 14 to trial today
   -Will continue with PEEP at current levels
   -Patient with pneumonia with ongoing treatment successful in resolution
   of bacterial infection based upon fever, WBC count
   -No role for stent given extensive and distal location of lesions.
   2)VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, NON-SUSTAINED (NSVT)
   _Continue with amiodarone but will have to be careful with bradycardia
   3)Colon Cancer-
   -No further interventions possible for colon cancer or local therapy

","The patient is a 37-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer, who has developed persistent and significant respiratory compromise. She has been treated for bacterial pneumonia but remains unable to wean from the ventilator. The assessment reveals evidence of proximal airway obstruction due to endobronchial lesions, which are too distal for any interventional procedure like stenting.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe impairment in lung compliance, maintains lobar collapse, and has persistent bilateral infiltrates. Decreasing the respiratory rate to 14 will be trialed today, and the current PEEP levels will be continued.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia, Non-Sustained (NSVT): The patient is being treated with amiodarone, but caution will be exercised due to the risk of bradycardia.
3. Colon Cancer: No further interventions are possible for colon cancer or local therapy.

ICU care includes nutrition support with Fibersource HN (Full) at 40 mL/hour, glycemic control, multi-lumen lines, indwelling port, arterial line, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and precautions against ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and she will continue to be managed in the ICU."

   37F with widely metastatic colon CA to lungs and brain, who presented
   with respiratory distress, s/p polymorphic VT.
   #. Respiratory failure
 Has persistent respiratory failure and unable
   to be weaned from vent as cannot tolerate pressure support at all.  Has
   persistently low compliance due to metastatic disease causing LUL
   collapse.
   -- has completed 10 day course of antibiotics, have stopped all Abx as
   of [**12-14**]
   -- Continue PEEP of 12 for now, monitor sats.  Decreased RR to 18
   yesterday and pH has normalized, and shows combination metabolic
   alkalosis and respiratory acidosis.  Will leave vent settings as is.
   -- patient could not tolerate pressure support at all, will likely not
   be able to be extubated
   -- ongoing discussion with the family re: trach/ goals of care; family
   wants to speak with oncology and IP for further options although given
   reassurance that no further interventions are likely to help.  Will get
   second opinions set up for the family.
   - Had been given stress dose steroids, will d/c to home dose in IV form
   #. Rhythm (ventricular tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, bradycardia)
   Has had no further episodes of VT since [**12-14**]. Pt now on amiodarone
   400mg po BID.  Also had sinus tachycardia episode last night in setting
   of being turned, possibly related to pain and perturbation.
   -- Have dc
ed Reglan and Zofran
   -- TTE showed no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and normal LVEF
   -- Continue amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] today (today is day 3, day 4 will
   start with evening dose today)
   -- Continue monitoring and replete lytes PRN for K > 4, Mg >2, check
   [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   -- 12 lead EKG if  arrhythmias happen again
   #. Stage 4 metastatic colon CA -
   -- f/u oncology recs, although are not following daily
   -- continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis in setting of brain mets
   -- onc SW consult
   #. Lack of bowel movements: Most likely ileus or constipation due to
   heavy sedation, less likely obstruction.
   - Will add erythromycin to encourage motility
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   - Consider po narcan

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with metastatic colon cancer, currently in the ICU for respiratory distress and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The patient has widely metastatic disease to the lungs and brain. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to persistent respiratory failure. His respiratory status remains unstable, with low compliance and inability to tolerate pressure support. The patient has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics and all unnecessary lines have been removed.

The patient also has a history of ventricular tachycardia, for which he is currently on amiodarone. He had a recent episode of sinus tachycardia last night, possibly related to pain and perturbation. The patient's family is still considering further interventions, although the medical team has reassured them that no further interventions are likely to be helpful. Second opinions are being arranged for the family.

The patient's other medical issues include stage 4 metastatic colon cancer, with ongoing follow-up with oncology recommendations. He is also on keppra for seizure prophylaxis due to brain metastases. The patient has not had any bowel movements, which may be due to ileus or constipation caused by heavy sedation. Erythromycin has been added to encourage motility, along with an aggressive bowel regimen.

The patient's nutrition is being provided through a fiber source HN (full) at 30 mL/hour, but he has high tube residuals."

   Assessment and Plan
   37F with widely metastatic colon CA to lungs and brain, who presented
   with respiratory distress, s/p polymorphic VT.
   #. Respiratory failure
 Has persistent respiratory failure and unable
   to be weaned from vent as cannot tolerate pressure support at all.  Has
   persistently low compliance due to metastatic disease causing LUL
   collapse.
   -- has completed 10 day course of antibiotics, have stopped all Abx as
   of [**12-14**]
   -- Continue PEEP of 12 for now, monitor sats.  Decreased RR to 18
   yesterday and pH has normalized, and shows combination metabolic
   alkalosis and respiratory acidosis.
   -- patient could not tolerate pressure support at all, will likely not
   be able to be extubated
   -- ongoing discussion with the family re: trach/ goals of care; family
   wants to speak with oncology and IP for further options although given
   reassurance that no further interventions are likely to help
   #. Rhythm (ventricular tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, bradycardia)
   Has had no further episodes of VT since [**12-14**]. Pt now on amiodarone
   400mg po BID.  Also had sinus tachycardia episode last night in setting
   of being turned, possibly related to pain and perturbation.
   -- Have dc
ed Reglan and Zofran
   -- TTE showed no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and normal LVEF
   -- Continue amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] today
   -- Continue monitoring and replete lytes PRN for K > 4, Mg >2, check
   [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   -- 12 lead EKG if  arrhythmias happen again
   #. Stage 4 metastatic colon CA -
   -- f/u oncology recs, although are not following daily
   -- continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis in setting of brain mets
   -- onc SW consult

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with a chief complaint of metastatic colon cancer. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 153/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient has marked scleral edema, a well-healed surgical scar, stable edema in all four extremities, and dorsalis pedis pulses.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose, and troponin-T levels. The creatinine level is within normal range.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure and is unable to be weaned from the ventilator due to low compliance caused by metastatic disease leading to left upper lobe collapse. The patient completed a 10-day course of antibiotics and has stopped all antibiotic therapy as of December 14th. The patient will continue with a PEEP of 12 for now and will be monitored for oxygen saturation. The patient is unlikely to be extubated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with extensive metastatic colon cancer who is currently experiencing persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure. Despite optimal treatment for pneumonia and exploration of all available interventions, there are no further options to maintain airway patency. The patient has been intubated for 13 days and requires assisted ventilation. She also has a history of ventricular tachycardia. The plan is to continue with assisted ventilation, aiming for a pH of 7.40 and ensuring adequate oxygenation. The patient's metastatic colon cancer is being managed by awaiting a response from oncology regarding radiation options. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the current treatment approach is not effective. This could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Metastatic Colon Cancer: The progression of the patient's metastatic colon cancer may lead to additional complications such as spread to other organs, increased pain, and systemic effects.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's history of tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia indicates an increased risk of arrhythmias. Appropriate management strategies should be implemented to prevent further cardiac events.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   37F with widely metastatic colon CA to lungs and brain, who presented
   with respiratory distress, s/p polymorphic VT.
   #. Respiratory failure
 Has persistent respiratory failure and unable
   to be weaned from vent as cannot tolerate pressure support at all.  Has
   persistently low compliance due to metastatic disease causing LUL
   collapse.
   -- has completed 10 day course of antibiotics, have stopped all Abx as
   of [**12-14**]
   -- Continue PEEP of 12 for now, monitor sats.  Decreased RR at 16
   yesterday has caused pH to normalize, and shows combination metabolic
   alkalosis and respiratory acidosis.  Will leave vent settings as is.
   -- patient could not tolerate pressure support at all, will likely not
   be able to be extubated
   -- ongoing discussion with the family re: trach/ goals of care; family
   wants to speak with oncology and IP for further options although given
   reassurance that no further interventions are likely to help.  Will get
   second opinions set up for the family.
   - Had been given stress dose steroids
 changed to PO dexamethasone 4
   q12h
   #. Rhythm (ventricular tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, bradycardia)
   Has had no further episodes of VT since [**12-14**]. Pt now on amiodarone
   400mg po BID.
   -- Have dc
ed Reglan and Zofran
   -- TTE showed no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and normal LVEF
   -- Continue amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] today (today is day 4)
 plan to
   change dose on [**12-21**]
   -- Continue monitoring and replete lytes PRN for K > 4, Mg >2, check
   [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   -- 12 lead EKG if  arrhythmias happen again
   #. Stage 4 metastatic colon CA -
   -- f/u oncology recs, although are not following daily
   -- continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis in setting of brain mets
   -- onc SW consult
   #. Lack of bowel movements: Now improved with erythromycin, felt to be
   ileus or constipation due to heavy sedation, less likely obstruction.
   - continue PO erythromycin to encourage motility
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   - Consider po narcan if worsens

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain. The patient presented with respiratory distress and experienced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). 

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to persistent respiratory failure. Despite attempts at weaning, the patient has shown low compliance and cannot tolerate pressure support. This suggests a likely tracheostomy may be required for long-term airway management.

The patient's rhythm has stabilized since December 14th, with no further episodes of VT. The patient is now on amiodarone 400mg twice daily, which is a medication used to prevent and treat certain types of arrhythmias. 

The patient's colon cancer has progressed to stage 4, with metastasis to the lungs and brain. The oncology recommendations are being followed up, although not on a daily basis. The patient is also taking Keppra for seizure prophylaxis due to brain metastases.

The patient experienced a lack of bowel movements, which has now improved with the administration of erythromycin. This medication helps encourage intestinal motility. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through Fibersource HN at a rate of 20 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being maintained with insulin. The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line, an indwelling port"

   Assessment and Plan
   37F with widely metastatic colon CA to lungs and brain, who presented
   with respiratory distress, s/p polymorphic VT.
   #. Respiratory failure
 Has persistent respiratory failure and unable
   to be weaned from vent as cannot tolerate pressure support at all.  Has
   persistently low compliance due to metastatic disease causing LUL
   collapse.
   -- has completed 10 day course of antibiotics, have stopped all Abx as
   of [**12-14**]
   -- Continue PEEP of 12 for now, monitor sats.  pH to normal on current
   settings, ABG shows combination metabolic alkalosis and respiratory
   acidosis.  Will leave vent settings as is.
   -- patient could not tolerate pressure support at all, will likely not
   be able to be extubated
   -- ongoing discussion with the family re: trach/ goals of care; family
   wants to speak with oncology and IP for further options although given
   reassurance that no further interventions are likely to help.  Will get
   second opinions set up for the family.
   - Had been given stress dose steroids
 changed to PO dexamethasone 4
   q12h
   #. Rhythm (ventricular tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, bradycardia)
   Has had no further episodes of VT since [**12-14**]. Pt now on amiodarone
   400mg po BID.
   -- Have dc
ed Reglan and Zofran
   -- TTE showed no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and normal LVEF
   -- Continue amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] today (today is day 4)
 plan to
   change dose on [**12-21**]
   -- Continue monitoring and replete lytes PRN for K > 4, Mg >2, check
   [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   -- 12 lead EKG if  arrhythmias happen again
   #. Stage 4 metastatic colon CA -
   -- f/u oncology recs, although are not following daily
   -- continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis in setting of brain mets
   -- onc SW consult
   #. Lack of bowel movements: Now improved with erythromycin, felt to be
   ileus or constipation due to heavy sedation, less likely obstruction.
   - continue PO erythromycin to encourage motility
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   - Consider po narcan if worsens

   37 yo female with history of metastatic colon cancer now with severe
   and persistent respiratory failure in the setting of extensive
   metastatic disease and with no further Rx available for cancer.  She
   has had hospital course complicated by polymorphic VT now on
   amiodarone.  We have persistent severe compromise in compliance and
   inability to wean from mechanical ventilator support despite clearing
   of infection and sepsis resolution.
   1) VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, NON-SUSTAINED (NSVT)-
   -Continue Amiodarone
   2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])-
   -Fixed and poor compliance of 17 persists
   -Will trial wean of PEEP if BP decreased but do fear further areas of
   collapse will evolve
   -Continue with A/C
   3)COLON CANCER

","The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of metastatic colon cancer who is currently experiencing severe and persistent respiratory failure. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by polymorphic VT, for which she is being treated with amiodarone. Despite clearing of infection and resolution of sepsis, the patient continues to have severe compromise in compliance and is unable to be weaned from mechanical ventilator support.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1) Ventricular Tachycardia, Non-Sustained (NSVT) - to continue amiodarone.
2) Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS) - fixed and poor compliance persists, will trial wean of PEEP if BP decreases, but fear further areas of collapse will evolve, continue with A/C.
3) Colon Cancer, Metastatic - will have meeting with radiation oncologist today to clarify that no further intervention is possible or reasonable.

The patient is receiving ICU care, including tube feeds for nutrition and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, but CPR is not indicated. The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU."

   37F with widely metastatic colon CA to lungs and brain, who presented
   with respiratory distress, s/p polymorphic VT.
   #. Respiratory failure
 Has persistent respiratory failure and unable
   to be weaned from vent as cannot tolerate pressure support at all.  Has
   persistently low compliance due to metastatic disease causing LUL
   collapse.
   -- has completed 10 day course of antibiotics, have stopped all Abx as
   of [**12-14**]
   -- Continue PEEP of 12 for now, monitor sats.  pH to normal on current
   settings, ABG shows combination metabolic alkalosis and respiratory
   acidosis.  Will leave vent settings as is.
   -- patient could not tolerate pressure support at all, will likely not
   be able to be extubated
   -- ongoing discussion with the family re: trach/ goals of care; family
   wants to speak with oncology and IP for further options although given
   reassurance that no further interventions are likely to help.  Will get
   second opinions set up for the family.
   - Had been given stress dose steroids
 changed to PO dexamethasone 4
   q12h
   #. Rhythm (ventricular tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, bradycardia)
   Has had no further episodes of VT since [**12-14**]. Pt now on amiodarone
   400mg po BID.
   -- Have dc
ed Reglan and Zofran
   -- TTE showed no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and normal LVEF
   -- Continue amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] today (today is day 5)
 plan to
   change dose on [**12-21**]
   -- Continue monitoring and replete lytes PRN for K > 4, Mg >2, check
   [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   -- 12 lead EKG if  arrhythmias happen again
   #. Stage 4 metastatic colon CA -
   -- f/u oncology recs, although are not following daily
   -- continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis in setting of brain mets
   -- onc SW consult
   #. Lack of bowel movements: Now improved with erythromycin, felt to be
   ileus or constipation due to heavy sedation, less likely obstruction.
   - continue PO erythromycin to encourage motility
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   - Consider po narcan if worsens

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old individual with a history of widely metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain. The patient presented with respiratory distress and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, which has persisted despite attempts to wean from the ventilator. The patient's low compliance is due to metastatic disease causing left upper lobe (LUL) collapse. Antibiotic treatment has been completed, and the decision has been made to stop all antibiotics. The patient is currently on PEEP of 12, and the ventilator settings will be left unchanged. 

The patient's rhythm has stabilized since December 14th, with no further episodes of VT. The patient is now on amiodarone 400mg orally twice a day. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). 

The patient's stage 4 metastatic colon cancer is being followed up with oncology recommendations, although they are not being followed daily. The patient is also taking keppra for seizure prophylaxis due to brain metastases. An oncology social worker consult has been scheduled. 

Additionally, the patient experienced a lack of bowel movements, which has improved with erythromycin. This was felt to be an ileus or constipation due to heavy sedation, less likely"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain. She presented with respiratory distress and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). She is currently in the ICU and has persistent respiratory failure, unable to be weaned from mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/61 to 163/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has received antibiotics, amiodarone for arrhythmias, and erythromycin for bowel motility. The patient's family has been informed about the prognosis, and there is ongoing discussion regarding tracheostomy and goals of care. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure and is unable to be weaned from mechanical ventilation. This can lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and lung infections.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). If it recurs, it may require further intervention such as additional antiarrhythmic medication or cardiac monitoring.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain. She presented with respiratory distress and experienced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has persistent respiratory failure and is unable to be weaned from the ventilator due to low lung compliance caused by metastatic disease. Antibiotics have been completed, and the decision has been made to stop all antibiotic therapy. The patient's current ventilator settings will be left unchanged. It is unlikely that she will be extubated. There is ongoing discussion with the family regarding the placement of a tracheostomy and goals of care. The family wants to speak with oncology and the intensivist for further options, although they have been reassured that no further interventions are likely to be beneficial. Second opinions will be arranged for the family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure and is unable to be weaned from the ventilator. This increases the risk of further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced polymorphic VT, which can potentially recur. Continuous monitoring and management of the patient's heart rhythm are essential to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias.
3. Metastatic Colon Cancer: The patient has stage 4 metastatic colon cancer with spread to the lungs and brain. The cancer may continue to"

   Communication:  Comments: Will need to continue to discuss the care
   plan in light of the fact that no further intervention for cancer is
   possible and patient has current limitations that prevent capacity to
   wean from ventilator support at this time.  Active infection has
   resolved.  Will state that our recommendation is to move to CMO status
   at this time as we have clear data from all components of oncology team
   that no intervention is possible and we medically have had resolution
   of acute insult as best as is possible.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who is experiencing persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes profound compromise of pulmonary function and hypoxemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on assisted ventilation due to respiratory failure. If the ventilatory support is not properly managed, there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure, which can lead to further hypoxemia and potential respiratory arrest.

2. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has been diagnosed with non-sustained VT. If left untreated or uncontrolled, VT can progress to ventricular fibrillation, which can result in cardiac arrest.

3. Colon Cancer with Metastasis: The patient has metastatic colon cancer. Although no further treatment options are available at this time, the cancer itself can continue to spread and cause further complications.

4. Infection: Although the active infection has resolved, there is still a risk of developing new infections due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay. Infections can worsen the patient's overall condition and lead to sepsis.

5. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has a negative fluid balance, which indicates a risk of dehydration. Inadequate fluid replacement can lead to organ dysfunction and compromise the patient's overall health.

6. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's prolonged imm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 47-year-old individual with widely metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain, presenting with respiratory distress.
- The patient has persistent respiratory failure and cannot be weaned from the ventilator.
- The patient's low compliance is due to metastatic disease causing left upper lobe collapse.
- Antibiotics have been completed, and all antibiotic therapy has been stopped.
- PEEP has been decreased to 10, and oxygen saturation levels are being monitored.
- The patient is unable to tolerate pressure support and is unlikely to be extubated.
- There is ongoing discussion with the family regarding tracheostomy and goals of care, with the family seeking further options from oncology and IP.
- The patient has had no further episodes of ventricular tachycardia since December 14th. They are currently on amiodarone 400mg po BID.
- Amiodarone will be continued, and the dose will be changed on December 21st.
- Monitoring and repletion of electrolytes will be done as needed, especially for potassium levels above 4 and magnesium levels above 2.
- A 12-lead EKG will be obtained if arrhythmias occur again.
- The patient's stage 4 metastatic colon cancer is being followed up with oncology recommendations.
- Keppra is being continued for seizure prophylaxis due to brain metastases.
- Oncology social work consult is planned.
- The patient's lack of bowel movements has improved with erythromycin, which is believed to be due to ileus or constipation caused by heavy sedation, less likely obstruction.
- Aggressive bowel regimen will be continued, with adjustments made if multiple stools occur today.
- Consideration will be given to po narcan if the condition worsens.
- ICU care includes nutrition via Fibersource HN (Full) at 50 mL/hour.
- Glycemic control will be maintained.
- The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line and an arterial line.
- Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is being provided.
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions will be followed.
- Code status is no compressions, and disposition will be readdressed with the healthcare provider."

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old individual with widely metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain. They presented with respiratory distress and sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The patient has persistent respiratory failure and is unable to be weaned from the ventilator due to low compliance caused by metastatic disease leading to left upper lobe collapse. Antibiotics have been completed, and all antibiotic use has been stopped as of December 14th. PEEP has been decreased to 10, and the patient's oxygen saturation levels are being monitored. The family is currently discussing tracheostomy and goals of care with the healthcare team, although they want to speak with oncology and the intensivist for further options. It has been explained to the family that no further interventions are likely to help.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure and is unable to tolerate pressure support, indicating a high likelihood of continued dependence on mechanical ventilation. This can lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which is a life-threatening arrhythmia. Although the patient has not had any further episodes since December 14th, there is still a risk for recurrent arrhythmias, and ongoing monitoring and treatment with amiodarone are necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of stage 4 metastatic colon cancer, who presented with respiratory distress and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. He has been in the ICU for an extended period and is currently experiencing persistent respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is sedated and not following commands.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure and is unable to be weaned from the ventilator. He cannot tolerate pressure support and has low lung compliance due to metastatic disease causing left upper lobe collapse.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient had an episode of polymorphic VT, but no further episodes have occurred since December 14th. He is currently on amiodarone 400mg orally twice a day.
3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, but it is not considered to be in shock.
4. Stage 4 Metastatic Colon Cancer: The patient has widely metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain. He is being followed up with oncology recommendations and is receiving seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam due to brain metastases.
5. Lack of Bowel Movements: The patient had an improvement in bowel movements after receiving erythromycin. This is believed to be due to ileus or constipation caused by heavy sedation, rather than obstruction. The aggressive bowel regimen will be continued, and the dosage may be decreased if multiple stools occur today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Arrhythmias: The patient is at risk for recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, particularly since he is still on amiodarone.
2. Respiratory Infections: The patient is at risk for respiratory infections due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest.
4. Stress Ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period."

","The patient is a 37-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who has developed persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure due to extensive destruction of the lung with metastatic lesions. Despite maximal ventilatory support, there has been no clinical improvement. All possible interventions have been discussed with the family and oncology, and no additional measures are available. The patient's code status remains as full code, but discussions regarding comfort measures only (CMO) are ongoing due to the lack of expectation for improvement and persistent ventilatory status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Ventricular tachycardia, nonsustained (NSVT): This is a type of abnormal heart rhythm that can potentially progress to a life-threatening arrhythmia if not managed properly.
2. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), colorectal (colon cancer): The underlying cancer can continue to progress and cause further complications, such as spread of metastatic lesions or organ dysfunction.
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the ventilatory support is weaned further, leading to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, cardiac rhythm, oxygenation levels, and overall clinical status to promptly identify and manage any potential complications that may arise."

   37F with widely metastatic colon CA to lungs and brain, who presented
   with respiratory distress, s/p polymorphic VT.
    #. Respiratory failure
 Has persistent respiratory failure and unable
   to be weaned from vent as cannot tolerate pressure support at all.  Has
   persistently low compliance due to metastatic disease causing LUL
   collapse.
   -- has completed 10 day course of antibiotics, have stopped all Abx as
   of [**12-14**]
   -- Decreased PEEP to 10 given low compliance, monitor sats.
   -- patient could not tolerate pressure support at all, will likely not
   be able to be extubated
   -- ongoing discussion with the family re: trach/ goals of care; family
   wants to speak with oncology and IP for further options although given
   reassurance that no further interventions are likely to help.
   - Had been given stress dose steroids since [**12-17**]- decreased to home
   dose on [**12-19**]
   #. Rhythm (ventricular tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, bradycardia)
   Has had no further episodes of VT since [**12-14**]. Pt now on amiodarone
   400mg po BID.
   -- Had dc
ed Reglan and Zofran
   -- TTE showed no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and normal LVEF
   -- Continue amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] today (today is day 6)
 plan to
   change dose on [**12-21**]
   -- Continue monitoring and replete lytes PRN for K > 4, Mg >2, check
   1XD lytes
   -- 12 lead EKG if  arrhythmias happen again
    #. Stage 4 metastatic colon CA -
   -- f/u oncology recs, although are not following daily
   -- continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis in setting of brain mets
   -- onc SW consult
   -- transfuse 1U PRBC if not CMO this pm
   #. Lack of bowel movements: Now improved with erythromycin, felt to be
   ileus or constipation due to heavy sedation, less likely obstruction.
   - continue PO erythromycin to encourage motility
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen, decrease if multiple stools today
   - Consider po narcan if worsens

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain. The patient presented with respiratory distress and underwent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). 

The patient's current condition includes persistent respiratory failure, unable to be weaned from the ventilator as they cannot tolerate pressure support at all. There is also low compliance due to metastatic disease causing left upper lobe (LUL) collapse. Antibiotics have been completed, and PEEP has been decreased to 8 cmH2O. 

The patient has experienced rhythm disturbances including ventricular tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, and bradycardia. No further episodes of VT have occurred since December 14th. The patient is currently on amiodarone 400mg po BID. 

The patient has stage 4 metastatic colon cancer, and follow-up oncology recommendations are being followed, although not on a daily basis. Keppra is being given for seizure prophylaxis due to brain metastases, and an oncology social worker consult is planned. 

The patient's lack of bowel movements has improved with erythromycin, which was felt to be ileus or constipation due to heavy sedation. It is less likely to be an obstruction. The patient will continue to receive PO erythromycin to encourage motility and will have an aggressive bowel regimen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with metastatic colon cancer who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress, and he has been diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that has spread to the lungs and brain.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, erythromycin for bowel motility, amiodarone for arrhythmias, and stress dose steroids. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4 C (97.5%), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/57 mmHg to 156/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%.

The patient's lab results show slightly abnormal values, including a white blood cell count of 7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, platelet count of 173 K/uL, creatinine of 0.2 mg/dL, blood glucose levels between 122 mg/dL and 184 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances such as potassium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals pitting edema in all four extremities and ventilator-induced breath sounds. There are no new imaging or microbiology data mentioned in the note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with widely metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain. He presented with respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU due to persistent respiratory failure and unable to be weaned from the ventilator. The patient has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics and has stopped all antibiotics as of December 14th. The plan is to keep PEEP at 8 for now and monitor oxygen saturation levels. The patient could not tolerate pressure support at all, making it unlikely that he will be able to be extubated. There is ongoing discussion with the family regarding tracheostomy and goals of care, with a plan to meet on Monday.

The patient's rhythm is stable, with no further episodes of ventricular tachycardia since December 14th. The patient will be switched back to amiodarone 400mg daily, confirmed with pharmacy that dosing should be [Hospital1 7] for one month after VT. The patient has discontinued Reglan and Zofran, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

   37F with widely metastatic colon CA to lungs and brain, who presented
   with respiratory distress, now also s/p polymorphic VT.
    #. Respiratory failure
 Has persistent respiratory failure and unable
   to be weaned from vent as cannot tolerate pressure support at all.  Has
   persistently low compliance due to metastatic disease causing LUL
   collapse.
   -- Has completed 10 day course of antibiotics, have stopped all Abx as
   of [**12-14**]
   -- Keep PEEP at 8 for now, monitor sats.
   -- Patient could not tolerate pressure support at all, will likely not
   be able to be extubated
   -- ongoing discussion with the family re: trach/ goals of care; plan
   for meeting on Monday
   -- continue home dose of stress dose steroids on [**12-19**]
   #. Rhythm (ventricular tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, bradycardia)
   Has had no further episodes of VT since [**12-14**]. Pt now on amiodarone
   400mg po daily.
   -- Had dc
ed Reglan and Zofran
   -- TTE showed no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and normal LVEF
   -- Continue amiodarone daily
   -- Continue monitoring and replete lytes PRN for K > 4, Mg >2, check
   1XD lytes
   -- 12 lead EKG if  arrhythmias happen again
    #. Stage 4 metastatic colon CA -
   -- continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis in setting of brain mets
   -- onc SW following
   #. Bowel motility: Now improved with erythromycin, felt to be ileus or
   constipation due to heavy sedation, less likely obstruction.
   - continue PO erythromycin to encourage motility
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen, consider decrease if necessary
   - Consider po narcan if worsens

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of widely metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain. He presented with respiratory distress and has been unable to be weaned from the ventilator due to persistent respiratory failure and low compliance caused by metastatic disease. The patient also experienced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia but has not had any further episodes since December 14th. He is currently on amiodarone 400mg daily and stress dose steroids. His TTE showed no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and normal left ventricular ejection fraction. The patient has stage 4 metastatic colon cancer and is receiving Keppra for seizure prophylaxis in the setting of brain mets. His bowel motility has improved with erythromycin, which was given for ileus or constipation due to heavy sedation. The patient is currently receiving nutrition through Fibersource HN at 50 mL/hour and is on aggressive bowel regimen. He has an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and prophylactic heparin SC for DVT. The family meeting on Monday will discuss tracheostomy and goals of care. The patient's code status is full code, but compressions are not indicated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure and inability to be weaned from the ventilator indicate a high risk for continued respiratory complications.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain. The patient presented with respiratory distress and is now also experiencing polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure and is unable to be weaned from the ventilator as they cannot tolerate pressure support at all. This indicates a possible long-term dependence on mechanical ventilation.
2. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient experienced episodes of VT but has had no further episodes since December 14th. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and replete electrolytes as needed.
3. Stage 4 metastatic colon cancer: The patient has metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain. Treatment for this condition will involve oncology services, and seizure prophylaxis with keppra may be necessary due to brain metastases.
4. Bowel motility issues: The patient's bowel motility has improved with erythromycin, which was given to address ileus or constipation caused by heavy sedation. It is important to continue aggressive bowel regimens and consider decreasing them if necessary.
5. Glycemic control: The patient requires insulin for glycemic control.
6. Nutrition: The patient is receiving Fiber source HN (full) at 50 mL/hour.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with widely metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain. She presented with respiratory distress and is currently suffering from respiratory failure, unable to be weaned from the ventilator due to low compliance caused by metastatic disease resulting in left upper lobe collapse.

The patient has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics and all antibioitics have been stopped as of [**12-14**]. The plan is to keep the PEEP at 8 for now and monitor oxygen saturation levels. The patient could not tolerate pressure support at all and it is likely that she will not be able to be extubated. An ongoing discussion with the family is taking place regarding the possibility of tracheostomy and goals of care, with a plan to meet on Monday.

The patient is also at high risk for post-obstructive pneumonia versus ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). A full workup will be deferred until after the family meeting today. Consideration is being given to obtaining a chest X-ray (CXR) and urinalysis and culture.

Regarding the patient's rhythm disturbances, she has had no further episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) since [**12-14**]. Amiodarone was changed back to [**Hospital1 7**] on [**2193-12-22**] at the request of pharmacy. A transthoracic echocardi"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 47-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure secondary to colon cancer. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has a tracheostomy tube placed on day 4. The patient's vital signs show a stable heart rate within normal range, blood pressure slightly elevated, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 92%. 

The patient has received various treatments including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, other medications, and infusions. He has undergone several lab tests and imaging studies. His lab results indicate normal white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet levels, but slightly elevated levels of potassium, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactic acid. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating within normal range.

The patient's assessment includes ventricular tachycardia, hypotension, and cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the colon. The respiratory failure is noted as acute but not ARDS. The patient has a history of colon cancer.

The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to being intubated and sedated, with no peripheral pulses, skin, or neurologic assessments performed.

The patient's medical team has discussed the plan with the family, including continuing comfort measures and discontinuing the central venous line once the family leaves. The patient's mother is still receiving aggressive care, although the plan is to transition to comfort measures.

   with respiratory distress, now also s/p polymorphic VT.
    #. Respiratory failure
 Has persistent respiratory failure and unable
   to be weaned from vent as cannot tolerate pressure support at all.  Has
   persistently low compliance due to metastatic disease causing LUL
   collapse.
   -- Has completed 10 day course of antibiotics, have stopped all Abx as
   of [**12-14**]
   -- Keep PEEP at 8 for now, monitor sats.
   -- Patient could not tolerate pressure support at all, will likely not
   be able to be extubated
   -- ongoing discussion with the family re: trach/ goals of care; plan
   for meeting on Monday
   -- continue home dose steroids (changed from stress dose on [**12-19**])
   -- will add methadone for improved patient comfort
   #. Leukocytosis: Patient at high risk for post-obstructive pneumonia vs
   VAP.  Will defer full workup until after family meeting today
   -- Consider CXR and urinalysis and culture
   #.  Rhythm (ventricular tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, bradycardia)
   Has had no further episodes of VT since [**12-14**].
   -- Amiodarone 400mg po BID for one month, changed on [**2193-12-22**]
   -- TTE showed no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and normal LVEF
   -- Daily lytes
   -- 12 lead EKG if  arrhythmias happen again
    #. Stage 4 metastatic colon CA -
   -- continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis in setting of brain mets
   -- onc SW following
   #. Bowel motility: Now improved with erythromycin, felt to be ileus or
   constipation due to heavy sedation, less likely obstruction.
   - continue PO erythromycin to encourage motility
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen, consider decrease if necessary

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with metastatic colon cancer to the lungs and brain, presenting with respiratory distress and now also experiencing polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient is intubated and sedated, opening his eyes to verbal stimuli but not tracking. He has anisocoria, tachycardia, and regular rhythm without murmurs. He is ventilated and has 3+ edema in all four extremities. The patient's laboratory values show leukocytosis, anemia, hyperglycemia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is currently on comfort measures only (CMO) and will continue to be intubated. No blood draws or X-rays are being performed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Polymorphic VT: The presence of polymorphic VT suggests an increased risk of arrhythmias and potential cardiac complications.
3. Infection: Elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and further complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings show variations, indicating a potential risk of hypotension and decreased organ perfusion.
5. Fluid imbalance: The significant fluid intake and output imbalance suggests potential fluid overload or dehydration, which can contribute to respiratory and cardiac complications.
6. Metastatic cancer progression:"
