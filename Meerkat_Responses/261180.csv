The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, admitted with hypertensive urgency. She has been improving with nicardipine drip. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 144/85 mmHg to 190/134 mmHg. Her heart rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is at 100%. She is currently not experiencing any complaints.

The patient's abdominal wall hematoma has shown a decrease in size on abdominal CT scan. Pain management is being continued with morphine, gabapentin, and Tylenol as needed. She is also on prednisone at 4 mg PO daily for her SLE.

The patient has anemia, which is mildly decreased from baseline. Monitoring of hematocrit (HCT) is recommended. She has a superior vena cava (SVC) thrombus, and her Coumadin levels are supratherapeutic. INR and coagulation parameters will be monitored. Evidence of myocardial hypertrophy was found on recent echocardiogram (Echo), but the patient is currently not experiencing any symptoms. Beta-blocker therapy will be continued. There is no worsening pericardial effusion.

Depression/anxiety treatment will continue with Celexa and clonazepam. The patient refuses CPAP for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, and abdominal pain. He was admitted to the ICU for hypertensive crisis and is currently undergoing dialysis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 118/64 mmHg, heart rate of 79 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's temperature is within normal range. 

During the past 24 hours, the patient underwent dialysis due to elevated potassium levels, and his EKG showed peaked T waves. He received 15 mg of Kayexalate for hyperkalemia. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is stable at 24.8 g/dL. At 2 AM, he received an additional 30 mg of Nicardipine because of a high blood pressure reading of 230/129 mmHg while asleep. The patient reported abdominal pain overnight, which was not relieved by morphine, so he was given 0.5 mg of dilaudid IV once.

Allergies include penicillins and Percocet (oral), which causes itching. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on [**2142-1-16**] at 07:07 AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for hypertensive urgency. Her current conditions include hypertension, a left abdominal wall hematoma, anemia, a superior vena cava (SVC) thrombus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), depression/anxiety, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and malnutrition. She requires ongoing medical management and support in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on multiple antihypertensive medications. It is important to monitor her blood pressure closely to prevent complications related to uncontrolled hypertension such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.
2. Left abdominal wall hematoma: Although the size of the hematoma has decreased, it is still present and may continue to cause pain and discomfort. Monitoring the hematoma for any signs of expansion or infection is crucial to prevent further complications.
3. Anemia: The patient has mild anemia, which can be managed with appropriate treatment. If left untreated, anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. SVC thrombus: The presence of an SVC thrombus poses a significant risk of pulmonary embolism if it dislodges. Close monitoring of the patient's symptoms and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and hypertension. She was admitted with hypertensive urgency. Her blood pressure improved with nicardipine drip but increased when she missed a dose of oral nicardipine. She is now off the nicardipine drip and restarting her home oral antihypertensives. She is due for hemodialysis today and will be placed back on her regular hemodialysis schedule of Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

The patient also has hyperkalemia, which resolved with administration of kayexalate. She has a left abdominal wall hematoma, which showed a small decrease in size on abdominal CT. She is experiencing pain, and morphine did not help, so she was switched to dilaudid PO instead. She continues with gabapentin and Tylenol as needed for pain.

The patient has several other medical issues including SLE, ESRD, anemia, superior vena cava (SVC) thrombus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), depression/anxiety, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and food allergies. She is on multiple medications including prednisone, beta blockers, Celexa, clonazepam, and various antihypertensive medications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of obstructive sleep apnea, chronic renal failure, hypertension, and abdominal pain. He was admitted to the ICU due to hypertensive crisis. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.4°C, heart rate 91 bpm, blood pressure 157/106 mmHg, respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an increase in total fluid intake and output balance of 310 mL. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and his skin, neurologic status, and tone are also not assessed. Laboratory results indicate elevated potassium levels and decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, PT/PTT/INR, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite being called out overnight. This could lead to complications such as hypertensive encephalopathy, intracerebral hemorrhage, or aortic dissection.
2. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function. This can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic symptoms.
3. Obstructive Sleep Apnea: The patient's history of OSA may contribute to respiratory issues, including"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and hypertension. She was admitted with hypertensive urgency. 

During her stay in the ICU, her blood pressure improved with the use of a nicardipine drip. However, it increased when she missed a dose of oral nicardipine but came down after replacing the dose. She was taken off the nicardipine drip and restarted on her home oral antihypertensives.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hyperkalemia, which resolved with the administration of kayexalate. She also has a left abdominal wall hematoma that showed a decrease in size on abdominal CT. She is experiencing pain, which has been managed with dilaudid PO instead of morphine. She continues to take gabapentin and Tylenol as needed for pain.

Her SLE and ESRD are being managed with prednisone and hemodialysis, respectively. Her anemia is mildly decreased, and she has a superior vena cava (SVC) thrombus with supratherapeutic levels of coumadin. Her heart conditions include hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and mitral valve prolapse (MVP). She also has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and is offered CPAP pressure but refuses it"

The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). She was admitted with hypertensive urgency. The patient's blood pressure improved with nicardipine drip but increased when she missed a dose of oral nicardipine, returning to normal after a replacement dose.

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including hypertension, hyperkalemia, a left abdominal wall hematoma, SLE, ESRD, anemia, superior vena cava (SVC) thrombus, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), depression/anxiety, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and a history of abdominal pain.

The patient's current medications include oral antihypertensives, including nicardipine, aliskiren, labetalol, hydralazine, and clonidine. She is also taking prednisone for SLE, gabapentin and Tylenol for pain, an anemia medication, and anticoagulation therapy with coumadin. The patient has a tunneled (Hickman) line and a peripheral intravenous (PIV) line.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating possible worsening renal function. Her potassium levels are within normal range. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated. Other"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She was admitted to the ICU for malignant hypertension crisis. The patient's blood pressure was initially very high, reaching systolic levels of up to 230's, and she received treatment with nicardipine and hydralazine. After these interventions, her blood pressure decreased to the 100's-120's range and remained stable overnight. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 98-234 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation but does not require supplemental oxygen. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight imbalance in fluid intake and output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's history of chronic renal failure and the recent episodes of high blood pressure could potentially lead to AKI. Close monitoring of renal function and urine output is essential.
2. Hypertensive Emergency: Although the patient's blood pressure has been managed, there is still a risk of recurrent hypertensive emergency. Continuous blood pressure monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary.
3. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): Immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing VTE. Prophyl"

   # Hypertension: Pt with extensive history of hypertension. Patient's BP
   improved with nicardipine drip.  Became increased yesterday when the
   patient missed a dose of oral nicardipine, but came down after a
   replacement dose.
   - restarted all home oral antihypertensives including nicardipine 30
   Q8H, aliskerin 150mg [**Hospital1 **], labetalol 900mg TID, hydralazine 100mg TID,
   and clonidine 0.3mg + 0.1mg weekly at current doses.
   - Renal consulted, HD yesterday
   - HD was MWF last week because of holiday schedule, will put back on
   home schedule of T, TH, Sat
   - follow renal recs
   -Will call Renal attending following patient to get more concise plan
   given patient continues to have hypertensive episodes about 1 hour
   prior to her Q 8 hour nicardipine dosing.  It would also be useful to
   have plan in place for discharge for when patient returns to ED.
   .
   #  Hyperkalemia:  Stable. Will continue to monitor.
   .
   # Left abdominal wall hematoma:  Abd CT showed small amount of decrease
   in the size.  Pt reported that morphine did not help pain, switched to
   dilaudid PO instead yesterday and pain controlled.  Contine gabapentin
   and tylenol as needed for pain.
   .
   # SLE:
   - continue prednisone at 4 mg PO daily
   .
   #ESRD: Renal following, plan for HD on Tuesday, back on regular
   schedule.
   - follow lytes, replete as indicated
   - HD T, TH, Sat this week
   .
   # Anemia: mildly decreased today, baseline 26, she is mildly decreased
   from baseline. AOCD and in setting of renal failure
   - monitor HCT daily
   .
   # SVC thrombus: Found to have SVC thrombus, supratherapeutic on
   coumadin.
   - will hold for now and trend INR currently 3.1
   - monitor coags  will likely need coumadin restarted tomorrow [**1-18**]

   # HOCM: evidence of myocardial hypertrophy on recent Echo. Currently
   not symptomatic. Echo without evidence of worsening pericardial
   effusion.
   - Continue beta blocker
   # Depression/anxiety. Continue Celexa, clonazepam 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
