","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, admitted after being found unresponsive in bed. The patient has been experiencing possible alcohol withdrawal and two weeks of reported hematemesis. On arrival to the MICU, the patient appeared to be having seizures with rhythmic eye movements. A head CT was negative for acute processes, and the tox screen was negative. The patient is suspected to have hepatic encephalopathy, possibly precipitated by a gastrointestinal bleed. There are no signs of infection or portal vein thrombosis on the RUQ US. The patient's pH on ABG is slightly high but reasonable, indicating that the patient is able to ventilate well. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the patient's altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's sudden unresponsiveness and time course of symptoms suggest the possibility of altered mental status. This could be due to alcohol withdrawal, hepatic encephalopathy, or another underlying cause.
2. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of UGIB and was found with bloody emesis. The patient's baseline hematocrit (Hct) is unclear, but it appears to be in the upper 20's to low 30's. The patient has been stable overnight, but ongoing monitoring and treatment are required.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AK"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, admitted after being found unresponsive in bed. The patient has been experiencing symptoms such as tremulousness, possible hepatic encephalopathy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's current medical conditions include altered mental status, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), acute renal failure (ARF), alcoholic hepatitis, hyperkalemia, elevated lipase, and hyperlipidemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status and history of possible withdrawal seizures indicate a risk for recurrent seizures.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's symptoms of tremulousness and possible hepatic encephalopathy suggest a risk for further deterioration in mental status and potential development of hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of UGIB and ongoing bleeding indicate a risk for continued blood loss and potential hypotension.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level of 1.1-1.2 and current level of 2.5 suggest worsening renal function, which may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
5. Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient's elevated AST and ALT levels (>2:1) suggest acute alcoholic hepatitis on top of alcoholic cirrhosis. This condition can lead to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. He was admitted after being found unresponsive in bed, with a possible history of alcohol withdrawal and two weeks of reported hematemesis (vomiting blood). On arrival to the ICU, the patient appeared to be having seizures with rhythmic eye movements. A head CT showed no acute processes, and a tox screen was negative. The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and is showing signs of hepatic encephalopathy (liver dysfunction affecting brain function). He is currently intubated with a nasogastric (NG) tube, receiving lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and has been placed on IV fluids to maintain hydration.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of UGIB and is currently experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by bloody output from the nasogastric tube. This can lead to hypotension, shock, and potential organ failure.

2. Alcoholic Hepatitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes with AST:ALT > 2:1, indicating possible acute alcoholic hepatitis on top of pre-existing cirrhosis. This condition can progress to liver failure and increase the risk of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis, admitted after being found unresponsive in bed. He has a history of possible alcohol withdrawal, two weeks of reported hematemesis, and an episode of poor oral intake. The patient appeared to be having seizures upon arrival to the MICU with rhythmic eye movements. A head CT showed no acute processes, and a tox screen was negative. The patient's mental status has not improved overnight, and he is still obtunded. There is no evidence of respiratory distress, and intubation was not performed overnight. Preliminary EEG results from last night were negative for seizures. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals mild scleral icterus, grossly bloody oral pharynx, tachycardia, no jugular venous distention, no thyromegaly, and 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, low potassium, and high bicarbonate levels. The patient has a history of alcoholic hepatitis, and his liver enzymes are significantly elevated above baseline. There is concern for acute"

   56 yo M with h/o etoh cirrhosis admitted with recent vomiting and now

   Altered mental status:  Likely related to hepatic encephalopathy
   although eye roving/facial vibrations yesterday ?concerning for
   seizure.  No evidence of seizure on EEG yesterday.  Regarding
   encephalopathy: possible decompensation in the setting of recent
   increase in vomiting.  SBP always a possibility although does not
   appear to have much ascites on exam.  CXR is underwhelming as is lack
   of leukocytosis, very low suspicion for pneumonia although mild
   aspiration pneumonitis (in the setting of vomiting) is possible.

     -Hold on further empiric abx for now.
     -Appears to be breathing comfortably and by ABG is very adequately

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of ethanol (etoh) cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU after being found unresponsive at home. He has been experiencing increased vomiting over the past few days and had a last drink on Tuesday night. The patient has also been noted to be tremulous and then unresponsive. In the ED, he was found to be in acute renal failure with mild hyperkalemia. He received intravenous fluids (IVF) and empiric antibiotics.

Upon arrival in the ICU, the patient exhibited roving eye movements and facial ""vibrations."" Lorazepam (Ativan) was administered, which helped slow down the eye movements. An EEG was performed, and there was no evidence of seizure. The patient's condition includes encephalopathy, possibly related to hepatic encephalopathy, and hypotension, which improved with hydration overnight.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 91/51 mmHg (72/37 mmHg), respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of ethanol (etoh) cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for unresponsiveness. The patient's recent vomiting and altered mental status are consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is also experiencing renal failure, hyperammonemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The vital signs show sinus tachycardia and stable blood pressure. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates adequate fluid resuscitation. The patient has chronic venous stasis changes in both lower extremities.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and rifaximin.
2. Renal failure: Maintain fluid balance and monitor creatinine levels.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Administer pantoprazole and sucralfate. No plans for endoscopy at present.
4. Cirrhosis: Continue lactulose and rifaximin. Hold diuretics due to dehydration.
5. Ethanol abuse: Monitor for signs of withdrawal. Provide vitamin support.
6. Nutrition: Provide total parenteral nutrition (TF).
7. Glycemic control: Blood sugar well controlled.
8. Lines: Change IV lines as per protocol.
9. Prophylaxis: Administer DVT boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and VAP precautions.

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis admitted with recent vomiting and unresponsiveness. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 123/58 mmHg, heart rate of 108 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for recent vomiting and dehydration.

The patient has a history of etoh cirrhosis and was found to be in renal failure with hyperammonemia. The altered mental status has been improving overnight, and the most likely diagnosis is hepatic encephalopathy due to recent increases in vomiting, dehydration, and respiratory alkalosis.

The plan includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy. Renal failure is suspected to be prerenal from dehydration or hepatorenal syndrome. Both glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and potassium levels have improved with hydration, so maintenance fluid will be given today.

The patient also has a possible gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) with some blood in his mouth and recent hematemesis. However, there are no signs of active bleeding, and the hematocrit (HCT) level is stable. Prophylactic treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and sucralfate will be provided.

The patient's cirrhosis requires lactulose and rif"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yoM w/ h/o EtOH cirrhosis; admitted after being found this morning
   unrepsonsive in bed by roommate, in setting of possible EtOH withdrawal
   and two weeks of reported hematemesis.
   #. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 although it is unclear what the actual
   etiology was of patient
s initial altered status was, the most likely
   explanation is hepatic encephalopathy, given that his ammonia was >200
   on admission; seizure, likely etoh w/d, was considered on arrival for
   which the patient received 6mg ativan, but per neuro is unlikely given
   that there was no seizure activity on EEG performed day of admission.
   LP was deferred, as the etiology of his current somnolence is likely to
   be decreased clearance of the benzodiazepine. Patient began to wake up
   overnight as expected as he begins to clear the meds.
   -- cont aggressive lactulose (and rifaximin) given HE is most likely
   diagnosis
   -- no resp compromise; sats good on room air; no need for ""airway
   protection"" intubation
   --continue aspiration precautions, advance diet carefully and with
   supervision
   #. UGIB: patient has history of UGIB; has been scoped in past, no
   evidence of bleed; c/f portal gastropathy. Report of hematemesis is
   unconfirmed, patient had blood on his teeth only. Baseline Hct unclear,
   has been stable at 27.
   -- maintain active T&S
   -- PPI IV BID; sucralfate
   -- liver recs
 start TF
   #. ARF: baseline Cr 1.1-1.2; admitted with Cr 2.5 with story of poor PO
   intake over several weeks.  Likely pre-renal.  Some improvement o/n
   with IVF; Cr now 2.0.
   -- cont IVF boluses as still appears volume contracted; will monitor
   volume balance closely
   -- will hold lisinopril 20 mg QD and lasix 40 mg QD (home meds)
   #. ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS: AST:ALT > 2:1, elevated above baseline (AST
   normally runs low 100's or less); concern for acute alcoholic hepatitis
   on top of alcoholic cirrhosis.  Could not visualize portal vein on RUQ
   US. Could also have some element of congestive hepatopathy.
   -- f/u liver recs (touched base w/ fellow by phone tonight; will see in
   am)
   -- cont lactulose/rifaximin
   #. ELEVATED LIPASE: has h/o elevated lipase with prior episodes of poor
   PO intake and emesis.  Pt was c/o abd pain prior to being found
   unrepsonsive.
   -- cont to trend
   #. H/O ETOH ABUSE: last drink on [**12-22**]; drinks 1 bottle of wine per
   night.  C/f increased ingestion recently.  Gave banana bag.
   -- no need for CIWA currently
   -- will place s/w consult once pt more responsive

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. He was admitted after being found unresponsive in bed, with possible alcohol withdrawal and two weeks of reported hematemesis (vomiting blood). The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's initial altered status is most likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, as indicated by elevated ammonia levels on admission. The patient received 6mg of lorazepam (Ativan) for suspected alcohol withdrawal, but this is unlikely because there was no seizure activity on the EEG performed. The neurologist decided to monitor the patient before considering a lumbar puncture (LP) or MRI.

2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of UGIB and was scoped in the past without evidence of bleeding. He reported hematemesis, but it has not been confirmed. His baseline hematocrit (Hct) level is unclear, but it has been stable at 27%. He will continue to receive aggressive lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine (Cr) level was 1.1-1.2, but he presented with Cr 2.5 due to poor oral intake over several weeks. This is likely pre-renal azotemia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are currently in the ICU and remain very altered, unable to provide a history due to encephalopathy. The urine culture is negative, and the neurologist has decided to monitor the patient before considering a lumbar puncture (LP) or MRI. The patient received 6mg of ativan on Saturday, which has not cleared possibly due to renal and hepatic failure. The patient's blood pressure is borderline and requires fluid resuscitation with 2 liters of lactated Ringer's (LR). The chest X-ray shows b/l infiltrates, consistent with pneumonia, and mild interstitial edema at the lung bases. The patient has no known drug allergies and is on various medications including sucralfate, protonix, rifaximin, lactulose, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have sinus tachycardia and are tachycardic. Fluid balance shows an input of 8,443 mL and output of 3,220 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 5,223 mL. The patient requires respiratory support with an O2 delivery device and has an ABG result of ///17/. The patient's general appearance is that of a poorly nourished, altered individual who is awake. Physical examination findings include jaundice, altered mental status, and muscle wasting. Neurologic examination is incomplete due to the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yoM w/ h/o EtOH cirrhosis; admitted after being found this morning
   unrepsonsive in bed by roommate, in setting of possible EtOH withdrawal
   and two weeks of reported hematemesis.
   #. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 although it is unclear what the actual
   etiology was of patient
s initial altered status was, the most likely
   explanation is hepatic encephalopathy, given that his ammonia was >200
   on admission; seizure, likely etoh w/d, was considered on arrival for
   which the patient received 6mg ativan, but per neuro is unlikely given
   that there was no seizure activity on EEG performed day of admission.
   LP was deferred, as the etiology of his current somnolence is likely to
   be decreased clearance of the benzodiazepine. Patient began to wake up
   overnight as expected as he begins to clear the meds.
   -- cont aggressive lactulose (and rifaximin) given HE is most likely
   diagnosis
   -- no resp compromise; sats good on room air; no need for ""airway
   protection"" intubation
   --continue aspiration precautions, advance diet carefully and with
   supervision
   #. UGIB: patient has history of UGIB; has been scoped in past, no
   evidence of bleed; c/f portal gastropathy. Report of hematemesis is
   unconfirmed, patient had blood on his teeth only. Baseline Hct unclear,
   has been stable at 27.
   -- maintain active T&S
   -- PPI IV BID; sucralfate
   -- liver recs
 start TF
   #. ARF: baseline Cr 1.1-1.2; admitted with Cr 2.5 with story of poor PO
   intake over several weeks.  Likely pre-renal.  Some improvement o/n
   with IVF; Cr now 2.0.
   -- cont IVF boluses as still appears volume contracted; will monitor
   volume balance closely
   -- will hold lisinopril 20 mg QD and lasix 40 mg QD (home meds)
   #. ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS: AST:ALT > 2:1, elevated above baseline (AST
   normally runs low 100's or less); concern for acute alcoholic hepatitis
   on top of alcoholic cirrhosis.  Could not visualize portal vein on RUQ
   US. Could also have some element of congestive hepatopathy.
   -- f/u liver recs (touched base w/ fellow by phone tonight; will see in
   am)
   -- cont lactulose/rifaximin
   #. ELEVATED LIPASE: has h/o elevated lipase with prior episodes of poor
   PO intake and emesis.  Pt was c/o abd pain prior to being found
   unrepsonsive.
   -- cont to trend
   #. H/O ETOH ABUSE: last drink on [**12-22**]; drinks 1 bottle of wine per
   night.  C/f increased ingestion recently.  Gave banana bag.
   -- no need for CIWA currently
   -- will place s/w consult once pt more responsive
   #. HYPERLIPIDEMIA:
   -- will hold home simvastatin given acute elevation in LFT's

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis who was admitted after being found unresponsive in bed. He has a reported history of hematemesis and possible EtOH withdrawal. Upon admission, the patient's ammonia level was significantly elevated at >200, which could explain his initial altered mental status. Seizure activity was considered but ruled out due to normal EEG results. The patient received lorazepam for suspected EtOH withdrawal and began to wake up overnight, likely due to decreased clearance of the medication.

The patient is currently alert and oriented x3, although still confused. He pulled out his nasogastric (NG) tube and is able to take some liquids and crushed pills. Allergies and last dose of antibiotics are unknown. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is in sinus rhythm.

The patient has been on various infusions and medications in the ICU, including IV fluids, PPI, sucralfate, and TF. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and liver enzymes. Other notable lab results include elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and lactate levels. Imaging studies"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chief complaint of encephalopathy. The patient's mental status has shown gradual but significant improvement throughout the day, although he still appears confused. The patient was able to pull out his NG tube and tolerate some liquids and crushed pills. There are no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius (100.3 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate ranging from 83 to 115 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 114/61 to 135/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -1635 mL since midnight. Laboratory results indicate several abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, low platelet count, high creatinine, high lactate, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has a history of acute renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and other electrolyte and fluid disorders. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's history of acute renal failure, along with the laboratory results showing high creatinine levels, suggests ongoing kidney dysfunction. This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yoM w/ h/o EtOH cirrhosis; admitted after being found this morning
   unrepsonsive in bed by roommate, in setting of possible EtOH withdrawal
   and two weeks of reported hematemesis.
   #. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 initial insult likely HE, then exacerbated
   by inability to clear Ativan. Now mental status clearing nicely,
   patient is much more alert. Tolerating PO
   -- cont lactulose (and rifaximin) given HE is most likely diagnosis
   --continue aspiration precautions, advance diet carefully and with
   supervision
   --encourage PO intake
   # HYPERCHLOREMIA: patient likely continues to be dehydrated. Will
   switch to D5
 NS today and encourage PO intake.
   #. UGIB: patient has history of UGIB; has been scoped in past, no
   evidence of bleed; c/f portal gastropathy. Report of hematemesis is
   unconfirmed, patient had blood on his teeth only. Baseline Hct unclear,
   has been stable.
   -- maintain active T&S
   -- PPI IV BID; sucralfate
   -- liver recs
 will likely scope
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal, resolved with IVF.
   -- cont IVF boluses today until PO intake adequate
   -- will hold lisinopril 20 mg QD and lasix 40 mg QD (home meds)
   #. ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS: AST:ALT > 2:1, elevated above baseline (AST
   normally runs low 100's or less); concern for acute alcoholic hepatitis
   on top of alcoholic cirrhosis.  Could not visualize portal vein on RUQ
   US. Could also have some element of congestive hepatopathy.
   -- f/u liver recs
   -- cont lactulose/rifaximin
   #. ELEVATED LIPASE: has h/o elevated lipase with prior episodes of poor
   PO intake and emesis.  Pt was c/o abd pain prior to being found
   unrepsonsive.
   -- cont to trend
   #. H/O ETOH ABUSE: last drink on [**12-22**]; drinks 1 bottle of wine per
   night.  C/f increased ingestion recently.  Gave banana bag.
   -- no need for CIWA currently
   -- will place s/w consult today
   #. HYPERLIPIDEMIA:
   -- will hold home simvastatin given acute elevation in LFT's
   #. NUTRITION: ADAT with aspiration precautions

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of etoh cirrhosis, admitted with recent vomiting and unresponsiveness. He has been diagnosed with renal failure and hyperammonemia. The patient's altered mental status has improved, and it is believed to be most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, likely due to recent vomiting, dehydration, and respiratory alkalosis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/67 to 135/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is in sinus tachycardia.

The patient has received various treatments and interventions, including lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy and potential gastrointestinal bleeding, pantoprazole (Protonix), carafate, and possible esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in the future. Diuretics have been withheld due to dehydration. The patient also requires vitamin support and an addiction consult.

The patient's laboratory results show several abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, high blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are also imbalanced.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a common complication of liver cirrhosis and can cause altered mental status and confusion.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of vomiting blood and hematemesis suggests possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function.
4. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection.
5. Hypoglycemia: Despite the elevated blood glucose levels, careful monitoring is still necessary as the patient may develop hypoglycemia during treatment.
6. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet indicates a significant fluid deficit, which needs to be carefully managed.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory alkalosis should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to prevent further respiratory issues.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management."

   in vomiting and dehydration and respiratory alkalosis
     -Continue Lactulose and rifaximin
    Renal Failure: Prerenal from dehydration vs HRS.  Both GFR and
   potassium have improved with hydration.
   ?GIB:  Some blood in his mouth and per partner some hematemesis
   recently.  No signs of active bleeding, HCT stable.
     -PPI and carafate
     -Possible EGD at some point in the future.
    Cirrhosis:
     -Lactulose and rifaximin as above
     -Diuretics on hold in setting of dehydration
    Etoh abuse:  Should be out of the window for withdrawal at this point.
     -Vitamin Support
     -Addiction consult
   FEN: Will po challenge today as he removed his NGT.
      -If needed, will use D5 1/2 NS for maintence given hyperchloremic
   non-gap acidosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. He was admitted with recent vomiting and unresponsiveness, and found to be in renal failure with hyperammonemia. The patient's altered mental status has improved today, suggesting hepatic encephalopathy due to recent vomiting, dehydration, and respiratory alkalosis. The plan includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, treating suspected gastrointestinal bleeding with PPI and carafate, addressing possible esophagogastroduodenoscopy in the future, managing cirrhosis with lactulose and rifaximin, providing vitamin support, addiction consult, and considering a feeding tube placement due to poor oral intake."

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yoM w/ h/o EtOH cirrhosis; admitted after being found this morning
   unrepsonsive in bed by roommate, in setting of possible EtOH withdrawal
   and two weeks of reported hematemesis.
   #. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 initial insult likely HE, then exacerbated
   by inability to clear Ativan. Now mental status clearing nicely,
   patient is much more alert. Tolerating PO
   -- cont lactulose (and rifaximin) given HE is most likely diagnosis
   --continue aspiration precautions, advance diet carefully and with
   supervision
   --encourage PO intake
   # HYPERCHLOREMIA: patient likely continues to be dehydrated. Will
   switch to D5
 NS today and encourage PO intake.
   #. UGIB: patient has history of UGIB; has been scoped in past, no
   evidence of bleed; c/f portal gastropathy. Report of hematemesis is
   unconfirmed, patient had blood on his teeth only. Baseline Hct unclear,
   has been stable.
   -- maintain active T&S
   -- PPI IV BID; sucralfate
   -- liver recs
 will likely scope
   #. ARF: Likely pre-renal, resolved with IVF.
   -- cont IVF boluses today until PO intake adequate
   -- will hold lisinopril 20 mg QD and lasix 40 mg QD (home meds)
   #. ALCOHOLIC HEPATITIS: AST:ALT > 2:1, elevated above baseline (AST
   normally runs low 100's or less); concern for acute alcoholic hepatitis
   on top of alcoholic cirrhosis.  Could not visualize portal vein on RUQ
   US. Could also have some element of congestive hepatopathy.
   -- f/u liver recs
   -- cont lactulose/rifaximin
   #. ELEVATED LIPASE: has h/o elevated lipase with prior episodes of poor
   PO intake and emesis.  Pt was c/o abd pain prior to being found
   unrepsonsive.
   -- cont to trend
   #. H/O ETOH ABUSE: last drink on [**12-22**]; drinks 1 bottle of wine per
   night.  C/f increased ingestion recently.  Gave banana bag.
   -- no need for CIWA currently
   -- will place s/w consult today
   #. HYPERLIPIDEMIA:
   -- will hold home simvastatin given acute elevation in LFT's

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis.
- He was admitted after being found unresponsive in bed, with a possible diagnosis of EtOH withdrawal and two weeks of reported hematemesis (vomiting blood).
- The patient has altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy (HE), which is exacerbated by an inability to clear Ativan (a medication).
- His mental status is clearing with lactulose (a medication used to treat HE) and careful monitoring.
- The patient has hyperchloremia, indicating ongoing dehydration, and will be switched to D5NS (a type of intravenous fluid) today.
- He has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), with no evidence of active bleeding found during a scope, but with evidence of portal gastropathy.
- The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) resolved with intravenous fluids (IVF).
- There are concerns about alcoholic hepatitis on top of alcoholic cirrhosis, as indicated by elevated AST and ALT levels.
- The patient's elevated lipase levels may be due to poor oral intake and vomiting.
- The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and was given a banana bag (a package containing medications commonly given to patients with alcohol withdrawal).
- The patient's hyperlipidemia will be managed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. He was admitted with recent vomiting and unresponsiveness, and was found to have encephalopathy and renal failure with hyperammonemia. Most abnormalities have resolved.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/54 to 135/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 5,740 mL and output of 1,177 mL since midnight. The patient's blood products, urine output, NG output, stool, and drain outputs are also recorded.

Physical examination findings include general appearance of no acute distress, thin build, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, and intact pulses in the extremities. The patient is oriented x 3, attentive, and follows simple commands. However, neurological examination was not fully assessed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. He was admitted with recent vomiting and unresponsiveness, which was attributed to hepatic encephalopathy and drug effect. The patient was found to have renal failure and hyperammonemia, but most abnormalities have resolved. The patient's current condition includes an electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute renal failure, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can lead to altered mental status and confusion due to the buildup of toxins in the brain caused by liver dysfunction.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's impaired kidney function may progress to chronic renal failure if not properly managed.
3. Infection: Patients with compromised liver and kidney function are at higher risk for infections, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Hepatic hydrothorax: In advanced stages of liver disease, fluid can accumulate in the pleural space, leading to shortness of breath and decreased lung function.
5. Esophageal varices: These are dilated veins in the esophagus that can rupture and cause severe bleeding in patients with cirrhosis.
6. Hepatorenal syndrome: This condition occurs when advanced liver disease leads to kidney dysfunction.
7. Hepatic osteodystrophy: Chronic liver disease can result in bone loss and osteoporosis, increasing the risk of"
