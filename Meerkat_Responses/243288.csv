","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, who presents with gallstone pancreatitis. The patient's initial assessment shows that she meets at least 2 Ranson criteria for gallstone pancreatitis and plans for ERCP possibly followed by cholecystectomy were made. The patient received aggressive fluid resuscitation and her ejection fraction (EF) is noted to be 40-50%. Lactate levels have improved from 2.6 to 1.1.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Gallstone pancreatitis: The patient's presentation indicates gallstone pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as persistent abdominal pain, pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst formation, or infected pancreatic necrosis.

2. Hypovolemia (volume depletion without shock): The patient is experiencing hypovolemia, as indicated by the fluid balance sheet showing a total input of 2,946 mL and total output of 1,625 mL. This could be due to ongoing fluid losses through various routes, including vomiting, diarrhea, or ongoing bleeding. It is important to monitor and manage fluid resuscitation to prevent further volume depletion.

3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's laboratory results show mild electrolyte abnormalities, including low potassium (K+ 3.7 mEq/L), low magnesium (Mg+ 1.8 mEq"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is an 89-year-old female with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and gallstone pancreatitis.
- She presented with gallstone pancreatitis, which was confirmed by elevated levels of amylase and lipase.
- The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain and tenderness.
- She received aggressive fluid resuscitation and her ejection fraction (EF) was noted to be 40-50%.
- Her lactate level decreased from 2.6 to 1.1.
- The patient is currently on maintenance intravenous fluids at 80cc/hr with a goal of urine output (UOP) greater than 50 cc/hr.
- She is also receiving Unasyn 3grams every 6 hours for infection, and her liver function tests (LFTs) and electrolyte levels are being monitored.
- The patient's home medications for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are being held for now due to pancreatitis.
- She is at risk for severe lactic acidosis, but her anion gap has closed.
- The patient denies any symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) or shortness of breath, but it is unclear if her left bundle branch block (LBBB) is new or old.
- Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and gallstone pancreatitis. She presents with altered mental status, which is not delirium, and has been experiencing chest pain in the evening with an unremarkable EKG. The patient also has wheezy lungs, but no known history of COPD or asthma. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 109/55 mmHg to 184/142 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and mildly disoriented. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, and mildly elevated liver enzymes. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, and her lactate level has decreased from 2.6 to 1.1. 

The patient received aggressive fluid resuscitation and is maintaining an ejection fraction of 40-50%. She has been prescribed Unasyn for infection, metoprolol IV for atrial fibrillation, and heparin subcutaneously for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 89 yo F, [**Hospital3 22**] resident, h/o htn,
   a-fib (no coumadin, asa) p/w gs pancreatitis. S/p ercp with stent
   placement. She remains intermittently confused / delirious, worse
   overnight.
   PE:  98.3  HR 70   BP140/60  RR 17  100% 2L
   Alert and pleasant but confused, b/b rales, RR, faint m, soft,+ bs, nt,
   no edema
   Labs reviewed: lipase 177 (6000) wbc 15.9, hct 33, cr 0.6, ca 8.2, ces
   neg X 1 set, LFTS normalized
   CXs --ngtd
   CXR- improvement in hilar fullness and mild interstitial edema
   A/P: acute gs pancreatitis s/p ercp, leukocytosis (decreasing),
   delirium,  h/o a-fib
   Agree with plan to manage gs pancreatitis with antibx course (unasyn).
   She is s/p ercp with stenting and her lfts have normalized, pancreatic
   enzymes are trending down. Her renal fx and hct remain stable. Her
   leukocytosis is trending down and bandemia has resolved and she remains
   AF with ngtd on cx data.  Clarify plan for repeat ercp vs interval
   chole down the line, as per surgical team.  We have stopped her IVFs
   and are advancing her diet.  Will further optimize BP control and
   resume home regimen.  She continues to have ICU delirium that seems
   worse at night. Would begin standing zyprexa at night +  prn,
   reoriente, optimizing sleep wake schedule. Would benefit from PT
   consult.  ICU: Sq hep, pIVs, full code.  Remainder of plan as outlined
   in resident note.
   Continue to work with surgical team regarding transfer to [**Hospital 680**]
   hospital to be closer to her home at her family request.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Altered mental status, initially diagnosed as delirium, which is worse at night.
- Hypertension, described as benign.
- Lactate levels initially elevated, indicating potential severe lactic acidosis, but have since improved.
- No significant cardiac enzyme elevation, suggesting no ongoing myocardial infarction.
- Mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, but no guarding or rebound tenderness.
- Clear lungs on auscultation, with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
- Normal heart rhythm (Sinus Rhythm) with a regular rate and regular rhythm.
- Improved chest X-ray from the previous day.
- Blood glucose levels within normal range.
- White blood cell count initially elevated, but trending down.
- Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels within normal range.
