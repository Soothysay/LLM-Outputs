   - Discrepency between patient's O2 sats (94% with good pleth) and pO2
   on gasses (137-160).  Went down cautiously on FiO2 to 50%.  At 4am PO2
   on gas went to 84 and pulse ox to mid 80s.  Increased FiO2 to 60 and
   then 100% (increased PEEP didn't help).  Next PO2 333 with O2 sats in
   the mid 90s.  ?met hemoglobinemia, but test difficult to run b/c of
   intralipid.  CXR looks increasingly congested.
   - Lab thinks that lipids may be depressing O2 sat.  Called toxicology,
   they will get back to us.
   - Continued on intralipid for 4 hours.
   - pH down to 7.47 at 10pm so started on D5 with 100mEq of bicarb at
   200ccs/hour.  pH 7.45 at 11pm.  then remained stable ~7.43, but without
   signs of QRS widening on EKG.

   44F with depression and EtOH abuse, s/p severe TCA overdose.  Multiple
   seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes.
   .
   # TCA overdose.  Doxepin found on scene.  Fits clinical scenario with
   CNS depression, widened QRS, seizure, hypotension initially at OSH.
   Received hypertonic Na and IV bicarb to overcome fast Na channel
   antagonism, lipid for improving volume of distribution.  No role for HD
   given volume of distribution
   - Appreciate tox recs.
   - Na bicarb prn to maintain pH > 7.45.
   - Keep K > 3 with supplemental (though does not need to be >4).
   - Given current pH, will hold bicarb for now.  Restart gtt when needed
   (3 amps at ~250 cc/hr - twice maintenance)
   - Continue intralipid infusion - 22.5 ml/min of 20% intralipid per tox.
   - Q1H ABG.
   - Q2H electrolytes.
   - Despite pH, avoid hypoventilation, as this let to clinical worsening
   in ED (VT rhythm appeared when RR decreased to 20).
   - Q1H ECG.
   - Seizure management.
   - Norepinephrine prn for hypotension (normotensive now, though commonly
   seen in TCA overdose).
   - Repeat 2 more doses of activated charcoal.
   .
   # Fevers: Ddx new infection, TCA overdose.  Has been hemodynamically
   stable w/o signs of hypotension/shock..
   .
   # Hypoxemia/impaired pulse oximetry: Unclear which [**Location (un) 118**] to trust.
   At least partly due to fluid overload.
   .
   # Seizure.  Most likely from TCA overdose and GABA receptor antagonist
   activity.  No prior history of seizures known.
   - Started on propofol gtt.  Pressors if needed for hypotension.
   - TCA management as above.
   - Benzos prn breakthrough seizure.
   .
   # Wide complex tachycardia.  Precordial negative concordance and axis
   change most suspicious for VT.  Also consider sinus tach with QRS
   widening from TCAs.  VT can be seen severe TCA overdose.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
   - s/p lidocaine bolus of 100mg; rebolus and gtt at this point if
   recurs.
   - TCA management as above.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in field due to mental status from
   med related CNS depression likely.
   - Keep current vent settings as above; no plan to wean until more
   medically stable.
   - Aline in place.
   .
   # Anion gap/lactic acidosis.  Likely related to TCA overdose, but by
   ?mechanism.  Was hypotensive at times during course, now normotensive.
   Lactate improving.
   - ABGs as above.
   - Fluid resuscitation prn.  Avoid further hypotension.  Pressors as
   needed for med-related hypotension.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Iatrogenic from multiple IV infusions of hypertonic
   fluids.
   - Monitor Q2H.
   .
   # Hypokalemia.  As above.  From extra to intracellular potassium shifts
   with alkalemic pH.
   - Replete to goal >3.
   .
   # Fever.  Upon arrival to MICU.  Blood cultures drawn in ED.  CXR
   without pneumonia and urine without WBCs.  Suspect central fever with
   above overdose.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of depression and ethanol abuse who presented with severe tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. The patient experienced multiple seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes. She was given hypertonic Na and IV bicarb to overcome fast Na channel antagonism, lipid for improving volume of distribution, and no role for HD given volume of distribution.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.6 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 117/77 mmHg to 159/97 mmHg, heart rate between 65-94 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 550-600 mL, respiratory rate set at 24, FiO2 at 100%, and PEEP at 5 cmH2O. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH 7.44, PaCO2 33.0 mmHg, HCO3- 28.0 mEq/L, SaO2 92.7%, and base excess -5.5 mEq/L.

The patient's laboratory values include white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 15.6 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 28.0%, platelet count of 132 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 2.8 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) of 146 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 103 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 28.0 mEq/L, blood glucose of 119 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.1 mg/dL, total CO2 (TCO2) ranging from 28-32 mg/dL, calcium (Ca++) of 6.7 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.0 mg/dL, phosphorus (PO4) of 1.4 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 5.5 mmol/L.

The patient's ECG shows a sinus rhythm with low voltages, normal QRS, and prolonged QTc. The chest X-ray (CXR) reveals increasing lower lobe opacities.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information are:

1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has hypernatremia (high sodium levels), hypokalemia (low potassium levels), and hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels). Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and appropriate repletion is necessary.

2. Poisoning/Overdose: The patient initially presented with severe TCA overdose. She was given lipid therapy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of depression and EtOH abuse who presented with a severe tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. The patient experienced multiple seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes. She was treated with hypertonic Na and IV bicarb to overcome fast Na channel antagonism, lipid for improving volume of distribution, and no role for HD given volume of distribution.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance, specifically hypernatremia caused by multiple IV infusions of hypertonic fluids. This will improve once sodium bicarb is titrated down.
2. Poisoning/Overdose: The patient is experiencing a TCA overdose, which can cause CNS depression, widened QRS, seizures, hypotension, and other complications. She has already received treatment with hypertonic Na, IV bicarb, and lipid infusion.
3. Fevers: The patient has a fever, possibly due to new infection or TCA overdose. There are localized infiltrates on exam concerning for pneumonia, and she will be treated like a ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Hypoxemia/Impaired Pulse Oximetry: The patient's pulse oximetry readings are not reliable, possibly due to volume overload or TCA overdose. ABGs will be trusted more than O2 sats.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with depression and a history of prior suicide attempts. She was admitted for a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose with neurological and cardiac toxicity. 

The patient's vital signs show fever, with a maximum temperature of 102.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Her heart rate is 94 beats per minute, blood pressure is 101/65 mmHg, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93%. 

The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. She is receiving propofol and diazepam infusions. 

The lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (15.3 K/uL), slightly low sodium level (135 mEq/L), low potassium level (2.9 mEq/L), high lactate level (5.5 mmol/L), and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 90/326). 

The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.65, indicating alkalosis. Her PCO2 is 32 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 314, and oxygen consumption is 14.5 L/min. 

The physical examination notes that peripheral vascular pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments were not performed due to the patient's intubation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   44F with depression and EtOH abuse, s/p severe TCA overdose.  Multiple
   seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes.
   .
   # TCA overdose.  Doxepin found on scene.  Fits clinical scenario with
   CNS depression, widened QRS, seizure, hypotension initially at OSH.
   Received hypertonic Na and IV bicarb to overcome fast Na channel
   antagonism, intralipid bolus for improving volume of distribution.
   - Appreciate tox recs are as follows:
   -----continue q1 hour EKG
   -----wean sodium bicarb by 50% if QRS remains unchanged,
   -----if  QRS increases, do not wean sodium bicarb
   -----maintain pH  between 7.45 and 7.55.  If over 7.55 d/c sodium
   bicarb
   -----Keep K > 3 with supplemental (though does not need to be >4).
   -----dopamine and levophed for hypotension
   - Q2H ABG.
   - Q4H electrolytes.
   - Despite pH, avoid hypoventilation, as this let to clinical worsening
   in ED (VT rhythm appeared when RR decreased to 20).
   - Seizure management.
   - Consider intralipid if patient begins to not do well- 100 cc
   - Continue to follow Tox recs
   - Call PCP to discuss prescriptions written
   .
   # Seizure.  Most likely from TCA overdose and GABA receptor antagonist
   activity.  No prior history of seizures known.
   - Started on propofol gtt.  Pressors if needed for hypotension.
   - TCA management as above.
   - Benzos prn breakthrough seizure.
   .
   # Wide complex tachycardia.  Precordial negative concordance and axis
   change most suspicious for VT.  Also consider sinus tach with QRS
   widening from TCAs.  VT can be seen severe TCA overdose.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
   - s/p lidocaine bolus of 100mg; rebolus and gtt at this point if
   recurs.
   - TCA management as above.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in field due to mental status from
   med related CNS depression likely.
   - Keep current vent settings as above; no plan to wean until more
   medically stable.
   - Aline in place.
   .
   # Combined respiratory/metabolic alkalosis.  With superimposed
   metabolic acidosis due to TCAs and lactate.
   - Q1H ABG and lytes.
   - Vent changes prn.
   .
   # Anion gap/lactic acidosis.  Likely related to TCA overdose, but by
   ?mechanism.  Was hypotensive at times during course, now normotensive.
   Lactate improving.
   - ABGs as above.
   - Fluid resuscitation prn.  Avoid further hypotension.  Pressors as
   needed for med-related hypotension.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Iatrogenic from multiple IV infusions of hypertonic
   fluids.
   - Monitor Q2H.
   .
   # Hypokalemia.  As above.  From extra to intracellular potassium shifts
   with alkalemic pH.  Required 140meq overnight.
   - Replete to goal >3.
   .
   # Fever.  Upon arrival to MICU.  Blood cultures drawn in ED.  CXR
   without pneumonia and urine without WBCs.  Suspect central fever with
   above overdose.
   - f/u cultures.

   Assessment and Plan
   44F with depression and EtOH abuse, s/p severe TCA overdose.  Multiple
   seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes.
   .
   # TCA overdose.  Doxepin found on scene.  Fits clinical scenario with
   CNS depression, widened QRS, seizure, hypotension initially at OSH.
   Received hypertonic Na and IV bicarb to overcome fast Na channel
   antagonism, intralipid bolus for improving volume of distribution.  Was
   weaned off NaCO3 drip yesterday afternoon because she continued  to
   maintain QRS <130
   - Appreciate tox recs are as follows:
   -----repeat serum TCA level
   -----discontinue sodium bicarbonate
   -----keep QRS <130; do q12hour EKG
   -----sodium bicarb for increasing QRS
   -----maintain pH  between 7.45 and 7.55
   -----Keep K > 3 with supplemental (though does not need to be >4).
   -----levophed for hypotension
   -----monitor for signs of anticholinergic syndrome
   - Q12H ABG.
   - Q12H electrolytes.
   - Despite pH, avoid hypoventilation, as this let to clinical worsening
   in ED (VT rhythm appeared when RR decreased to 20).
   - Consider intralipid if patient begins to not do well- 100 cc
   - Continue to follow Tox recs
   - Call PCP to discuss prescriptions written
   .
   # Seizure.  Most likely from TCA overdose and GABA receptor antagonist
   activity.  No prior history of seizures known.  EEG on [**11-22**] showed
   encephalopathy
   - Started on propofol gtt.  Pressors if needed for hypotension.
   - TCA management as above.
   - Benzos prn breakthrough seizure.
   .
   # Wide complex tachycardia.  Precordial negative concordance and axis
   change most suspicious for VT.  Also consider sinus tach with QRS
   widening from TCAs.  VT can be seen severe TCA overdose.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
   - s/p lidocaine bolus of 100mg; rebolus and gtt at this point if
   recurs.
   - TCA management as above.
   .
   # Respiratory failure/VAP.  Intubated in field due to mental status
   from med related CNS depression likely.  Sputum and mini-BAL positive
   for gram (+) cocci in clusters. MRSA (+). Failed most recent SBT
   - vanc and cefipime continued until cultures are completed
   - Keep current vent settings as above; no plan to wean until more
   medically stable.
   - Aline in place.
   .
   # Combined respiratory/metabolic alkalosis.  With superimposed
   metabolic acidosis due to TCAs and lactate.
   - Q12H ABG and lytes.
   - Vent changes prn.
   .
   # Anion gap/lactic acidosis.  Likely related to TCA overdose, but by
   ?mechanism.  Was hypotensive at times during course, now normotensive.
   Lactate improving.
   - ABGs as above.
   - Fluid resuscitation prn.  Avoid further hypotension.  Pressors as
   needed for med-related hypotension.
   .
   # Hypokalemia.  As above.  From extra to intracellular potassium shifts
   with alkalemic pH.  Required 140meq overnight.
   - Replete to goal >3.
   - Monitor for hyperkalemia because K may begin to shift out of cells
   now that she is improving.
   - EKG, Cagluc, D5 and insulin, kayexelate for hyperkalemia
   .
   # Fever.  Upon arrival to MICU.  Blood cultures drawn in ED. [**Month (only) 8**] be due
   to OD vs VAP
   - f/u cultures.
   - continue antibiotics
   - tylenol and cooling blankets as needed.
   .

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of depression and ethanol abuse who presented to the emergency department with a severe tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. She experienced multiple seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes, and was treated with hypertonic sodium and intravenous bicarbonate to overcome fast sodium channel antagonism. She also received an intralipid bolus for improving the volume of distribution.

The patient was intubated in the field due to mental status changes from medication-related CNS depression and later developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which was confirmed by sputum and mini-balloon cultures positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters, and identified as MRSA. She failed the most recent spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 111/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.0 K/uL, hemoglobin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU for a TCA overdose and is currently sedated. The patient did not tolerate the most recent spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and is unable to provide history. The patient has an endotracheal tube in place for respiratory support, as well as an NG tube for gastrointestinal decompression.

The vital signs show a stable temperature within normal range, a heart rate within the target range of 70-90 bpm, and blood pressure within acceptable limits. The respiratory rate is set at 16 breaths per minute with mechanical ventilation. Oxygen saturation levels are at 5%.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,446 mL with an output of 4,120 mL, resulting in a balance of 326 mL. The patient's urine output is also noted as 780 mL.

The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.43, which is within the normal range. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 290, suggesting adequate oxygenation. The respiratory system compliance is 28.9 cmH2O/mL, indicating some degree of restrictive lung disease.

The physical examination reveals signs of being overweight or obese, poor dentition, and the presence of endotracheal and NG tubes. The cardiovascular assessment shows normal heart sounds with symmetric chest expansion and clear breath sounds. There is evidence of peripheral edema in both lower extremities. Bowel sounds are present, and the abdomen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of depression and EtOH abuse, who presented with a severe tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. She experienced multiple seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes. The patient was treated with hypertonic Na and IV bicarb to overcome fast Na channel antagonism, and received an intralipid bolus for improving the volume of distribution. She was weaned off the NaCO3 drip due to maintaining QRS <130.

Medical Complications:
1. TCA overdose: The patient presented with symptoms consistent with TCA overdose, including CNS depression, widened QRS, seizure, and initial hypotension. She required treatment with hypertonic Na and IV bicarb to counteract the effects on fast Na channels, as well as an intralipid bolus to improve the volume of distribution.
2. Seizure: The patient experienced seizures likely secondary to TCA overdose and GABA receptor antagonism. She was started on propofol and pressors for hypotension. Consultation with neurology is recommended for EEG read and consideration of antiseizure medications.
3. Wide complex tachycardia: The patient had wide complex tachycardia with precordial negative concordance and axis change, which is suspicious for ventricular tachycardia (VT). This can be seen in severe TCA overdose. Continuous monitoring on telemetry is advised,"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of depression and ethanol abuse who suffered a severe tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. The patient presented with multiple seizures, significant QRS widening, and ECG changes. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to mental status changes from CNS depression likely related to the TCA overdose. There is also a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as evidenced by positive gram-positive cocci in clusters in the sputum and mini-BAL. 

2. Metabolic alkalosis and respiratory alkalosis: The patient has combined respiratory/metabolic alkalosis with superimposed metabolic acidosis due to the TCA overdose and lactate production. Close monitoring of ABG and electrolytes is required.

3. Anion gap/lactic acidosis: The patient has anion gap/lactic acidosis likely related to the TCA overdose. This condition requires monitoring of ABGs and lactate levels.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia due to iatrogenic causes from multiple IV infusions of hypertonic fluids. Monitoring of sodium levels is necessary.

5. Hypokalemia: The patient has hypokalemia, which is likely due to extra-to-intracellular potassium shifts with the alkalemic pH. Repletion of"

   Assessment and Plan
   44F with depression and EtOH abuse, s/p severe TCA overdose.  Multiple
   seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes.
   .
   # TCA overdose.  Doxepin found on scene.  Fits clinical scenario with
   CNS depression, widened QRS, seizure, hypotension initially at OSH.
   Received hypertonic Na and IV bicarb to overcome fast Na channel
   antagonism, intralipid bolus for improving volume of distribution.
   - Appreciate tox recs are as follows:
   -----Q12h ABG and EKG
   -----maintain pH  between 7.45 and 7.55.
   -----Keep K > 3.0 with supplemental (though does not need to be >4).
   -----Levophed for hypotension
   - Q12H electrolytes.
   - Seizure management.
   - Consider intralipid if patient begins to not do well- 100 cc
   - Call PCP to discuss prescriptions written
   .
   # Seizure.  Most likely from TCA overdose and GABA receptor antagonist
   activity.  No prior history of seizures known.
   - Started on propofol gtt.
   - Pressors stopped today.
   - TCA management as above.
   - Benzos prn breakthrough seizure.
   .
   # Wide complex tachycardia (corrected).  Precordial negative
   concordance and axis change most suspicious for VT.  Also consider
   sinus tach with QRS widening from TCAs.  VT can be seen severe TCA
   overdose.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
   - s/p lidocaine bolus of 100mg; rebolus and gtt at this point if
   recurs.
   - TCA management as above.
   .
   # Respiratory failure/VAP.  Intubated in field due to mental status
   from med related CNS depression likely.  Sputum and mini-BAL positive
   for gram (+) cocci in clusters. MRSA (+)
   - vanc and cefipime continued
   - Plan to wean from vent by tomorrow
   .
   # Combined respiratory/metabolic alkalosis.  With superimposed
   metabolic acidosis due to TCAs and lactate.
   - Q12H ABG and lytes.
   - Vent changes prn.
   .
   # Anion gap/lactic acidosis.  Likely related to TCA overdose, but by
   ?mechanism.  Was hypotensive at times during course, now normotensive.
   Lactate improving.
   - ABGs as above.
   - Fluid resuscitation prn.  Avoid further hypotension.  Pressors as
   needed for med-related hypotension.
   .
   # Hypernatremia (corrected).  Iatrogenic from multiple IV infusions of
   hypertonic fluids.
   - CTM
   .
   # Hypokalemia (corrected).  As above.  From extra to intracellular
   potassium shifts with alkalemic pH.
   - CTM

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of depression and ethanol abuse, presenting with severe tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. The patient had multiple seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes. She was initially hypotensive but responded to hypertonic Na and IV bicarb to overcome fast Na channel antagonism, as well as an intralipid bolus for improving volume of distribution.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 103/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 550 mL and pressure support of 18 cmH2O. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 303, and HCO3- of 27.8 mEq/L.

The patient's laboratory values indicate normal WBC count, Hct, and Plt. However, her electrolytes show hypernatremia (Na+ of 139 mEq/L), hypokalemia (K+ of 3.7 mEq/L), and metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- of 27.8 mEq/L). Other lab results include"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with depression and EtOH abuse who suffered a severe TCA (tricyclic antidepressant) overdose. The patient experienced multiple seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes.

The patient received hypertonic Na and IV bicarb to overcome fast Na channel antagonism, as well as an intralipid bolus for improving the volume of distribution. The recommended treatment includes maintaining a pH between 7.45 and 7.55, keeping K > 3.0 with supplemental potassium, using Levophed for hypotension, and following toxicology recommendations.

The patient also had a seizure, likely due to the TCA overdose and GABA receptor antagonist activity. Propofol was started, and the patient is being monitored for any breakthrough seizures. Benzodiazepines are given as needed.

Wide complex tachycardia with precordial negative concordance and axis change suggests ventricular tachycardia (VT), which can be seen in severe TCA overdose. Telemetry monitoring is ongoing, and lidocaine bolus and gtt are being used if VT recurs.

The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with sputum and mini-BAL positive for gram (+) cocci in clusters, indicating MRSA infection. Vancomycin and cefepime are being continued, and a plan to wean from"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman who has been admitted to the ICU for TCA overdose and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 111/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on a regimen of antibiotics, including cefepime and vancomycin, and is also receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prevention. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated lactate levels. Her electrolytes are within normal range. The patient's respiratory support parameters indicate a need for close monitoring due to ongoing secretions and an RSBI of 135.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which requires ongoing respiratory support. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if not adequately managed.
2. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels suggest a possible infection or sepsis. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially worsen the patient's prognosis if not promptly addressed.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: Although the patient's electrolytes are currently within normal range, ongoing monitoring is necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances that can occur"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of depression and alcohol abuse who presented with a severe tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. The patient experienced multiple seizures, significant QRS widening, and ECG changes. She was treated with hypertonic sodium and IV bicarb to overcome fast sodium channel antagonism, as well as an intralipid bolus to improve the volume of distribution.

The patient's current condition includes CNS depression, widened QRS, seizure, hypotension initially, and respiratory failure/VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia). The sputum and mini-BAL were positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters, indicating MRSA infection. She is currently on ventilatory support and being treated with vancomycin and cefepime.

The patient also has hypernatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis with superimposed metabolic acidosis, and fever. Her vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 128/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on supplemental oxygen.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for further seizures due to the TCA overdose, which can cause GABA receptor antagonism. There is also a concern for recurrent or new-onset arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia, given the Q"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of depression and alcohol abuse, who presented to the emergency department after a severe tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. She experienced multiple seizures, significant QRS widening, and ECG changes. The patient was treated with hypertonic sodium and intravenous bicarbonate to overcome the fast sodium channel antagonism, as well as an intralipid bolus to improve the volume of distribution.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/72 mmHg to 96/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 334 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 137. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 250, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43 mmHg.

The patient has some lower extremity edema, bilateral crackles and wheezes, and both pupils are reactive to light but sluggish. Bil"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of depression and ethanol abuse, who presented with severe tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. She experienced multiple seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes. The patient was intubated in the field due to mental status changes from CNS depression likely related to the medication. Sputum and mini-BAL cultures were positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters, and MRSA was identified. The patient is currently on vancomycin and cefepime, but due to the presence of MRSA, vancomycin resistance is a concern. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.7°F, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 107/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The RSBI is 286, PIP is 19 cmH2O, and ABG results are pending. 

The patient's laboratory values show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.8 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 0.7 mmol/L, and elevated LDH level of 695 IU/L. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. 

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure,"

","The patient is a middle-aged female who was admitted to the ICU due to severe tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. She presented with seizures, significant QRS widening, and ECG changes. The patient has a history of depression and ethanol abuse. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient is febrile, and cultures have been obtained. There are concerns about potential medical complications, including respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, poisoning/overdose, and wide complex tachycardia.

The patient's fever indicates a possible infection, and the fact that she is febrile overnight suggests that her condition may be worsening. The rising WBC count also supports the presence of an infection. Therefore, it is important to continue monitoring her temperature and follow up with cultures to identify the causative organism. Considering the recent development of fever, it may be necessary to discontinue the PICC line if the fever persists.

The patient's abdominal pain, along with the absence of bowel movements, raises concerns about possible bowel ischemia or other gastrointestinal complications. This warrants further investigation, including a KUB (kidney, ureter, and bladder) examination, bowel regimen, and recheck of liver function tests (LFTs), amylase, and lipase.

The patient's respiratory failure is due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The sputum and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and poisoning/overdose. She is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing fever, anxiety, and agitation. She has been receiving various medications including Lasix, cefepime, vancomycin, lorazepam, propofol, and heparin. Her vital signs show a temperature of 101.7°F, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 107/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory system compliance of 286. She has received blood products and is receiving IV fluids. The patient's laboratory results indicate some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose, and elevated lactate levels. There are also abnormalities in her electrolyte levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.28.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and she is intubated on mechanical ventilation. This indicates severe respiratory compromise. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which may require increased support or invasive interventions.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a fever, elevated white blood cell count, and"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of depression and EtOH abuse who was admitted with severe tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. The patient experienced multiple seizures and significant QRS widening. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to mental status changes from medication-related CNS depression. Cultures were obtained, including blood, urine, and sputum.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure/Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), and MRSA was positive for gram (+) cocci in clusters. The patient is currently on vancomycin (Vanc) for MRSA, and cefepime has been stopped. The plan is to continue Vanc for 10 days.

The patient's TCA overdose is confirmed with the presence of doxepin found on the scene. The patient received hypertonic Na and IV bicarb to overcome fast Na channel antagonism, as well as an intralipid bolus for improving volume of distribution. Liver enzymes are trending down.

The patient also experienced a seizure, most likely related to the TCA overdose and GABA receptor antagonist activity. Benzos are being given as needed for breakthrough seizure.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of depression and alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a severe tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. The patient presented with multiple seizures, significant QRS widening, and ECG changes. She was intubated due to mental status changes related to medication-induced CNS depression.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure/Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP), sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte & fluid disorder, and poisoning/overdose. She has a fever overnight and her WBC count is trending up. Cultures were taken, and if she continues to have a fever, it may be necessary to consider discontinuing the peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC) line.

The patient also has an ongoing infection with gram-positive cocci in clusters, which is positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin (Vanc) was started, and cefepime was stopped. The last day of Vanc treatment will be on the 16th of [month].

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.7°F, blood pressure ranging from 107/54 mmHg to 148/81 mmHg, heart rate between 71-90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 21-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen.

Fluid balance reveals a total input of 1654 mL, including 313 mL through the PO route, 414 mL through the TF route, and 1240 mL through the IVF route. Total output is 4955 mL, including 700 mL through the urine route. The calculated fluid balance is -3301 mL.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, low potassium level of 2.6 mEq/L, and elevated lactate level of 7.0 mmol/L.

The patient's plan includes continuing vancomycin, stopping cefepime, administering IV lasix to achieve negative fluid balance, weaning from the ventilator as tolerated, and managing TCA overdose. Further recommendations are sought for seizure management, and regular monitoring of ABG, EKG, and electrolytes is required. The patient's pain management and bowel regimen need attention as well.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of sepsis to septic shock, development of kidney injury due to hypotension and electrolyte imbalances, and further seizures due to TCA overdose."

   44F with depression and EtOH abuse, s/p severe TCA overdose.  Multiple
   seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes.
   .
   #Fever: Patient febrile overnight. Pan cultured. WBC count trending up.
   If continuing febrile will need to consider d/c PICC line, although
   this was started on [**12-25**], so fairly new.  Last strain sensitive to
   levaquin, bactrim, and gentamicin as well as vancomycin.  Sputum with
   gram (+) cocci, all other cultures NTD
   - change antibiototic to Bactrim because more sensitive and because
   vanc could be contributing to drug fever
   - continue to follow cultures
   - stop any unnecessary medications for possible drug fever.
   .
   #Pancreatitis: patient had abdominal pain on exam and was found to have
   pancreatitis.  This could be due to Propofol and needs to be stopped
   when possible.
   - NPO
   - Extubate today so can stop Propofol
   - If extubation not successful, will need to change sedative to
   midaz/fentanyl

   # Respiratory failure/VAP.  Intubated in field due to mental status
   from med related CNS depression likely.  Sputum and mini-BAL positive
   for gram (+) cocci in clusters. MRSA (+)  [**Last Name (un) 46**] to vanc.  Not passing
   RISBI
   - last day of vanc will be the 16^th of [**Month (only) **], would like to change
   antibiotic to Bactrim due to sensitivities
   - Plan to wean from vent today in order to get off propofol
   .
   # TCA overdose.  Doxepin found on scene.  Fits clinical scenario with
   CNS depression, widened QRS, seizure, hypotension initially at OSH.
   Received hypertonic Na and IV bicarb to overcome fast Na channel
   antagonism, intralipid bolus for improving volume of distribution.
   Patient
s PCP has been told about condition and states that she did not
   prescribe this for her.  Must have been an old scrip.  Liver enzymes
   continue to trend down.
   - Appreciate any further tox recs
   - Q24h ABG and EKG and electrolytes
   - Seizure management.

   # Seizure.  Most likely from TCA overdose and GABA receptor antagonist
   activity.  No prior history of seizures known.
   - Benzos prn breakthrough seizure.
   .
   # Wide complex tachycardia (corrected).  Precordial negative
   concordance and axis change most suspicious for VT.  Also consider
   sinus tach with QRS widening from TCAs.  VT can be seen severe TCA
   overdose.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of depression and alcohol abuse who presented to the emergency department with a severe tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. She experienced multiple seizures, significant QRS widening, and ECG changes. The patient was intubated due to mental status changes from medication-related CNS depression. Sputum and mini-BAL cultures grew gram-positive cocci in clusters, which were resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to Bactrim. The patient also has pancreatitis, likely caused by Propofol. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving sedation with Propofol. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a fever and an elevated white blood cell count. Her liver enzymes are trending down. The patient has been on multiple medications, including hypertonic Na, IV bicarb, intralipid bolus, and lidocaine bolus. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Drug fever: The patient has a fever and an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible drug fever. This could be due to an infection or a hypersensitivity reaction to one of the medications she is receiving.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis, which could be related to the use of Propofol. If not managed properly, this condition can lead to complications such as abdominal pain, organ dysfunction, and sepsis.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP):"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of depression and EtOH abuse, who suffered a severe tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose.
- She experienced multiple seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes.
- The patient developed a fever overnight, and her white blood cell count is trending up. She has been pan-cultured, and if the fever continues, it may be necessary to discontinue the percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line.
- The patient's sputum culture showed gram-positive cocci, which is resistant to levofloxacin, bactrim, gentamicin, and vancomycin.
- The patient has pancreatitis, likely caused by propofol, and it needs to be stopped when possible.
- She is intubated due to mental status changes from medication-related CNS depression and respiratory failure/Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP). The sputum and mini-balloon percutaneous aspiration of lower respiratory tract secretions (mini-BAL) are positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters, which are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
- The patient's TCA overdose was confirmed with doxepin found on the scene. She received hypertonic sodium and intravenous bicarbonate to overcome the fast sodium channel antagonism, as well as an intralipid bolus to improve the volume of distribution.

   starting anti-depressant.  Were not worried about drug interaction, but
   feel it is more of a psych question.  Psych was consulted yesterday.
   Psych recommendations are as follows:
-Continue 1:1 sitter
-Anticipate psych admit when medically cleared, patient cannot leave AMA
-Hold anti-depressants at this time
-Use caution when administering benzodiazepines and opioids as these may worsen
delirium; contact psych for specific recs
-Can use low dose Haldol 1-2 mg IV PRN agitation; monitor QTc with repeat dosing
   .
   # Wide complex tachycardia (corrected).  Precordial negative
   concordance and axis change most suspicious for VT.  Also consider
   sinus tach with QRS widening from TCAs.  VT can be seen severe TCA
   overdose.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
   - s/p lidocaine bolus of 100mg; rebolus and gtt at this point if

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of depression and alcohol abuse, who presented after a severe tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. The patient experienced multiple seizures with significant QRS widening and ECG changes. She was intubated in the field due to mental status changes from medication-related CNS depression. Sputum and mini-BAL cultures were positive for gram (+) cocci in clusters, and the patient was found to have MRSA, which was resistant to vancomycin. The patient's white blood cell count increased, indicating a possible infection. 

The patient was diagnosed with respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), for which she was placed on a face tent at 12L. She underwent weaning from the ventilator and is currently on low-flow oxygen. 

The patient also developed pancreatitis, likely caused by propofol, which was stopped, and her pancreatic enzymes have been trending up. 

Psychiatry was consulted regarding the patient's depression, and they recommended a 1:1 sitter, anticipation of a psychiatric admit when medically cleared, and caution with benzodiazepines and opioids due to potential worsening of delirium. 

The patient experienced wide complex tachycardia, which could be ventricular tachycardia (VT) or sinus tachycardia with QRS widening from TCAs. Monitoring on telemetry and administration of lidocaine were"
