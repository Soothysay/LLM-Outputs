   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo F admitted with hypotension, fever, bandemia, severe acidosis,
   and multiple system organ dysfunction consistent with septic shock.
   #. Sepsis/septic shock: Clinical picture is concerning for Toxic shock
   syndrome with DIC. Rapid decline <24 hours.   Covered broadly with ABX
   pending cultures and final gram stain. Imaging reviewed by Radiology
   here, CT head (noncontrast): negative for acute changes; CTA torso:
   negative for PE, dissection, PNA, free air, free fluid. +
   post-radiation changes (hx of breast ca in the distant past).  TTE
   negative for vegetation.
   - Appears clinically much worse this AM
   - Droplet precautions pending final gram stain and cultures
   - Continue fluid resuscitation, Vigileo monitor to help guide fluid
   resuscitation -> keep <12
   - Titrate Levophed/vasopressin for goal MAP >60-65
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Broad spectrum abx; CTX, Vanco, Doxycycline, Clindamycin
   - Continue steroids (dexamethasone) for severe septic shock
   - Continue Xigris cautiously given DIC picture; trend coags stabilize
   and d/c if INR>2.5 or platelets <30
   - Surgery consult for possible ischemic amputation.
   #. Respiratory failure: Attempting to ventilate to compensate for
   severe metabolic acidosis.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated, use PEEP as needed if volume overload becomes
   a problem
   - Ventilate as needed to attempt to prevent severe acidemia
   - Serial ABGs
   #. Metabolic acidosis: Profound acidosis in the setting of elevated
   lactate with likely sepsis.
   - AM ABG worse than prior
   - Bicarb gtt
   - Tox screens sent: positive for benzos
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Elevated BUN and creatinine.
   - Fluid boluses for BP
   - Bicarb gtt
   - Renal consulted, f/u recs
   #. DIC: Labs with elevated coags, D-dimer, LDH; fibrinogen low at 152.
   No active bleeding at this time. Received 6 units platelets and FFP in
   ED.
   - Treat underlying sepsis
   - Follow DIC labs
   - Check smear
   #. NSTEMI: Pt with elevated CK and troponin, EKG with non-specific
   changes, consistent with NSTEMI, likely secondary to shock and
   hypoperfusion.
   - Monitor Trops
   - Supportive care
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK at 9002, elevated MB, but index normal.
   Unclear if pt was down for a prolonged period.
   - Bicarb as above
   - Follow CK
   - supportive care
   #. Transaminitis: ALT/AST elevated; normal alk phos and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   likely related to shock liver.
   - Follow LFTs
   #.  Electrolyte abnormalities: Pt found to be hypocalcemic,
   hypomagnesemic.
   - Replete lytes PRN

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo F admitted with hypotension, fever, bandemia, severe acidosis,
   and multiple system organ dysfunction consistent with septic shock.
   1. Sepsis/septic shock: Clinical picture is concerning for Toxic shock
   syndrome. Recent dental procedure raises possibility of anaerobic
   organism with subsequent bacteremia. UA with 11-20 WBC and moderate
   bacteria but nitrite negative. + murmur on exam, unclear if new. Rapid
   decline <24 hours.  Covered broadly with ABX pending cultures and final
   gram stain. Imaging reviewed by Radiology here, CT head (noncontrast):
   negative for acute changes; CTA torso: negative for PE, dissection,
   PNA, free air, free fluid. + post-radiation changes (hx of breast ca in
   the distant past).
   - Droplet precautions pending final gram stain and cultures
   - Continue fluid resuscitation, goal CVP 8-12 (although femoral CVL),
   follow UOP
   - Vigileo monitor to help guide fluid resuscitation
   - Titrate Levophed for goal MAP >60-65
   - Broad spectrum abx; CTX, Vanco, Ampicillin (at meningitic doses),
   Acyclovir, and Flagyl for anaerobic coverage
   - Discussed abx regimen with ID
   - Continue steroids (dexamethasone) for possible meningitis
   - Arrange for ECHO as soon as possible for vegetation
   - Consider Xigris cautiously given DIC picture; will wait to see how
   coags stabilize given recent correction with products in the ED, as
   well as waiting 12 hrs from LP to initiate
   - Send urinary legionella Ag
   2. Respiratory failure: Pt is currently overbreathing the vent, likely
   attempting to compensate for severe metabolic acidosis.
   - ARDSnet ventilation
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated, use PEEP as needed if volume overload becomes
   a problem
   - Serial ABGs
   3. Metabolic acidosis: Profound acidosis in the setting of elevated
   lactate with likely sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female admitted with hypotension, fever, bandemia, severe acidosis, and multiple system organ dysfunction consistent with septic shock. The patient underwent invasive ventilation and arterial line placement. Blood cultures were taken, and an echocardiogram was performed. The patient's condition has rapidly declined within 24 hours. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated pending cultures and final gram stain results. The patient is on droplet precautions, fluid resuscitation, and titrated pressors for goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60-65. Additional medications include steroids for possible meningitis, consideration for Xigris due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) picture, and urinary Legionella antigen test.

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis/septic shock: The patient's clinical picture is concerning for toxic shock syndrome, potentially secondary to a recent dental procedure leading to bacteremia. The rapid decline within 24 hours is concerning.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently overbreathing the ventilator, likely attempting to compensate for severe metabolic acidosis.
3. Metabolic acidosis: Profound acidosis in the setting of elevated lactate suggests likely sepsis.
4. NSTEMI: Elevated CK and troponin levels, along with non-specific changes on the EKG, are consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), likely secondary to shock and hypoperfusion.
5. Acute renal failure: Elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate possible acute kidney injury.
6. DIC: Labs show elevated coags, D-dimer, LDH; fibrinogen is low at 152. No active bleeding at this time.
7. Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK levels suggest possible rhabdomyolysis.
8. Transaminitis: Elevated ALT/AST levels likely related to shock liver.
9. Guaiac positive stool: Guaiac positive on rectal exam, which may be a contaminant from groin line placement. No evidence of active bleeding or gut ischemia on CT.
10. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient is hypocalcemic and hypomagnesemic.

Please note that this summary and list of potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo F admitted with hypotension, fever, bandemia, severe acidosis,
   and multiple system organ dysfunction consistent with septic shock.
   1. Sepsis/septic shock: Based on laboratory derangements and SIRS
   criteria, pt with shock likely secondary to sepsis.  Pt with unclear
   source at this time, given absence of WBC in CSF, and unclear if GPC
   seen on initial gram stain at OSH lab, but meninigitis still in
   differential. Clinical picture is concerning for meningococcemia.
   Recent dental procedure raises possibility of anaerobic organism with
   subsequent bacteremia. UA with 11-20 WBC and moderate bacteria but
   nitrite negative. + murmur on exam, unclear if new. Rapid decline <24
   hours.  Covered broadly with ABX pending cultures and final gram stain.
   Imaging reviewed by Radiology here, CT head (noncontrast): negative for
   acute changes; CTA torso: negative for PE, dissection, PNA, free air,
   free fluid. + post-radiation changes (hx of breast ca in the distant
   past).
   - Droplet precautions pending final gram stain and cultures
   - Continue fluid resuscitation, goal CVP 8-12 (although femoral CVL),
   follow UOP
   - Vigileo monitor to help guide fluid resuscitation
   - Titrate Levophed for goal MAP >60-65
   - Broad spectrum abx; CTX, Vanco, Ampicillin (at meningitic doses),
   Acyclovir, and Flagyl for anaerobic coverage
   - Discussed abx regimen with ID
   - Continue steroids (dexamethasone) for possible meningitis
   - Arrange for ECHO as soon as possible for vegetation
   - Consider Xigris cautiously given DIC picture; will wait to see how
   coags stabilize given recent correction with products in the ED, as
   well as waiting 12 hrs from LP to initiate
   - Send urinary legionella Ag
   2. Respiratory failure: Pt is currently overbreathing the vent, likely
   attempting to compensate for severe metabolic acidosis.
   - ARDSnet ventilation
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated, use PEEP as needed if volume overload becomes
   a problem
   - Serial ABGs
   3. Metabolic acidosis: Profound acidosis in the setting of elevated
   lactate with likely sepsis.
   - Repeat ABG in ICU showing slight improvement
   - Bicarb gtt
   - Tox screens sent: positive for benzos
   4. NSTEMI: Pt with elevated CK and troponin, EKG with non-specific
   changes, consistent with NSTEMI, likely secondary to shock and
   hypoperfusion.
   - Consider ASA if platelets stabilize but holding given possibility of
   Xigris
   - Hold heparin for now; no BB given shock
   - Plan for ECHO, both to evaluate EF and wall motion abnormality as
   well as evaluate for vegetations
   - Follow CK/trop
   5. Acute Renal Failure: Elevated BUN and creatinine.
   - Fluid boluses to keep UOP >30cc/hr
   - Bicarb gtt
   - Renally-dose medications
   6. DIC: Labs with elevated coags, D-dimer, LDH; fibrinogen low at 152.
   No active bleeding at this time. Received 6 units platelets and FFP in
   ED.
   - Treat underlying sepsis
   - Follow DIC labs
   - Check smear
   7. Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK at 9002, elevated MB, but index normal.
   Unclear if pt was down for a prolonged period.
   - Start D5W with 3 amps bicarb gtt for renal protection
   - Follow CK
   8. Transaminitis: ALT/AST elevated; normal alk phos and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   likely related to shock liver.
   - Follow LFTs
   9. Guaiac positive stool: On rectal exam here was guaiac positive, may
   be contaminant from groin line placement. No evidence of active
   bleeding at present. No evidence of gut ischemia on CT a/p from OSH as
   reviewed by rads here.
   - Follow Hct
   - PPI
   10.  Electrolyte abnormalities: Pt found to be hypocalcemic,
   hypomagnesemic.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female who was admitted with hypotension, fever, bandemia, severe acidosis, and multiple system organ dysfunction consistent with septic shock. The patient's condition is concerning for meningococcemia and possibly anaerobic bacteremia due to a recent dental procedure.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin, acyclovir, and metronidazole. The patient also received drotrecogin (Xigris) and norepinephrine for hemodynamic support.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and treatment include:

1. Sepsis/septic shock: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing symptoms suggest an ongoing infection leading to sepsis and potential deterioration into septic shock.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is overbreathing the ventilator, indicating respiratory distress. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilation settings are necessary to prevent further respiratory compromise.

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has profound acidosis with elevated lactate levels, likely secondary to sepsis. Continued monitoring and management of acid-base balance is crucial.

4. NSTEMI: Elevated cardiac enzymes (CK and troponin) and nonspecific changes on EKG indicate a possible NSTEMI"

   Patient with evidence of severe infection with mulitsystem organ
   failure. Patient has profound metabolic acidosis, partly anion gap and
   partly hyperchloremic. Patient is receiving fliuds with bicarbonate. On
   Xigris as well. Appears to have severe tissue damage with elevated CPK
   and probably rhabdo. Multiple bullae with possible skin source -
   concern for strep and staph. Maintain broad spectrum antibiotics.
   Blood pressure somewhat improved. Trying to wean off norepinephrine.
   Will consider placement of internal jugular line to allow removal of
   femoral line. Patient has such diffuse capillary [**Last Name (LF) 3117**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] still be
   intravascularly depleted despite massive volume resuscitation.
   Oxygenation has deteriorated with picture suggestive of ARDS by gas
   exchange, although CXR is not that impressive at this point. Plateau
   pressure is 27. Will go down on FIO2 to 0.8 and reassess PaO2. If it
   drops, will try to increase PEEP to 16. Keep plateau pressure less than
   30. Patient being vented at 8 ml/kg now to get tidal volume that allows
   us to compensate for metabolic acidosis. If that improves, will try to
   reduce tidal volume toward 0.6 ml/kg.
   Patient's acute renal failure suggests the process may have been
   ongoing for several days. She has minimal urine output. Elevated
   Potassium may start to become a problem within next 24 hours; she
   appears to have significant tissue damage with cellular release of
   potassium likely to follow. Acidosis remains an issue with
   contributions from lactate and renal failure.
   Prognosis extremely poor.
   Anemia due likely to overwhelming sepsis. Not at transfusion threshold
   now.
   Should address CPR not indicated with family.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual presenting with altered mental status, fever, acute respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and hypotension. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on multiple life support measures, including invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's oxygenation has deteriorated, and the CXR shows patchy alveolar infiltrates bilaterally. ARDS is a potential complication due to severe infection and multi-system organ failure.
2. Sepsis-induced Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating septic shock, which can lead to organ perfusion and potential organ failure.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient exhibits signs of DIC, characterized by widespread activation of the coagulation cascade leading to both thrombosis and bleeding tendencies.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's minimal urine output suggests acute renal failure, possibly secondary to sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or direct infection.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has profound metabolic acidosis, partly anion gap and partly hyperchloremic. This can be attributed to lactic acidosis from tissue hypoperfusion and renal failure.
6. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia, likely secondary"

","The patient is a 64-year-old female admitted with hypotension, fever, bandemia, severe acidosis, and multiple system organ dysfunction consistent with septic shock. The patient's condition has rapidly declined within 24 hours. The patient has been covered broadly with antibiotics pending cultures and final gram stain. Imaging, including a CT head and CTA torso, has been reviewed by Radiology and showed no acute changes.

The patient is currently on droplet precautions pending final gram stain and cultures. Fluid resuscitation is being continued, and a Vigileo monitor is being used to guide fluid resuscitation. The goal MAP is greater than 60-65, and Levophed/vasopressin is being titrated accordingly. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, including CTX, Vanco, Doxycycline, and Clindamycin, are being continued. Steroids (dexamethasone) are being continued for severe septic shock. Xigris is being used cautiously given the DIC picture, and its use will be discontinued if INR exceeds 2.5 or platelets fall below 30.

A surgery consult has been obtained for possible ischemic amputation. The patient is being ventilated to compensate for severe metabolic acidosis. FiO2 is being weaned as tolerated, and PEEP is being used as needed if volume overload becomes a problem. Serial ABGs are being performed to monitor the patient's respiratory status.

   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Broad spectrum abx; Ceftaz, Vanco, Doxycycline, Clindamycin
   #. Respiratory failure: Attempting to ventilate to compensate for
   severe metabolic acidosis.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated, use PEEP as needed if volume overload becomes
   a problem
   - Ventilate as needed to attempt to prevent severe acidemia

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female admitted with hypotension, fever, bandemia, severe acidosis, and multiple system organ dysfunction consistent with septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hyperglycemia, respiratory failure, severe sepsis, hypocalcemia, acute renal failure, and possible toxic shock syndrome. The patient's condition has continued to decline, and she remains critically ill in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's lab results show elevated coagulation parameters, which indicate the presence of DIC. This condition can lead to bleeding and organ dysfunction.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia can contribute to further complications and poor outcomes.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation to support respiratory function due to acute respiratory failure. This condition can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
4. Severe Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of sepsis has progressed to severe sepsis, which involves organ dysfunction. Sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure if not promptly treated.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are low, indicating hypocalcemia. This electrolyte imbalance can affect cardiac function and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female who was admitted with hypotension, fever, bandemia, severe acidosis, and multiple system organ dysfunction consistent with septic shock. The patient's condition has worsened overnight, and she now presents with cyanosis, epidermal necrolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has been covered broadly with antibiotics pending cultures and final gram stain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's platelet count remains low, indicating ongoing DIC. This condition can lead to bleeding and clotting complications throughout the body.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation to compensate for severe metabolic acidosis and to prevent further respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Sepsis can progress to septic shock, which can be life-threatening.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated BUN and creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as well as the buildup of waste products in the body.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient has low calcium levels, which can cause muscle cramps, spasms, and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), indicating muscle breakdown. This"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female who was admitted with hypotension, fever, bandemia, severe acidosis, and multiple system organ dysfunction consistent with septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hyperglycemia, respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypocalcemia, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): This is a serious condition characterized by widespread activation of coagulation, leading to the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body. It can cause multiple organ dysfunction and can be life-threatening.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, which can be a result of stress, infection, or inadequate insulin secretion. If left uncontrolled, hyperglycemia can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and she is dependent on mechanical ventilation. This may be due to sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or another underlying lung pathology.

4. Severe Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. The patient's sepsis has"
