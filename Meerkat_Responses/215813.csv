","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's progress note provides comprehensive information about their health status in the ICU. It includes details such as chief complaints, 24-hour events, allergies, medications, medical and family history, review of systems, and flowsheet data. The note also includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, respiratory support, physical examination findings, lab results, imaging reports, microbiology results, ECG findings, assessment, and treatment plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These may include:

1. Infection: The presence of vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring indicates that the patient's condition could be unstable. The note also mentions lab results, which may include markers of infection such as white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CR). Additionally, the mention of microbiology reports suggests ongoing surveillance for infections.

2. Respiratory Issues: The respiratory support section of the note indicates that the patient may require assistance with breathing. This could be due to conditions like pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or other respiratory illnesses.

3. Cardiac Problems: The ECG findings mentioned in the note could indicate underlying cardiac issues such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction. Continuous monitoring of the ECG helps identify any cardiac complications.

4. Renal Dysfunction: The presence of creatinine (Cr) levels in the lab results suggests that renal function is being"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   56M with rectal carcinoma s/p resection, chemoradiation who was
   referred to ED for R common iliac DVT and was found to be febrile. Now
   with improving fever on ABx but worsening neurologic status concerning
   for cord compression in the high thoracic or low cervical vertabrae.
   MRI was WNL however. Given his ongoing and protean neurologic signs,
   concern for carcinomatous meningitis.
   .
   Weakness: GBS vs Lymhomatous carcinomatosis. Vasculitic polyneuropathy
   on the ddx, however this and carcinomatosis is less likely given the
   acuity of patient's symptoms. Cord compression essentially given
   negative MRI. If truly GBS, intriguing that pt had fever and diarrhea
   perhaps a viral inciting event to trigger this GBS.
   - Telemetry monitoring as autonomic neuropathy and arrhythmias can
   occur with GBS.
   - NIF and VC q4
   - Goal NIF >20 and VC >1 L
   - EMG in am if able to do in unit
   - Emperic IVIG 500mg/kg x 4 days with premedication (tylenol,
   benadryl), first dose now
   - f/u CSF cytology, CEA, beta 2 microglobulin, LDH, other studies
   - consider check anti-[**Doctor Last Name **], anti-yo, anti-ri
   - Consider nerve conduction study in am
   - Chest PT to prevent atelectasis and respiratory failure
   - Daily ABGs
   - Low threshold to intubate especially if pt cannot protect airway,
   develops hypercarbia or hypoxia
   - Neuro and neuro onc recs, appreciate their input greatly
   .
   # Diarrhea: Likely viral given negative c diff x 2 and negative stool
   studies and cultures.
   - repeat campylobacter, stool studies
   .
   # Fever: Resolved. ? [**2-10**] diarrheal illness vs PNA/aspiration. Given
   recent chemotherapy, always concerning for infection. However, patient
   is not neutropenic. Bandemia reflects recent Neulasta administration.
   No evidence of sepsis. CXR, u/a unremarkable. Fever might also be
   related to DVT or chemo itself.
   -Repeat CXR today, if no infiltrate will DC antibiotics.
   -CIS
   -Repeat stool studies
   .
   # Aspiration PNA: Now on levoflox/flagyl. Had been on vanco/zosyn
   changed to levoflox/flagyl.
   -Repeat CXR, if negative will DC abx as low suspicion for PNA

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of rectal cancer and is currently experiencing progressive weakness, difficulty handling secretions, and dyspnea. These symptoms suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, which is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.

2. Neurologic complications: The patient is presenting with neurologic signs such as numbness/tingling and weakness in the upper extremities. This could be indicative of a neurological disorder or compression of the spinal cord, possibly due to metastatic disease from the rectal cancer.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with DVT, which is a clot that forms in a deep vein, usually in the legs. If the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs, it can cause a potentially life-threatening condition called pulmonary embolism.

4. Infection: The patient has been febrile and received antibiotics for possible infections. Although the fever has resolved, the patient remains at risk for developing further infections, especially considering his immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy.

5. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has experienced diarrhea, which could be due to viral or bacterial infections, or even related to his underlying malignancy. It is important to monitor and manage any gastrointestinal symptoms to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

6. Medication complications:"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   56M with rectal carcinoma s/p resection, chemoradiation who was
   referred to ED for R common iliac DVT and was found to be febrile. Now
   with improving fever on ABx but worsening neurologic status concerning
   for cord compression in the high thoracic or low cervical vertabrae.
   MRI was WNL however. Given his ongoing and protean neurologic signs,
   concern for carcinomatous meningitis.
   .
   Weakness: GBS ddx includes lymhomatous carcinomatosis, vasculitic
   polyneuropathy, and vascular occlusion of spinal circulation given new
   pain although less likely given the lack of anatomic correlation with
   UE and LE bl weakness.  Vasculitis and carcinomatosis is less likely
   given the acuity of patient's symptoms. Cord compression essentially
   given negative MRI. If truly GBS, intriguing that pt had fever and
   diarrhea perhaps a viral inciting event to trigger GBS. Apparently per
   neurology attending GBS can have pain.
   - Obtain EKG (wnl), CXR (mild pulm edema on my read), CE pending.
   - Check ESR, CRP if negative would make vasculitis highly unlikely
   - Continue Telemetry monitoring as autonomic neuropathy and arrhythmias
   can occur with GBS.
   - Continue NIF and VC Q12H given stability
   - Goal NIF >20 and VC >1 L
   - EMG today
   - Continue emperic IVIG 500mg/kg x 4 days with premedication (tylenol,

   develops hypercarbia or hypoxia
   - Neuro and neuro onc recs, appreciate their input greatly

   # Diarrhea: Likely viral given negative c diff x 2 and negative stool
   studies and cultures.
   - f/u campylobacter, stool studies

   # Fever: Resolved. ? [**2-10**] diarrheal illness vs PNA/aspiration. Given
   recent chemotherapy, always concerning for infection. However, patient
   is not neutropenic. Bandemia reflects recent Neulasta administration.
   No evidence of sepsis. CXR, u/a unremarkable. Fever might also be

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged man with a history of rectal carcinoma who presented to the emergency department with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was found to be febrile. He was started on antibiotics and then transferred to the ICU due to worsening neurological status, concerning for cord compression in the high thoracic or low cervical vertebrae. An MRI was performed but was normal. The patient's ongoing and protean neurological signs raise concern for carcinomatous meningitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to his acute respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Neurological Complications: Given the worsening neurological status and concern for cord compression or carcinomatous meningitis, the patient is at risk for further neurological deterioration.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient already has a confirmed DVT, and there is a risk of progression or development of new clots.
4. Infection: The patient's fever and diarrhea suggest a possible infection, which could be bacterial, viral, or related to his underlying cancer.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's recent chemotherapy treatment puts him at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and mucositis.
6. Metabolic Disturbances: The patient has an elevated hemoglobin A1C, indicating glucose intolerance. Close monitoring and management of blood glucose levels are necessary.

He presented to the emergency department with a common iliac deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was found to be febrile. The patient's condition has improved with antibiotic treatment, but he is now experiencing worsening ascending weakness and loss of speech/swallowing, which are concerning for Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). Lumbar puncture results show albuminocytologic dissociation, and electromyography confirms the diagnosis of GBS. The patient's respiratory mechanics have improved, allowing for potential transfer to a neurology ICU bed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included respiratory failure, which is a potential complication of GBS due to muscle weakness affecting breathing.
2. Autonomic Neuropathy: GBS can also cause autonomic neuropathy, leading to potential arrhythmias and other cardiovascular complications.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which may be due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) caused by pain, malignant metastasis, or a central nervous system process. Monitoring urine electrolytes and restricting free water intake will be important.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be related to pain or underlying conditions such as malignant metastasis. Proper pain control will be crucial"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   56M with rectal carcinoma s/p resection, chemoradiation who was
   referred to ED for R common iliac DVT and was found to be febrile. Now
   with improving fever on ABx but worsening ascending weakness and LP w/
   albuminocytologic dissociation concerning for GBS.
   .
   GBS: Patient w/ worsened ascending weakness/numbness and speech/swallow
   concerning for dysphagia.  LP w/ albuninocytologic dissociation.
The patient is a 56 year old man with a history of rectal
adenocarcinoma s/p resection and chemoradiation c/b right
cerebellar metastasis s/p resection who was admitted with right
common iliac vein thrombosis and fever who has subsequently
developed bilateral leg weakness, worsened bilateral ascending
lower leg numbness, dysphagia to liquids and solids, and SOB
with albuminocytologic dissociation on LP consistent with [**Last Name (un) 3245**]
[**Location (un) **] Syndrome. He is currently getting his second dose of IVIg.
His exam is slightly worse today, with weaker IPs and deltoids
today when compared with yesterday. He had a trace triceps reflex
today. He remains in the ICU today given his VC decreased from
1500 to 1000 yesterday to today. He has evidence of oropharyngeal
involvement given he failed his video swallow today.
-Continue IVIg x4 days
-Obtain NIF/VC q4 hours overnight
-Continue telemetry to evaluate for arrythmia
-f/u LP for cytology and the other pending studies
-Consider repeat EMG/NCS when improved to further evaluate for
axonal involvement
-Repeat S&S eval when he starts to clinically improve, continue
TFs for now
-Can call out to neurology when respiratory function tests
improve (likely will need step-down unit)
   - Obtain EKG (wnl), CXR (mild pulm edema on my read), CE pending.
   - Check ESR, CRP if negative would make vasculitis highly unlikely
   - Continue Telemetry monitoring as autonomic neuropathy and arrhythmias
   can occur with GBS.
   - Continue NIF and VC Q12H given stability
   - Goal NIF >20 and VC >1 L
   - EMG today
   - Continue emperic IVIG 500mg/kg x 4 days with premedication (tylenol,
   benadryl), first dose now
   - f/u CSF cytology, CEA, beta 2 microglobulin, LDH, other studies
   - consider checking anti-[**Doctor Last Name **], anti-yo, anti-ri
   - Chest PT to prevent atelectasis and respiratory failure
   - Low threshold to intubate especially if pt cannot protect airway,
   develops hypercarbia or hypoxia
   - Neuro and neuro onc recs, appreciate their input greatly

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 56M met rectal cancer s/p resection /
   colostomy, CNS mets resected '[**60**], DVT and progressive weakness
   concerning for GBS, imaging without clear compression, LP with elevated
   protein. Sent to MICU with NIF -20 and falling FVC. This AM, NIF -40 /
   FVC 1.5L. Reports back / shoulder pain o/n, on IVIG for possible GBS.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.3 BP 150/60 HR 60 RR 14 with sat 100 on 3LNC.
   PERRL, EOMI. 4/5 strength. No reflexes. CTA B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. No
   edema. Labs notable for WBC 9K, HCT 35, K+ 3.4, Cr 0.9. CXR with clear
   lungs.
   Agree with plan to manage weakness with EMG, neuro eval (ongoing), f/u
   CSF cytology and other studies, CRP / ESR, review of MRI re vascular
   compromise. Appears to have improved with IVIG, but pain is out of
   proportion for GBS
 continue IVIG, initiate PT, talk with neuro-onc re
   paraneoplastic syndrome. Given respiratory compromise, will follow NIF
   / FVC q8h, ABG reassuring, monitor off oxygen to avoid masking
   hypoventilation. Lovenox for malignancy-associated DVT in the settin of
   met rectal cancer. Formal S+S eval prior to advancing diet
 may need
   NGT for meds and nutritional support. Remainder of plan as outlined
   above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of rectal adenocarcinoma, who underwent resection and chemoradiation. He was admitted with right common iliac vein thrombosis and fever. Subsequently, he developed bilateral leg weakness, worsening bilateral ascending lower leg numbness, dysphagia to liquids and solids, and shortness of breath. The patient has albuminocytologic dissociation on lumbar puncture, consistent with Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). He is currently receiving his second dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory function and dysphagia increase the risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of the patient's respiratory mechanics and early intubation if necessary are important.
2. Autonomic neuropathy and arrhythmias: GBS can cause autonomic dysfunction, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Telemetry monitoring should be continued to evaluate for arrhythmias.
3. Infection: Although the patient's fever has resolved, there is still a concern for infection due to his immunocompromised state from chemotherapy. Regular monitoring of vital signs and laboratory studies is essential.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of DVT, which requires anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin to prevent further clotting.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 56M met rectal cancer s/p resection /
   colostomy, CNS mets resected '[**60**], DVT and progressive weakness
   concerning for GBS, imaging without clear compression, LP with elevated
   protein. Sent to MICU with NIF -20 and falling FVC. This AM, NIF -40 /
   FVC 1.5L. Reports back / shoulder pain o/n, on IVIG for possible GBS.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.3 BP 150/60 HR 60 RR 14 with sat 100 on 3LNC.
   PERRL, EOMI. 4/5 strength. No reflexes. CTA B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. No
   edema. Labs notable for WBC 9K, HCT 35, K+ 3.4, Cr 0.9. CXR with clear
   lungs.
   Agree with plan to manage weakness with EMG, neuro eval (ongoing), f/u
   CSF cytology and other studies, CRP / ESR, review of MRI re vascular
   compromise. Appears to have improved with IVIG, but pain is out of
   proportion for GBS
 continue IVIG, initiate PT, talk with neuro-onc re
   paraneoplastic syndrome. Given respiratory compromise, will follow NIF
   / FVC q8h, ABG reassuring, monitor off oxygen to avoid masking
   hypoventilation. Lovenox for malignancy-associated DVT in the settin of
   met rectal cancer. Formal S+S eval prior to advancing diet
 may need
   NGT for meds and nutritional support. Remainder of plan as outlined
   above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of rectal carcinoma who underwent resection and chemoradiation. He presented to the emergency department with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was found to be febrile. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute on chronic, not ARDS, and worsening ascending weakness with albuminocytologic dissociation concerning for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The patient's fever has improved on antibiotics, but his weakness has worsened. He is currently on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for possible GBS and has been made NPO due to dysphagia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure and requires close monitoring of his respiratory mechanics. If his condition worsens, mechanical ventilation may be required.
2. Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS): The patient's symptoms of worsening ascending weakness and speech/swallow difficulty, along with the findings of albuminocytologic dissociation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), are concerning for GBS. This condition can lead to progressive muscle weakness and potentially respiratory failure.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on enoxaparin for prophylaxis. However, there is a risk of developing further thrombotic events,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of rectal carcinoma who presented to the emergency department for a right common iliac deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was found to be febrile and referred to the ICU. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including acute respiratory failure, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG), hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), hypertension, diarrhea, and fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, leading to intubation for respiratory failure. There is a need for close monitoring in the neuro ICU due to the risk of further respiratory decompensation.
2. Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS): The patient's symptoms of worsening ascending weakness, dysphagia, and albuminocytologic dissociation are concerning for GBS. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been initiated.
3. Ischemic ECG Changes: The patient exhibits upward sloping ST segment changes on the ECG. These changes could indicate myocardial ischemia or demand-related changes. Further evaluation is needed to rule out any cardiac issues.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia due to SIADH. Free water restriction is"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of rectal carcinoma who presented to the emergency department for a right common iliac deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was found to be febrile. He has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, possibly due to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), and is currently intubated. The patient's fever is improving with antibiotics, but he is experiencing worsening ascending weakness, dysphagia, and respiratory status. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is negative for growth, and he is being treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). 

The patient also has ischemic ECG changes, which are likely demand-related and do not indicate chest pain. His hyponatremia is believed to be due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and is improving with free water restriction. 

Other medical issues include diarrhea, which has been ruled out as Clostridium difficile infection, and hypertension, which is thought to be related to pain. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, but insulin therapy has been initiated to address this. 

The patient is receiving nutrition via a feeding tube and is on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's current disposition is to be transferred to the neuro intensive care unit (IC"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of rectal carcinoma who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The patient presented with worsening ascending weakness, dysphagia, and respiratory decompensation. He has been intubated for GBS respiratory failure with a negative CSF for growth. The patient is currently being treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and is scheduled for transfer to the neuro ICU when a bed becomes available.

The patient also has leukocytosis with increased secretions and aspiration around the time of intubation. A chest X-ray (CXR) and pan culture have been ordered to assess for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's ischemic ECG changes are likely demand-related and will be monitored with cycle enzymes and aspirin.

The patient has hyponatremia due to SIADH, which is improving with free water restriction. Hypertension is likely pain-related and will be managed with morphine and sedation on vent. The patient previously experienced diarrhea, but a C. difficile test was negative. No further episodes have occurred while in the ICU.

The patient's fevers have resolved, and the CSF and blood cultures from admission were negative. A pan culture has been ordered for new leukocytosis. The patient is on Lovenox for deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","The patient is a 56-year-old man with metastatic rectal cancer and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) who is currently intubated for progressive weakness. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to progressive weakness, and lung volumes have improved with positive pressure ventilation. There is a possibility of aspiration around the time of intubation, so blood, sputum, and urine cultures should be checked. A recheck of the chest X-ray today is also recommended, with a low threshold to start hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) antibiotics.

The patient's GBS has worsened with ascending weakness and numbness. A lumbar puncture with albuminocytologic dissociation and electromyography (EMG) confirms GBS. Intubation was attempted yesterday, but the patient was too sedated. The last day of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment is today, and no plasmapheresis is planned per neurology. Follow-up CSF cytology, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), beta 2 microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and other studies are recommended. The patient should be transferred to a neuro-intensive care unit (ICU) when a bed becomes available.

The patient also has hyponatremia, which is improving with fluid restriction. Continued free water restriction less than 1.5 liters per day is advised. The patient is experiencing sinus t"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with metastatic rectal cancer who is currently in the ICU due to progressive weakness caused by Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). He has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient also has respiratory failure, hyponatremia consistent with SIADH, tachycardia, and diarrhea. He has a history of alcohol allergies and rashes. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 133 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 161/95 to 186/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, as well as increased lactate levels. Chest X-ray shows bibasilar atelectasis without new airspace consolidation or pneumothorax. The patient's medical team is considering potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), which may be related to aspiration. They are also monitoring for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and reviewing the patient's cardiac enzymes due to tachycardia. The patient's fluid restriction is being continued for improving hyponatremia, and he is receiving prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy. The plan is to transfer the patient to a neuro ICU bed when available and continue"

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of metastatic rectal cancer, now presenting with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and respiratory failure. He has been intubated due to progressive weakness. The patient's medical history includes alcohol allergies and rashes. 

On review of systems, the patient is unable to obtain a complete review of systems. His vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 133 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 161/95 mmHg to 105/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient received the third dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and no plasmapheresis was performed as per neuro consultation. Tachycardia and inferolateral ST depressions were noted on the electrocardiogram (ECG), but the patient did not experience chest pain. Urine electrolytes were checked and confirmed SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone). 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Other lab results indicate normal glucose levels, slightly elevated troponin T, and elevated lactate levels. 

Radiology images show bibasilar atelectasis but no new airspace consolidation, pneumothorax, or evidence of malignant metastasis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with metastatic rectal cancer who has been diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and is currently experiencing progressive weakness. The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 133 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105-186 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's temperature is within the normal range at 37.4°C.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,277 mL and output of 2,495 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's respiratory support consists of being on CPAP/PSV with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 97%, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 265 mmHg.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.9-20.8 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) of 35.5-38.2%, platelet count (Plt) of 197-281 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) of 0.7-0.9 mg/dL, troponin-T of <0.01 ng/mL, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 28 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 420 IU/L, calcium (Ca++) of 8.9 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.6 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) of 3.0 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, GBS, hyponatremia, hypertension, diarrhea, fevers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), rectal cancer, and elevated blood glucose. The patient is being managed with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), tube feeding, pain control, and monitoring for autonomic neuropathy and arrhythmias.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low respiratory rate indicate a potential risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and appropriate ventilatory support will be necessary.

2. GBS: The patient's worsening ascending weakness, numbness, and speech/swallow difficulties suggest an evolving GBS condition. Close monitoring of neurologic status, respiratory function, and cardiac function is essential.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low serum sodium level may indicate hyponatremia. This could be due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), pain-related diuresis, or malignant metastases. Further evaluation and management are needed to address this electrolyte imbalance.

4. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure readings may be related to pain or SIADH. Blood pressure control should be implemented to prevent complications associated with uncontrolled hypertension.

5. Diarrhea: The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms, specifically diarrhea, require further investigation, including stool studies and possible treatment for campylobacter infection.

6. Fevers: The patient's recent fevers should be evaluated to determine the underlying cause. Continued monitoring and appropriate investigations are necessary to identify any potential infectious sources.

7. DVT: The patient is receiving low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox) for DVT prophylaxis. Regular monitoring of the patient's coagulation status and continued anticoagulation therapy are important to prevent thrombo"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of metastatic rectal cancer who presented to the ICU with progressive weakness and respiratory distress. He was intubated due to increasing weakness. The patient has been diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His vital signs include a heart rate of 133 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105-186 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has received various medications including propofol, pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, enoxaparin, and others. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, with slightly decreased potassium levels. Imaging studies are also documented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of the patient's ventilation status will be necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS): GBS is an autoimmune disorder that can cause progressive weakness and paralysis. In severe cases, it may lead to respiratory failure, as seen in this patient. Continuous monitoring and supportive care are crucial to manage the progression of GBS symptoms.

3. Rectal Cancer: The patient has a history of metastatic rectal cancer. While it"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with metastatic rectal cancer who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). He has been intubated for progressive weakness. The patient's fever and leukocytosis have improved without antibiotics, and there is a concern for aspiration. His weakness and numbness have worsened, and an LP with albuminocytologic dissociation confirmed GBS. The patient has finished IVIG treatment but has not undergone plasmapheresis as recommended by Neurology. He is awaiting transfer to the neuro ICU when a bed becomes available.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to GBS, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if the condition worsens.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect his airway, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia. This risk should be closely monitored, especially since his fever and leukocytosis have improved without antibiotics.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on Lovenox for prophylaxis against DVT, which is a potential complication in immobilized patients. Regular assessment of lower extremities for signs of DVT is important.
4. Autonomic Neuropathy: The patient's tachycardia may be related to autonomic neuropathy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). The patient is intubated and currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP mode. Pain management has been increased with morphine due to ongoing pain. There are concerns about increased sinus tachycardia in the morning, but cardiac enzymes are negative. The patient also has low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis, which raises the possibility of aspiration. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures are pending, and so far, gram staining is negative. There are issues with accessing the patient's central venous access due to the use of a single-lumen port for propofol administration. A PICC line may be needed. The patient had low urine output, so a bolus of normal saline was given. The patient's medical history is obtained from previous hospital records, as the patient is sedated and has a language barrier. Allergies include alcohol and rash. The patient is receiving infusions of propofol, pantoprazole, and enoxaparin. Other medications include morphine sulfate. Review of systems is unchanged except for the mentioned symptoms. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C, blood pressure ranging from 111/70 to 158/103 mmHg, heart rate between 96-128 bpm, respiratory rate of 13-21 breaths per minute,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with metastatic rectal cancer who has been admitted to the ICU due to progressive weakness caused by Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's main issues include respiratory failure, fever, leukocytosis, potential aspiration, worsening ascending weakness/numbness, non-cardiac chest pain, hyponatremia, tachycardia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and diarrhea. He also has a history of malignancy (colon cancer) and is receiving treatment accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the underlying GBS and potential complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and fever suggest a possible infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection, and appropriate antibiotics should be initiated if necessary.
3. Aspiration: Given the patient's intubation and potential swallowing difficulties, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent this.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with DVT, which requires anticoagulation therapy. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and potential bleeding risks should be done.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hypon"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with metastatic rectal cancer who has been admitted to the ICU with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). He is currently intubated due to progressive weakness and respiratory failure. The patient is experiencing pain, which has been managed with an increased dose of morphine. He also has low-grade fever and leukocytosis, with no new culture growth. His vital signs are stable, but he has sinus tachycardia. Fluid balance and respiratory support are being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is currently supported by mechanical ventilation. If his condition worsens, there is a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis, indicating a concern for the development of blood clots.
3. Infection: The presence of low-grade fever and leukocytosis raises the possibility of an underlying infection. Aspiration pneumonia should also be considered given his intubation status.
4. Cardiac complications: Although cardiac enzymes are negative, the patient's chest pain could be related to GBS or IVIG. Monitoring for any signs of cardiac ischemia is important.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient had an improvement in hyponatremia with fluid restriction, but ongoing monitoring is necessary to prevent its recurrence.

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure secondary to Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). The patient remains intubated and on pressure support ventilation (PSV) in the ICU. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no evidence of cardiac damage.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 100 beats per minute with a normal rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 111/70 to 158/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a FiO2 of 40%. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,115 mL, with total outputs including 630 mL of tidal flow, 294 mL of PO output, 2,365 mL of IV fluids, and 208 mL of urine output. The net fluid balance is 80 mL positive.

The patient is receiving propofol at a rate of 60 mcg/kg/min for sedation, pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and enoxaparin (Lovenox) for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Morphine sulfate has been administered for pain management.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. Kidney function tests are within normal limits, but liver function tests show slightly elevated levels of AST"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure secondary to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The patient has been intubated and remains on mechanical ventilation with pressure support (PS) mode. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no signs of cardiac injury. The patient has received infusions of propofol, pantoprazole, enoxaparin, and morphine sulfate. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate between 96-128 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 78-111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the inability to obtain a complete review of systems due to sedation. The patient's medical and family history, as well as allergies, remain unchanged except for the addition of alcohol-related rash. 

Flowsheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 3,115 mL of fluids with an output of 3,035 mL, including 502 mL of tidal volume, 630 mL of total fluid intake, and 2,365 mL of intravenous fluids. The patient's blood products and urine output are also documented. The respiratory support section indicates that the patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 478-538 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PE"

","The patient is a 56-year-old man with metastatic rectal cancer who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to progressive weakness. He is intubated and on positive pressure ventilation. The cause of his respiratory failure is likely his progressive weakness. His lung volumes have improved with positive pressure ventilation, and there is a possibility of aspiration around the time of intubation. Secretions have increased yesterday but none today. His chest X-ray (CXR) remains unchanged, and sputum cultures have been negative so far with no organisms on gram stain. 

The patient also has Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which is characterized by worsened ascending weakness/numbness. A lumbar puncture (LP) with albuminocytologic dissociation and electromyography (EMG) confirms the diagnosis of GBS. He is too somnolent for non-invasive ventilation (NIFs). He has completed a 4-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for GBS. 

The patient also has hyponatremia, likely due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). This has improved with fluid restriction. 

Additionally, the patient has sinus tachycardia, possibly related to autonomic instability associated with GBS or another underlying condition. Cardiac markers are negative. 

Other issues include diarrhea with negative stool studies, deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with metastatic rectal cancer who is now experiencing Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). He has respiratory failure and is intubated for progressive weakness. Lung volumes have improved with positive pressure ventilation. There is a possibility of aspiration around the time of intubation. Secretions increased yesterday, but none today. The chest X-ray remains unchanged, and sputum cultures are negative to date with no organisms on Gram stain. White blood cell counts are down today.

The patient also has GBS with worsened ascending weakness/numbness. Lumbar puncture showed albuminocytologic dissociation, and electromyography confirms GBS. The patient was intubated yesterday and is too somnolent for NIFs. The last day of IVIG was yesterday (4-day course). No plasmapheresis is planned per neurologist for now. Follow-up CSF cytology, CEA, beta 2 microglobulin, LDH, and other studies are recommended.

The patient has hyponatremia with urine electrolytes consistent with SIADH. Fluid restriction has improved the condition. The patient is also experiencing sinus tachycardia, and cardiac markers are negative. There is a possibility of autonomic instability due to GBS. Monitoring is recommended.

Other conditions include diarrhea with negative stool studies, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) being treated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute, non-ARDS, chest pain, non-cardiac, colon cancer, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 at 40%, and PEEP at 5 cmH2O. Vital signs include a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 111/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,115 mL and output of 3,035 mL, resulting in a balance of -80 mL. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 20.8 K/uL, elevated troponin-T levels, and abnormalities in liver function tests. The patient's cancer treatment includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures will be necessary to detect any signs of infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) progression: Although the patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy with enoxaparin (Lovenox), there is still a risk of DVT progression. Regular monitoring of lower extremity circulation and"
