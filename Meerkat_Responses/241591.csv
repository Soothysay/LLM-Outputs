   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with an altered mental status, hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding (melena), and other medical complications. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications and unknown allergies to penicillins, aspirin, tetracycline, and sulfonamides. The patient is receiving multiple medications in the ICU, including norepinephrine for blood pressure support and proton pump inhibitors for gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and evidence of fluid balance issues. The patient's lab results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated blood glucose, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates poor perfusion, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly addressed.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of melena suggests ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can result in significant blood loss and shock.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Hypernatremia: The elevated sodium levels can cause neurological symptoms such as altered mental status and seizures.
5. UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): The altered mental status could be due to a urinary tract infection, which needs to be identified and treated promptly"

Lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.5 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 30.3%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 253 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 2.6 mg/dL, elevated blood glucose of 153 mg/dL, and other lab abnormalities including prolonged PT/PTT/INR, low calcium, low magnesium, and normal phosphate levels.

Assessment and plan:
The patient's current assessment includes gastrointestinal bleed, hypotension (not in shock), and impaired skin integrity. The plan involves holding antihypertensives, monitoring the patient's condition, and providing supportive care. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the disposition is transfer to the floor."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan, written by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   [**Location (un) 2599**]. I would emphasize and add the following points: [**Age over 90 **]F urosepsis,
   GIB, hypotension due to septic or hypovolemic shock.
   Exam notable for Tm 97.9 BP 124/54 HR 74 RR 18 with sat 99 on 2L. UOP
   >50 cc/h. O/P remains very dry, neck veins flat. CTA B, RRR s1s2.
   Abdomen is soft. No edema. Labs notable for WBC 10K, HCT 32, K+ 4.0,
   Cr 2.6 to 1.7.
   Agree with plan to continue antibiotics for urosepsis and serial
   transfusions for blood loss anemia, which has stabilized / improved.
   Suspect we will be able to d/c pressors soon if we give another 1-2L
   IVF; if not will need to consider PICC or CVL, though I hope to avoid
   this and would favor arterial line as a first step to confirm
   hypotension given absence of end organ dysfunction. Hypernatremic at
   the moment, so will need to also address FW repletion over the next few
   days. Advance diet, OOB. Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 35 min
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are currently in the ICU and have been diagnosed with severe sepsis, hypovolemia, upper gastrointestinal bleed, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure, indicating potential cardiovascular compromise. They are also experiencing respiratory distress, as evidenced by an increased respiratory rate and the need for supplemental oxygen. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia and electrolyte imbalances. They have a history of allergies to certain medications and have received blood transfusions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition suggests sepsis, which is a life-threatening response to infection. If not properly managed, sepsis can lead to organ failure and death.

2. Hypovolemia: The patient's low blood pressure and inadequate fluid balance indicate hypovolemia. If left untreated, this can result in organ dysfunction and shock.

3. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has evidence of an upper gastrointestinal bleed, as indicated by melena and decreased hematocrit levels. If the bleeding continues or worsens, it can lead to significant blood loss and further compromise the patient's condition.

4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension. This condition can reduce blood flow to vital organs and may contribute to organ dysfunction or failure if not addressed.

5. Respiratory Distress: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a chief complaint of being unable to wean off levophed overnight. She has received free water for hypernatremia and two units of packed red blood cells. She is being given HISS due to blood glucose levels above 150. Urine electrolytes show a 2.4% fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) and a 49.3% fractional excretion of urea (FeUREA), which is consistent with intrinsic renal failure. The patient has significant urine output (1.8 L) with hypernatremia, indicating post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis. The patient has multiple allergies, including Depakote (Oral), thrombocytopenia, sulfa, penicillins, aspirin, and tetracycline. Her last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin at 08:04 AM on 01/07/2022. The patient is currently on norepinephrine infusion at 0.08 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications and medical history remain unchanged. The patient denies pain today.

Flowsheet Data:
The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/49 to 125/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute,"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. However, there are several significant events mentioned. The patient was unable to wean off levophed overnight, received free water for hypernatremia, received two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), and started on hemodialysis (HISS) due to blood glucose levels being greater than 150 mg/dL. Urine electrolytes were checked, showing a feNa of 2.4% and feUrea of 49.3%, which is consistent with intrinsic renal failure. The patient also had a significant urine output of 1.8 liters with hypernatremia, suggesting post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis.

The patient has allergies to Depakote (Oral), thrombocytopenia, sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), unknown allergens for penicillins, aspirin, tetracycline, and unknown antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin). The last dose of antibiotics given was Ciprofloxacin on [**2122-1-7**] 08:04 AM.

The patient is currently on infusions of norepinephrine at 0.08 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following changes: the patient denies pain today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis, severe hypovolemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and multiple organ dysfunction. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and has been receiving various treatments including fluids, vasopressors, blood products, and medications for glycemic control and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic parameters, fluid balance, and laboratory values. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications and has not been weaned off levophed. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition suggests sepsis with multiple organ dysfunction. If not appropriately managed, sepsis can progress to septic shock, leading to further complications such as organ failure and death.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient's fluid balance indicates ongoing volume depletion. If not addressed, this can lead to hypotension, organ hypoperfusion, and potential renal failure.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of melena and GI bleed indicates active upper gastrointestinal bleeding. If not managed promptly, this can result in significant blood loss, hypotension, and potential shock.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers, which can lead to secondary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypotension and lethargy. She has a history of baseline dementia and is currently unresponsive. The patient has multiple medical allergies, including Depakote, sulfa antibiotics, penicillins, aspirin, tetracycline, and unknown allergies to ciprofloxacin. She is in the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, severe hypovolemia, upper gastrointestinal bleed, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's vital signs show a stable blood pressure within normal range, sinus rhythm, and normal oxygen saturation. However, her respiratory rate is on the higher end of the normal range. Her fluid balance shows a total input of 3,777 mL and total output of 1,240 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,537 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an O2 delivery device and her ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. Her physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor and peripheral vascular pulses not assessed. Neurological examination is also not assessed due to the patient's unresponsiveness. Lab results indicate thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, elevated creatinine, and slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient has multiple lines including a multi-lumen line, 18-gauge line, and 22-gauge line."

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypotension and lethargy. The patient has a history of dementia and is currently unresponsive. Allergies include Depakote, thrombocytopenia, sulfa, penicillins, aspirin, tetracycline, and unknown allergies to sulfa, penicillins, aspirin, and tetracycline. The patient received ciprofloxacin, which improved her condition.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/44 to 125/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with a total input of 3,777 mL and total output of 1,240 mL. The patient's blood products transfused were 279 mL.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin appearance, pale conjunctiva, and peripheral pulses not assessed. Neurologic examination is also not assessed due to the patient's unresponsiveness. Lab results indicate elevated potassium levels at 147 K/uL, low hemoglobin at 10.7 g/dL, slightly elevated BUN at 127 mg/dL, low magnesium at 1.3 mg/dL, and high sodium at 18 mEq/L. Other"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis, severe, due to a urinary source. The patient was on pressors but is now off and has normalized hemodynamics with fluid resuscitation. The patient also has hypovolemia (volume depletion without shock) and gastrointestinal bleeding, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB). There is concern for an ascending infection or stone, and an abdominal CT is planned. The patient requires ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the disposition is transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition can worsen if there is an ongoing infection leading to sepsis. It is important to continue monitoring vital signs, administering appropriate antibiotics, and managing fluid balance.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient may experience further volume depletion if there is ongoing fluid loss from gastrointestinal bleeding or other sources. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and timely fluid replacement are crucial.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Continued bleeding could lead to worsening anemia and shock. Endoscopic evaluation and intervention may be necessary to control the source of bleeding.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal impairment. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as adjusting medications and fluid balance"
