   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 85 yo M with a history of chronic systolic CHF, LV
   dysfuntion, s/p BiV ICD placment in [**2108**], and h/o VT treated with
   multiple therapies, most recently mexilitine/dofetilide who presents
   with VT refractory to mexilitine therapy now transferred to CCU for
   episodes of VT/VF.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient transitioned to amiodarone tonight for V tach but
   continues to have rhythm abnormalities. Since transfer to CCU patient
   has already had 2 episodes of VTach > 10 beats. Patient also has
   history of PAF and has been off of warfarin pending possible procedure.
   Since episodes of Vtach seem to be predominantly at night, I question
   whether hypoxia [**1-21**] OSA might be contributing.
   - Continue to hold Dofetilide and Mixeletene as washes out
   - Stat lytes and replete K to 4.5 and Mg to 2.2
   - Continue amiodarone gtt
   - Start Lidocaine gtt with bolus 100mg x1
   - Make NPO in case of possible ablation
   - Heparin gtt for anticoagulation given possible procedure
   - Continue betablocker for rate control
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD, however many risk factors including DM2,
   HTN, HL. R + L heart cath [**5-1**] shows no flow limiting disease.
   - Continue betablocker, statin
   .
   # PUMP: Chronic systolic heart failure with EF 20%, s/p BiV ICD
   placement. Repeat TTE on this admission shows unchagned EF 20-25%
   dilated, LV with severe global hypokinesis. Mild signs of fluid
   overload on exam, including ankle edema and elevated JVD. Cath revealed
   elevated markedly elevated right (RA = 14 mm Hg) and left heart (PCWP =
   26mmHg) filling pressures consistent with CHF.
   -continue lasix 80 mg IV x1. Goal I/O negative 1 L.
   -will reassess whether metolazone should be restarted
   -continue Carvedilol 12.5mg daily, Spironolactone 25mg daily
   .
   # Renal failure: Cr up to 1.8. Apparent baseline 1.5 to 1.7. Likely due
   to DM and HTN. Also rising in the setting of diuresis.
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Urine lytes

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient is hyponatremic, which can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and muscle weakness.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a negative fluid balance, indicating that the output exceeds the intake. This can result in dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, which can potentially progress to sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, leading to cardiac arrest.
4. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, and any additional stress or exacerbating factors could worsen heart failure symptoms, leading to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, or cardiogenic shock.
5. Dementia: The patient has dementia, which can increase the risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, and difficulty with self-care activities."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and previous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. The patient was admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU) due to ventricular tachycardia (VT) refractory to mexiletine therapy. 

The patient continues to experience episodes of VT despite being on amiodarone and lidocaine infusions. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and has been off warfarin pending a possible procedure. 

The plan includes restarting mexilitene, discontinuing lidocaine, and initiating heparin for anticoagulation to bridge for the procedure. Post-procedure, the patient will be started on Coumadin. The dose of carvedilol will be reduced due to hypotension, and consideration will be given to transitioning to metoprolol if persistently hypotensive. 

An ablation procedure is planned in the next 1-2 days, per electrophysiologist (EP) recommendation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of ventricular tachycardia, non-sustained (NSVT). The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, dementia (including Alzheimer's, multi-infarct), and chronic pain. The patient was started on mexelitine at 150 mg po TID and amiodarone IV and po overlap per EP. Carvedilol was reduced from 12.5 to 6.25 [Hospital1] due to low SBPs. The patient's goal I/O even +101 cc at 1900; -560 at MN. The patient experienced some nausea, which responded to compazine and Maalox. EKG unchanged. The patient requested a prn sleep aid and received trazodone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia, Non-Sustained (NSVT): The patient's chief complaint is NSVT. This condition can potentially lead to sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, which are life-threatening arrhythmias that may result in cardiac arrest.

2. Chronic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of chronic heart failure. Complications related to CHF may include worsening heart failure symptoms, pulmonary edema, fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and decreased cardiac output.

3. Dementia: The patient has a history of dementia. Complications related to dementia may include increased cognitive decline, worsening functional status, falls, infections, and difficulty with self-care activities.

4. Chronic Pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain. Complications related to chronic pain management may include medication side effects, addiction, inadequate pain control, and decreased quality of life.

5. Medication Side Effects: The patient is on multiple medications including mexelitine, amiodarone, and carvedilol. Side effects of these medications may include hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, nausea, vomiting, and liver toxicity.

6. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient has experienced episodes of nausea and vomiting. Complications may include dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, aspiration pneumonia, and poor medication absorption.

7. Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating. Complications may include hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, both of which can lead to various health issues such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or hypoglycemic unawareness.

8. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to his immunocompromised state and indwelling lines. Complications may include catheter-related bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or wound infections.

9. Pressure Ulcers: Immobility and decreased nutritional status can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers. Complications may include localized skin breakdown, infection, or systemic inflammation.

10. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and hypercoagulable state can increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Complications may include pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and a previous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He was admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU) on [**2115-5-3**] with ventricular tachycardia (VT) that was refractory to mexiletine therapy. The patient continues to experience episodes of VT despite being on amiodarone and lidocaine drips. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and has been off warfarin pending a possible procedure.

Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has had multiple episodes of VT over the last 24 hours, but none greater than 15 beats. He remains on amiodarone po/IV and lidocaine drips.
2. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Chronic: The patient has chronic systolic CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%, dilated left ventricle (LV) with severe global hypokinesis. There are signs of fluid overload on exam, including ankle edema and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVD). Elevated right atrial (RA) pressure and left heart pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) indicate CHF.

   # RHYTHM: Several episodes of v tach over last 24 hours, but none
   greater than 15 beats. Remains on Amiodarone po/IV and lidocaine drips.
   Patient also has history of PAF and has been off of warfarin pending
   possible procedure. No episodes of hypoxia overnight to associated
   vtach to hypoxia, OSA.
   - Continue to hold dofetilide
   - Restart mexelitene and d/c lidocaine gtt at 6 pm tonight
   - Replete lytes to K 4.5, Mg 2.2. Lytes drawn [**Hospital1 **].
   - Continue Amiodarone gtt with overall of po Amiodarone for Loading
   - Heparin gtt for anticoagulation to bridge for procedure, will be
   started on coumadin post-procedure
   - Wlll decreased carvedilol to 6.25 mg  po BID since patient has had
   multiple rounds held for hypotension and he would clearly benefit from
   having betablocker on board. Will consider transition to metoprolol if
   persistently hypotensive.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and previous implantation of a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) on [**2115-5-3**] with ventricular tachycardia (VT) refractory to mexilitine therapy. Despite being treated with amiodarone and lidocaine drips, the patient continues to have episodes of VT.

Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of VT, which are refractory to the current medications.
2. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of chronic systolic CHF with a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%. Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows a dilated left ventricle with severe global hypokinesis. Elevated right atrial (RA) pressure and left heart filling pressures consistent with CHF were noted during cardiac catheterization.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from baseline 1.5 to 1.7, indicating possible renal failure. This may be due to diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN). Urine electrolytes suggest a pre-renal et"
