- The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and liver metastasis. She was admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and hypotension.
- The patient had a fasciotomy on 12-10 for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome and was transferred to the MICU.
- She experienced a second episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) last night, which converted to sinus rhythm with adenosine administration.
- The patient underwent an uneventful operation to close the fasciotomy.
- She was started on heparin gtt last night but developed warmth and tachycardia, so the infusion was stopped due to concern for an allergic reaction.
- The patient has multiple allergies, including morphine, oxycodone, penicillins, prednisone, codeine, and Advair Diskus.
- Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 97 bpm (86-174 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 128/66 mmHg to 153/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and liver metastasis. She presented to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension, which were resolved with IV adenosine. She underwent fasciotomy for compartment syndrome due to a left calf hematoma. She is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia and hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of tachycardia and hypotension, which was resolved with adenosine. Possible underlying causes include recent surgery, missed doses of diltiazem, new pulmonary embolism (PE), hyperthyroidism, or myocardial infarction (MI).
2. Bilateral PEs: The patient likely has bilateral PEs secondary to known metastatic malignancy. Anticoagulation therapy may be required to prevent further clot formation.
3. Leg compartment syndrome: The patient had wound vac placement and is scheduled for closure in the operating room (OR) today. Close monitoring is necessary to assess wound healing and prevent any complications.
4. Normocytic anemia: The patient has a baseline HCT of 30%, which is likely fluctuating due to recent surgery. Daily monitoring of HCT levels is recommended, and transfusion may be required if HCT falls below 24%.
5. Metastatic NSCLC: The patient has a"

The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for a fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine, codeine, penicillins, and prednisone. He is currently experiencing supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and has been treated with adenosine. The patient underwent closure of fasciotomy without complications but received heparin, which caused him to feel warm and become tachycardic, leading to the cessation of the infusion due to concern for an allergic reaction. The patient's allergies include hives, rash, and pruritus with penicillins and prednisone. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate ranging from 86 to 174 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/51 mmHg to 128/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose, and creatinine levels, as well as decreased potassium, sodium, and magnesium levels.

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic NSCLC, status post right middle lobectomy and chemotherapy, who presented with left calf compartment syndrome due to a hematoma requiring fasciotomy. She also has experienced episodes of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for adenosine administration.

The patient has multiple allergies, including morphine, oxycontin, penicillins, and prednisone. She is currently on several medications, including heparin sodium, adenosine, and other ICU medications. Her medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged from admission except for the noted complications.

Vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/67 to 161/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The physical examination reveals well-nourished general appearance, with no abnormalities in the eyes, head, ears, nose, throat, or lymphatic system. Cardiovascular examination is normal, but there is evidence of crackles throughout the right side of the chest. Abdominal examination shows a soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds.

   I saw and examined this pt, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of services provided. I agree with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 575**]
   note, including assessment and plan. Recurrent episode of SVT
   overnight, requiring adenosine.  Currently in sinus rhythm, though
   tachycardic. Suboptimal pain control likely contributing. Plan to
   increase diltiazem and pain regimen. Appears okay for floor transfer.

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic NSCLC, previously underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy, and had bilateral pulmonary embolism in October 2018. She presented with left calf compartment syndrome and required fasciotomy. On day 2, she developed AVNRT and was transferred to the MICU for adenosine.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate in the 110s, blood pressure in the 90s, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 94%. Her physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, crackles throughout the right side of the chest, trace edema in both lower extremities, and warm skin. Neurologic examination shows that she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to person, place, and time.

Laboratory results indicate normal hemoglobin and leukocyte counts, slightly elevated blood glucose level, and slightly decreased platelet count. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. Imaging studies reveal no significant findings.

Assessment and plan include post-operative management for compartment syndrome and fasciotomy, evaluation of respiratory crackles possibly due to fluid overload, ongoing monitoring for potential pulmonary embolism, management of sinus tachycardia, and treatment of AVNRT.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening compartment syndrome, pulmonary embolism, fluid overload, and cardiac arrhythmias"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and liver metastasis. She was admitted to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension. The patient has a long history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), likely AVNRT, which has been managed with diltiazem and vagal maneuvers in the past. Currently, she is on the maximum dose of oral diltiazem and has experienced multiple episodes of SVT, which have terminated with adenosine. The plan is to proceed with electrophysiology study (EPS) and ablation tomorrow.

The patient also has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), likely secondary to known metastatic malignancy. Heparin was attempted last night but the patient became tachycardic and felt hot, so it was decided not to use heparin in the future. Coumadin was restarted, which she tolerated well. The oncologist is okay with using coumadin over low molecular weight heparin in the setting of malignancy.

The patient had left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome and underwent fasciotomy on [**12-10**]. She is doing well post-operatively.

The patient has normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 10.6 g/dL. This is likely fluctuating due to recent surgery. Monitoring"

- The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and liver metastasis. She has been admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and hypotension.
- The patient underwent a fasciotomy on [**12-10**] for a left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome and was transferred to the MICU.
- She experienced two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), with the second episode peaking at 170-190 beats per minute. The patient's blood pressure is also elevated.
- The patient has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) likely secondary to known metastatic malignancy.
- She had surgery for closure of left leg compartment syndrome, which is doing well.
- The patient has normocytic anemia with a hematocrit level of 32.1%.
- She is currently on several medications including coumadin, diltiazem, cefazolin, and adenosine.
- The patient's allergies include morphine, oxycontin, penicillins, and prednisone.
- She has not tolerated codeine and the reaction to heparin resulted in tachycardia and feeling hot. Therefore, heparin will not be used in the future, and the patient will continue on coumadin.

","The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic NSCLC who underwent right middle lobectomy and chemotherapy. She also has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism and is currently on Coumadin. The patient recently underwent a fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome and had two episodes of AVNRT, which resolved with adenosine.

The patient's current conditions include post-operative pain, possible fluid overload with crackles in the right lung, and a previous pulmonary embolism. Her heart rate has been elevated in the 110s, with an unclear etiology. She also experienced an episode of AVNRT, and the precipitant is unclear but may include surgery. Her TSH level is 1.1, and blood/urine tests are negative to date.

The patient is receiving various treatments and interventions, including pain medication, bowel regimen, orthopedic recommendations, diltiazem 60mg PO tid restarted overnight and increased to q6Hr, and restarting dilaudid. She is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She is doing better with IV esmolol now and has no issues with
   recurrent SVT. She does not tolerate HR when greater than 140 well. She
   is due to have EP evaluation in am [**2188-12-15**]. We will hold
   anticoagulation for this and when cleared start low dose coumadin for
   DVT
s. I am concerned she may need the added help of an IVC filter till
   bleeding issues have settled. Her family has been updated at the
   bedside.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic NSCLC, who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy. She has had bilateral pulmonary embolism in October 2018 and is currently in the ICU due to left calf compartment syndrome, which required a fasciotomy and closure. The patient experienced multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that resolved with adenosine. She also has allergies to morphine, oxycontin, penicillins, and prednisone. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/63 to 98/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission. She is receiving various medications, including adenosine, beta-blockers, ativan, and dilaudid. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrent SVT: The patient has already experienced multiple episodes of SVT, which can potentially recur and require further intervention.
2. Compartment syndrome: The patient previously had left calf compartment syndrome that required surgical intervention. There is a possibility of developing compartment syndrome in other body parts.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism. Although she is currently on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, who underwent a right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy. She also had bilateral pulmonary embolisms in October 2018. The patient recently experienced compartment syndrome in her left calf, for which she underwent fasciotomy and closure. She also had episodes of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), which resolved with adenosine.

The patient presented with multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with blood pressure readings ranging from 80-147 mmHg. The cause of SVT is unclear, but may be related to surgery. The patient is currently on diltiazem 60mg PO q6Hr, lopressor 2.5mg IV x1 now, and will start lopressor PO. A cardiology/EP consultation has been scheduled for tomorrow.

The patient is also experiencing pain after her compartment syndrome and post-op fasciotomy. She is on dilaudid IV for pain management. Her bowel regimen and orthopedic recommendations are also mentioned.

Regarding her previous pulmonary embolism, the patient's Coumadin has been held, and her INR is being monitored. Long-term, oncology is okay with Coumadin, but if any procedure is planned, bridging with another anticoagulant may be necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and liver metastasis. She was transferred to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension. The patient has had multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), likely atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). She was initially managed with diltiazem and vagal maneuvers but subsequently started on esmolol to control her heart rate. The plan is for an electrophysiology study (EPS) and ablation today. The patient also has bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs), which are likely secondary to metastatic malignancy. Heparin was attempted but the patient became tachycardic and felt hot, so it was not used. Instead, coumadin was restarted, which she tolerated well. The patient underwent surgery for left leg compartment syndrome and is doing well. She has normocytic anemia with a hematocrit level of 26.8%. Her metastatic NSCLC is not being actively treated during this hospitalization. The patient's current medications include PPI, coumadin, and a bowel regimen. Her code status is full code and her disposition is ICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and liver metastasis. She presented to the MICU with tachycardia and hypotension. The patient underwent an ablation for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which was successful. She also had a bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis and underwent a fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome. 

Medical Complications:
1. SVT: The patient had an episode of SVT, which required ablation. This procedure was successful.
2. Bilateral PEs: The patient has a history of metastatic malignancy, which likely contributed to the development of bilateral PEs. Heparin was attempted but caused tachycardia and feeling hot, so it was not used further. Coumadin was restarted and tolerated well.
3. L leg compartment syndrome: The patient had compartment syndrome in her left leg, for which she underwent surgical closure.
4. Normocytic anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia, but her hematocrit (HCT) level is stable. Daily monitoring of HCTs is recommended, and transfusion should be considered when HCT is below 24.
5. Metastatic NSCLC: The patient has metastatic NSCLC, but it is not actively being treated during this hospitalization.

The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of rapid heart rate. They experienced AVNRT, which was treated with adenosine. The patient also has allergies to morphine, Oxycontin, penicillins, and prednisone. They received esmolol, metoprolol, adenosine, and hydromorphone infusions in the ICU. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the rapid heart rate. Vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate ranging from 70-193 bpm, with blood pressure within normal limits. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has normal oxygen saturation. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1076 mL and output of 1640 mL. Laboratory results indicate some fluctuations in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and troponin-T levels. The patient is being monitored for constipation, supraventricular tachycardia, and headache. The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines are being managed in the ICU. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia are also in place. The patient's code status is full code.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy. She also has a past medical history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently in the ICU for complications related to calf compartment syndrome, AVNRT (atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia), and PE.

The patient underwent a fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome and experienced two episodes of AVNRT, which resolved with adenosine. The precipitant of AVNRT is unclear, but it may include the surgery. The patient is currently on esmolol, a beta-blocker, for rate control.

She has a history of PE one month ago and is on coumadin with a supratherapeutic INR. The patient will receive vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for the upcoming electrophysiology (EP) study today. In the long term, her primary oncologist needs to consider the risk-benefit of lovenox versus coumadin for this oncology patient.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 73 bpm (with a range of 70-193 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 99/48 mmHg to 164/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (with a range of 14-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 2 L. The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,076 mL over 24 hours, with outputs totaling 1,640 mL. The patient's urine output is within normal limits at 1,640 mL. The patient is receiving esmolol at a rate of 75 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications include metoprolol, adenosine, and hydromorphone (Dilaudid).

The patient's laboratory values show stable hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal limits. The patient's troponin T levels are normal, and cardiac enzymes are within normal range. Imaging reveals a right effusion that has improved since the previous day.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's main issues include s/p compartment syndrome, post-op fasciotomy, AVNRT, and s/p PE. The plan includes continuing pain management with dilaudid, bowel regimen, and orthopedic recommendations. For AVNRT, the patient will continue on esmolol and undergo an EP study today. The patient will receive vitamin K and FFP for the EP study due to her elevated INR. In the long term, the primary oncologist needs to consider the risk-benefit of lovenox versus coumadin for this oncology patient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of bilateral PE and is on coumadin, which increases the risk of bleeding. If the patient undergoes an invasive procedure or experiences trauma, there is a risk of bleeding complications. Additionally, the patient's respiratory support with a nasal cannula and FiO2 of 2 L may indicate respiratory distress or difficulty maintaining oxygenation.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has AVNRT, which can be triggered by surgery. The patient is on esmolol for rate control, but there is a risk of bradycardia or hypotension with its use. The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, increasing the risk of bleeding during procedures such as the EP study.
3. Infection: The patient is in the ICU, where there is an increased risk of healthcare-associated infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or elevated white blood cell count, is essential.
4. Renal complications: The patient has a history of compartment syndrome and may have compromised renal function. Monitoring renal function through laboratory values is important to detect any acute kidney injury.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a history of PE and is on anticoagulation therapy. There is a risk of bleeding complications due to the anticoagulation, as well as the potential for new thromboembolic events if the anticoagulation is inadequate."

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism recurrence: Given the patient's history of bilateral PE and current critical condition, there is a potential risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to her immobilization and recent surgery, the patient may develop DVT, which can lead to further complications such as pulmonary embolism.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's use of Coumadin with a high INR increases the risk of bleeding complications, especially during invasive procedures or if there are any errors in medication administration.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy. She has had previous bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PE) and recently underwent a fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome caused by a hematoma. The patient also experienced two episodes of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), which resolved with adenosine.

The patient's current condition includes ongoing pain managed with hydromorphone (Dilaudid), bowel regimen, and orthopedic recommendations. She has right lung crackles, possibly due to fluid overload, and is scheduled for a chest X-ray. She is also on coumadin with a supratherapeutic INR, receiving vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for an upcoming electrophysiology (EP) study. In the long term, her primary oncologist will need to consider the risk-benefit of low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) versus coumadin for this oncology patient.

The patient's heart rate has been in the 110's, with an unclear etiology, and her baseline heart rate is in the 90's. She has received one liter of normal saline and will be assessed for response. The cause of the AVNRT is unclear but includes surgery. Diltiazem 60mg PO"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer and liver metastasis. She was admitted to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension, likely secondary to known metastatic malignancy. The patient underwent an ablation for supra ventricular tachycardia, which was successful. She also had a fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome. Her current condition includes constipation, bilateral pulmonary embolism, normocytic anemia, and metastatic NSCLC.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Supra ventricular tachycardia recurrence
2. Pulmonary embolism complications such as pulmonary hypertension or infarction
3. Hemodynamic instability due to metastatic malignancy
4. Infection due to prolonged IV lines or immunosuppression
5. Deep vein thrombosis or further clot formation
6. Anemia worsening or transfusion reactions
7. Complications from constipation such as impaction or perforation
8. Metastatic NSCLC progression or spread to other organs."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and liver metastasis. She was admitted to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension. The patient has undergone several procedures, including a cardiac catheterization, ablation for supra ventricular tachycardia (SVT), fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome, and closure of the compartment syndrome.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including SVT, bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs), and normocytic anemia. The SVT was successfully ablated, and she is being monitored on telemetry. The bilateral PEs are likely secondary to her known metastatic malignancy. Heparin was attempted but the patient developed tachycardia and felt hot, so it was discontinued. Instead, she is on coumadin, which she tolerated well. The plan is to restart coumadin after the ablation and follow INR levels.

The patient also had compartment syndrome in her left leg, which required a fasciotomy and subsequent closure. Orthopedic recommendations will be followed, and she will continue on cefazolin.

Her normocytic anemia is stable with a HCT that is not actively being treated during this hospitalization. Daily HCTs will be monitored, and transfusion will be considered if HCT <24.

The patient's metastatic NSCLC is not actively being treated during this hospitalization.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition is being provided through IV fluids and a regular diet. Prophylactic measures include DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) prevention. The patient has two central lines, a 20-gauge and a 22-gauge. She is also on a bowel regimen for constipation.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), compartment syndrome, and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) requiring electrophysiological (EP) ablation. She underwent fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome due to a hematoma and s/p AVNRT requiring EP ablation. The precipitant is unclear but includes surgery. The patient is currently s/p EP ablation yesterday. She has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema with right effusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema.
2. Infection at the site of fasciotomy and closure.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or PE recurrence.
4. Complications related to long-term anticoagulation therapy, such as bleeding or clotting disorders.
5. Potential recurrence of AVNRT or development of new arrhythmias.
6. Complications related to NSCLC, such as disease progression or metastasis.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based solely on the provided progress note and may not include all possible factors or considerations. It is essential to consult with the healthcare team for a comprehensive assessment and management plan."

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, bilateral pulmonary embolism, compartment syndrome in the left calf, and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) requiring electrophysiological (EP) ablation. She underwent fasciotomy and closure for the compartment syndrome and EP ablation. The patient's current condition includes wheezing after the procedure, which improved with diuresis, abdominal pain after the procedure that resolved with disimpaction, and no further episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary edema with right effusion: The presence of pulmonary edema can lead to respiratory distress and compromised oxygenation.
2. Lower extremity edema: Edema in the lower extremities may indicate poor venous return or fluid overload, which can result in decreased cardiac output.
3. Abdominal pain: Persistent abdominal pain can indicate ongoing intra-abdominal issues such as infection, perforation, or ischemia.
4. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): SVT can lead to decreased cardiac output, compromised organ perfusion, and potential arrhythmias.
5. Compartment syndrome: Reoccurrence of compartment syndrome can lead to severe pain, muscle and nerve damage, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Metastatic non-small cell lung"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, bilateral pulmonary embolism, compartment syndrome in the left calf, and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) who underwent an electrophysiologic (EP) ablation. The patient also had a fasciotomy and closure for a left calf compartment syndrome hematoma. The patient's current condition includes an unclear precipitant for AVNRT, but it may include the surgery. The patient is currently on metoprolol for rate control and is following up with her EP recommendations. She has pain from the compartment syndrome and post-op fasciotomy, and her bowel regimen and orthopedic recommendations need to be addressed. Additionally, she has a history of pulmonary embolism one month ago and is on Coumadin. The patient's primary oncologist will need to consider the risk-benefit of Lovenox versus Coumadin for this oncology patient in the long term.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema with Right Effusion: The presence of pulmonary edema and right-sided effusion may indicate heart failure or fluid overload. This can lead to respiratory distress and reduced oxygenation.
2. Compartment Syndrome: The patient had a left calf compartment syndrome that required fasciotomy and closure. There is a risk of reoccurrence or progression of compartment syndrome, which can lead to tissue ischem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy. She also has a past medical history of bilateral pulmonary embolism, and recently suffered from left calf compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy and closure. The patient experienced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) twice, which resolved with adenosine. She is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Risk of recurrent AVNRT: Given the patient's recent episodes of AVNRT, there is a potential for it to recur, especially during her stay in the ICU. Monitoring and prompt intervention with esmolol or adenosine may be necessary.
2. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is currently on systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin. There is a risk of developing DVT due to immobilization in the ICU. Regular assessment for signs of DVT and ensuring proper anticoagulation management is essential.
3. Risk of nosocomial pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to her prolonged mechanical ventilation. Proper lung hygiene, secretion management, and regular chest x-rays should be performed to monitor for any signs of infection.
4. Risk of stress ulcer bleeding: Due to the"
