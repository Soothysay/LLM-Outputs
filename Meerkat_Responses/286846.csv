 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   ANEMIA
   Patient is hemodynamically stable. Hct in low 30's after transfusion.
   Patient being prepped for colonoscopy, which is to be done later today.
   Suspect right colon bleed given melena, no source in upper system by
   endoscopy, and relatively normal BUN/Creat ratio consistent with
   patient not being significantly volume depleted.  If patient bleeds
   aggressively today, would push for angiography.
   Patient intubated for procedures. Oxygenation good. Minute ventilation
   acceptable. If bleeding does not recur, would awaken patient and
   extubate.
   Patient unresponsive on exam but propofol in place. She had received
   several narcotics and benzodiazepines prior to transfer; initial
   somnolence likely related to that. Propofol started because she was
   pulling out tubes. Sounds as if she has had delirium in recent weeks.
   No evidence of CNS infection. Stool being checked for CDiff. Would stop
   all antibiotics except flagyl and monitor cultures.

","Chief Complaint: GI bleed, anemia, altered mental status

Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-inch tall individual with a weight of 42.6 kg, admitted to the ICU. They have been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (melena), resulting in anemia. The patient's altered mental status is attributed to the administration of narcotics and benzodiazepines prior to transfer. Intubation was performed for upper endoscopy, which did not reveal the source of bleeding. Neurosurgery tapped the VP shunt, revealing 2 white blood cells (WBCs), 1 red blood cell (RBC), and a glucose level of 69. Blood pressure has been stable, and the patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient remains on assisted control ventilation with good arterial blood gas (ABG) results on FIO2 0.4. A colonoscopy is planned for later today, as it is suspected that the right colon may be the source of bleeding. If the patient experiences aggressive bleeding, angiography will be considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's melena indicates ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding. If this continues or worsens, it can lead to further anemia and hemodynamic instability.
2. Colon bleed: Suspected right colon bleed could cause lower gastrointestinal bleeding, potentially leading to anemia and hypotension.
3. Infection: The patient's"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and lab results, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Inability to protect airway: The patient has an endotracheal tube in place, indicating that they are unable to maintain their own airway. This increases the risk of aspiration and requires close monitoring and intervention.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting a possible infection or inflammatory response. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

3. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has melena (black, tarry stools), which can indicate an upper gastrointestinal bleed. This is a serious condition that requires prompt evaluation and management.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin is described as cool and there is mention of muscle wasting. These findings suggest possible impaired skin integrity and may indicate a risk for pressure ulcers or other skin complications.

5. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is noted as altered, but it is not delirium. This could be due to various factors such as medication effects, hypoxia, or sepsis. Close monitoring and assessment of neurological function are necessary.

6. Potential risks associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient has been on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 40% for an extended period. Prolonged mechanical ventilation can lead to ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI)"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 71 year old lady with recent stented MI, multiple medical problems
   presents with abdominal pain, recent nausea/vomiting, altered mental
   status and leukocytosis from outside hospital ED. She is minimally
   responsive, has poor venous access and comes with little outside
   information.
   .
   # Vent: Intubated for airway protection. Has good resp status prior to
   intubation.
   - use propofol for sedation given quicker metabolism. Her BPs have been
   holding stable
   - keep on PS overnight
   - SBT and RSBI in AM and extubate ASAP
   - routine vent care
   .
   # GIB: She does have hx of UGIB from ""ulcer"" at OSH. Presence of
   melantic stools also suggests UGI source, although could not rule out a
   high colonic bleed. Unfortunately, she is recently s/p LAD BMS and
   needs to be on ASA and plavix. GI will urgently scope tonight given
   that she cannot come off anti-plt therapy
   - [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] place large bore PIV as well in case need for urgent volume
   - transfuse 2U PRBC now
   - apprec GI
   - [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI
   - Q4hr HCTs and transfuse to keep HCT up
   - send H. pylori
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - golytely overight and possible C-scope in AM
   - if continues to bleed, would to bleeding scan
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: CT abdomen pelvis reviewed and rules out obstruction,
   current volvulus, abscess, hemorrhage or obvious colitits. Viral
   gastroenteritis can be invoked, as can C. diff given recent
   institutionalization. This may be related to GIB
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - plan as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concern for abdominal process, sepsis and central
   infection given her VP shunt. C. Diff also possible. U/A unrevealing.
   Reassured the lactate is normal, vital signs stable. Despite high WBC,
   otherwise not likely sepsis. Given high WBC count, C. diff is more
   likely than other infectious processes.
   - per neurosurgery no need for VP shunt tapping
   - Consider repeat LP attempt, although failued X 2 already and may need
   IR guided
   - Blood & Urine cultures
   - C. diff stools
   - Flagyl 500mg IV Q8 started on floor given high likelihood of C.diff.
   As now in ICU, would switch to PO vanc.
   - if worsens clincially, broaden to Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely due to infection and opioids/sedatives
   given in our and OSH EDs. Monitor with neuro exams and reassess if does
   not clear with appropriate drug metabolism. Of note, she has been
   getting progressively more unresponsive throughout the day, answering
   yes/no in AM, but now unresponsive to painful stimuli
   - consider LP if mental status does not clear; however, I have low
   clinical suspicion for meningitis
   - consider flumazenil and narcan to reverse benzos and opiates if
   mental status does not improve
   .
   # CAD s/p MI BMS [**1-9**]:
   - Continue ASA/Plavix despite bleeding risk
   - Hold Imdur, Lisinopril, HCTZ given GI Bleed
   - Continue Carvedilol for ischemic protection despite GI bleed risk.
   - Continue Simvastatin
   .
   # PVD: Has hx of recent pseudoaneurysm
   - Continue ASA/plavix, monitor distal pulses.
   .
   # COPD: Continue Spiriva, Nebs
   .
   # FEN: NPO while patient altered, maintenance IVF. Replete lytes PRN
   # PPX: Protonix IV, ASA/Plavix, Pneumoboot
   # Code: Full, Confirmed
   # Access: RIJ
   # Dispo: MICU for now

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old lady with a recent history of stented myocardial infarction (MI), multiple medical problems, presenting with abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, altered mental status, and leukocytosis from outside hospital ED.
- She is intubated for airway protection and has good respiratory status prior to intubation.
- She has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to an ulcer, and there is a suspicion of ongoing UGIB.
- She is on antiplatelet therapy and cannot be taken off it, so urgent endoscopy is planned tonight.
- Her abdominal pain is likely related to the UGIB.
- She has leukocytosis, which could be due to an abdominal process, sepsis, or central infection.
- She also has altered mental status, which may be due to infection, opioids/sedatives, or drug metabolism issues.
- She has a history of critical limb ischemia with pseudoaneurysm and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- She is on various medications including proton pump inhibitors, aspirin, Plavix, statins, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of UGIB and current symptoms suggest ongoing bleeding. Urgent endoscopy is planned to identify and treat the source of bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 71 year old lady with recent stented MI, multiple medical problems
   presents with abdominal pain, recent nausea/vomiting, altered mental
   status and leukocytosis from outside hospital ED. She is minimally
   responsive, has poor venous access and comes with little outside
   information.
   .
   # Vent: Intubated for airway protection with AMS and prior to EGD. Has
   good resp status prior to intubation.
   - extubated yesterday, now on room air with normal oxygenation
   .
   # GIB: She does have hx of UGIB from ""ulcer"" at OSH. Presence of
   melantic stools also suggests UGI source, although could not rule out a
   high colonic bleed. Unfortunately, she is recently s/p LAD BMS and
   needs to be on ASA and plavix.
   - CVL, and PIV
   - Hcts stable although slowly trending down
   - apprec GI
   - [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI
   - Q4hr HCTs and transfuse to keep HCT up
   - send H. pylori
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - golytely overight and possible C-scope in AM
   - if continues to bleed, would to bleeding scan
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: CT abdomen pelvis reviewed and rules out obstruction,
   current volvulus, abscess, hemorrhage or obvious colitits. Viral
   gastroenteritis can be invoked, as can C. diff given recent
   institutionalization. This may be related to GIB
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - plan as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concern for abdominal process, sepsis and central
   infection given her VP shunt. C. Diff also possible. U/A unrevealing.
   Reassured the lactate is normal, vital signs stable. Despite high WBC,
   otherwise not likely sepsis. Given high WBC count, C. diff is more
   likely than other infectious processes.
   - per neurosurgery no need for VP shunt tapping
   - Consider repeat LP attempt, although failued X 2 already and may need
   IR guided
   - Blood & Urine cultures
   - C. diff stools
   - Flagyl 500mg IV Q8 started on floor given high likelihood of C.diff.
   As now in ICU, would switch to PO vanc.
   - if worsens clincially, broaden to Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely due to infection and opioids/sedatives
   given in our and OSH EDs. Monitor with neuro exams and reassess if does
   not clear with appropriate drug metabolism. Of note, she has been
   getting progressively more unresponsive throughout the day, answering
   yes/no in AM, but now unresponsive to painful stimuli
   - consider LP if mental status does not clear; however, I have low
   clinical suspicion for meningitis
   - consider flumazenil and narcan to reverse benzos and opiates if
   mental status does not improve
   .
   # CAD s/p MI BMS [**1-9**]:
   - Continue ASA/Plavix despite bleeding risk
   - Hold Imdur, Lisinopril, HCTZ given GI Bleed
   - Continue Carvedilol for ischemic protection despite GI bleed risk.
   - Continue Simvastatin
   .
   # PVD: Has hx of recent pseudoaneurysm
   - Continue ASA/plavix, monitor distal pulses.
   .
   # COPD: Continue Spiriva, Nebs
   .
   # FEN: NPO while patient altered, maintenance IVF. Replete lytes PRN
   # PPX: Protonix IV, ASA/Plavix, Pneumoboot

The patient's white blood cell count is high, indicating an abdominal process, sepsis, or central infection. C. diff is more likely given the high WBC count. She has been started on Flagyl IV Q8 for C. diff and will switch to oral vancomycin if in the ICU. If her condition worsens clinically, broader antibiotics will be considered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of recent stented myocardial infarction (MI), multiple medical problems, presenting with abdominal pain, recent nausea/vomiting, altered mental status, and leukocytosis from outside hospital ED. She was intubated for airway protection and is currently extubated on room air with normal oxygenation. The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to an ulcer, and melanic stools suggest a UGI source. However, the presence of a left anterior descending artery bare-metal stent (BMS) requires her to be on aspirin and Plavix. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hcts) is stable but slowly trending down. The plan includes clear liquids today, a bowel preparation for colonoscopy tonight, and a colonoscopy tomorrow. The patient is also on proton pump inhibitors, carvedilol for ischemic protection, and other medications as per the assessment and plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of UGIB and melanic stools suggesting a UGI source. Despite being on aspirin and Plavix due to the recent stent placement, it is important to continue these medications for cardiac protection. However, there is a risk of bleeding, and close monitoring of vital signs, hemoglobin levels, and blood products is necessary.
2. Clostridium difficile (C."
